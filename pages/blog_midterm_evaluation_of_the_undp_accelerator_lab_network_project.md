1.1 The scope of this evaluation

This midterm evaluation is an independent assessment designed to

inform how the Accelerator Lab project can better support UNDP in
“taking innovation from a boutique venture to a corporate reflex.”1
It shares an overview of the project’s current outcomes as well as
suggests improvements to its implementation. It will also provide
reliable evidence of whether the approaches are having an impact,
how and why.

To do this, interviews were conducted with members of the global team

who run the project, as well as Accelerator Lab members across all Regional

Bureaus. The evaluation is also based on conversations with donors, strategic

leads at UNDP and Resident Representatives of Country Offices; all of whom

are involved in the project. These conversations in combination with a thorough

literature review and data analysis form the basis of this report.

1.2 Findings in brief

The Accelerator Lab Network is an ambitious experiment and is already
a success. It was launched as a deliberate disruption to the usual
way that UNDP operates, and to increase the credibility of UNDP as a
partner of choice for 21st century sustainable development challenges.
It is both a unique organizational intervention at a national level as
well as one working at a global scale, learning across a network of
development practitioners across the world.

Creating one successful Lab is difficult enough. It is extremely impressive

that 91 labs in 115 countries (whether set up in 2019 or 2020) are actively

contributing to innovation in UNDP and their host country. Many are even

thriving. Most of these Labs are set in contexts with extreme social, ecological

and economic challenges, and where governing institutions have difficulties

meeting the demands of accelerated environmental and social change.

The objective of these Labs was to introduce new ways of working that

can be part of enabling and embedding a shift in development practice and

the organizational culture that supports it. Taking an innovative approach

to capacity development, the Accelerator Lab Network shows signals of the

potential value of development done differently. The Labs have shown how

this new way of working is credible, which suggests changes of this nature

are possible in organizations like the UN. In this sense, the Accelerator Lab

Network is already a successful experiment. In particular, there is obvious scope

and rationale to continue the initiative beyond the three years, given that the

Accelerator Labs are a time-bound initiative to inject innovation into UNDP’s

organizational DNA.

It is worth exploring how to establish the Labs as a permanent R&D

function within UNDP Country Offices around the world, to ensure continuous

exploration and experimentation related to evolving sustainable development

challenges. Components of UNDP’s Accelerator Lab Network model show how a

continuous renewal function could look and operate.

2.1 Development needs to be done differently

UNDP wants to position itself as a pioneer in the future of development,
a sector that UNDP describes as having “a growing gap between
the interconnected, structural, and increasingly unpredictable and
complex challenges we are facing, and the way that government and
development planning is carried out.”5

Those complex challenges range from acute disasters like the Beirut

Explosion, the socio-economic fallout of COVID-19 and the full scope of

the Sustainable Development Goals. UNDP sees the future of a sustainable

development sector as one that needs to rapidly respond to complex global

crises, in a manner that is both increasingly local and more able to adapt to

the complexity of the challenges it faces. The Accelerator Labs were seen as an

experiment to see what that future of development might look like and to map

this back onto UNDP in practice.

2.2 The role of the Accelerator Labs

In 2019, UNDP launched the Accelerator Labs to build the “world’s largest

and fastest learning network on sustainable development challenges.” 6 The

ambition was that teams of Labs in Country Offices around the world could

“close the gap between the current practices of international development in
an accelerated pace of change.”7 The Accelerator Lab Network is also part of

UNDP’s evolving role in the UN system by expanding the way the organization

8

invests in, thinks about and delivers development. At its inception it was

described as:

...part of an ongoing transformation of how UNDP works. The

Labs will create a country-based implementation modality for the

country support platforms that incentivize the shift to open source

development, bringing diverse knowledge, skill, perspectives, and

capital around the table to co-create bigger and better integrated

results. The Accelerator Labs are a time-bound initiative to inject

innovation into organizational DNA, taking innovation from a

boutique venture to a corporate reflex.

2.3 What the Accelerator Labs are

The Labs are teams of three people working inside UNDP Country Offices,

So Far. Annual Report. (2020)

usually working closely with either a Resident Representative or Deputy

Resident Representative. Each team is made up of three distinct roles: a Head

of Exploration, Head of Experimentation and Head of Solutions Mapping.

The Accelerator Lab initiative began with a core global team of eight who

are responsible for running and leading the project. That team recruited and

onboarded 180 people into 60 Labs covering 78 countries, from all UNDP

Regional Bureaus. By 2021 the global team has grown to 13 and there are now a
total of 270 ‘Labbers’ in 91 Labs across 115 countries.fig.1

Our ambition and our action needs to match the scale of the

issues that we face. That’s why we’re launching 60 Labs at once.

3.1 The scope of this evaluation

This evaluation comes approximately halfway through the intended

duration of the Accelerator Labs project. Its scope is to gather lessons
learned and challenges faced by the initiative covering the period
from July 2019 to October 2020. This independent assessment will
inform and provide recommendations for the second phase of the
initial 60 Accelerator Labs, as well as the expansion of the Accelerator
Lab Network to a total of 91. This midterm evaluation will:

01 Offer an independent assessment that builds a narrative around

current project outcomes as well as improve its implementation

and make necessary course corrections in the vision for

transforming UNDP into a learning network.

02

Provide tangible knowledge, examples and reliable evidence of

whether these innovative approaches are having an impact, how

and why.

03

Provide input to new models for tracking results that can better

take into account nonlinear progress, ripple effects and unintended

consequences.

Some of this is contained within this report, and some

aspects are to follow in later pieces of work. The findings and

recommendations of the evaluation will inform the following

3.2 The evaluation approach

The Accelerator Labs project was set up with a defined set of

assumptions to be tested. This report combines a narrow focus
on testing the validity of those assumptions with a developmental
evaluation approach to explore what fell outside the original
hypotheses of the project.

3.2.1 The three core assumptions of the project

At the outset of this experiment, there were three overall assumptions for

12

what success for the project would look like. Much of this has been captured by
an extensive results framework.12

UNDP. Multi-Country Project
Document. Internal document
(2019)

01 UNDP Country Offices and partners will have increased capability

for scanning, sense-making and experimentation for sustainable

development solutions in 60 developing countries.

02 New sustainable development solutions will be scaled at country level as

part of UNDP’s country programme and operations, national policy and/

or markets.

03 A core global level result will be that a global learning and scaling

network is established and functioning.

3.2.2 Taking an explorative, qualitative approach

This evaluation explored what might be missed by the existing

quantitative results framework. It also looks both at, and beyond, the scope of

the original design assumptions. This has given colour to the previous results

framework and helped identify patterns that this other data missed.

The evaluation data is based on interviewing Lab teams from across the

world, both one-on-one and in workshop formats. It also draws on interviews

with global team members, Resident Representatives, Regional Coordinators,

donors of the project and UNDP’s strategic innovation team members. A range

that covers a broad spectrum of those involved, from a UNDP perspective in the

Accelerator Labs, but as with all qualitative work, might not be generalisable

across all of the 91 Labs. There were 23 people interviewed in total and I held

workshops with participation from 48 Labs.

Before this evaluation, there already existed a substantial amount of data

on the evolution of the Lab network: in reports, blogs and social media. Given

the volume of information (and the number of Labs), this evaluation follows

leads towards good practice. Our interviews and workshops primarily focused

both on what seemed to be working, to understand where the programme

works well, and to deduce why, under what conditions and what enablers there

are to support this promising practice. As well as also focusing on what barriers

and challenges are faced on different levels of governance within the ecosystem

of the Accelerator Lab Network.

3.2.3 Cross-cutting issues

This evaluation also identified and analysed the extent to which this

project has addressed the cross-cutting issues of gender equality, human rights

and marginalization of groups by responding to the following questions: to

what extent have marginalized groups benefited from the work of UNDP in the

country? To what extent have gender equality and the empowerment of women

been addressed in the design, implementation and monitoring of the project?

To what extent has the project promoted positive changes in gender equality

and the empowerment of women?

4.1 Improved UNDP capabilities

Could the Accelerator Lab Network influence the capabilities, ways

of working and culture of UNDP Country Offices to illustrate how
development can be done differently?

Beyond increasing the capabilities of UNDP Country Offices and partners

to scan horizons, make sense of and experiment with potential new sustainable

development solutions, the evaluation has found that the Accelerator Lab

Network is improving the capabilities, capacity and culture of UNDP to deal more

effectively with complex challenges and help achieve the 2030 Agenda by:

What this looks like in more depth:

01 The Labs are influencing ways of working in UNDP

Country Offices.

The Accelerator Labs are introducing new methods like experimentation,

13

solution mapping and collective intelligence. For example, the Labs play a role

internally to the Country Offices as conveners and facilitators, most recently
to support the Country Programme Document (CPD) planning process.13 They

are designing processes for inclusive participation across the whole office,

and inventing new ways to connect and create alignment between operational

and programmatic staff. The Labs are bringing in foresight methodology and a

portfolio approach to the long-term programmatic planning of Country Offices.

02 The Labs are illustrating alternative ways of doing

development by drawing in new and unusual data sources.

From drone and satellite data, to financial transaction data to

ethnography as well citizen generated data, the Accelerator Lab Network

is drawing on a broad range of data sources to diversify and expand their

understanding of the issues they are working on.

Thanks to the Accelerator Lab, we were able to do surveys and

collect information when nobody could.

—Carole Flore, Resident Representative, UNDP Côte d’Ivoire14

Drawing on action plans from 2020,15 on average, Labs used seven

new data sources ensuring a wide range of perspectives on issues relevant

to the Country Office. This marked a move towards real-time intelligence on

sustainable development.

and grassroots innovators to expand how they understand problems and

explore possible solutions. They also get key stakeholders in the room to better

understand the nature of challenges in their local environments.

On a deforestation project in Uganda this included bringing NGO

and Forest Ministry officials together with illegal loggers, firewood sellers,
housewives and school officials.16 This ensures actionable and collective

intelligence is identified from a broader set of perspectives, creating

opportunities for learning and leveraging multiple points within a systems issue

(such as deforestation).

A survey consultation with UNDP senior management17 found that

bringing on board new and unusual partners such as start ups, grassroots

innovators and engaging in deeper work with universities is one of the key

perceived added values of the Labs. The respondents mentioned it is not only

about partnerships (of which a total of 520 were registered in 2020, engaging

with a wide range of sectors, stakeholders and unusual partners including start

ups, grassroots innovators and universities), but also about the importance of

more participatory bottom-up relationships and the possibility of tapping into

new networks as part of coalitions for development action.

04 The Labs are illustrating alternative ways of doing

development by deploying multi-method approaches
to scan for and test solutions

Across the network the Labs have introduced and modelled a

sophisticated and broad set of tools and methods. Labs draw on over 48

innovation methods, from asset mapping to participatory design and

hackathons. Importantly, Labs are not following a blueprint—rather they

are critically applying a diverse set of methods across diverse contexts and

challenge spaces. There is no one-size fits all approach and by drawing on their

range of expertise across the network novel approaches are being introduced.

pandemic

Their ability to respond quickly to support local communities was consistently

recognized by both internal and external partners.18 For example, they mobilised

the digitisation of the informal economy to connect informal workers to an online
income.19 The Labs model new ways of working for national partners to deal

06 The Labs had the flexibility to seize opportunities

Flexibility and autonomy allowed the Accelerator Labs to spot and make

the most of opportunities to add value. The Labs, working in learning cycles,

can operate with agility and start or end what they are working on as they

explore and experiment. A core enabling factor of their impact is that they do

not work to deliver a long-term fixed plan. Over the course of the health and

socio-economic impact of the pandemic, there was value in being able to pivot

and adapt quickly in a rapidly changing environment modelling options for

implementation by the Country Offices. Labs were able, in a matter of weeks,
develop new affordable PPE in Colombia20 by working across supply chains,

business, academia and government.

sets to drive development activities in the current context. 75 percent of Labs

members are new to the UN system, bringing in an impressive and diverse range
of new technical and soft skills.21 Of this wide range of skills, agile and digital

stood out more prominently. These new skill sets were particularly visible when

dealing with complex uncertainties like COVID-19, where the ability to work

with agility to drive rapid, experimental learning and sense-making, as well as

shifting to work with digital platforms and tools became imperative. The latter

has also supported the implementation of UNDP’s new digital strategy. More

broadly, bringing in these new skills enabled other innovation initiatives to get

more traction and support. For example, around driving forward new portfolio

and sensemaking approaches within ‘Deep Demonstration’ activities— UNDP’s

experimental initiative to drive systems transformation in highly complex
problem areas. 22

4.2 Scaling solutions for development

Could the Accelerator Lab Network shift approaches to the exploration,

development and scaling of solutions?

Beyond seeing new sustainable development solutions with a potential

for scaling at country level, the Accelerator Lab Network is shifting the approach

to the exploration, development and scaling of solutions to deliver better

outcomes with:

>

Projects that are becoming more user-oriented, iterative, and

learning-oriented recognizing the complex and cross-cutting nature of

development challenges

>

>

Projects that are becoming part of a portfolio-driven logic, beginning to

build inroads for leading systems transformation efforts.

Reinforcement locally sourced solutions and making good use of local

assets and actionable intelligence to develop, adapt and scale outcomes

with national partners.

>

Action as a convener by bringing together other actors of UNDP, the UN,

traditional and non-traditional partners to identify, test and improve

local solutions.

>

Inspiration drawn from solutions—both generated locally and those

identified by the network—to legitimize new investments in innovation.

What this looks like in more depth:

sensemaking skills, other Country Office staff joined this workshop and have

since used these skills on other projects.

There are ripple effects from the Lab's value outside of UNDP. There are

over 25 government innovation initiatives who have either been influenced or
set up as a result of the Accelerator Labs’ capability.24 This is the Accelerator

Lab Network scaling beyond UNDP into national and local governments—

transferring and expanding the approaches of sensemaking, scanning and

experimentation into government functions.

02 Expanding the range of partnerships while reinforcing

local solutions

Labs are increasing the likelihood of successful implementation and

scaling of solutions by working across a range of partnerships and prioritising

local actors and solutions. The Labs’ ability to prioritise local relationships

with unusual subjects over the usual big players in the development sector is

positively shifting practice towards grassroots local solutions and ownership.

In Nepal, the Lab connected local partners during the COVID-19 response,

drawing on the existing robotics community and connecting them with

hospitals resulting in a pilot robot successfully delivering food and non-urgent
supplies to patients to encourage physical distancing in hospitals.25

Country Office management as bringing new funding and non-monetary

support into the Country Office. The Colombia Accelerator Lab brought in

$9.8 million in investment from USAID for a COVID-19 response as a result

of earlier successful efforts to put together a value chain of stakeholders to
research, design and mass produce protective gear.27 This initial investment

was further supported by a further $14 million from the Bogotá Environment

Secretariat and Colombian mayor’s offices. This indicates a growing capacity for

Labs to legitimize and grow emerging solutions and experimental approaches in

the form of service lines both within UNDP and among a wide range of external

partners.

04 UNDP regulations are blocking promising community solutions

A wide range of promising prototypes and solutions have been developed

in partnership with grassroots organizations and local entrepreneurs across

the network. According to the Ugandan Lab a surprising but significant barrier

to fully realizing the potential of these locally based partnerships is the UNDP

procurement processes and IP regulations.

05 Promising solutions reveal potential to revisit IP policies

and procurement regulations

The Labs are identifying specific pain points that have emerged in the

course of working with new partners, managing digital assets and tapping into

grassroots innovators where there is a power and knowledge imbalance.

They report that the significant timeframes required for processing

or procurement slowed down exploratory projects, limiting their ability to

“accelerate” in learning cycles.

Restrictive requirements prevented developing partnership models,

being biased towards established players over upstarts. It has also proved a

deterrent for new partners in the development ecosystem when UNDP owns

the IP. In Uganda, solutions to deforestation from grassroots or community

organizations couldn’t be built on and larger partners had to be found.

Signs of different ways of going to scale
"Going to scale" in the development sector is often synonymous with

copying the same idea or solution from one context and replicating it into
another.28 The Accelerator Lab Network approaches scaling with more nuance.
Inspired by leading innovation practitioners,29 the global team has instead

framed it for:

the UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab is influencing policy-making on e-commerce;

the UNDP Viet Nam Accelerator Lab is working with the government around

new agendas for a circular economy; the UNDP Argentina Accelerator Lab

is mapping out and advocating for new policies on air pollution. There are

concepts that have scaled out and spread across borders. In Morocco, Timor

Leste, and Cabo Verde, Labs have taken up the work from India on gamified
approaches to counter COVID-19 misinformation.30 Labs’ have been “scaling

deep”, where working with an agile and experimental mindset has impacted

many Country Offices across the global network, influencing them to adopt a

more responsive approach to crisis response and solution development. Labs

are also creating impact at scale. In Pakistan, ringtone messages dealing with
COVID-19 reached 113 million people.31

One cross-cutting insight from this evaluation is that there is a need

to influence the overall scaling ‘logic’, going away from strictly focusing on

solutions to legitimising a portfolio of interventions. This would require moving

the goal post of scaling. It should move from growing one solution towards

balancing and partnering with multiple actors in a diversified portfolio angled at

systems change. However, their ability to influence this level within the Country

Office is very limited and that it relates to an operating model dominated by

project-based business models.

What this looks like in more depth:

01 A learning network that is active and thriving

The Labs are sharing actionable learning on a daily basis. Sometimes

openly on platforms that are public, as well as on closed ones that are for

private messaging. They use mediums they are comfortable with—three active

Whatsapp groups started after one Lab member pinned their name and number
on a noticeboard for others to get in touch.32 That Whatsapp group now has up

to 300 messages a day of people sharing, asking for help or simply chatting.

As well as Whatsapp, members use Microsoft Teams to share updates,

blog posts, weekly reflections and thematic questions to the network. And on
the blogging platform Medium,33 the Accelerator Lab members post articles

02 Regular rituals of connection

The global team hosts weekly calls for the entire network to meet and

exchange ideas. These evolved from an initial "chalk and talk" design in the style

of a lecture or lesson, to something closer to an informal hang out and check-in

space. The fact that Labs are willing to dial-in to these calls at very early and late

times of day is testament to how valued these relationships and exchanges of

knowledge are.

The weekly drop-in calls! I feel terrible if I miss one because

I know how much I would learn.

—Lab member from one of this report’s workshops

03 A self-organizing network taking the lead

There is a steady rhythm of activity across the network with much of it

led by the Labs themselves, with the different roles creating their own events.

The Heads of Exploration organized an annual summit, to learn from each other

and welcome the second cohort of Labs. Interestingly, this seems to have been

prompted by two things: a desire for community that wasn’t found in their
local UNDP Country Offices and the ambiguity of the roles themselves.36 This

proactive approach is a sign of a healthy community, one that feels empowered

to lead and take ownership of an issue.

04 A learning network to activate a more diverse range of

knowledge, resources and experiences into operational

The Accelerator Labs are consistently sharing new methods and

approaches across the network. For example, 85 percent of WhatsApp
conversations between January–September 202037 were about methods

perspectives and options, enabling them to reach non-obvious approaches

and solutions. The UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab was able to get the correct

paperwork in less than seven weeks for their COVID-19 mobile money solution,

thanks to help from colleagues in the network. The alternative could have taken
many months.38 Without support from the network, that project may not have

gotten off the ground as quickly as it did.

05 The Labs show a high degree of trust necessary for learning

The sharing and learning as a global network is built upon strong

foundations of trust across a diverse and distanced group. Psychological safety
is required for risk taking, experimentation and innovation practice.39 Having

a trusted safe space to develop confidence in new methods, fail, and ask

questions of peers is pivotal to the success of the Labs.

For example, the weekly reflection blogs posted into the Microsoft Teams

channel exhibit a high degree of honest reflection, personal interrogation and

vulnerability, as individuals and teams grapple with their context, their position

within the Country Office and their relationship with local communities.

06 The Labs as a peer support network

The Labs generate and receive value in the network as a peer support

network. These Labs were set up to intentionally challenge business as usual,

and because going against the grain can be hard, sometimes exhausting work,

having a community of peers is important to maintain resilience:

Sometimes it feels that I don't belong, but every time I touch

base with some colleagues [in the network] it's amazing the feeling,

the connections and the insights.

—From an interview with an anonymous Lab member

07 Developing a knowledge management system

Making the most of working at this global scale requires an infrastructure

to maintain it. The global team and the Labs collect a range of both codified
insights and tacit understanding across teams.40 This takes the form of social

listening tools to scan both blog posts and WhatsApp conversations, as well
as through Wikis, with some of this new knowledge funneled into reports.41

The question remains: how to make this knowledge both timely and easily

accessible to busy people.

4.4 Cross-cutting issues

This section assesses the extent to which the Accelerator Lab Network
project addresses gender inclusion and incorporates UNDP’s
commitment to the human rights-based approach and gender
mainstreaming, and other relevant cross-cutting issues.

01 Gender inclusion, equality, and empowerment.

Thirty-five percent of blogs explicitly address SDG 5, Gender Equality. These

publications constitute a valuable asset that reflects and shares learning on

projects that are targeting gender equality. One example is the blog series by

the UNDP Paraguay Accelerator Lab about the findings of their community

innovation challenge which was aimed to support female rural innovators and
entrepreneurs.42

The Solutions Mapping platform compiles all the grassroots solutions

mapped by the Accelerator Lab Network. The platform provides a filter by gender

tags and a new feature to identify women-led solutions. Some of the solutions

observed were a mentoring network led by women in Uganda, a women’s taxi

cooperative in Ecuador, or a WhatsApp hotline for gender-based violence in

South Africa.

When reviewing documented learning challenges worked during 2020,

we found a significant number addressing gender equality. In Ecuador, the

Accelerator Lab tackled the lack of social protection schemes for female youth

workers; in India, the game CoronaChampion helps women and girls in poor

communities obtain accurate information about COVID-19 in a fun way. Although

these actions are promising, they still constitute a minority of the activities. The

network should review Country Office selection processes for frontier challenges

in order to better live up to this programming principle.

The Accelerator Lab Network has strongly prioritized and contributed to

the frontier field of Collective Intelligence, which as a principle recognizes the

need to draw on diverse views and perspectives to come to better decisions

and the need to be mindful of biases and power relations. It also means

acknowledging the importance of data empowerment—enabling people to use

data to advocate for their rights, take collective action, or hold governments
to account.43

One of the use cases identified for Collective Intelligence relates to new

forms of governance in accountability. In collaboration with GIZ Data Lab, the

Accelerator Lab Mexico combines open data about urban infrastructure (such

as public transport) with closed government datasets to better understand

the urban characteristics of gender-based violence in public spaces across

Mexico City.

03 Marginalized Groups

One of the central values of the project observed both in the core

design of the projects and talking to different stakeholders is elevating the

knowledge and participation of marginalized groups by engaging with unusual

partnerships, new networks, and vulnerable communities. For example, the

Zimbabwe Accelerator Lab partnered with trade associations and vendors of

the local market in Harare. The Lab was able to make visible the contributions of

20,000 informal workers in the food production value chain from all across the

country. Reports indicate that in 2020 the Accelerator Labs partnered with 520

different organizations, and many of these partnerships focused on increasing

the participation of marginalized groups.

Solution Mappers of the Accelerator Labs are mapping, connecting

and amplifying locally-led solutions to inform the design and delivery of new

approaches as part of UNDP’s work. Additionally, the Accelerator Labs aim to

contribute to their field through their partnership with the Honey Bee Network

to develop and showcase the importance of bottom-of-the-pyramid solutions

and grassroots innovation.

04 Other Cross cutting issues: South-South Cooperation,
Knowledge Management, and United Nations Reform.

The Accelerator Lab project is contributing positively and actively to

other cross-cutting issues like South-South Cooperation by fostering cross-

country partnerships; knowledge management by re-imagining how knowledge

explorative space to a permanent R&D function and

capability. To make the most of this potential there are

both critical questions in need of answering, and some

further specific recommendations to take on board.

6.1 The challenge for innovation labs

There’s no perfect way to run a lab. Specific contexts and the pressures
they face are different. The challenge for most labs is to carve
out their niche—their mission and purpose—in an often hostile
bureaucratic environment. From the start, many public sector
innovation labs are hamstrung; few resources, little internal
legitimacy, or weighed down under the same bureaucratic
accountability that prevented innovation in the first place.

Compared to the roll-out of a new technology or digital agenda, labs are

often in the business of intangibles. It’s harder to point to their specific outputs

precisely because they are set to work in an explorative, boundary-pushing

space. At the same time, they need to work to prove their political and strategic

value too. They need one foot in the future and one in the now.

to identify the most important areas for labs to focus on. It is applied here as an

organizing framework for developing and categorizing the recommendations

fig.3
‘Wheel of Trade-offs’ model

for this project.

The format of trade-offs can offer support in shifting strategy and making

the sorts of choices that will create alignment between the Labs’ potential

and what’s achievable. The core questions are: what characterizes the overall

"pathway to change" when it comes to the positioning, mission and purpose of

the Accelerator Labs? And what key trade-offs are connected to the strategy

and tactics in the day-to-day decisions in running the Labs?

6.2 Pathway to change: the paradox of disruptive integration

Challenges

The Accelerator Lab Network was launched as a challenge to business as

usual, as well as becoming a new version of it. Shifting the practice of learning,

project and programme approaches, partnering, and organizational culture

is a high ambition. For the project, there is balance to be found in being both

(productively) disruptive as well as integrating enough to embed that new way

of working.

In this case, the design intent of the Accelerator Labs is carried out with a

fair amount of space for serendipity. There is no strict formula for action since

a network of labs at this scale has never been done before. From the outside,
it resembles a “skunkwork” model45, illustrating and testing a potential future

way of working for international development, within a temporarily protected

space. The onus—and tension—on the Lab is to figure out how to integrate it

outside that protected space.

Innovation labs around the world face a similar tension, and they, like the

Accelerator Labs, face two overall challenges:

01

There is a challenge to understand the strategic value-add of the Labs.

Key stakeholders in many Country Offices struggle to understand and

integrate the work of the Accelerator Labs in their strategic operations

(including core programmes). They are uncertain about how best to make

use of the Labs' areas, as well as to what extent the Labs' contributions

should be embedded into programmes or work outside them.

02

There is a challenge in the diverse and ambiguous nature of Lab

contributions. This is especially relevant in the relationship between the

incremental and potentially transformative contributions of the Labs.

On the one hand, there is a narrative attached to the work of the Labs

around the radical redesign of development practice focused on systems

transformations that deal more effectively with global challenges and the

SDGs. On the other hand, many Labs are working on what is considered

to be small-scale experiments focused on incremental innovations with

limited strategic relevance.

Considerations

Where labs work best, they are a reflection of their environment—whether

disruptive or pragmatic. The success of the Accelerator Lab Network rests on

the readiness of the broader organization to make the most of this opportunity.

There have been signs of a lack of organizational readiness within UNDP

Country Offices including:

>

The Accelerator Labs are being seen as a temporary project rather

than a lasting investment into the operating and cultural environment of

UNDP, and are continuing to be considered a “nice to have” rather than

subject to strategic investment.

>

Uncertainties about longer-term objectives and future accountabilities,

which can increase tension and result in poor collaboration and ongoing

negotiations over what the Labs are meant to be doing.

>

The Labs risk becoming too pragmatic to ensure their survival within

the Country Office context—potentially getting caught up doing work that

is too incremental, compromising the distinct features they were meant

to influence the environment with.

As a response to these risks, the following section will describe ways

of addressing them and support a pathway to change through disruptive

integration.

Recommendations

To increase organizational readiness—as well as strengthen efforts to

ensure sustainable and impactful integration of the Accelerator Lab Network—

it would be useful to prioritize the four tactical trade-offs and recommendation

detailed in the next section.

01 Creating mandate

Creating strategic ownership of the Labs’ role, contributions and

development by their Country Offices

There have already been attempts to create awareness and engage with

46

From an interview with a
Regional Innovation Team Lead.

Country Offices on how best to take ownership of the labs. This ownership

seems crucial to the labs being seen as a valuable asset and not "just another

project." This depends on the proactive support of leadership as well as a

collaborative approach across the Country Office.

There are great examples of strategic ownership and integrations across

the Accelerator Lab Network. There are equally some experiences among the
Country Office staff of the labs “being forced upon them”46 and uncertainty of

how to interpret the reasoning behind the initiative. Some take the initiative

to be a response to a perceived lack of internal expertise. This can potentially

cause resistance.

These challenges are very typical when introducing labs in organizations.

Moreover, some of the resistance can also be linked to the rapid process

of launching the Accelerator Labs and the limited timeframe to prepare

onboarding and an enabling environment, making it difficult for everyone

involved to figure out their roles and responsibilities.

Trade-off

There is a trade-off between putting emphasis on the design intent of the

Accelerator Lab Network and implementing the initiative through co-ownership

with Country Offices. The former risks a low level of local ownership, the latter

risks varied quality in the Lab outputs and distance from the original design

intent. The former requires a limited level of engagement, is more rapid and

easier to manage while the latter requires a high level of engagement, is time-

intensive and harder to manage. What is the most useful trade-off?

44

Recommendations

Consider what successful integration looks like and to what extent the

initiative can be open to being shaped further by the Country Offices to create

their local ownership. This will include:

>

Ensuring a continuous dialogue about how best to strategically position

the Labs within the Country Office and national context. This will differ

in different contexts. Managing expectations of the Country Office

executives by continuously and collaboratively refiningthe Lab’s role,

contributions and accountabilities given that the purpose of the Lab is

contextual and subject to change.

>

Increasing psychological safety. While spaces such as the Resident

Representative (RR) and Deputy Resident Representative (DRR) sessions

have been set up for sharing professional vulnerabilities and uncertainties
around their role and practice,47 there seems to still be a need for honest

and psychologically safe conversations between UNDP executives, the

global team and Country Office Resident Representatives.

>

Describing successful integration. Begin to capture what successful

integration can look like to build a shared vision for the future function

of the Lab. This would help manage the expectations of what’s possible.

In particular how they can unleash the potential of a Lab functioning as a

R&D team within the Country Office. Describe how the Labs are meant to

be a boundary-pushing space which keeps a distinct methodology and

approach while integrating it into the Country Offices environment.

>

Celebrating useful examples. Encourage more Labs to develop new

programme functions and ways of organizing the work to help position

the Labs’ contributions more strategically (for example around scoping

programmes like in Bosnia and Herzegovina).

02 Supporting actions and decisions

Rethink UNDP administrative systems to create an enabling environment
to support an effective learning culture and new ways of working.

Launching the Accelerator Labs as "the world's largest and fastest
learning network on sustainable development"48 has been a bold approach.

48

UNDP Accelerator Labs. "About
us". (2019)

This intent has already been realized with Labs working experimentally,

applying new formats, procedures and processes of learning support,

knowledge management and impact assessment.

This also means that the Labs have a range of accountabilities between

the Country Office and the global team. These accountabilities can pull the Labs

between different priorities.

The value of the network as a learning and peer support resource for a

community of disruptors looks different to one that is designed to integrate

functions. In order to spread and scale solutions, embed new ways of working,

and convert the lessons learned beyond the network itself, there is still some

way to go. Currently, applying their own tools and processes, network learning

is working well for the Labs, although translating network learning into value

for others has been difficult. However e the recent development of a network
learning prototype is encouraging.49

A similar point can be made in relation to other administrative systems

like procurement and IP. The Labs are illustrating what is possible when

partnering with new partners, but are held back by current management
procedures built for a different time.50 This works against potential

collaborations with private sector entrepreneurs and grassroots organizations.

This can be seen in the three pain points presented in 2020 to “the LAB of
Labs” project board:51

>

>

Partnership default is rigid and does not allow for collaboration in an

experimental setting.

Intellectual Property is acquired by UNDP through the Standard Basic

Assistance Agreement with no corporate position on global public goods

or a robust licensing practice.

>

UNDP engagement facilities may not make investments or provide seed

funding outside of commercial contracts. Nor can it give the private sector

grants.

MIDTERM EVALUATION OF THE UNDP ACCELERATOR LAB NETWORK

Unleashing the Potential of the Labs

46

The bigger point here is that there is a need to rethink the administrative

systems of UNDP to support new ways of working with partners, as well as to

support new kinds of learning processes.

Trade-off

It’s sometimes unclear who the Labs are for. If they are for everyone,

they are also for no-one in particular. Is the network about incremental

change or societal transformation? Development done differently requires

structural transformation. Without real and significant investment into shifting

accountabilities and administrative systems, "development done differently"

is likely to remain a combination of small-scale experiments and a hopeful

narrative.

Recommendations

Change administrative systems to create a better environment for new

ways of working. This means:

>

>

>

Creating new ways of partnering enabled by procurement and IP

systems, not hindered by them.

Developing learning systems socialized through shared formats and

procedures for knowledge management and collective sense-making.

Redesigning evaluation and impact assessment to support learning

through experimental processes of testing hunches and ideas rather

than reporting on projected activities.

It is encouraging that UNDP created a new position for legal innovation,52

52

currently working with the Labs on IP research and alternative modeling, and

UNDP. Legal Innovation
Adviser (2021)

the Accelerator Labs are currently working on a desk review on alternative IP
models within this focus area.53 Specifically in relation to the Accelerator Labs,

53

it is important to:

>

Evolve the approach to impact measurement based on lessons learned

about the actual value-creation of the Labs. This includes what can be

expected in different contexts and at different levels of maturity and turn

it into practical frameworks and tools for supporting the everyday work of

the Labs. This should evolve into a set of accountabilities. A measurement

framework shared between UNDP Headquarters and Country Offices

could be developed that recognizes the diverse and in-direct nature of

the value-add of the Labs.

MIDTERM EVALUATION OF THE UNDP ACCELERATOR LAB NETWORK

47

>

Leverage the global network to advance learning. As the Accelerator Lab

Network matures, invest in the ability of the Accelerator Labs as a global

network to create knowledge and enable learning through their activities.

The possibility is to transform knowledge management based on more

generative and experimental methods. The emphasis should bring

together external research, evidence based on ethnographic methods

and results of Lab experiments.

03 Managing activities

Developing a clearer articulation of the learning journey of the Labs

and what can be expected along the way.

In most Country Offices, there is uncertainty about what sort of projects

the Accelerator Labs should work on. Sometimes projects can appear random

and unrelated to core programmes or the national or local government

agenda. For Country Office employees (including Lab members), this results

in uncertainty on what is or isn’t a legitimate project, whether it relates to any

strategy or if it has the potential to scale. More fundamentally,

is it okay to do smaller experiments with incremental value?

As the Labs mature these choices need to be made. What these choices

are and what they lead to needs to be clearly articulated with compelling

stories. This is linked to the Labs' capacity advancement and maturation over

time.

Trade-off

There is a binary logic among many of the people involved who consider

the Lab activities to be inside or outside of strategic priorities. The trade-off

here is to leave it open for a diverse set of judgements or invest in developing

a more nuanced understanding of the Lab’s learning journey. The former risks

resulting in inconsistent diversity with little possibility for quality assurance. The

latter risks creating a more prescriptive approach, specifying the journey of the

Lab and what is needed at different stages of it.

MIDTERM EVALUATION OF THE UNDP ACCELERATOR LAB NETWORK
Unleashing the Potential of the Labs

48

Recommendations

Resident Representatives and Lab employees should challenge the binary

logic of the Lab's activities being either strategic (within an existing formal

strategy) or not important (fringe). Develop a set of scenarios of what feasible

trajectories can be expected for the life cycle of the Accelerator Labs based on

lessons learned and experience from innovation labs around the world.

This will include:

>

Illustrating what it would take to make these different life cycles

happen in practice—including testing how the Labs can integrate as R&D

functions in the Country Office.

>

Adopting a more nuanced approach where a wide range of activities can

be seen to serve the purpose of the Lab’s development and to create a set

of alternative project criteria and accountabilities.

>

Creating legitimacy by seeing value in terms of longer-term strategy,

potentially linked to the UNDP strategic plan. This includes allowing for

and prioritizing activities that align systems transformation approaches

with the current focus of the Accelerator Labs—as is being done with the

Deep Demonstrations in Bolivia, Zimbabwe, Vietnam and other UNDP

Country Offices.

04 Setting up the team

Invest in innovation leadership and team development across
UNDP to create better strategic management of the Labs
within Country Offices.

Given their small size and the limited resources available, many Labs

have exceeded what can be expected of them. The importance of supportive

leadership has been highlighted across the entire Accelerator Lab Network.

Country Office leadership needs to be able to position the Lab's role to

strategically connect to programme work in new ways while proactively

managing potential resistance to new ways of working. That could be through

framing issues that bridge silos (like in Uganda on deforestation) or by

reorganizing programme processes to enable collaborative and explorative

scoping of all programme work (like in Bosnia and Herzegovina).

The evaluation findings reveal has learned that the leadership required

for supporting shifts in practice is often characterized by the ability to see the

strategic value of applying new methods and being able to organize ways for

the Labs to create value for the Country Offices. This leadership is characterized

by humility, experimentation and a learning-orientation which manifests in

how they take ownership of and collaborate around the strategic positioning

of the Lab, how they manage people, knowledge and data, and ultimately drive

behavioural change to do project and programme delivery differently.

Trade-off

There is a significant difference in the value contribution of Labs with

leadership having previous experience with innovation compared to ones

where leadership has little or no experience or training in innovation. A

trade-off here is keeping the status quo or attempting to maximize the Lab’s

value contributions through significant investment in developing innovation

leadership capacity among current Country Office executive management.

MIDTERM EVALUATION OF THE UNDP ACCELERATOR LAB NETWORK
Unleashing the Potential of the Labs

50

Recommendations

It is important to use the executive function to deepen investment in

innovation leadership development across UNDP Country Offices. This involves:

>

Seeing future investments in leadership as a core part of the longer-

term sustainability of the Accelerator Lab Network—both through

training, capacity building and recruitment priorities. (in particular if

there is strategic commitment to see the Labs integrating as permanent

R&D functions).

>

Enabling and supporting better collaboration and teamwork within the

Country Office environment through engagement with leadership around

effective ways of setting up the Lab team and organizing work flows.

>

Clarifying roles and responsibilities of the Labs and describing the

specific requirements for supporting collaborative experimentation. This

is seen especially in convening and facilitating the collaborative process

beyond any specific method.

>

Adapting job descriptions to expand work already ongoing within the

new cohort of Labs where job descriptions are reflecting better alignment

between “exploration” and “solutions mapping.”

>

Reviewing methodologies and expertise to deal with difficulties

within the Country Offices in understanding the value of the current

methods applied. This is particularly important in light of accounts of Lab

contributions more frequently coming in the shape of convening and

facilitating the collaborative process across stakeholders and unusual

partners than through specific methodological contributions. This

evaluation does not judge whether these accounts are reflected in the

actual value created, but it does recognize the need to effectively socialize

these methods to support new ways of working.

6.4 Looking ahead: a roadmap for success

There is obvious scope and rationale to continue the initiative beyond

the three-year timeframe. Given that the Accelerator Labs are a time-bound

initiative to inject innovation into UNDP’s organizational DNA, it is worth

exploring how to establish the labs as a permanent R&D function within

UNDP Country Offices around the world to ensure continuous exploration and

experimentation related to evolving sustainable development challenges.

This function could be central to UNDP’s innovation capacity. Not as a one-off

project or programme, but as an institutional innovation: a way of continuously

exploring and experimenting with new ways of dealing with the SDGs. One that

shifts UNDP’s:

>

>

>

>

Approach—towards more user-oriented, iterative, learning-oriented and

portfolio-driven methods and processes.

Relationships—towards better ways of connecting with local

communities and sourcing solutions from the bottom up.

Learning—towards better ways of supporting project work and new kinds

of knowledge management and curation.

Culture—towards increased mutual trust and collaboration and

widespread agile and experimental culture.

There are components of UNDP’s Accelerator Lab Network that model

what a continuous R&D function could look like.

Considering lessons learned, observed signals of an emerging new

practice, and the potential created by the Accelerator Lab Network, this

evaluation puts forward various sets of considerations and recommendations

that, taken as a whole, would increase the likelihood of a successful trajectory

for making the most of the initiative. In their nature, they are interconnected

and should be considered holistically, in relation to each other rather than

as separate steps. They overlap with existing initiatives and priorities already

taken by the global team to support the initiative—efforts that, in this light, only

should be strengthened further.

This evaluation has put together a suggested roadmap for the shorter

term that lays out recommended actions and priorities. To fully unleash the

potential of the Accelerator Lab Network, further support and investment

should make use of the roadmap on the following pages.

52

01 Short-term actions

Ensure continuous dialogue about
strategic positioning

>

Explore and illustrate how to best position the

labs within the Country Offices and national

context. This will differ country by country.

>

Manage expectations by creating concrete

ways of continuously refining the strategy

and the lab’s role, contributions and

accountabilities given that the purpose of the

lab is contextual and subject to change.

Describe patterns of successful
integration

>

Begin to capture and describe what successful

integration can look like in different

circumstances to manage expectations.

>

Have a sensitivity to keeping a distinct

methodology and approach given that the labs

are meant to be on an explorative, boundary-

pushing and frontier space which is at odds to

usual narratives of integration.

Show possible trajectories of the labs

>

Update the story of what the labs can

(or should) achieve as they mature from

small-scale experimentation to systems

transformation.

>

>

Develop a set of possible trajectories for the

life cycle of the Accelerator Labs.

Illustrate the possible learning journeys that

need to be enabled and supported to make

these different life cycles happen.

Transform knowledge management to be

based on more generative and experimental

methods.

>

Bring together external research, evidence

based on ethnographic methods and results

of Lab experiments.

Evolve the approach to impact
measurement

>

Expand the impact measurement based

on lessons learned about the actual

value creation of the Labs and what can

be expected in different contexts and at

different levels of maturity.

>

Supplement current results frameworks to

create space for accountability for learning

and improvement, supporting experimental

processes of testing assumptions and ideas

>

Experiment with and embed developmental

evaluation logics within project delivery.

03 Longer-term organizational strategy

recommendations

Rethinking UNDP administrative
systems

>

Create an enabling environment for new

ways of working and partnering—including

procurement, IP, reporting and

evaluation systems.

>

Create environments that adapt to digital and

innovation needs, support effective project

delivery and enable learning cultures.

>

Build on efforts already initiated around legal

innovation and alternative modelling in IP

and procurement areas.

Investing in innovation leadership

>

Use the executive function to deepen

investment in innovation leadership

development across UNDP to create better

strategic ownership within Country Offices.

>

Prioritize leadership investment as part

of future investments in the longer-term

sustainability of the Accelerator Lab

Network—both through training, capacity

building and recruitment priorities.

>

Revisit the overall Country Office team setup

with a focus on improving collaboration

and teamwork.

It is essential to recognize that any roadmap for making the most of
the Accelerator Labs involves a collective learning journey on all
levels: in the labs, within the Country Offices and at the global level
within UNDP. Instead of basing decisions on existing knowledge,
adopting an experimental approach should allow for exploring and
testing how new interventions can function together. It also allows
understanding of what different levels of governance are required to
create desired sustainable effects. This experimental approach has to
be accompanied by ongoing organizational dialogue about how
things are working and what is needed in terms of support.
