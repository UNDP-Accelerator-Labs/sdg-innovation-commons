> Title of the innovation

Opening of a special education school in rural area, eg in mulobezi or senanga.

> Brief description of the innovation

I am a secondary school teacher and I have a heart for people with special needs. Children in rural areas don't have access to schools because of the distance and lucky of funds to support themselves hence I saw the need to give them an opportunity also to persue their career if given a chance.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If the school is opened it can be divided in sections, the one side for pupils with special needs children and the other side for the normal children, it will create jobs for youths especially us teachers waiting to be employed  by the government, it will generate income in that other organizations that may want to come on board to support us,and the small  money or school fees paid by the pupils will be able to pay teachers hence creating more jobs. Children will also be taught surviving skills incase their will be no jobs at least they can create some jobs for themselves.

> Technical Feasibility

The feasibility is to build a school or schools in rural areas for people living with disabilities and orphans  so that everyone is covered.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will improve greatly on the lives of young people especially those with special needs for they will not have to depend on their families but will be able to stand on their on and be useful to themselves and also to others.teachers who are going to be employed will be able to fend for themselves and also help those who might not have the capability to help themselves.
