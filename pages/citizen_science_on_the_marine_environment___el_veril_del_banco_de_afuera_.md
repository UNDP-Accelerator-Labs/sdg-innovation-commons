Overall goal: Assess ocean acidification in the coastal area of Mar del Plata.

Description of citizen participation: The idea behind "El Veril del Banco de Afuera" (Outer Bank Reef) lies in the collaboration between the National Institute for Fisheries Research and Development (INIDEP in Spanish) and the "Escualo” Underwater Activities Center (CASE in Spanish) diving club in collecting information on the marine environment in order to coordinate an integrated monitoring effort towards the evaluation of possible changes linked to ocean acidification in the coastal site of Mar del Plata.   CASE scuba divers collect seawater samples (for the analysis of pH levels and total alkalinity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton and bacterioplankton abundance) during their recreational outings to "El Veril" (a coastal site visited by divers due to its good visibility and variety of marine species) on a semi-monthly basis. They also record the metadata required at the sampling site (GPS coordinates, date and time, sampling depth, the dive computer temperature profiles, and sea conditions).
