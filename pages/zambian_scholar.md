> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Zambian Scholar’s main flow of income will be through the purchasing of its services by our target consumers who can be all learners of different ages, levels and interests country wide. A subscription fee will be charged to the institutions and learners that choose to access the services offered by the platform.

This will be very beneficial and help enhance the quality of education by increasing the access to a lot of educative information and materials that will be available and can be accessed at any time at a good and fair price. The challenge prize will be a huge stepping stone and investment that will catapult the project into action by making it easy to purchase all the required resources.

> Technical Feasibility

The Zambian Scholar platform is a website designed by implementing the concepts of website programing and designing namely; Hypertext Mark-Up Language (HTML), Cascading Styling Sheets (CSS) and Java Script. A prototype exists and it is built using HTML and CSS only. This platform will be accessible through Smartphones, computers or any device that can properly access the internet and support its modern features. For it to be a success it needs to be properly and creatively structured with a user friendly user interface using the named programming languages, it has to be connected to a billing service that will be a means of payment for the purchases of services that will be offered and it is supposed to be hosted by any company that offers web hosting services. Finally proper advertisement will ensure its publicity and spread of recognition so that its services can be purchased and that the platform may start its operations.

The Zambian Scholar website will improve and make easy the life of many learners country wide as they will have an opportunity to access a vast variety of learning and educative materials that will be at their fingertips. Learners will be able to communicate with their teachers, fellow learners and access different academic services even when schools are closed. It will also reduce the cost guardians or academic sponsors of learners having to travel long distances or waiting for a long time due to poor service delivery just to access learners’ results and progress reports from schools. It is also very essential as it will allow and convince many leaners, schools and the entire education sector to embrace the advancement of technology and to take advantage of the introduction of Information Communication and Technology (ICT) into Zambia’s educational syllabus to improve the quality of our education as a nation and produce a computer literate and oriented work force.
