Looking at mundane traditional practices from space can be eye-opening. We have attracted significant attention of the communities and policy makers by providing data about open burning in Ukraine via free satellite datasets with notification settings. 



Communities were encouraged to enroll in "Do not burn - compost" challenge to exchange best practices and learn more on how they can use GIS solutions to track current and prevent future fires. The Ministry of Environmental Protection is now designing policy interventions that will incorporate the GIS solution into the state response. 



More about the challenge (in Ukrainian):
