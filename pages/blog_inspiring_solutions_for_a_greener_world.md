From Empty Lab to first prototypes and SolutionsThrough the award-winning project “BioHack My World(link is external),” UNDP, UNICEF, and the City of Skopje established the first BioHacking Laboratory(link is external), putting Skopje on the map of cities in Easter Europe with such state-of-the-art, open, innovative space. The BioHack lab will serve as an acceleration hub that brings science closer to the community of entrepreneurs and will, spark curiosity and will serve as an inspiration to a new community of entrepreneurs, young people, and civil society enthusiasts that want to pursue activities in the realm of circularity with a focus, but not limited, to bio-waste.One of our early hypotheses of the project, created as an option as part of the City Experiment Fund(link is external), was that with the establishment of such a laboratory will encourage a shift in narrative and act as a system transformation initiator that would inspire young people to shift their focus of interest to STEAM research and, in the near future, create economic opportunities, including start-ups. These spin-offs, we designed, will employ highly skilled labor by utilizing some burning environmental challenges, such as biowaste.

Skopje Bio Hack My World 2023 Challenge CallIn early April, UNDP joined forces with Solveo(link is external), an innovation consultancy company, to test this hypothesis by launching the first program for startups working with Biotechnologies. The Skopje's(link is external)Bio Hack My World 2023(link is external) challenge had a core objective to discover are there remarkable teams, startups, entrepreneurs, and innovators with groundbreaking ideas aimed at addressing pressing environmental challenges and second to facilitate progress from the initial ideation phase to the achievement of tangible outcomes, be it a proof of principle, proof of concept, or the development of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Simultaneously, an important aim of the challenge was to generate increased recognition and understanding of the recently established Biohacking lab and its extensive capabilities. And all this within 3 weeks. The challenge garnered significant attention. 44k people were reached on social media through various social media campaigns, 37 participants started the program who created 11 proof of principles or MVPs. The and participation, with 37 individuals forming 11 diverse teams. Following the Design Thinking methodology used by leading Startup Accelerators such as YCombinator(link is external), the teams managed to identify the customer's needs, rapidly create and test prototypes, and bring new innovative solutions that fit the identified needs. All teams underwent the 5 cyclical stages: empathize, define, ideate, and prototype. All converged to explore new horizons, leveraging biowaste to create innovative solutions.

A core aspect of the Bio Hack My World 2023 challenge was the development of innovative solutions that can be presented to the general public in an open day called Demo Day. The Demo Day(link is external) highlighted the immense potential and groundbreaking work of the participating startups, entrepreneurs, and innovators. A day that offered an invaluable opportunity for the teams and startups to demonstrate the tangible impact and viability of their solutions to potential customers and investors, paving the way for future collaborations and partnerships. Or as they become widely known as the local innovators, the unsung climate action heroes.The Innovative SolutionsThe future of sustainability lies in the hands of innovators who challenge conventional norms and champion environmentally conscious solutions. As we've explored the inspiring initiatives presented by these visionary teams, we are reminded of the power each individual holds to create lasting change. By embracing these solutions, we actively contribute to waste reduction, resource conservation, and establishing a greener world. Let's unite in celebrating and supporting these pioneers as they continue to inspire positive change and foster a healthier planet for future generations.The Innovative Solutions that are the Future for a better sustainable life:

Outcomes of the ChallengeThe Bio Hack My World 2023 challenge marked a significant milestone in North Macedonia's journey towards fostering innovation, collaboration, and sustainable solutions in biotechnology and biowaste transformation.
