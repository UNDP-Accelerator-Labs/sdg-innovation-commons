> Name of the experimental activity

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To understand whether a designated reporting platform designed for citizens will enhance citizen feedback on development projects and services, and compliment monitoring of UNDP development initiatives. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF citizens have access to a platform where they can report on the status of UNDP development initiatives THEN citizen participation and feedback will increase, and add another layer to the monitoring of these initiatives. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Design of a platform that is suitable for Fiji's context

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Number of projects/ initiatives that have an added layer of monitoring through citizen feedback/ participation

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Citizen feedback and reporting through use of digital surveys or mobile application.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

NA

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999
- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Technical expertise (Digital/ IT)  30% of Solution Mapper, Explorer, and Experimenter's time respectively
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

NA

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

NA

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

NA

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

NA

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Na

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

NA
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

NA

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

NA

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All project teams who utilize this platform, and MEAL teams.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Government partners

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

NA

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

NA

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

This experiment could potentially be replicated across all projects/ programmes, working across all thematic areas and SDGs.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense and explore phases will have a heavy influence on this experiment as a variety of platforms/ applications will have to be explored to identify the best fit to Fiji's context. 

> What surprised you?

NA
