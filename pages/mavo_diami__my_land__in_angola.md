## Geodata for Agriculture and Water (G4AW) The Mavo Diami social enterprise contributes to the acceleration of agribusiness performance by leveraging geodata-based information services in Angola for the benefit of smallholder farmers.

The envisaged impact of the effective use of Mavo Diami services is strengthened the resilience of smallholder farmers to climate change; improved soil sustainability and land allocation; and improved self-reliance of smallholder farmers due to sustainable food production and improved income security. In turn, this will contribute to a more stable agricultural economy in Angola.

Mavo Diami from consortium led by Worldvision Netherlands. The Mavo Diami project funded under the Geo Data 4Agriculture and Water of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs / Netherlands Space Agency. The aim of this project is to improve the food and income security of more than 100,000 smallholder farmers by accelerating their agri-business performance through informed decisions supported by the Mavo Diami services built on weather, water, soil, and crop signals and other relevant data and indicators. The project is called Mavo Diami, which means 'my land' in Angolan local language (Kimbundo). During the project the Kres network was formed as a social enterprise to carry on beyond the project.
