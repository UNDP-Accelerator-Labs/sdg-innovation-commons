> TITLE: Please provide a title for the solution you observed.

Many people work in up-scale neighborhoods in domestic work. Many of them earn either the minimum wage or a little higher than that. Some of these employers work as guardians but seem to lack the means or time to afford fast food meals or services alike.  This group of women (a mother Doña Vivi and two daughters: Wendy Elizabeth and the youngest, Hellen Alejandra Pérez Siquinajai,  is a 10 year old girl),  have managed to prepare local food (tamales, chuchitos, tortillas) for a very accessible price for the workers. And since most of them have long shifts and can´t get out to search for food, the Pérez ladies, have come up with a food delivery service in a "baby carriage" to provide the necessary for these workers. If you need to request them something in particular, you can also contact the via WhatsApp and ask for your favorite meal. 

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Market solution for low-income workers to eat well and healthy. Women responding to an unsolved demand. Creativity to respond through delivery  to people that may not afford other technological services on the market (uber eats - glovo - etc.)

> NEED: What need does this answer?

Unemployment, accessibility to food services, low-income workers served,  women working together, women entrepreneurship, economic solutions, delivery food high cost solutions, distance barriers solved

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

How these 3 ladies (mother and two daughters) have managed to raise a very small business provide services for low income employees. They are well known in the neighborhood (they sing "tamales!" as they walk around the neighborhood streets), and this service is possible  without any noise or emissions, because the deliver by walking around with a baby carriage. They live half a mile away in a poor settlement. Probably they walk another mile between customers places, delivering food at noon and evenings. The proximity between the two neighborhoods  has allowed them to find solutions to sell their cook talent and production. No government involved.
