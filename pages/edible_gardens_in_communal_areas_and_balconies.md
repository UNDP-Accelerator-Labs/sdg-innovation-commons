Edible gardens in communal areas and balconies

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

During the first lockdown, I've noticed my neighbors started growing edible gardens on their balconies but in communal areas as well - when I asked questions why they decided to plant vegetables and herbs their  explanation consists of a few factors: 1 they would like to enjoy the benefits of home-grown produce 2 take up a new hobby since now they have more time without commuting to offices/workplaces 3 keep themselves and their children busy - some of them said the gardening is helping them to cope with anxiety  and stress

> NEED: What need does this answer?

The edible gardening addresses multiple needs 1 psychological needs - a new normal with lockdown has helped us to rethink our experience and appreciate the little things we have, in addition, gardening is well known as the positive activity for mental and physical health 2 social needs - my neighbours have joined the gardening community to share their learning and support the novice gardeners. Moreover, growing more vegetables they were able to support vulnerable groups of people who were shielding themselves   

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

I'm thinking about how we can use this practice to make edible gardening a part of the city landscape to introduce it not only as a wellbeing exercise and a social practice but as something that is part of the circular economy and one of the ways to combat climate change.
