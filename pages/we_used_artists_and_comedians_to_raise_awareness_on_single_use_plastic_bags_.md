We used Artists and comedians to raise awareness on subjects that are not easy to relate to, such as single use plastic bags and its impact in Eswatini particularly on the environment and on the livelihoods of rural small scale livestock farmers. Such has been used to raise awareness on other subjects such as Gender Based Violence.
