Through a human-centered design process we identified that a series of common experiences and attitudes among informal construction workers  represent barriers to their recognition of rights to social insurance and to their willingess to contribute social insurance payments. These attitudes arrise in informal conversations and reflection on daily experiencies. The solution we designed is to structure similar informal conversations around their experiences and the rights and obligations to social insurance.
