UNDP PROVIDES HUMANITARIAN-DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS FOR RESPONDING TOWARDS DISPLACEMENT CRISIS
UNDP provides humanitarian-development solutions for responding towards displacement crisis
Working in the framework of the humanitarian-development nexus, UNDP is helping to strengthen the national capacities to address the immediate and medium-term challenges posed by displacement crisis.
AUGUST 19, 2022
The world today is in a global crisis of unprecedented levels of forced displacement. A record 100 million people have been displaced by war and other conflicts worldwide. This complex crisis requires an integrated response that combines humanitarian and development actions. In more than 40 countries, UNDP offers development solutions that complement the humanitarian efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), other UN agencies, international and civil society organizations and governments to meet the urgent needs of refugees and their host communities. UNDP's solutions are comprehensive and aims to address the long-term consequences of the crises and preserve achievements in sustainable development.
Together with other UN agencies UNDP in Belarus supported the Belarusian Red Cross (BRC) in coordination and management of the national response towards the displacement crisis. Working in the framework of the humanitarian-development nexus, UNDP is helping to strengthen the national capacities to address the immediate and medium-term challenges posed by the crisis. This experience became a solid base for the joint action towards developing the national response in support to Ukrainian refugees in 2022.
Together with other UN agencies in Belarus, national partners, UNDP participates in the Inter-Agency Refugee Coordination Forum established at the country level to coordinate activities aimed at supporting refugees from Ukraine through addressing their long-term social and economic needs, as well as of the host communities
In partnership with the Belarusian Red Cross UNDP developed a set of recommendations to enhance capacities for emergency response to mass arrivals of migrants. The recommendations help enable effective deployment of staff and volunteers, ensure efficient information and resource management.
127 volunteers and the Belarusian Red Cross staff of got training in crisis intervention and psychosocial support in emergency environments. Based on the identified needs, especially of women and children, essential goods were rapidly delivered to refugees and the logistics capacity of the BRC was strengthened.
UNDP helped engage two UN Volunteers to work with the Red Cross. The Vulnerability and Needs Assessment Specialist supports the BRC through conduction of a continuous assessment of multi-dimensional vulnerabilities of refugees. The assessment applies a human-centered design, continuously engaging key stakeholders on informing them about development of context-driven solutions. Th host communities are the crucial part of the assessment.
In addition to this, UNDP Accelerator Lab partnered with the BRC to develop a digital platform that connects refugees with support services and opportunities available for them in Belarus. The BRC and UNDP map existing services and opportunities on legal counselling, jobs, housing, education, healthcare, humanitarian aid (clothing, hygiene, food, etc.), search for relatives, psychosocial support and psychological assistance. The services that the platform offers also can benefit other vulnerable groups and local communities.
UNDP also focuses on socio-economic integration of refugees, helping to improve their access to labor market, support job skills and deliver professional trainings for various industries and sectors.
All these solutions aim to reduce inequalities and help harness the economic potential of refugees and other displaced people to foster local development and growth.
