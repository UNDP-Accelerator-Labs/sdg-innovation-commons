Then he gave it the shape of the bottom part of the stove. The bottom part is provided with a hole to insert the fuel. Then he made a cylindrical wall over it and allow it for drying. On the other day, the stove construction would be completed by constructing four cylindrical clay pole of 5 inches height and 2 inches in diameter. That's how the modified cooking stove is constructed. After the completion of construction one bottle is placed inside and around the bottle dried fodder/residue is filled throughout the stove by pressing it well so it can become compact and highly dense. Then he removed the bottle gently away from the stove. Then he made a hole at the bottom by removing some dried fodder/residue. Then through the help of paper or oiled wooden sticks, the stove is being ignited. If the flame is not enough one can insert wood sticks also. Performance According to Mr. Ashok,  with the help of 1.5 - 2 kg dried residue/fodder the stoves ignite up to 2 hours, and meal for 8 people can easily be cooked. Benefits It is smoke-free.
