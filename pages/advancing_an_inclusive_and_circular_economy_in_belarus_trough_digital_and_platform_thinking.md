## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Transition from simple Green Economy towards more Circular economy needs digitalization, more inclusion and strategic support. The country needs support in proper embedding of international experience and internal dissemination of best practices within the sensitive context.

2. Digitalization creates opportunities for vulnerable groups, but raises cybersecurity issues. Because of cybersecurity risks Digital Public Goods remain the preferred form of digital products over open source solutions in the given context.

3. Smart cities solutions have potential for growth and experiments are a proper way to persuade national partners that it worth attention. Digital platforms are complex approach that is not only scalable, but also modernizable when the community adopts it and starts thinking of improvements. So' switching to another digital solution or improving the existing within the changed needs - is the inseparable part of digital thinking for stakeholders.

4. Digital products are good in uncovering technical bareers, lack of collective design, lack of capacity that can be addressed through UNDP's traditional programme interventions.

5. Platforms organize collective work over a complex problem where multistakeholder approach is needed, like migrants/refugees, Chernobyl recovering districts or Climate.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Surveys - What kind of business models are best available practices for enterprises?  Qualitative interviews - How many circular products can be created?  Focus group - What are the most circular sectors of economy?  Ecosystem mapping - Which actions of which ministries are most effectively support the circular producers and exporters?



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collective intelligence - collect persuasive data about raw/secondary materials flow on enterprises;  Design thinking - collectively formulate priority directions of circular economy;  Horizon Scanning - range the actions in tome to focus on most necessary priority actions first;   System Thinking - LNOB, ensure gender mainstreaming.

## End
****

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Using of existing digital solutions, support of partnership discussions with data helped to engage digitalization as an enabling factor to promote variety of topics like Greening, Social support, Entrepreneurship, Startups and Inclusion of migrants/refugees, and find cross-cutting actions that contribute to couple of them. Additionally, UNDP was for the first time presented at the country level as a digital champion that have experience in digital solutions for variety of purposes, like Greening.
