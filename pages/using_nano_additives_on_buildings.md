> Description of the solution

Nano-additives are nano-particles added to another material to improve its properties. 
One of the most commonly used nano-additives is nano titanium dioxide or nano-TiO2. Nano-TiO2 molecules can absorb ultraviolet radiation from the sun to decompose organic molecules, microorganisms, and nitric oxide pollutants. The result of this decomposition is harmless molecules such as water (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2).
