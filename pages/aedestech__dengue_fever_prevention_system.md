Mr Lim Chee Hwa has the mindset to combat dengue in Malaysia and hopefully around the globe one day after meeting an entomologist who had an idea to create a project such as the AedesTech Mosquito Home System (AMHS) to contain the spread of Aedes mosquitos. AedesTech is an invention that reduces the population of aedes mosquitos in the effort to reduce the number of dengue cases. It also can be used as a surveillance and monitoring tool. Designed to be placed anywhere, it has been proven to reduce 75% of dengue cases and 50% of labour costs. Its specialty also lies in a chemical liquid used in the device itself. Aedestech functions as a tool to control Aedes mosquitos and it also utilises 4IR technologies. As Aedes mosquitos are attracted to the trap to lay their eggs, the life span of those hatched eggs will be shortened. They would not be able to make it to its adult stage, which in turn helps combat the spread of dengue. Not only that, because Aedes mosquitos do not lay their eggs in one place, they most certainly would travel elsewhere and at the same time lay their eggs there as well. When they do leave the trap, they would carry along with them the chemical liquid which has been implanted on them, and that is how they are able to contain the spread of dengue; by auto dissemination. The chemicals used in the trap is non-toxic and non-hazardous. It is in fact safe for human ingestion (though not recommended). It also offers 24/7 protection and one only needs to refill the chemical liquid in the machine once a month.
