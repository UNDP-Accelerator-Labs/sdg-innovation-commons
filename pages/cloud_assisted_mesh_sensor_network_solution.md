> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- private sector

> Timescale of implementation

- medium-term (2-4 years)

> Other Notes

Proposed solution, still waiting to be implemented in the future.

Here is the link to the similar technology in academic paper published: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12652-022-03704-4#:~:text=The%20proposed%20cloud%2D%20assisted%20mesh,an%20aggregation%E2%80%93aware%20multihop%20cooperative 

 And the experiment was carried out simultaneously within the SRMIST Campus, Chennai, India to ratify the reliability of the proposed CMSNS.
