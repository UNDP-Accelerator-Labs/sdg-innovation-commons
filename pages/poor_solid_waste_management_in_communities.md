Poor Solid Waste Management in Communities

> Brief description of the innovation

Poor solid waste management has continued to hit very high levels in most parts of our country. Left uncleaned, cabbage can bury us! To some like us, not all hope is gone. 
We can manage such heaps of garbage very well. Systematically, we can only tackle cabbage by managing their sources- homes and from market places.
Solid waste robs from us land needed for gardens and maintained community play parks. Further, solid waste pollutes land through thrown pollutants like plastics which contributes to the change in weather and climate which often times are burnt or when decay take place.
To manage solid waste, proper approaches are needed. One such approach is through house to house waste collection.
House to house as well as business solid waste collection approach calls for a convincing discussion by waste collectors to household and business owners. Assuring them of a service in disposal of their generated waste.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

By offering a service to householders and business houses they in return will be paying a minimal amount K5 per sack of waste.
  As starters, we aim to target on average forty(40) houses per street multiply by the fourteen(14) streets. We target about five hundred, sixty(560) houses in our community to subscribe to our program. Hence the expected return will be K2800 per week of which K1,000 to go to hired light truck. Me and the little crew(the 3 to join) will at least share the K1,800 income.
For us to keep existing and grow, we will definitely need other funds to boost us. Therefore, the challenge fund to us can be used in the following ways: 
- aquire our good runner second hand light truck to cut spending more on hiring.
-Purchase wheeled chargeable refuse containers for customers to ease their throw and our refill.
- explore other ways of dealing with sorted waste. Sorted plastics or paper to be sold to recycling firms for our income.
- look for a affordable arable land so that decomposing waste is used as manure to support growth of food crops for sell.
- challenge fund part to be used to offer incentives to the old but the young especially for picking or sorting waste just to boost their resolve to remain environmentally clean but in turn we will be receiving sorted waste.
- after improvements in income, we will register our company with pacra and patent our products and services.
 If waste is removed from top of surface, the scenary beauty of our community will result. We will have clean and green parks and lawns full of clean fresh air. Fiona and flora species will not dimish.

> Technical Feasibility

House to house waste collection is an approach involving us waste collectors visit each house or a business place on agreed times to collect customer's generated waste at a minimal fee of k5 per sack for disposal at designated refuse dump site.
We are aware of some challenges like; not all householders or businesses will receive the cabbage collection talk well especially the aspect of paying something but we will be conversing amicably with them to achieve our desired results for our existence while protecting the environment in the quickest possible time.
Registered householders will be mostly visited, once a week( subject to change), while business houses will be visted three(3) times per week to collect accumulated solid waste packed in sacks in initial stages and later in bins with a view of blocking them not to be disposing rubbish at undesignated areas.
This routine has to keep flowing so much that in our first year of operations, we would love to see eighty (80%) percent of households and businesses getting used to our service- solid waste collection.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Poor solid waste management can be said to be a social problem because it is caused by us humans during our interaction with ourselves and but affecting our environment. The solutions then lies in working as social beings yielding immernse benefits such as: personal income is assured to all the involved. Therefore, most personal needs will be met than none which all because of participating into managing solid waste in our community.
The community is aware of the activities going on and happen to be part of the change even in just word.
If they can convert waste with money or receive an incentive for their customership they rejoice. Hence clean environment equal peace of mind for people around the very community.
The greener surroundings will provide places for meditations, rest as well as venturing sites.
Let us now delve into solid waste management and it's relavance to where we are in time or the current market.
As humans, we will continue to acquire goods at the same time produce waste. Since it's so, collection of waste will always be there.
Plastic is getting tall in the manufacturing industries. Therefore, plastic recycling will continue to be important. But before you recycle, we will collect and manage waste.
Proper management of waste requires that we cover all areas rich or poor an collect everything throw. 
The will and power to work are required for our clean homes, Communities as well as our business premises. Even in our small communities we still can sustain our every business by working to extend services we offer through approaches that work so as to reach our customers within or out of our communities.
In doing our very best, business growth is assured.
