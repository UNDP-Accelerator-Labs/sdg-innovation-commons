> Brief description of the innovation

We recycle plastic bottles into pavers and fencing poles by mixing it with sand for pavers and saw dust for fencing poles

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With the growing of construction industry in Zambia particularly, the demand for such products has gone up. Our product is 30% cheaper and 5times strong than the current products on the market which are concrete pavers and steel poles. Our target market are Government which is a key partner in fighting environmental pollution of plastic waste and individuals in the constitution sector.

> Technical Feasibility

We cut the bottles into pellets and melt them into using a drum, once they turn into semi liquid form we add sand in bits. And then pour the mixture into a mould to get a required shape and let it cool down. However we hope to acquire modern machine electric machinery to eliminate the use of charcoal for heating the the bottles as the use of charcoal has a negative impact on the environment because of cutting down of tress to make charcoal

> Anticipated Social Impact

We will engage the community especially the youths and women in buying the raw materials which in turn will create employment. Our innovation brings in affordable products to the market as our product is 30% cheaper and 5times durable than the concrete products on the market. You pay less for more value
