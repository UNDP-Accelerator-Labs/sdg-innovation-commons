## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Blue economy is a wide and highly potential area in Bangladesh for employment but Berry complex area to work. Blue economy is one of the important areas where we need lots of innovations in many ways because one third of the people living in that coastal belt in the areas are unexplored. Many organisations including government organisations try to come up with some ideas but it takes a long time to suggest some practical working engagements. Modernization of fishing and employment in fishing is the right area to explore by undp Environmental conservation in the coastal belt and ocean based tourism is another area to go deeper and come up with some solutions in collaboration with government and other UN agencies like FAO.
