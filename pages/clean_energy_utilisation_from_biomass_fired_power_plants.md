> Title of the innovation

Clean energy utilisation from biomass fired power plants

> Brief description of the innovation

Forest and agricultural crop residues are  the major biomass resources. These biomass resources can be used in the generation of thermal based electricity. In Zambia, majority of agriculture wastes such as corn stocks/cobs, wheat straw, rice husks etc., are just left for bush burning. These can be collected and used for power generation in biomass fired thermal boilers. Moreover, short period harvest forest such as pines can be grown for power generation use.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The biomass cofired boilers can be set up in rural areas where ZESCO power grids have not reached and generated power is sold to rural communities at affordable rates. This will in turn provide electricity to rural communities and improve livelihood and also reduce stress on ZESCO which is already overstretched. The innovation results into zero net emission of CO2 and reduces SOx and NOx thereby cubbing down global warning.

> Technical Feasibility

The agricultural residues are collected, compacted and transported to operating site and later pre-processed to reduce size and moisure and increase the energy density. Later are fed into the boiler by grate feeder. In this way, electricity in the range of 15-30MW is produced by help of steam turbine and generator. If funding is available implimentation is in less than 12 months.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The rural set up where ZESCO has not reached will benefit immediately -typical rural electrification program; employment will be given to local communities; electricity will be cheap and affordable and will result into rural development. Relevant as it reduces dependancy on hydro resources, increase compettion and reduces load shedding.
