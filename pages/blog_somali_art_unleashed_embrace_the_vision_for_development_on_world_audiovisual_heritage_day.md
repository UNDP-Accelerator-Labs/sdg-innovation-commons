Throughout generations, the Somali people have upheld a longstanding tradition of storytelling, passing down cultural stories and poetry. This cultural richness has not only preserved the past but has also given birth to a vibrant Somali mythology, featuring iconic characters such as Dhegadheer, Araweelo, and Cigaal-Shidaad, who have dynamically assumed roles in ever-evolving narratives.Aligned with this cultural heritage, the Accelerator Lab is taking the initiative to organize an exhibition that celebrates artists of all ages. Our vision is that this showcase will serve as a melting pot for diverse talents, encompassing content creators, digital storytellers, photographers, traditional storytellers, poets, and social media influencers. We firmly believe that artists play a pivotal role as catalysts in a transformative exchange that not only brings hope, practicality, and the potential for change but also allows them to draw insights from traditional perspectives, thereby enriching their own artistic endeavors.This cross-cultural exchange and learning endeavor are designed to foster a wellspring of creativity and innovation. It is our firm belief that this newfound creativity can be harnessed to address critical development issues, including peace, justice, reconciliation, and socio-economic challenges that impact both individuals and communities. Additionally, it presents an opportunity to engage with environmental concerns, thus establishing a holistic development perspective.The Exhibition Experience a two-day exhibition filled with engaging activities. You'll witness captivating Somali mythology storytelling, live art creation through drawing and painting, and meaningful discussions between generations. In Somali society, stories are a key way to share news, cultural insights, wisdom, and important messages. Storytelling unites people, bridging gaps among those from different backgrounds.By hosting this exhibition, we aim to bring together people with diverse experiences, fostering learning and creating valuable professional connections. It's an opportunity for individuals from all walks of life to come together.Art and storytelling are potent tools for communication that can be used to support important causes such as peacebuilding, engaging citizens, addressing climate change, and promoting gender equality.
