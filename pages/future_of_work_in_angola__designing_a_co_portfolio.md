## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Designing a CO Portfolio on Future of Work
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the CO works in a very siloed way, in order to answer the challenge of Work and Employment in Angola, all units need to work together for a common agenda and increased impact. As a Deep Demo CO we will be supporting the CO in designing a Portfolio focused on the Future of Work.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Economy is mainly focused in the oil sector Jobs that offer security and basic working conditions are concentrated on few specific sectors. Most of the employed population is on the informal sector working without social protection Youth skills and capabilities are limited and available education and training programs do not fit the present and future labour market demands Institutional frameworks for employment and for business are still inefficient and burocratic, lacking flexibility.  Future of Work in Angola must consider the following: Creation of more jobs & opportunities for youth; Diversification in the nature of work aligned with the diversification of the economy & the environment; Reformed education system where skills development, vocational training and capacity building meets market demands; Decent work and social protection for social inclusion Inclusive labour market that tackles inequalities and gender social norms. After conducting Sensemaking for 9 CO projects, we have learned that the CO is not harnessing the Digital Economy and emerging digital futures; not enough venture into the productive sectors that support the Diversification of the Economy; Informality is highly considered but from a formalization perspective, not exploring the middle ground, not contradicting the formal/informal dichotomy; big investment in skills development, specially for Government, direct skills development for the communities is not much and follows a traditional approach not exploring new types of jobs and skills; not looking in the direction of green transition; Private Sector not leveraged; dominant Government support and less on individual or community needs; not looking at the future of work; lack of coherence and integration among projects.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab has previous experience in systems thinking and portfolio design, the team is prepared to lead a portfolio Design process. The Accelerator Lab has been working with the Strategic Innovation Unit and managed to place the CO as a Deep Demo CO, mobilizing 200 K to invest in Portfolio Design.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We want to learn how to design a Portfolio that builds on ongoing CO projects and new pipeline projects, and at the same time is interconnected with other development partners ongoing initiatives and Government programs and plans. An integrated set of strategic interventions that are able to change the system by building on what is already happening and looking at the future as well.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We want to tap-in to the CO collective capacity, with a core multi-disciplinary team co-designing the Portfolio together with a group of diverse stakeholders. Eventually simultaneously implementing and managing some pilot initiatives included in the Portfolio.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

They will help understand who to engage with, what actors have ongoing actions and programs in the area of Future of Work, what resources, needs and capacities these stakeholders have that can be leveraged. The Team will look into CO ongoing projects, resources and capacities that were already mapped in the previous stage (CO internal sensemaking), and integrate them with what other stakeholders are doing in order to build an integrated set of strategical options that will increase results. This can be best achieved by bringing some of these stakeholders into the design process through a co-creation effort if possible.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

To grow this challenge the Portfolio will need to be anchored in a main Government Partner that will act as the Portfolio champion (potentially Ministry of Economy and Planning - MEP). To allow for growth portfolio must also be aligned with a source of funding, the CO is trying to anchor it to a new pipeline opportunity in partnership with MEP. Other key Ministries must also be informed and collaborate as well as private sector and academia. All stakeholders can be involved either in the design phase or as implementing partners of specific interventions/projects/pilots which are part of the Portfolio.
