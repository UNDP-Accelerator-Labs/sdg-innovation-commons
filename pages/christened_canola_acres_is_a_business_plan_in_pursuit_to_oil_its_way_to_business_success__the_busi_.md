> Brief description of the innovation

The type of farming that we would like to implement is known As Greenhouse Farming or Organic Farming. This type of farming is known to be modern and easy, since no much machines or farm inputs are needed, and the returns are awe-inspiring. If all the rules of this type of farming would be observed, one can harvest products from the farm for over one (1) year. Horticulture work improves crop yield, quality, nutrition value, and resistance to insects, diseases and environmental stresses. Horticulture usually refers to gardening on a smaller scale, while agriculture refers to a large scale cultivation of crops. Most of the crops that are planted on a horticultural farm take at most four (4) to eight (8) weeks to be ready for market.
