## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Bridging the information gap.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that job seekers are often unaware of sectors where there are many employment opportunities and seem unaware of their own skill gaps (soft and hard) in applying for jobs. We hope to bridge the gap between unemployed youth and available jobs in the country, while incorporating innovative insights from the Lab’s engagement in 2021. Our challenge is a continuation of our Big Bet of 2021, which tackled the reasons leading to the rising rate of unemployed and underemployed youth in the country. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Nigeria has a massive young population with youth ranging from the ages of 15-35 years old, making up over a third of the population. However, 43% of Nigeria's youth are under or unemployed. Specifically, 21M are unemployed and 18M are underemployed. We have learned that there is a notable disconnect between skills and employment opportunities among job seekers; a problem with the dissemination of jobs on platforms that can be assessable to all; a broader inclusion of informal jobs; and opportunities for job creation through innovation sector.      The combination of declining economic conditions, increasing population growth, a struggling educational sector that isn’t positioned to respond agilely to labour gaps and flight of skilled labour to other parts of the world has resulted in a situation where there is a paucity of both job opportunities (for most youth) and appropriately skilled workers in key sectors.

The value of education and preparedness among young graduates in Nigeria is of great concern. This was a reoccurring issue we gathered from our collective intelligence exercises. A number of reasons have led to the decline in education including: strikes, insecurity, rising tuition cost, lack of traineeship in curriculums, poor budgetary allocation to primary, secondary and tertiary institutions, among others.     According to the National Bureau of Statistics, youth unemployment rose from 19% in quarter four of 2015 to 42.5% in quarter four of 2020. This infers that about half of the youth population is not engaged in any economic activities and has implications on economic growth and development.  https://guardian.ng/business-services/dealing-with-rising-unemployment-poverty-insecurity/  https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20211113143735211  https://allafrica.com/stories/202202110010.html  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1119375/unemployment-rate-in-nigeria-by-quarter/  https://businessday.ng/news/article/nigeria-must-improve-on-education-to-reverse-trend-of-youth-unemployment/

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

It is worth investing resources in this challenge, because the multiplier effects of unemployment and rising costs of living contribute to the increasing insecurity which is being experienced all over the country and cause more unrest.   Also exploring the future of work in Nigeria and expanding the definition of work by incorporating the informal economy will be key in a couple of years. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can stakeholders (jobseekers, employers) quickly access/share data that helps them make informed decisions about how to find work/workers? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Human-centered design and co-creation methods will be used throughout the process to ensure that the initiatives are created for and with the community in mind (underemployed/ unemployed youth, employers, facilitators & educators).      Solutions mapping will be used to recognize multiple innovative solutions to combat the unemployment challenge.    Hackathons, will be done in collaboration with public and private sector partners we have worked with to leverage their networks and initiatives in closing the employment gaps. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Collective intelligence, surveys and collaboration with focus groups will provide us with first-hand knowledge and insight to the challenges and needs of the community we hope to serve. Mobile data will help us better understand how people conduct their searches on the social media handles that we found were mostly used for searches. Qualitative interviews will help us in getting insights on the effectiveness of different platforms and tools.
