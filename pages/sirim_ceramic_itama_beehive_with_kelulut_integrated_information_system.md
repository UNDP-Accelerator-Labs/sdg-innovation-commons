The SIRIM Itama stingless beehive is made of innovative porcelain material. The beehive has a topping with 15-inch diameter and 3-inch depth. It has the properties of zero water absorption, flexural strength of 30MPa and density of 2.3g/cm3. The ceramic beehive has a lifespan of 20 years, and is capable of keeping out invading pests. It is waterproof and maintains a conducive temperature for the bees and the honey produced in the ceramic hive.  While the Kelulut Integrated Information System is a registered digital sensory device and system to measure temperature and humidity of Kelulut (stingless) beehives in real time. Through the assistance of the device, a continuous and consistent monitoring of the hives ensures that the colony stays productive, which will result in an increase of honey productivity and beekeeper income.
