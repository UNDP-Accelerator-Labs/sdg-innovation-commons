> Brief description of the innovation

Soya beans  production and processing deals with the production of soya beans and extraction of crude oil, this falls under the agricultural category, many say agriculture is the backbone of the nations economy, but I believe that agriculture is the heart of the economy, because without food man can not live, and its agriculture that provides us food, therefore much investment is needed and must be dedicated to farming.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will greatly generate income for me and other unemployed youths in Zambia as a nation at large, looking at the current situation in our country we have no/less jobs and hence its hard to earn a living, however the soya beans production and processing innovation will positively change our lives, in a sense that it will stand as mean of employment for me and others, if we are empowered ,we wish to do this from level one which is farming, to the final stage which is distribution of oil, this will not online be a benefit to us, but the country at large as it will improve food security. The end product which is oil, will bring a lot of income as we intend to supply oil in and outside the board, lately farming of soya beans has been done on small scale due to low or little financial  capacity, but we wish to due this on a larger scale should we be empowered. This innovation will create employment for over 500 people across the board.

> Technical Feasibility

Soybean is an essential crop that is grown globally due to its various and diverse uses. Given its importance, there are many pre-growing practices to prepare the field for the growing season, including tillage, pre-plant fertilization, and monitoring soil pH. Many agronomic aspects must be considered during growing season to ensure successful soybean growth including crop rotations, double cropping, cover crops, irrigation, row spacing, plant density, and post-emergence fertilization. Additionally, integrated pest management involving the use of pesticides, resistant soybean cultivars, and cultural practices are vital to control the numerous pests of soybean. While soybean is highly used in livestock feed due to its high protein content, it’s methionine deficiency and presence of antinutritional factors still present problems that need to be solved. Soybean versatility is represented by the many uses in human consumption, biofuels, and other industrial uses. Traditional and conventional breeders have been working to increase protein and oil content, while eliminating antinutritional factors. Genetic engineering and gene editing show promise to help improve soybean by introducing genes to improve protein and oil quality and knocking out genes to remove antinutritional factors.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve the lives of unemployed youths, 
There will be food security in our nation 
It shall improve the agricultural sector
There will be zero tolerance to unemployment
This will reduce the rate of drug abuse among unemployed youths .
To mention but a few
