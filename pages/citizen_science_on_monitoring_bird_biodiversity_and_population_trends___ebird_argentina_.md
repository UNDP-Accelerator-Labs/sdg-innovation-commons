Objectives:  Collect real-time bird sightings, photographs and sounds to be used in scientific studies   Contribute towards knowledge of distribution and abundance of different species and facilitate their care and conservation 

Description of citizen participation: It works as a reference database to quickly view how birds are distributed and in which seasons they may be found in Argentina, learn about their abundance, see photographs and listen to their sounds. It is the most complete database on bird distribution records of Argentina.  Bird sightings may be entered by any person on the website and/or app. The database harnesses the power of citizen sighting and photography, and each potential birdwatcher is encouraged to collect information on the presence or absence of species and their abundances (number of individuals identified in each sighting).
