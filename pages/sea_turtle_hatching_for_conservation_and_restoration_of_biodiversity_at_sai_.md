## Title

Sea Turtle Hatching for Conservation and Restoration of Biodiversity at Saint Martin's Island in Bangladesh
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to conserve the biodiversity of Saint Martin's for saving Environmentally Vulnerable Sea Turtles from annihilation.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Sea turtles have played vital roles in maintaining the health of the world’s oceans for more than 100 million years. These roles range from maintaining productive coral reef ecosystems to transporting essential nutrients from the oceans to beaches and coastal dunes. But the nesting populations of turtles have declined due to the severe exploitation of eggs and the illegal killing of adult turtles by fishing and other activities. Rapid pollution in sea water and the human created issues are creating unfavorable situations for conservation of turtles. Today, a few individual turtles nest on the sandy beaches along the coast of Bangladesh including St. Martin’s Island which is one of the turtles’ prime nesting locations. It is reported that 35 Olive Ridley turtles were found nesting in one night in 1983. By 1996-98, however, the highest number of nesting turtles in one night was 15. But this has reduced to just two or three now. As St. Martin's biodiversity is being destroyed day by day, it is unavoidable to protect the sea turtle by ensuring safe nesting for conserving the environment of the island.

The population of nesting turtles is small in number at present times. From October 1996 to April 2001, 477 olive ridley and 28 green turtles nested successfully in Saint Martin’s Island. Hawksbill turtle nests are rare, only one confirmed leatherback nest was observed in Shill Banyar Gula in May 2001, and no confirmed loggerhead nests have been observed. The greatest number of nests recorded in a single season for olive ridleys was 137 in 2000/01. But nowadays the number of mother turtles coming for nesting has significantly reduced. According to local elders, nesting was common on most of the beaches 10-15 years ago. Rashid (1989) recorded 35 green turtles in one night nesting on one beach.

Local residents have found around 40 dead sea-turtles washed up on the Saint Martin's Island beach under Teknaf upazila in Cox's Bazar over a one week time period, indicating that such a large number of deaths may threaten the sea ecosystem.

It is undeniable that marine turtles are one of the most significant components of the environment to conserve biodiversity. They create a healthy biological environment by controlling the increase of jellyfish, maintaining healthy seagrass beds and coral reefs, eating sponges, balancing marine food webs, facilitating nutrient cycling from water to land and  many more. Previously, it was said that Saint Martin’s is the safe haven of various species of fauna.The beach of the island is also home to internationally endangered green turtles and olive turtles.

But in recent times, the turtles’ lives are in threat due to fishing nets and fishing vessels that are severe on the island. Large mechanized fishing boats ply the deeper offshore zone in the south and southwest. Islanders normally use drift nets, fixed gill nets, rocket nets, seine nets, etc., all of which can result in accidental capture and either drowning or intentional killing of sea turtles. The fishing community is superstitious and considers the sighting of a turtle or a turtle getting entangled in the fishing nets as a poor omen. Fishermen often kill turtles encountered during fishing activities.

Moreover, the limited number of mother turtles that are coming to lay eggs are often killed by the stray dogs and disturbed by the noise of the beach area. St. Martin's island has become unsafe for sea turtles. During the winter season, the coral island has a lot of marine life. Turtles used to come to the island to lay their eggs. But for the last two years, it has decreased a lot. These things have been spotted by the lab team and we characterized its urgency to preserve turtle eggs and raise them for nesting until baby turtles come out of their shell and return to the sea, which is their natural habitat.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Accelerator Lab’s experimentation with the sea turtle for their safe nesting would add value to the increase in the number of this essential marine species. Accelerator lab with its multidimensional and dynamic stakeholders from different sectors would additionally bring value by creating awareness of biodiversity restoration and conservation of environment of Saint Martin’s Island among the community people, locals, as well as tourists. It’s also worth investing in because it at a time contributes to nature in multiperspective.

Safe hatching of vulnerable sea turtles to help in conserving the world’s ocean health, and coral reef ecosystem, transporting essential nutrients from the oceans to beaches and coastal dunes.
