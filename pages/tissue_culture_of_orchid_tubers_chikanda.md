> Title of the innovation

Tissue culture of orchid tubers chikanda

> Brief description of the innovation

Tissue culture is the in vitro aseptic culture of cells, tissues, organs or whole plant under controlled nutritional and environmental conditions [1] often to produce the clones of plants. ... Small pieces of tissue (named explants) can be used to produce hundreds and thousands of plants in a continuous process.
In this case we will be working with orchid tubers chikanda which are  might be extinct our country.
Orchid tubers Chikanda can be collected from swamp areas and can later be propagated in a lab then later introduced in the environment.This will reduce the time time for them to grow in the wild and ensure that our delicacy is not extinct.
These orchids are traditionally propagated through seeds. However, it takes about 2-3 years for mature orchids to produce these. Therefore, plant tissue culture has become an ideal method to protect this species from extinction and achieve commercial viability.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Tissue culture of the orchid tubers will help increase the availability of chikanda on the market which is now hard to find as it has to come from as far as Angola  as we longer have enough to go round.
ZARI Zambia Agriculture Research Institute can take up this activity which can help them to generate revenue to run some activities that are on hold due to funding.
The project will also employ more graduated like me that are still unemployed.
With this project we can establish a plant where Chikanda can be processed and packed and sold on the Zambian market and abroad for our people living outside Zambia.
We will be conserving orchid tubers and also scaling up on nutrition.

> Technical Feasibility

Samples of orchid tubers will have to be collected from different areas.
They can be cultured at Zambia Agriculture Research Institute.
The fundamental steps of plant tissue culture are fourfold:

-Select a healthy parent plant (explant).
-Eliminate any microbial contamination from any exposed explant surfaces.
-Inoculation the explant in an adequate culture medium.
-Incubation of the explant in a controlled environment with appropriate temperature, humidity, air quality, and illumination.
There are also four different types of plant tissue culture, which may be chosen based upon the goals of the culture, or plant species:

cell culture (such as gametic cells, cell suspension, and protoplast culture).
tissue culture (callus and differentiated tissues).
organ culture (any organs such as roots, shoots, and anthers).
One of the popular applications of plant tissue culture is the in vitro clonal propagation - also known as micropropagation. Plant tissue culture, in this case, can aid in the reproduction of plants that have problems with seed germination (recalcitrant plants), or have short-seed viability. Although micropropagation can be applied to any species, it is recommended for commercially essential plants or those at risk of extinction. For example, micropropagation is widely used for the cultivation of orchids such as Paphiopedilum delenati. 

Micropropagation can be carried out in three different ways:

-using an apical or axillary bud.
-using the adventitious bud.
-through the formation of a somatic embryo, -using somatic parent plant cells.
The success of each of the techniques depends on the genetic background, culture media, and incubation conditions.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our people in the market will not have to travel long distances to bring orchid tubers chikanda and we will conserving our tubers which means they will not be extinct, looking at a sustainable today without affecting the future of the next generation.
