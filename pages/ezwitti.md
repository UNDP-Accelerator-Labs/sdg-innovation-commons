## A non-profit restaurant initiative 

Ezwitti is a non-profit, charitable initiative based on the concept of “inviter and invited.” Customers (the “inviter”) can purchase meals that are then offered for free to those in need (the “invited”). Located in the heart of the capital, it’s the first restaurant of its kind in Jordan, operated by volunteers of various nationalities. The initiative provides healthy meals to underprivileged individuals with dignity, without financial barriers. It’s a unique community-driven model promoting generosity and social solidarity.
