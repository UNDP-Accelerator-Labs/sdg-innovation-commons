> Title of the innovation

Loan repayment system

> Brief description of the innovation

The system interlinks loans with goods and products.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It is simple, easy to use, user friendly and the power of the company? 
POWER OF THE COMPANY: what customers want the most is a high quality service with a high quality benefit.
The system brings about the benefit of self company advertising without spending any or very little funds. Customers talk about products and goods with other customers and with that the benefits of the system have a very high probability of being reference in conversations. Customer to customer advertising  is the best and pure form of advertising. It has no bias nor false claims but the sharing of pure benefits one got.

INCREASED LOAN REPAYMENTS: customers will find it more beneficial to pay back the loan than not to. Increased loan repayments mean more goods or products sold which equals more revenue made.

*Individuals are the target market as micro loans are the best suitable for the system as loans can be given to thousands of individuals at once there by spreading the risk and increasing revenue outcomes.*

BENEFITS TO THE ENVIRONMENT: only healthy and beneficial goods and products will be sold to customers such as body building foods.

THE PRIZE: winning will enable me to activate my recycling project to enable a clean and healthy environment. Winning will enable me to assist a large number of customers and open the doors to economic development using the loan system set up.

> Technical Feasibility

STEP1: funds for loans and goods/products must be available.
STEP2: customer gets loan.
STEP3: customer pays back principal amount after loan period.
STEP4: customer buys goods/products from loan provider using the interest from loan after loan period.

IMPLEMENTATION: the innovation will be implemented using a step by step process from the bottom  up. 
To begin with...
ADVERTISING of the loans will be done through radio and social media. Foot soldiers will be used because person to person is a very effective way of advertising has it will enable for a lot of information to be given out to possible customers who with the acquired information and knowledge will spread the word in a more solid manner because he or she is fully aware of the system. This will be done for two years after which analysis and company diagnosis must be done to know how the business is doing. 
After this, the best methods that worked well for the company in advertising will be doubled and considered as the company's form of advertising's first priority for one year. 
After three years we will be able to call ourselves strong members of our market servicing areas. At this point the company and its products will be able to advertise themselves on there own. The company at this point will reduce the amount spent on advertising.

> Anticipated Social Impact

People need to eat and they also need means of making it possible for them to eat. People will be able to use the loan to make something that will bring in more resources and enable them to pay back the loan and receive a benefit of goods/products when paying back the loan which will add value to their way of life and actually support themselves in a more organized way.

The interest rates on loans in Zambia are high and a lot of people find it difficult to repay loans and also fail to get loans because of fear of failing to repay back. My loan repayment system will make it easier for people to get loans and to repay loans due to its simplicity and strong benefits it comes with.
