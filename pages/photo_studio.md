> Title of the innovation

Photo studio

> Brief description of the innovation

We intend to start up a photo studio to help other cameramen to produce still photos within Mumbwa instead of traveling to Lusaka which is about 150 kilometers using public transport.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income will be generated because everyone who wants to print out photos will have to pay something. It will improve other existing businesses because some businesses die due to luck of printers in an area so bringing it closer would improve existing businesses. It will also be cost effective for other cameramen to produce their work photos locally.

> Technical Feasibility

In our business, we will have mainly printers, and cameras to print and also teach those that would like to become cameramen or camerawomen how to hundle cameras, printers and many more to deal with photo studios  so they can start their own businesses out there. We have no prototype at the moment.

> Anticipated Social Impact

When the business grows, we will employ workers who will help us run our business which will improve their lives
