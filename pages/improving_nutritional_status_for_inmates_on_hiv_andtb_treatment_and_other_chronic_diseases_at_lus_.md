> Title of the innovation

Improving nutritional status for inmates on HIV and/TB treatment and other Chronic diseases at Lusaka central correctional facility

> Brief description of the innovation

Nutrition in correctional facilities in Zambia is a major public health concern. There are a number of inmates who have chronic diseases including HIV and TB who need nutritional support. This will improve adherence to treatment and improve their health status. My innovation is to start keeping broiler chickens at Lusaka central correctional facility in order to feed inmates with chronic diseases as well as to generate income through sales for sustainability. This will be a self-sustaining innovation as inmates are able to work and manage the project without having to employ people as poultry workers.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If we manage to buy chicks, drugs, and chicken feed every 3 weeks to raise 1,000 broilers each time for a period of six weeks in each cycle, we will be able to feed the inmates on chronic medication with chickens at least once a week. There are about 300 inmates on chronic medication at any given time at Lusaka central correctional facility, five people can share one chicken meaning from each batch of 1,000 we can get 100 for feeding and sell the rest to generate income. Broiler chickens are on-demand on markets and will be easy to sell. The selling price is dependant on the cost of chicks and feed but there is always profit. There will be no cost on labor as the inmates with assistance from one corrections officer will be able to raise and sell the chickens. There is a garden within the correctional facility that can benefit from the manure that will be generated from the poultry.

> Technical Feasibility

Having worked with correctional facilities in Zambia since 2010 supporting the facilities with TB and HIV screening and treatment, the main challenge inmates find adhering to treatment is inadequate food and poor nutrition.
INNOVATION DESIGN
* There is enough space at the Lusaka central correctional facility to build a poultry house that can hold about 2,000 birds
*We need to procure:
- building materials for the poultry house, Inmates will build the poultry house
- Cables to electrify the poultry house, bulbs for heat and light
- Feeders and drinkers
- work suites for inmates and the corrections officer who will be working in the poultry
- Disinfectants for the poultry house
- Bath soap and washing detergent for inmates who will be working in the poultry house to prevent diseases 
- Deep freezer to keep chickens to feed inmates with chronic conditions
- Cooker for cooking this special meal away from the general kitchen
- Every 3 weeks we will buy chicks, drugs, and chicken feed
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
* Once all is set, we will identify one corrections officer and 10 inmates who are on antiretroviral treatment but strong enough to take care of the chickens. Like this, inmates will take ownership of the project since they are beneficiaries
* The corrections officer will be in charge of buying the chicks, feed, and drugs every 3 weeks
* Once chicks are bought, they will be put in a brooder within the poultry house and managed for two weeks by the assigned inmates and then move from the brooder to the main poultry house. The brooder will then be disinfected in the one week break awaiting the new batch of chicks
* The assigned inmates will be alternating to feed both the chicks in the brooder and the ones growing in the bigger poultry house
* Once the chickens mature in the sixth week, 3 inmates with the corrections officer will start selling and slaughter 100 for food
* An account will be opened to keep the money, some of the money will be used to buy vegetables to add to the inmates' diet as well as to sustain the project.

> Anticipated Social Impact

First and foremost, the health of inmates with chronic diseases will improve because we are adding another source of proteins to their diet
Secondly, we will increase the supply of chickens on the market meaning even the general population will be able to buy chickens for food
