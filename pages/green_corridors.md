> Description of the solution

In Medellin, Colombia, green corridors were created that follow and restore the geography of the area prior to recent development. From 2016 to 2019, the city created 36 corridors, 18 along major roads and 18 along waterways, covering over 36 hectares. The areas with green corridors have already seen temperature reductions of up to 4 degrees celsius. These Green Corridors provide Medell√≠n with a host of ecosystem services: they help to reduce average city temperatures by 2¬∞C, enable carbon uptake via plant growth, capture particulate matter (PM2.5) to improve air quality, and increase urban biodiversity thanks to creation of more wildlife-friendly habitats. These rapid effects demonstrate why nature-based solutions are rapidly increasing in popularity in the field of sustainable urban design. The Green Corridors project also won the 2019 Ashden Award for Cooling by Nature ‚Äì watch the video below to hear more about the project from the city‚Äôs mayor.
