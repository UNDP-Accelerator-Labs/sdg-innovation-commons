## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

-&nbsp;&nbsp;UNDP Iraq’s current portfolio is concentrated on working with local communities and families to ensure better infrastructure and livelihood opportunities, as well as maintaining a strong partnership with the government aiming at developing a strategic framework for climate action and good governance. Hence, the portfolio’s strength is centered around community work and building networks, and there remains tremendous opportunity to further leverage these networks for policy change at the national level. - The current portfolio is concentrated around learning, communicating, and applying (to some extent) lessons and making decisions; however, the portfolio of interventions has space to mainstream further.&nbsp; The emergent signals of severe climate change in Iraq are not recognized as a factor that affects the social contract. The current portfolio does not leverage climate action as a vehicle to strengthen trust among communities and hence social contract in the country. - The sensemaking process highlighted the importance of digital tools and digitalization to strengthen government-people trust or people-to-people trust.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Engagement with local youth: the engagement with local youth provided data on the main challenges for the weak social contract, from the perspective of the youth, who represent more than 50% of Iraq’s population.&nbsp; 

Qualitative Interviews: Interviews with actors from the public sector, private sector and local community in order to provide insights on the work being done to tackle the weak social contract in Iraq. 


Informal Conversation: informal conversations helped the team to have a role in bringing unspoken needs and opportunities and provide a safe space and flexibility so participants can speak freely. 

Sensemaking: Collective sensemaking had a role in performing participatory analysis and identifying, collectively, priorities and opportunities to work on. 




> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Portfolio approach: This approach used to structure a portfolio of interventions to strengthen social contract in Iraq&nbsp;

Mapping Signals of Change: This method had been used to map signals that indicate a weak social contract in Iraq and the signals indicating the opportunities to strengthen social contract in Iraq.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Design Thinking: This method had been used to further investigate the affected and benefiting stakeholders from the weak social contact in Iraq.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

System’s Mapping: This method&nbsp; had been used to have an overview of the system of weak social contract of Iraq to support in identifying critical points for intervention. Solution Safari: This method had been used to research potential local solutions, interventions, to be part of the newly designed portfolio.

UNDP Strategic Innovation Unit and UNDP Country office in Iraq :&nbsp; The UNDP-CO in Iraq completed the sensemaking phase of Deep Demo for reimaging social contracts in Iraq and designed the primary&nbsp; portfolio of interventions to strengthen social contract in Iraq. The design of the social contract portfolio is supported through the second generation of the "Deep Demonstration“ initiative, nurtured by the UNDP Strategic Innovation Unit and financed by the Government of Denmark.&nbsp;
