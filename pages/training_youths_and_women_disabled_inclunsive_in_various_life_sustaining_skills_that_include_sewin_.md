> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation will carter for youth of both gender including the disabled ones and also the women in the community especially those not on employment ,they will be taught these skills so as to equipment the with the knowledge and ensure that they utilize these skills to benefit them in their life as a self employment strategy of earning a living.
In addition,the members will be put in groups and trained,there after given the capital in material form and begin producing the items and selling to gain profits.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will help to generate income for me and others in the community through the sales of items made where by those profits will be shared among the active members in percentages including a percentage for me as their tutor and leader in all the groups.
Further,there will be other income generation within the group where will introduce village banking within the members,where the members will be putting their money they earn from profits together,those who wants to borrow,the can get at an interest rate when returning it so as to increase the income to be shared at the end of a given agreed period.
The targets market will vary according to the product that will be being produced.for example,sanitary reusable pads will targets the young girls and women in the community and in schools as well as the doormats which will also be sold in offices,shops and homes.the snacks will mainly be targeted for the dailycommunity individually to buy for consuption.Different clothes will be sold to the community members,in rural areas and also arranging with schools to be making uniforms for them at a cost.
The benefits of these skills is not only for income generation,but also to promote the health well being of the people and the environment at large.For example,items like sanitary pads,they helps to keep the environment clean where by when used they are washed and kept to be requested unlike the non reusable ones.this,helps to reduce refuse disposed in the environment by the irresponsible individual.Reusable pads are non toxic as they do not contain chemicals,this,promoting health of girls and women in a fight against cancer.Activities like doormats production,tailoring and making of snacks,will help keep members busy in the community and work towards reaching their goal of well being there by reducing idle mind which can lead into behaviors that are not acceptable in the society since this innovation is mainly targeted for both educated or not educated people in the community.

> Technical Feasibility

Honestly,this innovation is just in my knowledge and skills I have which am ready to impatient them on others.Currently,I have one sewing electric machine which I use to make items for selling as for my personal sustainiblity.
Hence,if found the opportunity to be empowered so as to meet the needed requirements to implement this innovation,then it can be achieved.
The major proposed implementation plan is to first to notify the innovation program to the government officers in the district,there by communication the whole plan and purpose of it  that is its vision and missiion,upon given a good ahead,then mobilize the interested individuals in the community,form groups,then choose the skills they may have the interest in to be doing and contribute little amount of money for each group to open a bank account so that all the village banking saving if not borrowed by the members are to be kept in the bank account.
If empowered then buy the needed equipment such as sewing machines,doormats needles and other neends so as to begin the projects.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation can help improve the lives of the people in the society through gaining of profits which can help them earn a living.Not only so but also use of the items the make on their own.
Other items can be being given in bulk to some other business people in the markets at an order price for them to resale then there buy promoting locally produced items in the society and country at large.
In addition as stated earlier,sanitary pads will help the people not only to save their money but not buying pads monthly but also helps in a fight against cervical cancer in women and girl.
