> Title of the innovation

Combat Obesity and Chronic diseases with the informative power of Food and Nutrition by using technology to enable people to have easy access to a Nutritionist, nutrition knowledge and healthy food alternatives.

> Brief description of the innovation

According to W.H.O, non communicable diseases(NCD’s) kill 41 million people each year, equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally.
Unhealthy eating habits, unhealthy lifestyles and physical inactivity show up in people as High Blood Pressure, increased glucose(Diabetes type 2), Overweight/Obesity and elevated blood lipids. These are risk factors that can lead to cardiovascular diseases, the leading NCD in terms of premature deaths. 

To help solve this problem, this is where Sukie Wellness comes in. We help people have easy access to a Nutritionist, nutrition knowledge/coaching and healthy food alternatives both online and physical.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our business Model is as follows: 
1. Monthly subscription to have access to a Nutritionist both online or physical. The Nutritionist provides client with meal plan, Nutrition knowledge and motivation support for the duration subscribed.
2. sale of healthy food alternatives on an e-eCommerce platform. Using e-eCommerce makes our business reach to great masses as geographical location is not a barrier.
3. Our next milestone is manufacturing of nutrient dense foods which are not on the market. For example, instant cereal for busy pregnant women.

Out target market includes:
1. Overweight and obese individuals
2. Diabetes and High blood pressure patients
3. Healthy conscious individuals 
4. Corporate wellness

The challenge prize will help us increase our food alternative stock to catch up with demand. examples of the food alternative include Almond flour, coconut flour to replace wheat flour, pink salt to replace table salt, avocado oil to replace veg oil e.t.c.
The prize will also help us achieve our next milestone as indicated on our number 3 business model above.
Lastly, it will help us employ more nutritionist to help us offer service to many people without delay.

> Technical Feasibility

We intend to use technology for people to have easy access to a Nutritionist and healthy food alternatives. 
We are currently building an eCommerce platform where clients will have access to our services and products regardless of geographical location.
Our next milestone will be manufacturing of Instant Cereal for busy pregnant women(a product which is not on-the market), this will be sold both on our eCommerce platform in all leading supermarkets country wide after which we can start exporting.

> Anticipated Social Impact

In our nutrition coaching sessions, we help clients realize that healthy food is tasty, affordable and locally available because there is a misconception that healthy food is expensive when not,  we further  offer them motivation and emotional support among many other support services. 

Adopting healthy, good eating habits can make a huge difference in a way an individual feels and operates. Once a person feels good within themselves, follows a healthy diet,  it shows in all other aspects of their lives, from a roadside tomato seller, a receptionist to a CEO, everyone benefits. We are dedicated to unlocking your potential with good nutrition.

Mission: To impact Africa with knowledge on how to manage body weight and prevent chronic diseases through the trans-formative power of Food and Nutrition. 

Vision: A world where all people thrive through the transformative power of food and Nutrition.
Our innovation is relevant because we have witnessed the worrying rise of obesity and poor diet related disease like Diabetes, BP etc.
