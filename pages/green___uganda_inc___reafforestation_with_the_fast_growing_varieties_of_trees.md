Reafforestation. Our concept is to make tree planting be taken up as life saving service by humanity and must therefore be a duty of every living human being and must be free and voluntary. So we shall be coordinating activities of life saver volunteers
Our focus is to raise the fast growing varieties of trees both locally available and imported e.g. Clonal eucalyptus, Paulonia, Bamboos, Lira, Cassia, Neem etc,
These fast growing trees would quickly substitute the present wood product sources and thus alleviate the pressure on the naturally occurring wood sources allowing them to recover and rejuvenate effectively.
