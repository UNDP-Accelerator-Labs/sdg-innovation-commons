Behaviorally informed RCT to increase uptake of e-service in 5 municipalities 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Georgia was already a pioneer in e-services before the COVID crisis, but pandemic-mandated restrictions on physical contact have accelerated the shift towards the delivery of public services online. However, the uptake of the online services was significantly low outside major cities. In addition, Covid has significantly hit the small and medium size businesses with vulnerable groups lacking an access to business support opportunities. Our challenge is to close the digital gap between rural and urban areas and support development and uptake of services with gender equal opportunities in mind through behaviorally informed RCT. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Covid19 has shifted work of the government and development sector drastically, since new challenges emerged, along with post pandemic uncertainty. UNDP Georgia has obtained support from the Rapid Finance Facility to address some of the most stressing issues in the country caused by the Covid19. Specifically, targeting the digital service delivery on the local level and the equal access to business development opportunities for vulnerable groups with an aim to “leave no one behind.”    Over the past few years Georgia has made a significant achievement in the area of service development. Georgia's Public Service Halls have become one of the role models globally for the service delivery, where up to 400 different government services can be accessed through one stop shop principle.   While Georgia has made huge strides in digitalization and connectivity in the last decade, the pandemic showed that the benefits have been uneven, leaving rural areas and at-risk groups underserved. There is a digital divide between urban and rural areas, particularly remote and mountainous locations. Less than half of the rural population uses the Internet every day, compared to 65 percent in urban areas.

Government of Georgia is introducing new electronic system for e-services in local self-governments, which will enable local population to request respective services online, as well as engage in local-self government activities. It is a good time to encourage the population towards uptake of these e-services offered by the LGs

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

AccLab Georgia will support the RFF project team in implementation of the behaviorally informed RCT study to nudge citizens towards to uptake of e-services offered by the 5 LGs in Georgia. The Lab will bring the behavior science expertise, which is not available in house within the project team.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What kind of intervention/communication can nudge citizens towards the uptake of e-services offered by the local self governments.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will develop the RCT based on the identified barriers among population for the uptake of e-service and the interventions used for the intervention groups will be developed with behavioral science approaches. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

the data from the e-services software is not available cince the analytical function of the software is not available. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The grow scale for this challenge would be to roll out a full-scale intervention in all municipalities based on the RCT outcomes from 5 pilot municipalities
