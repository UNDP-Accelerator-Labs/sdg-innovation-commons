This solution consists of a number of platforms intended to identify, document, and preserve Syrian modern and contemporary intangible heritage in the field of arts and design. The idea came from Syrian architect kinda Ghannoum who came up with this intuitive when she was making research about the modern design history in Syria and found little to no proper archive documenting the rich and diverse arts and crafts, especially in graphic design field. There are five platforms:  stamps archive, logo archive, print archive, media archive, and type archive
