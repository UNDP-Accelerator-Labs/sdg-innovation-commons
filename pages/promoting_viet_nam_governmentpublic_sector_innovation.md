Understanding Incentive to drive Viet Nam Government/Public Sector Innovation 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that government officials lack incentives to change or adopt new innovative practices.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In Viet Nam, the role of the government in socio-economic development has long been emphasized. Hence, the number of people working for the government is very large, creating too much burden on the state budget. This means that each of the officials earns very little salary (for example, a typical government official earns 200-300 USD per month for the first 5-6 years of his/her government career), hence they have to work extra jobs (ex. teaching, selling things online, consulting,...) to make up for their families needs. With that, they don’t usually have time for any new things that require extra effort and are often sensitive to financial return (ex. if the new things do not guarantee them extra earning, they are less likely to adopt them).  Because of the lack of financial incentives, it government officials positions difficult to attract and retain talents. For example, officials may lack research, policymaking skills, or language skills. Those that are capable are often overloaded with their existing tasks and do not have room for innovation. The government structure is also very complicated and bureaucratic. In order to carry out any new initiatives, government officials need permission from several layers of management. Once something fails, they also have to face multiple layers of punishment. This reduces their incentive to innovate. Finally, most of government officials have life-long posts, which means that they do not have incentives to do things better to keep their jobs. Their incomes are also mostly the same, based on the number of experiences rather than on the effectiveness of their work. Hence, there’s little structural or peer pressure to take risks and do things better.

In Viet Nam, there are a huge number of workers employed by the state budget, and there is a large gap in innovation capacity between the public and private sector. High-quality human resources are one of the most critical elements in having an innovative and competitive workforce. Official data show that there are about ~10% of the working population in Viet Nam on government payrolls (this includes government officials, teachers, nurses, police,…), with rather low productivity, yet with very secure jobs which puts a huge burden on the government budget to pay a livable salary.  Current government salary level only covers about 65-70% basic expenses and needs of an average citizen.  It is a well established fact that a government official cannot make basic ends meet and live with the official salary alone. Yet this is a sensitive topic and there is a general consensus in society to quietly accept that government officials  don’t live by “salary”, but “other” sources of income.  There is a lack of publicly accessible data or study on the government official’s on other types of incentive (e.g: taking risks, adopting innovative approaches etc…). http://www.molisa.gov.vn/Pages/tintuc/chitiet.aspx?tintucID=20947

As  UNDP, one of our main partners is with government and public sector workers.  Yet we often take for granted that 1) government workers have the right incentive to devote full attention/resource to work with UNDP in pursuing SDGs and 2) government workers have the capacity (skills, mindset, etc…) to adopt and scale new approaches. This is a risky assumption from UNDP, as we rush in to work with government partners and lock in our project without fully understanding the capacity and incentive of our partner.  Based on anecdotal observations and some official sources,  there is an increase in brain-drain in the public sector. Every year there is a growing number of government officials who leave the public sector in part because of the growing wage gap between the public and private sector. There are multiple restructuring efforts every year and there are significant cuts to the amount officials working in the government which means fewer new people are recruited. Multiple articles and interviews have been describing how it is becoming increasingly difficult to make a decent living within government; fewer and fewer university graduates want to pursue a career in the government (which was still a dream for many just a few years back). For officials, creating “other” sources of income is a survival necessity -- which promotes corruption and abuse of power. This pose a major challenge for UNDP to engage with public sector in Innovation, as there are many inherent risks to innovation, yet we are often forced to work with a tight deadline, small funding opportunities, high delivery pressure, perform "innovation theater" -- all of which increase the chance of selecting risky partners and ultimately detract us from making REAL progress toward SDGs.  http://www.molisa.gov.vn/Pages/tintuc/chitiet.aspx?tintucID=20947  https://vnexpress.net/sao-phai-co-bam-tru-cong-chuc-luong-ba-coc-ba-dong-4225160.html  https://vnexpress.net/cong-chuc-lam-giau-bang-cach-nao-2198813.html

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Accelerator Lab is in a unique position to ask the tough questions that typical UNDP projects refrain from due to political pressure and government partner interest.   The majority of UNDP projects heavily involve government officials -- this also speaks to a major bias in the UN system to serve the government, donors and politicians need first and foremost rather than actually being neutral and citizen-centric that we are supposed to -- once our implementing partners are set, it is very difficult to change as the focus is on ensuring delivery and reporting endless success story (a.k.a development porn).  If UNDP is serious about committing to our core principles of serving the people first, we need to examine critically how we engage (if sometime at all) with government partners. Being mindful of government official incentive is critical on any UNDP project involving government partners, so we don’t back up the wrong horse, muddying ethical lines,  or waste resources on a project that sounds good on paper (which innovation often tends to be) but a nightmare in implementation.   Systems transformations can’t be achieved by focusing on serving government and politicians needs alone. Yet so much of UNDP procedures not only favor, but actively rely on government partners to ensure delivery and appeal to donors. On the other hand, the option to work with other actor such as private sector is often extremely cumbersome with due diligence.  There needs to be a concerted effort in critically examining how we collaborate with government partners,  with other units and stakeholders are very much needed. Having this learning cycle focus  on innovation within the Government can shed light on how both UNDP’s  own and current government system is highly risk averse and follows traditional governance approaches of control and command. Due to the strong role of the state, governance impacts all the activities related to both the Accelerator Lab’s, other Unit’s, and largely all development work in Viet Nam.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Government officials lack incentives to change or adopt new innovative practices and are therefore stuck in traditional, linear and rigid governance mechanisms that are not fit for complex 21st century challenges that require agility, adaptiveness and anticipation. New culture and experience is needed to integrate new governance approaches within both national and city level governments.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we (UNDP) incentivize government officials to take more risks and try something new in a way that leads to a bigger and more sustainable impact? If we provide them with knowledge (innovation tools), value and evidence, would they be more receptive to change &amp; apply innovation methods?  If we provide them with common space or a platform  to work together across departments (citylab, nic) then gov official will collaborate better? What are the current capacity of innovation in government official in Viet Nam? How can UNDP design  incentive schemes that can give space for government officials to innovate in Viet Nam? This is based on ongoing Accelerator Lab work with government partners. We will measure the impact in this learning cycle of the past work.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Usually, the government collects data from official surveys or consultation workshops with beneficiaries. With ethnographic research, the problems and needs of beneficiaries and other stakeholders are more fleshed out, helping policymakers understand these beneficiaries at a much deeper level. With satellite data, it helps fill in the gap of lacking data on waste management/or mismanagement in Da Nang city. Based on which, the government can make much more practical policy.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Currently UNDP is working at both national and city levels on promoting innovative approaches with the Government partners that are more adept to addressing 21st century challenges. At the national level, UNDP has been working with the recently established National Innovation Centre (NIC) on SME innovation advising on their new strategy.  At city level,  the Accelerator Lab is working with the Da Nang government (PPC,DISED, DNES) to formulate a CityLab task force and building a Circular Economy Hub. The emphasis on both streams of work is on identifying public sector champions but also bringing more voices to decision making and adopting an experimental approach that will aim to address fast paced development challenges.
