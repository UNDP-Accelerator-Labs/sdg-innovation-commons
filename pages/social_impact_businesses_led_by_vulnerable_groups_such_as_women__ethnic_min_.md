## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Social impact businesses led by vulnerable groups (SIB)such as women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities and diverse gender group are facing challenges in developing sustainable business models to balance profit and social impact. One of those challenges is access to capital.

 

There are several reasons which limit SIBs to access to capital. First, the readiness of those SIBs to receive investment is low. They have limited capability in designing and implementing a sustainable business model. As a result, their financial performance is not yet at the scale to attract investors. Secondly, although the SIB community has been established, it is not strong enough to support SIBs in entering new markets, connecting with business development service providers and investors. Thirdly, there are several policies to support social enterprises and cooperatives, but those policies are not comprehensive and do not cover all types of SIBs in Viet Nam. Particularly, specific policies to enable business environment for SIBs led by vulnerable people haven’t been implemented effectively. SIBs still hesitate to fulfill administrative procedures to get support from the government. Despite the above-mentioned challenges, there are possibilities in encouraging more investors to invest in SIBs. Building up a stronger SIB ecosystem can improve SIB access to better market and investment opportunities. Stronger enterprises that want to generate greater impact will pay more attention to SIBs led by vulnerable people and consider their investment. An example is the cooperation between Sao Do entrepreneur club which gathers big businesses and Nghi Luc Song center to establish a social enterprise to support people with disabilities. Such model opens a new investment mechanism for SIBs led by vulnerable people.

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
The specific blog on social impact business and impact investment hasn't been completed yet.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The biggest barrier is the awareness of the society on social impact business. There is still a misconceptual understanding of SIBs that they work for charity purpose. Even within many SIBs, business owners focus more on impact generation rather than establishing a sustainable business model.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Building SIB ecosystem takes time and the test phase can not be implemented in 2022

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Building SIB ecosystem requires a system approach to collect information from different stakeholders. Hackathon is a tool to urge SIB champion to co-create solutions to strengthen the SIB ecosystem, which in turn to attract more investment for SIBs
