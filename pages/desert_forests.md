Desert Forests
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is evaluating whether there is sufficient interest and engagement from tourists for the Desert Forests activity in the deserts of Wadi Rum.


> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



1) Tourists do not have enough activities to do during the afternoon hours in Wadi Rum.

2) Tourists would like to contribute to greening Wadi Rum.

3) Wadi Rum camps would be incentivised to participate in and/or sell planting activities because it will support their eco-certification process, mainly criteria (3.4,10.4,10.5, and 11.6).

4) The product will have a high return on investment for the local community-based organisations and camps.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

- We are building on the findings we got from our tourism research in the city of Madaba.

- based on an article in the Jordan Times newspaper, Wadi Rum received in the first two months of 2024 a total of 18,359 visitors, the majority of whom were non-Arabs, according to figures released by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.

- The number of visitors in January was 6,814, which significantly increased to 11,545 in February. Non-Arab tourists constituted the majority with 14,200 visitors. Arab visitors accounted for 1 per cent of the total with 187 visitors, while Jordanian visitors made up 22 per cent with 3,972 visitors.

- Ther is a sharp decline in visitors numbers compared to the same period last year where the site recived 210,444 visitors in the first four months.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Before scaling Desert Forests, we aim to test its value by evaluating demand and visitor feedback

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



It is essential to assess ideas through pilot or prototype projects to ensure they are well-developed, desirable, and scalable. This approach helps refine the concept and maximise its impact before full-scale implementation. For this, we are collaborating with the Wadi Rum protected area, to run a two-month experiment to test tourists' engagement with the product, its marketing methods, and decentralised product sales.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The experiment will require to collect data from the tourists that undergo the tourism experience.  This feedback will help fine tune this experience to help it scale.

## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Government: (ASEZA and Wadi Rum Protected area) / They are our main partner for this experiment and they would have to sustain this tourism experience beyond the lab.

This experience will also be an eye opener for the officials in the Wadi Rum protected area to know how to test tourim experiences before going into a fully fledged program.
