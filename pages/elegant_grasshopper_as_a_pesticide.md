elegant grasshopper as a pesticide  
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that smallholder farmers use chemical pesticides on already poor arable land and we are exploring if an elegant grasshopper could be used as an organic pesticide while also controlling a herd of grasshoppers feeding on crops during planting season.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

There is currently little literature relating to the beneficial use of Elegant Grasshopper in Lesotho. Elegant grasshopper is one of the specie known to destroy plants and farmers always struggle to expel it on fields except by using chemicals. While conducting a solution mapping exercise in Kolo region in the Mafeteng district, the Lesotho Accelerator Lab discovered a serendipitous innovation used by one of the farmers. The farmer had initially killed the elegant grasshopper while working on the field, and later realised that plants which were near the dead grasshopper were not being attacked by pests and insects. That is when the farmer started hunting for elegant grasshoppers to manufacture own pesticide instead of buying and using chemicals. The lab is currently working with National University of Lesotho to conduct a laboratory analysis identifying the good and hazards which may be invited by using this innovation when scaling it up to support other farmers in Lesotho. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

There is currently no data relating to elegant grasshopper as a pesticide. However, UNDP is currently working with the National University of Lesotho to collect enough information in order to carryout the experiment. the current data that exist is the infestation of locust that happened in Ethiopia, Kenya and other parts of Africa

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

There are currently no laws relating to management of pesticides in the country particularly hazardous chemical pesticides  The first attempt to put some regulatory instrument was in the form of Pesticides Management Bill of 1986 which was intended to regulate the use of pesticides in general. There are no provisions for among others banning and or restricted use of some pesticides in the bill.   www.oecd.org/chemicalsafety/pesticides-biocides/1934470.pdf

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This will promote and provide insights into the use of natural pesticide which will provide a solution to the infestation of inserts that affect crops. this solutions will provide an easily available product for the smallholder farmer to use. This was identifies at solution mapping in Mafeteng and this experiment will enhance the work that is being done by the farmer. there has also been signals from other countries which has large infestation of locust and this might be prevalent in Lesotho. Lesotho also has a history of famine and this solution might assist in that

Can elegant grasshoppers be used as a pesticide in crop farming

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can the elegant grasshopper be used as a pesticide and what are the environment impacts/benefits to the grasshopper. What would be the impact on the ecosystem if grasshopper are used as a pesticide

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Use science to prove current evidence that was discovered by the farmer in a small rural area in Lesotho  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

If elegant grasshoppers have characteristics of a pest repellent, this will provide more information on chemical reactions within the elegant grasshoppers that can be utilised to manufacture organic pesticides.

We plan to utilise collective intelligence with research institutions to enable scientific elements which have potential to classify elegant grasshopper as a pesticide specie. This will be augmented by laboratory tests to prove the hypothesis.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The ministry of agriculture and farmers will benefit from this challenge as it will give them an alternative for pest control as this will provide an organic way to control the pests. Additionally, farmers and the ministry will have more knowledge on the elegant grasshopper and other uses that the grasshopper can have beyond being a pesticide. They will learn both its advantages and disadvantages. There is need to collaborate with the Ministry of Agriculture and farmers associations.
