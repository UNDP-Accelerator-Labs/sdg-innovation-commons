"JOSA is the not for profit organisation that works for a better Jordan through openness in technology."

The Jordan Open Source Association (JOSA) is a non-profit organisation based in Amman, Jordan. The association is among the few non-profits registered under the Jordan Ministry of Digital Economy and Entrepreneurship.



JOSA’s mission is to promote open source principles for the good of the Jordanian society. We believe that information that is non-personal – whether it’s software code, hardware design blueprints, data, network protocols and architecture, content – should be free for everyone to view, use, share, and modify. Our belief also holds that information that is personal should be protected within legal and technological frameworks. Access to the modern Web should likewise remain open.
