## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Name of the experimental activity

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Provide hands-on experience for government officials to learn how to create and implement an experiment in the digital transformation of public services so that it’s more accessible to vulnerable groups. 



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Hypothesis: If we make streamline the portal so that it’s less busy, more directional, and aligns with accessibility standards, then not only the general public but also vulnerable groups, especially blind and visually impaired people will use the portal more often

Hypothesis 1: IF we improve the features of the search section (so that different keywords can produce search results), THEN people will need less time to do the procedure on the platform, more satisfied and the number of users will increase.

Hypothesis 2: IF the login function is simpler, less requirements, THEN people will need less time and easier to carry out the procedure, will be more satisfied and the number of users will increase.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Provide a cohesive and comprehensive digital governance incubation program for government officials that include capacity building workshops, coaching, sharing sessions, hackathons, experiment design and implementation to hand-hold them through the activity.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The before and after length of time that end users spend on completing the same task?

Level of satisfaction of users when using the redesigned portal 

The accessibility of blind and visually impaired users of the portal (i.e. whether their screen reader software can read and understand the codes of the portal)

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Observation (watching users, counting time of using the website, etc.)

Interviews

Google analytics

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

11/11/2021 - 16/6/2022

	

User testing at the Hackathon with the Blind association

The Hackathon is a rare opportunity for the coders and end users to sit together for observation

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49
- 50-99
- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> Please upload any supporting links

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

All of team members are involved. We also hired multiple consultants on ethnographic research, UI/UX design and public service administration experts

Time allocated for ethnographic research (each interview takes 1 - 2 hours)
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The experimentation will finish in May 2022.

Proven hypotheses

Hypothesis 1: IF we improve the features of the search section (so that different keywords can produce search results), THEN people will need less time to do the procedure on the platform, more satisfied and the number of users will increase.

Hypothesis 2: IF the login function is simpler, less requirements, THEN people will need less time and easier to carry out the procedure, will be more satisfied and the number of users will increase.



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The methodology of ethnographic research and internal government hackathon helps to engage the government officials more deeply in empathizing with their beneficiaries, especially vulnerable people. 



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

The whole incubation program takes 8 months, however the experiment itself was 4 months  



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

No monetary resource from the Lab but from our partner - the Governance & Participation team - in a 100,000 USD project but we don’t know the exact amount spent for the experiment



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No monetary resource from the Lab but from our partner - the Governance & Participation team - in a 100,000 USD project but we don’t know the exact amount spent for the experiment



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Similar to question 28. And we will pass on the incubation model to our national partner - the National Innovation Center so that other provinces in the country can also apply. 



> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

> Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?
