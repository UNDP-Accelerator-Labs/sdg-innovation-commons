[[ai_summary:Abdullah Hashi, the acting head of experimentation for the Somalia Counter Office UND Backlab, discussed an R&D initiative to scale practices and strategies that outperform trends in communities affected by drought. The initiative aimed to identify local solutions to address recurrent droughts in Somalia's pastoral communities. To achieve this, they used a positive deviance method, combining non-traditional digital sources with traditional data methodologies, including satellite imagery, remote sensing analysis, interviews, and focus group discussions. The pilot took two years to conduct, engaging stakeholders at each step, including government ministries, community members, and villagers. After identifying successful practices in "positive divine" villages, they transferred these solutions to low-performing villages through a Buy-In-Discovery-and-Action-Plan methodology, with positive results, including engagement from government institutions interested in scaling the methodology.]]

# Somalia's Positive Deviance Approach to Scaling Up Resilient Agricultural Practices

### [[0:00]] Tell me your name\. Your oh, let's this will make noise\. So let me have this, tell me your name, your title and say I consent to this recording\.

Hi, my name is Abdullah Hashi\. I'm the acting head of experimentation for the Somalia Counter Office UND Backlab\. I consent to this recording\.

### [[0:21]] OK\. Over to you for the R&D questions\. Could you tell me about an R&D activity you'd like to share?

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:Data Powered Positive Deviance]]
Yeah\. So this was an initiative, a pilot about scaling practices and strategies of outperforming trend in our communities in Somalia, where we are trying to take these strategies and solutions from outperforming communities to other low performing communities in the drought times\. So Somalia, I think 70% of the country is covered by hinderlands, which is essential, you know is it for the level of pastoral communities\. So over the past years they have been facing a lot of recurrent throat which is caused by overgrazing and increasing number of regulations and also the climate factories such as recurrent routes\. I mean, so we were trying to find a local solutions\. I mean there have been many solutions to address this recurrent routes and how this is impacting the life of the pastoral community\. So the issue was, can we find local communities that's outperforming during the raw times and prefer these solutions and strategies there they are using to maintain their headlines to other communities?

### [[2:08]] How did it come about? Where did it start?

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Data Powered Positive Deviance]]
[[tools:Design]]
Yeah, So it came about Somalia has been facing monetary carbon grant is one of the worst droughts were in 2016 and 17 so which had an impact on the livelihoods of the pastoral and equity pastoral communities\. So we tried, I mean we were using utilizing what's called a positive deviance method to to identify communities that are outperforming in that, in that draw times and also posted draw times\. And this methodology allows us to use different data methodologies, both traditional and nontraditional digital sources to identify communities that are maintaining the rental lines after and during the roads\. So we first we tried I mean to identify these communities through non traditional digital data sources such as mobile data or remote sensing\. So we tried to communicate with the private sector, especially the telecommunication companies and so many 70% of the people have access to mobile use\. So we tried to get the data of, you know, movement of the personal communities from the telecommunication, but that didn't work\. So we tried to use other sources of data to identify what we can consider a positively violent community\. So community that are performing better during the drought\.

### [[4:28]] What who, who was involved in your journey and what was their role\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
So we had different stakeholders within our initiative\. So we had GI zip has mini stakeholder who was supporting the initiative and we had, you know, relevant ministries from the Somaliland government cabinet\. We had ministry of livestock, ministry of environment, Ministry of Agriculture\. We had, you know, the communities that are living in the areas that we were conducting the research\. We have, you know, a knowledgeable community members who live in Somaliland who knows better, You know, the climate issues of the of the area\. So all all of these stakeholders were played in different holes and yeah, we were engaging all of them\.

### [[5:35]] How did you ensure the investor for the perspectives were considered and how did they input change the RED journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Trust]]
So I mean before the beginning to, to to select, you know, the, the location or the area that we were trying to conduct the reset, we organized the stakeholders meeting\. As I mentioned, we had, you know, different ministries attended and participated in, in that representatives from different ministers that attended in that stakeholders\. We also had an eligible member of communities in that stakeholders engagement\.  
So from the beginning they were part of you know, you know, contributing input to, you know, to identify the locations that we think we can consider us posted by villages or groups\.  
At the same time, wherever, with every step that we were taking, we were trying to engage with different stakeholders to, I mean, take their contribution, their input also to, you know, requested them, you know, to validate some data that we were collecting through both traditional and traditional methodologies\.

### [[6:58]] What tools, methods or methods did you use to do what you just described in one?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Data sharing]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
So we were, as I have mentioned, we were using what's called data power positive, different methodology which combines, you know, both non traditional digital sources and also traditional data sources\. So we were using satellite imagery data, we were using remote sensing analysis, we were using, you know, interviews, focus group discussions\. We were using, I mean, yeah, this kind of different data methodologies in terms of, for example, conducting the experimentation\. Also we're using a methodology called the BDA, which is buy to get, buy in from community and then discover solutions\. And also I can maybe come when I'm talking about the experiment, I come in, I maybe explain later, but it's called buy in discovery and action plan methodology\. So we're using different methodologies in terms of, you know, discovering the practices and solutions and strategies and also trying to sphering these solutions from one community to another community\.

### [[8:23]] What practice influenced your choice of processing methods?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:ArcGIS]]
[[tools:Data Powered Positive Deviance]]
[[tools:Conducting interviews]]
For example, for the type of tool that we were using for remote sensing analysis, we believe that it was type of tool that was, you know, suitable to use for, you know, Hendland area in Somalia where it was the one of the most suitable remote sensing analysis to the Somali geography, especially the area that we were conducting the research\. And for the other methodologies, you know, interviews and focus group discussions, we were conducting this research in Agri pastoral communities where we thought this was the, you know, most suitable areas to discover solutions or also validate data\.

### [[9:27]] Were there any specific, specific tactics or approaches used to engage stakeholders build by in or address resistance to your R&D work?

[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Undertanding the community]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
Yeah, one of the tactics that we were using was, you know, to engage, I would still call it continuously, you know, the, the pilot took for two years, you know, to to conduct\. So we were trying to update them each and every step that we are taking in terms of, for example, villages that we were conducting the research, we were trying to establish, you know, a communication channel with villagers to had a good relationship with them, you know, to do our work smoothly\. So it was kind of, I mean, engagement tactic, I mean, to continuous engagement with the and communication, open communication with the government and also with the villagers\. What was the outcome of your RND gene? So after, you know, collecting the data and identifying an areas of villages that we think are considered they are performing well and we call it as a positive divine areas\. We tried also to identify what they are doing differently\. What are the solutions practice that they are there so they were able to maintain their regenerates\. Why they are different from the others\. So we, you know, after collection data, analyzing data, we came up, you know, with different solutions to strategies that they were implementing\. I can name, you know, rangeland management\. There was a village activism, there were a protection of the, you know, environment\. There were, I mean, using an organic pesticide, you know, for their agricultural field\. So there were a lot of strategies on practice that they were doing differently\. So what we did was, you know, I mean to facilitate transfer of these practices from the positive divine village to other low performing villages\. So we selected 2 villages which you know, were geographically and climate wise, you know, similar and which was performing better and the other one was performing lower\. So what we did was to design an experiment to transfer the practice from the positive event village to other to lower performing village\. So we followed a process that we called a PDF getting by in discovering the solutions and then in and transferring these solutions to other village\. So we started with the low performing village where we facilitated session with the community\. We were using visual data and had a session with the community to talk about, you know, why they are, you know, performing lower than the other village\. And we showed them, you know, the data, the maps and everything that we have collected\. And we got there by in, I mean to participate in the the research and we asked them to select, you know, representatives from their village to company with us to the positive divine village to in order to discover the solutions and, and had, you know, knowledge sharing discussion with the other community\. So they selected members of the community representative is from them and these representatives coming at us with to the positive divine community\. Where do they have discovered, you know, the practices, the strategies, the solutions that are that are there to maintain the rent lines\. So we had knowledge sharing, knowledge exchange discussion between the two representatives from the low perform affiliate and also the Boston Divine affiliate\. And they share the OR exchange of the you know, the idea solution is also they discovered, you know, the solutions\. They have visited you in different places in in that area\. And after that, we took their representatives from, you know, poster divine village to the lower performing village to talk to their community about what they have seen the solutions, the practice, the and and, and and, and, and strategies that they see, you know, is relevant to the, to their community\. And from there we came up with an action plan for the low performing village, which, you know, they selected, you know, some solutions that they wanted to implement in their village in the future so that they can maintain the arrangements\. So they came up with these solutions and we had, you know, the timeline, the people who will be responsible for implementing these solutions\. So that's the way we conducted them the, the, the, the, the experiment\. So for the outcome, we, you know, also while we were designing the experiment also we had a monitoring evaluation, you know, system for, for, you know, for the, for the pilot\. So we are using to elements to one is, you know, to conduct a remote sensor analysis\. Before the experiment, we, you know, conducted a remote sensor analysis for the low performing village\. So now after the experiment, we also want, you know, to conduct again, remote sensor analysis to see, you know, what's the difference?  
That's when we to measure, you know, the the impact\. Another way that we are trying to measure the impact is, you know, to we have already the action plan from the community\. So we want to also to maybe go there and see what has been done, you know, according to that action plan\. So we that's something another impact that we have seen that we are getting, you know, engagement or we have been approached by, you know, different government institutions\. They that want, you know, also to adopt the methodology and also want, you know, to scale this solutions and prices and methodology as well to other places in Somalia\.

### [[16:27]] What would you do differently if you had to start ugly? What would you have different?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
I mean, I mean, maybe in it's not about the experience, but when it comes to, you know, sharing the outcome of the experiment, you know, we had a workshop in in in Nairobi, Kenya with the different stakeholders from different organizations, I in terms local, in terms from the government\. So to share, you know, the outcomes and the insights of the experiment\. So I think we maybe have missed, you know, some crucial stakeholders\. So one thing that I would have done differently\. So, you know, to invite more, you know, diversity stakeholders to, to, to such, you know, insights sharing workshop\. So, and it's it's something that we also planning, I mean, to have maybe another workshop with in Somalia with the government and also federal member States and also other actors to again share, you know, the outcome of, of of this pile all set\.

### [[18:23]] How do you feel? That wasn't so bad, right?

I feel so so\.
