## Emmanuel Saati’s innovation Smart Blind Stick provides blind people with detection and localization of objects to offer those people a sense of the external environment using functions of sensors. The sensors also aid the user with the mobility task based on the objects' dimensions, range, and height. The assistant technology provides fast processing for the exchanged information between a blind person and sensors. For example, the system can detect the obstacle that is 4m in front of a blind person in 30sec.
