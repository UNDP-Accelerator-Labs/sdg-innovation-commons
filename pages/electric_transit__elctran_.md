> Title of the innovation

Electric Transit (ELCTRAN)

> Brief description of the innovation

Electric transit is a scooter selling and sharing(rental) service company with a twist. Selling and renting electric scooters and offering its customers battery swapping stations when they run low instead of the alternative of waiting to charge it yourself which takes time and luck of infrastructure. One pays a monthly subscription and is eligible to go to a charging hub where he or she is able to leave his low battery's for already charged one just like a filling station but quicker and cheaper.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Electric transit will generate income by first selling affordable electric scooters. Secondly by offering swap stations meaning if ones battery is low they are able if they're members via monthly subscription fee to swap their low battery for already charged ones with ease. As there is no infrastructure that will allow one to charge from home. And is an efficient and time friendly manner of doing things.
Our target market is the regular commuters students, business people who want to beat traffic with efficiency and affordability. 
As it is known the world wishes to reach carbon naturality by 2060 thus electric transit is the way to go. Take note charging stations will use solar to charge the batteries thus a smart city and cleaner air.

> Technical Feasibility

The implementation process is set to be in phases. With first a pilot program set to determine the viability from which we move to gradual implementation in specific areas where swap stations are established. Seeing success we move on to city wide implementation. To note all this will require massive sensitization for awareness of the benefits of electric transit.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Firstly we look at demographics Zambia has a young vibrant population. This population is constantly on the move but we have crazy traffic that delays people to work massively. Also we have the high cost of fuel and its unstablity that is unreliable. The product being offered is affordable as customers have the choice to rent out the product(scooter) or buy. We provide infrastructure that enables one to refill(swap batteries) with ease and convenience. The product also improves air quality in the long run by reducing toxic waste produced by combustion engines on the road.
