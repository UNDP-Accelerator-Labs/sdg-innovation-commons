> Brief description of the innovation

Aquadaily is a new vibrant innovation developed by KUYEMAETA KALALUKA ROYD a Zambia young man in Sioma District. 
The innovation is about harnessing the the challenges which are culmination of climate change in oder to have ample yielding in the areas of aquaculture specifically the culturing of fish and aquatic plants, and  daily cattle farming.
Aquadaily is a new highly profitable farming business in the whole world and first ever of it's kind to land or being talked about in Zambia. 
Aquadaily is a new technology which has being developed due to climate change. The question was: How can  daily cattle farming thrive in times of drought and sudden floods?  This question gave birth to aquadaily. 
Aquadaily is where fish ponds are used as a venue for planting aquatic plants/ grass, and the cattle manure are used as a booster for fast growth of fish and for diseases control. The aquatic plants/grass grown in the fish ponds are used as cattle feed. These aquatic plants/grass very health and fast than any plants/ grass grown else where. The aquatic plants/  grass are every nutritious, highly good for milk production, growth etc. The aquatic plants/grass and cattle manure are not administered as known or in a way one may think like but by using the new innovations.
Aquadaily is a good business venture which is less labour, low cost of production, and does well in all seasons including harsh ones.
This farming leads to high production of milk and fish almost twice the current production of milk and fish in the whole world. This also reduces the cost of fish production by 45 percent.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The programme is fighting against climate change in such away that it keeps the environment pure and making it pure whilst increasing food production levels. The food products produced at low cost ever  will be sold customer at a profitable price. The innovation is about harnessing the the challenges which are culmination of climate change in oder to have ample yielding in the areas of aquaculture specifically the culturing of fish and aquatic plants, and  daily cattle farming.
Aquadaily is a new highly profitable farming business in the whole world and first ever of it's kind.  
Aquadaily is where fish ponds are used as a venue for planting aquatic plants/ grass, and the cattle manure are used as a booster for fast growth of fish and for diseases control. Hence, aquadaily innovation will address the challenges people face in daily farming and aquaculture. The aquatic plants/  grass are every nutritious, highly good for milk production, growth etc. 
Aquadaily is a good business venture which is less labour, low cost of production, and does well in all seasons including harsh ones.
This farming leads to high production of milk and fish almost twice the current production of milk and fish in the whole world. This also reduces the cost of fish production by 45 percent. Since the above are the results of aquadaily, it is clear that the business make profit .

> Technical Feasibility

Aquadaily innovation 's implementation is based on the blending of aquaculture and cattle daily farming.
When we talk of aquaculture we are talking of the culturing of fish and aquatic plants/ grass/ vegetables in the fish pond and around the fish pond. This is done by using the aquadaily innovations, without these innovations this can not be achieved.
When we talk of cattle daily farming I am talking about culturing of daily catttle for milk production purposes. May I not confine it to daily cattle only, even non daily cattle can be cultured. May I make it clear that aquadaily is ideal for daily cattle as the aquatic plants/grass/ vegetables are greatly ideal for increasing milk production levels.
Aquadaily begins first with the culturing of daily cattle so that we can have cattle manure for fish ponds (for fish and aquatic plants/grass/ vegetables) to grow fast and healthy. This done using using aquadaily innovations/ technology.
The aquatic plants/grass/vegetables Will be harvested using aquadaily innovations/ technology, processed and administered using aquadaily innovations/ technology.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Aquadaily is the new innovation which results into fast and healthy growth of catttle, fish, plants, grass and vegetables, into increased milk production. This being the case, aquadaily ensures that the cost of production decreases,  the time taken for the production decreases and finally, increases the production levels. With this, aquadaily's produce outcompetes all similar produce on the market
The innovation is very important because it insures fast production without harm to the environment or the produce being harmful to consumers, low cost of production, smooth culturing of fish, cattle, aquatic plants/ grass and vegetables in drought and other harsh seasons/ times without stoppages or setbacks and finally almost twice increased production levels. With this people will be helped as it addresses the challenges people face.
