## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The experiment arises in the national health context as of December 2020, with an exponentially increased number of cases, the evidence of community circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the duplication of positive cases in which the contagion traceability thread has been lost.
Given these circumstances, the government and different actors in society urged the population to comply with the recommended preventive measures, among which are highlighted:
- Use a mask, and correctly
- Physical distancing
- Reduction of mobility and avoiding crowds
- Maintain and respect the “social bubble”, that is, the same group of essential contacts.
Therefore, with this experiment, we intend to make the Uruguayan population aware of the moment of urgency in which we find ourselves, looking for people to be more responsible in their individual actions, help protect themselves and protect their families and nearby communities, to slow the spread of COVID-19. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we send personalized letters with a clear and moving message regarding COVID care, then compliance of health prevention measures at the individual level will increase.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

 - 200 people were randomly selected from the Uruguayan telephone directory and letters were sent to their homes.
 - This letter was authored by the 'me from the future', that is to say, that the person who sent the letter was the same person, but from the future. In turn, a mask was sent along with the letter so that it can be used by people and in this way generate greater fidelity with the letter.
 - After the letter was sent, each person was contacted by telephone to complete a questionnaire.
 - In turn, a control group was formed with 200 people who did not receive the letter, and who were also contacted in order to carry out the evaluation.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The citizens 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

To generate the data of the people to send the letters, open data of all geographic addresses of Uruguay, georrefentiated was used. From this dataset, we randomly sampled the treated and control group for the experiment.
Link: https://catalogodatos.gub.uy/dataset/ide-direcciones-geograficas-del-uruguay                        To evaluate the result of the experiment, 
We sent the 200 letters and we took another group of 200 people as a control group that did not receive the letter neither the face mask. A week after sending the letters, we telephoned both groups to ask some questions so that we could compare the two groups and evaluate the impact of sending the letter. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 month

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Partially proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

- The sample should have been bigger. 
- The surveys to evaluate were not very specific. Therefore, the answers where not good enough to evaluate the experiment. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Really short, one month. 

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

200 USD. We had in the office the envelopes, the face masks and the stamp. We did the printings in the office. It was our time mostly. The Uruguay post sent the letters charging us just 200 Usd to cover their costs.

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

It has learnings regarding the effectiveness of the letters to try to change behavior. We are designing similar experiments that came out thanks to this experience. Not with letters but with Whatsapp messages.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1.	Infodemics can influence people's decisions and affect their health and well-being.
2.	When it comes to effective communication, information must not only be relevant and precise but also be given at the right time and pace.
3.	It is possible to do fast, cheap, and easy experiments within the country office. Much more possible than what we expected. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Data collection. 
Survey design. 
Evaluation 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Everyone, because we were able to test a new way of influencing the behavior of citizens that could be taken into account for further projects and communications from the CO. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, three iterations. The first MVP we tested in the CO, the second with family & friends, and the third one is the one we sent to the citizens.  

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Have an expert in surveys to evaluate the experiment. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, money to send the letters, and an expert to design the survey and the message of the letter. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The solution mapper and the explorer were fundamental in this experiment, we built this together. For example:
-	By exploring similar experiences in other parts of the world
 -	Understanding what was happening in disinformation at the national level
 -	Connecting with the Uruguayan post as an existing solution for sending letters.
 -	Map people who work on behavioral issues who helped us to write the letter.
 -	Designing the MVP: Writing the letter 
 -	Collecting the data for sending the letters

All the activities where hold by the three of us.
