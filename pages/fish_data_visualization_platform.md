"This is the data intelligence and visualization platform that will compile the information of the different Remora hardware and software, helping analyze the situation of the fisheries, the fishing effort, and the consumer behavior, among others. This data will help monitor catch, fish breeding cycles, percentage of catch and by-catch, fishing effort and the correlation to weather conditions, moon phases and tides, among others. This information will be crucial for several stakeholders, from policy makers down to the fishermen, to make informed decisions and then act on them. The platform would be a revolutionary tool that could change the way fisheries are managed by analyzing fishing “big data."
