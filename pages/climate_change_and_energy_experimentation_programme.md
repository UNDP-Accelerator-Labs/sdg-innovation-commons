## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. One of the steps that should be taken prior to or as a first step in experimentation is an assessment of novelty- this helps the innovator and experimentation partners understand the distinction between innovation and creativity.  2. It is important to asses resiliency and commitment of innovators, this determines how far the innovator is willing to go in order to test/understand the efficacy of their innovation.  3. The diversity of innovations within a portfolio makes it challenging to find suitable research experts and testing equipment for every step of experimentation, there is a need to find a design that allows flexibility in sourcing of funding, experts, testing equipment and materials to aptly support the testing and certification of innovations.  4. From two experiments that were running we discovered that there was a huge demand for the innovations within the innovators community and these products were already socially accepted and being used by the community. There is need to bridge certification procedures to allow such products to continue to be used by the communities while testing is underway.  5. A learning from the ongoing experiment with Colehill Copper Slag stove: Converting waste to energy needs a viable and flourishing value chain to be established to ensure the availability of energy source for the innovation to run. This is a learning that can be applied to all other innovations in that, there is need for relevant support industries within the innovation ecosystem to support the growth of the innovations which in turn has the capacity to provide opportunities for decent jobs.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. To test the innovations in the portfolio we partnered with academic institutions to provide research oversight and mentorship, the focus/purpose of the research had to be aligned from the a development partners perspective to the research institutions perspective, eg commercially viable vs academically stimulating.    2. As the innovation ecosystem is fairly young in the country, institutions are yet to adapt to understand how to respond to supporting innovations  3. To run the various stages/ iterations of testing requires more time and funding.  4. Lack of availability of local materials and testing equipment

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These were the methods available for the 8 innovators and their research focal points to use during their experimentation, noting that the majority of the testing during the reporting period was in lab scientific testing. For the Innovators using/ developing apps and drones they sourced historical metrological data. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Most of the Innovations were at early prototype/ pilot stage, and no concrete evidence had been generated to prove that the innovation indeed were effective solutions to the challenges they were trying to tackle. In order to improve their innovations this required further improvements and a series of iterations of prototyping with mentorship and guidance from research experts. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?
