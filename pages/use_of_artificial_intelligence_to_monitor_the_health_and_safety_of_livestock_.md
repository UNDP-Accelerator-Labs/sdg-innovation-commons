> Title of the innovation

Use of Artificial intelligence to monitor the health and safety of Livestock.

> Brief description of the innovation

We want to use AI enabled chips to monitor the temperature as well as the behaviour of Livestock. This will enable farmers to monitor their animals from the comfort of their homes and reduce the human labour involved in monitoring their animals.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Initially we want to lease the said technology to various farmers across the country,of course these will be big commercial farmers, but we want to be inclusive. Therefore we will engage the government as well as mobile phone companies so as to subsidise the product enabling small and medium scale farmers to access the product. The technology will greatly reduce the cost of having a lot of human labour. The prize will help our company in having our own research facility that will help us with accurate data as we seek to improve the product and solving other Livestock related problems that can solved using Artificial intelligence.

> Technical Feasibility

Although we have not yet built a prototype, the tags are designed to check the temperature of the animals and send it to the farmer, the tags also monitor the normal behaviour of the animal and if it detects slight changes in the behaviour of the animals it notifies the farmer and a few components of the tags are as follows: 
1). IC CHIPS. The IC Chip that makes decisions and provides memory to store data.
2). TAG ANTENNA. The antenna connects to the tag IC. It receives signals from the interrogator and transmits the signal received back.
3). SUBSTRATE. This is the part that holds all the components together.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This technology will reduce the cost on farmers with regard to having a lot of human labor.
It will also allow farmers to detect diseases early thereby reducing mortality rate.
The innovation is important to the market because as the world continues to develop into a more digital and tech era, our farming techniques must evolve into tech focused techniques and solutions.
