"The Zikra Initiative replaced and transformed the charity drive experience with the philosophy of ‘exchange,’ or, the act of giving one thing and receiving another in return.  The ‘exchange’ experience eliminates the giver-receiver dynamic and replaces it with an ‘equal’ and fair relationship in which both the giver and the receiver gain new skills and resources." http://www.zikrainitiative.org/#
