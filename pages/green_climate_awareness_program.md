> Title of the innovation

Green Climate Awareness program

> Brief description of the innovation

To foster climate change awareness In the communities and schools by establishing eco clubs which gives climate knowledge and tree planting initiatives. As an environmental student of the university of Zambia we are highly encouraged to be part of climate and environmental awareness programs and projects. Giving environmental knowledge to the communities and schools is part of who we are. The Green Climate Awareness innovation is one of the highly effective ways I possibly think which can be used to educate the public about the environment and its necessary benefits. Am aimed at making massive awareness to the general public and encourage the planting of carbon sinks and cleaning the environment. The keep Zambia clean

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will enable those involved to start gardens in schools which will help generate income. The innovation is determined at making use of the environment in any possible way. When plants or crops are planted they act as carbon sinks and they purify the air in the atmosphere and they also help prevent soil erosion.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovations main aim is to develop a population which is aware and concerned about the environment and its related problems. The purpose is to impact knowledge, attitudes, motivation, commitment, and skills to work individually and collectively towards solutions of current problems and prevention of new ones. Green Vision Zambia acts as one of the inspiration team/prototype. The implementation plan is to establish eco clubs In various schools and generate income through sustainable means.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Climate change is no longer a projection but rather a reality and we need to act fast the effects are visibly clear. This awareness program gives the population a chance to be part of the change the world needs. The people with knowledge contribute to the solutions. And I believe the world today including Zambia itself needs solutions to its unprecedented increases in pollution and mass deforestation its experiencing.
