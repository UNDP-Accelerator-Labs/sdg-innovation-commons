## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Nous avons appris que les cooperatives de femmes de Menaka sont confrontes a des problemes securitaires 2. Il est souvent difficiles pour elles de commercialiser leurs produits laitiers 3. Elles sont confrontees par un manque d'equipements pour la conservation et la transformation de leurs produits 4. Les besoins specifiques ont permis le developpement d'un concept de solution digitale pour la commercialisation en ligne 5. Lancer une solution digitale en zone securise est plus impactant
