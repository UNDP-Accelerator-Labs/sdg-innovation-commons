The search for local initiatives brought the Lab team to Banankoroni, a neighbourhood on the outskirts of Bamako. In this neighbourhood, we met a young, ambitious entrepreneur who has set up an informal solid plastic waste purchasing business. This company consists of a grinder and a washing basin. It buys solid plastic waste which is sorted, crushed, washed and bagged by the few men and women who work there. This plastic waste is destined for processing at the plant in Ghana.

The entrepreneur wants to develop this business by recovering plastic waste because, according to him, the sanitation sector presents real economic opportunities.
