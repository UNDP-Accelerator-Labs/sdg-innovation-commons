Part 1: A Catalyst for Change at ID4Africa2025 in Addis AbabaIn May 2025, Addis Ababa became a hub of energy and ideas as leaders, innovators, and changemakers from across Africa gathered for the ID4Africa2025 conference. The event was a meeting of minds, and a powerful reminder of how digital identity is reshaping the way governments connect with their people.I was fortunate to have attended the event; after all, UNDP has been an integral part of the journey in shaping and supporting the Digital Legal Identity agenda in many countries. As I reflect on the conversations and insights shared during the 2025 conference, one thing stood out: digital ID systems are more than the tech solutions and platforms that are vendor driven. They’re about people. They’re about creating more inclusive, transparent, and responsive governance. And for countries like Namibia, they offer a unique opportunity to strengthen the bond between citizens and the state.This blog series will unpack the key takeaways from ID4Africa2025, exploring how Namibia, and other countries can turn these insights into action. In this first blog, I’ll be surfacing the foundational themes that emerged.

Digital Identity: More Than a NumberThe first thing is that a digital ID is more than a technical tool. It is a gateway to rights, services, and public participation. When implemented thoughtfully, it can help citizens access healthcare, education, and social protection seamlessly. But in order for this to happen, people need to understand what digital identity means for them. They need to know their rights, their responsibilities, and how their data is being used.In Namibia, this could mean launching nationwide awareness campaigns that speak to people in their own languages and through the platforms they trust. Whether it is through community radio, local newspapers, or social media. The approach should focus on starting where people are by making digital identity something people feel ownership of, not something that has been imposed on them.Trust: The Cornerstone of Digital TransformationOne of the strongest messages from the conference was that trust is everything. Without it, even the most advanced digital systems will struggle to gain traction. Citizens need to feel confident that their data is safe, that their voices are heard, and that the system works for them, not against them.Namibia has a real opportunity here. By being transparent about how digital ID systems are developed and used, and by inviting public input at every stage, the government can build a foundation of trust that will support long-term success.

Citizens as Co-CreatorsAnother powerful idea that emerged in Addis Ababa was the importance of involving citizens not just as users, but as co-creators of digital ID systems. When people are invited to shape the policies and practices that affect them, the results are more inclusive, more effective, and more sustainable.Namibia could lead the way by creating spaces. Spaces both online and offline, where communities can share their views, raise concerns, and help design solutions that reflect their realities.No One Left BehindInclusivity was a recurring theme at ID4Africa2025. Too often, digital systems fail to reach the people who need them most. The people living in remote areas, people with disabilities, the elderly, the marginalised or those without formal documentation. When that happens, trust erodes and inequality deepens.Namibia can take proactive steps to ensure that its digital ID rollout is truly inclusive. This might involve continued outreach and support to their current mass registration drive using mobile registration units, forging partnerships with grassroots organisations, and tailored outreach to underserved communities. The goal is simple: everyone counts, and everyone should be counted.Collaboration is KeyNo single actor can build a successful digital ID system alone. Governments, civil society, the private sector, and international partners all have a role to play. The conference highlighted the power of collaboration. It reinforced the value of bringing together diverse perspectives and resources to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Namibia has a vibrant ecosystem of partners who are ready to contribute. Fostering open, cross-sectoral collaboration, could unlock new ideas and scale up solutions that work.

Open Standards, Local SolutionsFinally, the importance of open standards was a key takeaway. These allow for flexibility, innovation, and local adaptation. All to ensure that digital ID systems can evolve with changing needs and technologies. Namibia can benefit from adopting open standards that empower local developers and innovators to build tools that are tailored to the country’s unique context. This approach not only enhances sustainability but also builds local capacity and ownership.Looking AheadThis is just the beginning. In the coming blogs, we’ll dive deeper into each of these themes, exploring how Namibia can turn these insights into action. The unique single message here is that digital identity journey is more than the system itself. It is about people. And when citizens are informed, engaged, and empowered, the possibilities are endless.
