> Type of the Solution

Innovative

> Description of the solution

The Twin is based on coupling several environment models that are tested and parametered with observed data to ensure that these are representative of Singapores urban climate center. Twin is a computer model, or digital urban climate twin of Singapore. This will allow policymakers to analyse the effectiveness of various heat mitigation measures before spending money on solutions that might not work. 

> Who lead the solution

Local Government
