> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Really it's a good business which needs a lot of patience when you engage yourself in it.  It has advantage and disadvantage were by for you to acquire all the documents which are needed for you to transport from the source to the market you need to have enough capital and communication with the owners of consessions or licence are the people who are bringing us, as youths to suffer because they collect a lot of money from Chinese people whom now they give all the production papers. Now for us Zambians to go and buy papers which you will find that they are no spaces..

> Technical Feasibility

These are trees which found in the forest. They are difficult to find but also they have specific area where you can find it. Like I said it really needs enough capital.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We promote jobs to the community and youths in the same areas were we find this trees. Also we donate money to the same community. And now we are being effected on market because same people are the ones who buys this timber they have stopped. Our cry is that if the gorvment of the day can introduce other companies that will be buying from Zambia I think it may help slot of citizens here.
