> Brief description of the innovation

Extraction of organic palm oil from organically grown palm fruits using basic technique known as "Oil Flotation". This technique employs the concept of density variation in which Palm fruits crushed and boiled to facilitate floatation of palm oil which is then scooped up from the boiling pot and reboiled to drain out the water from the palm oil so as to give the oil pro-longed shelf-life. After boiling and scooping the oil for three times, the oil is allowed to cool down and prepacked in plastic bottles of different sizes for sale on the market

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Locally produced organic palm oil will sell cheaply because of the cheaper production process involved. This involves growing of palm trees using natural but suitable and fertile soils found in Luapula, Zambia. Eliminating fertilizer is a serious cost reduction in the  edible oil production process. Once planted, palm trees will produce palm fruits for over 40 years during which period harvesting will be continuous thereby providing continuous income over 40 years.
Target market will include a common man in low cost residential areas such as Chawama township where buying cooking continues to remain a luxury due to the high cost in most shops.
We intend to engage Hungry Lion to consider switching to our organic palm oil, with our low price offer, we have no doubt that Hungry Lion will take our offer. Further we intend to partner with Shoprite stores for national distribution of our cheap organic palm oil where it will be accessed by both the haves and the have nots.
Production off edible oils without using fertilizers will preserve soil quality and maintain the natural eco system required for grassland and general vegetation

> Technical Feasibility

Obtain Vast idle land on the banks  of Luapula river from Chiefs. Register Cooperatives to till the land and grow palm trees. Engage local people to attend to the palm tree fields and  extract oil after maturity period of four years. Sell the oil to the local and surrounding towns, transport the excess to the line of rail (Copperbelt and Lusaka Province )
Set up Palm oil kiosks in low cost high density residential areas for sell to the community

> Anticipated Social Impact

Increased nutrition for both the rich and the poor. 
Job creation for youths
Household income security
