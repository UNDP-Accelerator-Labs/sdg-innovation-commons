Innovators: SPC/GIZ programme and Late Charlot Long Wah, Chinese origin, former Kava store entrepreneur in Vanuatu.

Narrative: Climate change threatens the bountiful harvests of fruits in Vanuatu such as mango, papaya, and tamarind. It is both a source of food and income for most of the population of Vanuatu. Charlot Long Wah, a Chinese living in Port Vila, developed this system of solar drying in collaboration with the SPC/GIZ programme and launched the solar drying system project. The solar drying system uses solar energy to naturally dry and preserves fruits, nuts, fish and meat, that can last up to a minimum of a year. This innovation was launched in North Efate in Vanuatu and helped the village women to produce dried quality products for food security as well as earn income.
