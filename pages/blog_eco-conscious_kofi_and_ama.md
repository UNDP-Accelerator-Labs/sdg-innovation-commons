Introduction

Ghana’s production of waste is rising
rapidly, along with an
increasing
population and expanding economy. It is
estimated that 75% of solid waste is simply
discarded and just 5% of the 1.1 million
tons of plastic waste Ghana generates
annually is recycled, contributing to poor
sanitation and pollution.

This waste could be described, more
accurately, as material in transition - much
of it is recoverable. With an estimated
value of US$ 15 billion, there is huge
potential for a circular economy. Recycling
is a key element of Ghana’s approach
to managing plastic waste, but despite
some good practice in plastic waste
management, as set out in the Roadmap
for Radical Reduction of Plastic Waste
in Ghana, the current reality presents a
significant development challenge.

To respond to challenges such as this, the
United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) has set up an innovative network
of Accelerator Labs across the globe,
including in Ghana, to identify, test and
scale up solutions to developmental
challenges.

In synergy with other initiatives by the
UNDP in Ghana, such as the Ghana Waste
Recovery Platform (which is facilitated by
UNDP), the UNDP Ghana Accelerator Lab
(AccLab) has been identifying, mapping,
and experimenting with grassroots
for waste management,
solutions
and applying various methodologies
to understand
the circular economy
including behavioural insights, collective
intelligence, and ethnography.

One such solution is a plastic recycling
scheme,
through which homes and
businesses can deposit their recyclable
plastic bottles in branded containers,
at selected fuel stations in Accra. The
AccLab has used behavioural insights
methods to design experiments which
focus on driving changes in behaviour,
increasing take-up of plastic recycling
and thus improving waste management.

Recycling is not an entirely new concept
in Ghana. Some communities have
always re-used items – including plastic
bottles. Indeed, there is an informal
community which goes from house to
house collecting plastic waste, for free
or for a fee. But can informal solutions
cope with volumes of plastic waste being
collected?

In line with an ethos of growing portfolios
of mutually reinforcing solutions to tackle
complex challenges from multiple angles
and accessing more diverse data about
the AccLab
development challenges,
collaborated with
the Ghana Waste
Recovery Platform and Young Reporters
for the Environment (an NGO) to launch
talk about recycling
an online Let’s
survey. The survey
results provide
primary data about some of the complex
issues affecting waste-management,
particularly recycling.

the Accelerator

Lab
Furthermore,
(an
collaborated with Tro-Tro Diaries
online community on Facebook with
around 400,000 members in Ghana and
West Africa) to generate conversations
about how plastic waste is affecting
communities.

Understanding the
context: “Let’s Talk About
Recycling” survey

Fig 1: Respondents by region & Waste Segregation Rate

The Accelerator Lab conducted an online survey to collect data on segregation and
recycling, particularly of plastic. This report highlights some key results. An infographic
and full set of results is here.

There were 405 respondents to the survey, most of whom live in the Greater Accra
(67%) and Ashanti (11%) regions of Ghana, with 45% being female and 53% male (2% did
not answer this question). 41% said they segregate their waste at least sometimes, but
the majority (59%) do not. 77% said their communities are badly affected by plastic litter
to at least some extent.

Results suggest that households and businesses prefer their recyclable waste to be
collected at their doorsteps, instead of taking it to recycling points. Typically, this is
linked to issues of accessibility (location of recycling points), affordability (perceived
costs of the journey to recycling points - including time), and the existence of alternatives
(including whether there is a recyclable waste collection service in place).

2

Who segregates what?

23% of respondents said they segregate their waste regularly – we call them Eco-
conscious Kofi and Eco-conscious Ama!. Those who segregate support different
economic activities including food-processing and the creative sector. Some give
glass waste to craft companies who produce traditional glass bead jewellery; compost
food waste into manure for farming; sell or give plastic bottles to juice-makers who
bottle sobolo (a hibiscus-based drink); and donate plastic waste to youth-led recycling
schemes for making school bags, as well as other recycling schemes.

Which recyclable materials are generated and
segregated daily?

36% said plastic, but many would also like to segregate paper, glass, electronics, and
food, suggesting opportunities for green entrepreneurs. Some of the respondents said;

“There should be facilities for people interested in electronic hobbies to salvage parts
for makerspaces. (Greater Accra)

Organic waste (cocoyam, plantain, yam) can be sorted and sent back to gardens or
farms. (Ashanti)”

However, efforts to segregate are sometimes hampered by errors in handling waste.

“Personally, I will segregate waste 24/7 but the eventual collectors do not, they collect
everything into the same thing- that is the problem. (Greater Accra)

I put the plastic bottles in a separate bag and give it to the company that collects our
rubbish. Sometimes I see they add it to the general rubbish. (Greater Accra)”

Community recycling point or pick-up service?

Fig 3: What happens to segregated waste & How far are you willing to travel to a
recycling facility?

About 50% of those who segregate waste have it collected by waste pick-up
companies. 32% go to recycling facilities, and the rest rely mainly on informal-sector
waste collectors.

Zoomlion (Ghana) Limited was most often mentioned for waste pick-up. SME’s, including
Sesa Recycling, Coliba, Jekora Ventures and Nwura Asa were also mentioned.

There are huge quantities of catering waste (plastic bottles and polystyrene containers)
generated at large social events in Ghana, particularly funerals. Several catering
businesses who responded to the survey, called for practical support to recycle this
waste.

About 60% of respondents said they would only travel up to 10 minutes on foot to use
a community recycling facility suggesting a strong preference for either a collection
service, or recycling facilities located close the communities.

Informal-sector

Respondents highlighted the significant contribution informal sector waste-pickers and
collectors make to recycling, but said they should be organized better and supported,
given the potential for recycling to create jobs and stimulate local economies. However,
some pointed to low incomes from waste-picking (an average of 50 pesewas from
selling 1 kg of plastic) as a disincentive.

What would make segregation and recycling easier?

Fig 4: Making recycling easier & Benefits of recycling.

The survey asked respondents what would make segregation and recycling easier?
The top 3 things are: more community recycling facilities (17%); making facilities more
visible and easier to find (16.4%) and increased awareness (15.8%). Further analysis of
the data showed that the lack of affordable bins, and lack of accessible collection and
recycling facilities are particularly acute challenges outside Accra. Some respondents
noted:

“Big companies should provide recycling bins at low/no cost or things will not change.
(Greater Accra)

Assemblies should ensure we know where facilities are - make them easier to access
without a car. Are there any outside Accra? (Greater Accra)

I live in a peri urban community. There is no recycling centre in the whole district –
about 30 km from Kumasi. (Ashanti)”

Just about 1 in 4 respondents (26.3%) said that more recycling would make the country
cleaner.

To raise awareness about segregation and recycling, many respondents suggested
using more Ghanaian languages and less English in public campaigns, and tailoring
communication to suit different levels of environmental awareness in communities. This
could be a combination of repeated public-education campaigns to get basic messages
across, and gradual education of communities about more complex concepts, for
example benefits of recycling.

5

Incentives

Only 10% of respondents said they would only recycle if they were paid to, but many
suggested incentives including pay-back or points-redemption, to cultivate and sustain
segregation habits.

“Some token amount to people, especially young children, and youth, for bringing a
certain quantity of pure water sachets, plastic bottles, old shopping, and fertilizer bags,
to the recycling containers. (North East)

Nwura provides points for households who sort their waste, retrievable in cash at a
point in time. This has encouraged more households to sort their waste.” (Western)

Provide some incentive for the recycling bins to be emptied regularly. We see such bins
overflowing … making all around very filthy and defeating the purpose for providing
[them]. (North East)”

Online conversations
to generate data about
plastic segregation and
recycling

To generate additional insights about plastic segregation and recycling, the AccLab
collaborated with the Tro-Tro Diaries online community, to frame questions for 4 weeks
of online conversations. The online conversations reached 19,500 members of the
online community with about 2150 commenting.

The main question was “Is our community badly affected by plastic litter or are we just
exaggerating?”

This generated a lot of comment from the online community, including broad agreement
with the proposition that communities are badly affected by plastic litter, but also
specific examples pointing to awareness of the link between gutters choked by plastic
and flooding, whether in Accra or other cities like Koforidua.

Behaviour was often cited as a key part of the problem, whether consumer behaviour
where buyers accept or except their purchases to be placed in many plastic bags, or
where people dump their waste in public spaces.

As one comment describes:

“Badly affected but yet you buy toothbrush, and you request plastic bag, you buy
[energy drink] in Tro-Tro [another] plastic bag, yoghurt [and] pie, pie gets its own plastic
bag, yoghurt gets it own plastic bag, then they both get overall plastic bag”.

Another comment on the online conversation was:

“Exaggerating??? If it rains in Koforidua and the gutters overflow, that’s when you will
realize how serious this thing [plastic litter] is”

“Badly affected and that is the cause of most of the flooding in Ghana, because most
of the gutters are choked with plastic”.

Applying Behavioural
Insights to Plastic
Segregation and Recycling

Background

The Let’s Talk about Recycling Survey and Online Conversation point to contextual
factors that may make it more or less likely that people in Ghana will segregate their
plastic for recycling, including whether facilities to deposit segregated plastic are
conveniently located or whether waste-management companies provide a reliable
collection service from homes.

However since segregation and recycling of plastic is not mandatory in Ghana, it is
important to understand the choices individuals make about post-consumer plastic,
and how these may manifest as patterns of behaviour. The AccLab conducted 4 focus
groups in communities to understand these behaviours, and data from the focus
groups points to different behavioural archetypes of recyclers. Archetypes help to
describe the typical motivations and attitudes of those who recycle – and include
“Eco-conscious Kofi”, “Maybe Mansa” and “Just-passing Ama”. Eco-conscious Kofi
is a generally eco-conscious Ghanaian, often working in a professional role in the
waste-services sector, an expatriate, or a Ghanaian who has returned home after living
overseas, with exposure to recycling schemes. Recycling is established behaviour in
this group. Maybe Mansa is often an avid browser of social media, and publicity and
advocacy about recycling on social media may be the trigger to visit the recycling
point. However, recycling by this group is only intermittent. A Just-passing Ama only
recycles when they happen to be close to the recycling location and it is convenient –
which in some cases is about every 3 months or so.

The purpose of applying Behavioural Insights was to understand what it takes to
shift people from being a Just-passing Ama to a Maybe Mansa or better still an Eco-
conscious Kofi and hence increase quantities of post-consumer plastic deposited in
recycling bins.

The AccLab designed a set of “nudges” (easy and low-cost suggestions) to encourage
and accelerate recycling behaviour, as part of a process of experimentation. This is
one example of how the UN system is deploying behavioral approaches to tackle
development challenges.

Experiments were co-designed with GRIPE (Ghana Recycling Initiative by Private
Enterprises), Coliba Limited (a recycling start-up), and Total Petroleum (Ghana) Limited,
and took place at selected fuel service stations under an existing iRecycle project, where
people can deposit PET (polyethylene terephthalate, the most common thermoplastic
resin used in containers for liquids and foods) plastic bottles in recycling bins.

8

These fuel stations are behavioral hotspots, where the primary activity, refueling,
can be reframed, to include other decisions, such as whether to shop at an onsite
convenience store, service the car, and deposit plastic. Typically, waste pickers collect
plastic from the bins for sale to aggregators and recyclers. The plastic deposited is a
no/low-cost input for waste-pickers, aggregators, and recyclers, supporting livelihoods
along a value chain which links the informal and formal waste sectors.

While arrangements under the iRecycle project worked well initially, amounts of plastic
deposited declined over time. At one station Osu, bins that were previously full enough
to be emptied twice a week, only needed emptying twice a month. As use of the bins
declined, waste-pickers reverted to picking plastic off the streets. Since segregation
and recycling are learned behaviors, this was an ideal opportunity for the AccLab to
test if applying BI could increase use of the bins, by shifting social norms from ‘plastic
waste is a national problem - for Government to solve’ to ‘plastic waste is also a local
problem – which local people have a key role in solving’.

Context and Archetypes

Following the initial focus groups, the AccLab organized additional interviews and
workshops with waste pickers, recycling start-ups, those who segregate, and those
who do not. Segregators said that locating bins at the fuel stations enables them to
combine segregation with buying fuel, making it easier to sustain their segregation
habits, but they had concerns about bins not being emptied regularly and creating
litter. Those who do not segregate highlighted the lack of awareness about where
to take segregated plastic to, corroborating results of the Let’s Talk about Recycling
survey. An inspiring group of female pensioners, who are also waste pickers, described
how many of the youth had abandoned waste-picking because of declining incomes,
but these pensioners saw waste-picking not only as a source of income (albeit low),
but an important way to maintain physical and mental activity and a sense of purpose
during their retirement.

Workshops enabled co-creation and refinement of behavioral archetypes (personas) to
describe typical motivations of segregators including the active (Eco-Conscious Ama
and Kofi) and intermittent (Just-Passing Ama and Maybe Mansa), as well as those who
do not segregate (No Chance Omar). Based on this, an information intervention was
designed, to encourage segregation, targeting a 10% increase in plastic deposited,
based on the framework below.

Results of the experiments

Over 3 months in late 2020 and early 2021, quantities of plastic deposited, and
perceptions of existing and potential segregators, were studied. In total just over 1
tonne of plastic bottles was deposited at the 2 sites. At East Legon, almost 750kg was
deposited, about 59kg weekly, and an average 18% increase above a pre-intervention
baseline of 50kg weekly. At Osu, almost 300kg was deposited, about 23kg weekly, and
an average 44% increase above a pre-intervention baseline of 16kg weekly. Bins were
also monitored at two similar “control” locations, where amounts of plastic deposited
did not vary much or showed some decline, over the experiment period. These are
very positive outcomes, particularly as they were achieved without financial or other
incentive systems, pointing to untapped potential for segregation and recycling among
households and businesses, and opportunities for green entrepreneurs and investors.

At the experiment sites, bins were often full, and excess plastic was bagged separately.
Over time, some segregators reported secondary behavioral effects, as their family
and friends began to segregate their plastic.

What worked?
Success factors include:

a) Co-creating and situating archetypes in local contexts: The archetypes helped
people to see themselves in context, situating the plastic issue at an individual
and community level, not just nationally or globally.

Billboards combined English with Ghanaian languages Twi and Ga, using the
phrases Fa Ye Adefofrↄ and Kε Fe Nↄ Kooklo, meaning “use something which exists
for something new”. Local communities were mentioned directly including “Osu
Man Bii [meaning people of Osu] – Don’t just throw your plastic away”).

b) Cognitive dissonance: We juxtaposed Ghana’s Independence Arch in the
background and litter in the foreground, suggesting gaps between aspirations
for clean communities and current realities. For some, this was a trigger to pay
attention.

Recycle” survey and the Conversation on the Tro-Tro Diaries online community.

Recommendations

1. The ‘Let’s Talk about Recycling’ survey, Tro-Tro Diaries Online Conversation and
Behavioural Insights experiments provide multiple perspectives on the potential for
a circular economy, and associated opportunities and challenges. The infographic
of integrated results captures key data and linkages. These are rich sources of data
and knowledge, to help individuals, as well as public and private organizations to
design successful plastic segregation and recycling schemes in Ghana.

2. While plastic deposited did increase following the experiment, segregation habits
can lapse if bins are few and inaccessible – two concerns that came up clearly in
the ‘Let’s Talk about Recycling’ survey’ and the Behavioural Insights experiments.
It is important to develop more networks of well signposted bins, particularly
outside Accra, and the data suggests opportunities for the private sector to invest
in developing these networks of bins, particularly where they are innovatively co-
located with other services including shops and fuel stations. Feedback from the
experiments shows that people are more likely to develop segregation habits if
these build upon and reinforce existing habits including buying fuel and shopping.

3. Overall, there is understanding of the harmful effects of plastic pollution, including
in the TroTro diaries Online conversation, where respondents made the link
between gutters choked with plastic and flooding in some of Ghana’s big cities.
However, while there is awareness, individuals continue to make choices which
exacerbate the very problem they recognize, including by overusing plastic bags
and casual littering. This suggests that raising awareness is not enough on its own.
Instead, as the experiments show, the use of carefully designed communication,
incorporating behavioural approaches, can be used to trigger behavioural change.
The archetypes developed for this experiment including Eco-conscious Kofi and
Ama and No-Chance Omar could be further developed and modified to support
efforts to achieve behavioural change.

4. Enabling Maybe Mansa to become Eco-Conscious Ama is great but enabling No-
Chance Omar to become Just-Passing is also significant. Recognizing incremental
behavioural change should be a key part of awareness raising, as idealized levels
of eco-consciousness often portrayed in advocacy can appear unattainable. There
is scope to expand this behavioural approach across more sites, and to modify
messages in line with local priorities.

5. Among the active segregators and recyclers (the Eco-conscious Kofis and Amas)
there is interest in making things from segregated material, and not only plastic.
There are opportunities for the private sector to decentralize capacity to process
plastic and other materials, for example using mobile shredders, which could then
enable individuals to take up entrepreneurial activities and begin trading and
creating jobs locally.

6. With rapid growth in post-consumer plastic, it is also necessary to develop uses for

plastic-waste at scale, including through sustainable construction.

7. To achieve true behavioural change, these messages must also be customised
for children and youth, including through products such as this UNDP Accelerator
Lab (Ghana) animation, so that environmental awareness is developed at an early
age, enabling the younger generation to play a key role in achieving the change
we want to see.
