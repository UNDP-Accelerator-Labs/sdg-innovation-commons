The project "Malteria" seeks to provide a solution to the problem caused by the massive consumption of disposables in informal food stalls by proposing the replacement of two essential elements in this food sale, a plate for solid food and a bag, both made with biomaterials using as principal material the same waste produced by this sector prevails, such as the corn husks of the tamales, which are also biodegradable.

This project is a collaboration of Taina Campos with Cointya Oviedo.
