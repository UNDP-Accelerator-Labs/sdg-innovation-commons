HIRING OF SCAFFOLDING MATERIALS

> Brief description of the innovation

A scaffold is a support structure created to help wok men in the construction, maintenance or repair of buildings, bridges and other man made structures. They can also be used to create a platform for product exhibition and musical concert platforms. My goal is to find potential clients to hire the scaffolds as a way of generating income.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income will be generated by getting potential clients to hire the scaffolds. I'll offer reasonable rates to satisfy both myself and the client.

> Technical Feasibility

I have already created a poster/flyer soft copy to use for advertising purposes publicly and on the streets to capture the attention of the people passing by. I also intend to seek aid from the government as I require assistance in finding prospective clients.

> Anticipated Social Impact

I will be able to create work opportunities to scaffolders who basically are the people who are highly skilled in the erecting and dismantling of scaffolds.
