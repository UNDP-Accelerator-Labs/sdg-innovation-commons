> Brief description of the innovation

Poach Talent is an online platform that gives recruitment agencies, government institutions, and the private sector an online presence to list jobs and tenders and receive in-app job applications and bids to their respective accounts on the platform.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Companies will list jobs and tenders on the platform. To list, a company will subscribe to a recurring subscription or a one-time off payment for a specific listing on the platform. Having this platform will help save companies from spending a lot of money and time on job listing websites as it will provide you with a bank of previous applicants who might have similar qualifications to the job you're advertising. Winning the challenge prize will help meet all the technical aspects of having the platform on the web.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is a web application. The web app will provide you with a dashboard that allows companies to list jobs and bids, view jobs and bids, view applicants, and also assign roles to certain people in the company to view the applicant's list and bids so as to allow transparency in the hiring process.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My platform will;
Help companies have a sense of visibility and effectiveness in the hiring process.
Besides listing, companies will be able to view profiles of people seeking employment.
Reduce the time and cost to find a suitable candidate 
Provide companies with a larger database of prospective employees.
