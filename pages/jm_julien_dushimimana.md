> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

JM JULIEN DUSHIMIMANA

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

By email; juliendushime49@gmail.com

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

YES, He is part of Grid Incubation Innovation Hub in University of Rwanda.

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Electrical energy from utility (grid) in Rwanda is expensive and not enough. People do not believe in solar energy technology due to its intermittence. This solution is to connect solar energy to utility using a device called 'RIGHT LAMP AUTOMATIC CHANGEOVER SWITCH'. The solar energy use is the priority source of energy. From this, electrical energy use will be enough as users are to generate their own electricity. The PV-Grid system reduces electricity price between 80% to 100% and Rwandans will be able to cook using electricity which is the strongest solution to environment degradation.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- IP protected

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

50,000 FRW/KW equivalent to 52$

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Advance order has to be given

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

The YouTube video below captures the end user feedback. 

> Please upload a link of end-user feedback


> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

The system saves between 80% and 100% of electricity price. During the innovator's thesis, he used the prototype on one electrical shop as a sample. The results revealed that 97.5% of energy from solar was used meaning that the energy tariff reduced by 97.5% in that shop.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

Capital to make it a product ready for the market.
