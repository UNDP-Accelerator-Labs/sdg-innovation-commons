Educating our children for mind change and innovation from baby to grade seven

> Brief description of the innovation

Jopepa christian school is a community based school centrally located right at middle of the compounds in Lusaka, we currently in operation for one year and have about 120 learners drawn from the same compounds where we operate from. We are on our own land and work under very difficult conditions or challenges such as lack of running water, lack of proper sanitation, financial challenges to modernize the school etc. We have a 1x6 unfinished classroom block and 6 teachers, a male and 5 female.

This innovation will create income through school fees that will be paid by the able learners and this goes towards payment for teachers and everyday running of the school. The extra income or profit will be served for the expansion of the school to accommodate more learners in communities where we are you. Our target market are our local community members for there's no public schools. Our go is to provide affordable quality education to both the have and the have nots children in our communities.

Phase 1 of our innovation is to finish the baby to primary school section which takes us whole of this year and phase 2 of our innovation is to put up the secondary section from junior secondary school to senior secondary school and the last phase is the tertiary level to accommodate the the skills training for our learners and of that of the community where we operate from.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation will create jobs first for graduate teachers and the support staff who work at our school, skills that we will give graduates will later translate into job creation for members of the community where we are.
