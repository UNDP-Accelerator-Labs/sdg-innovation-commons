## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Adoption of Clean Cooking Technology 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that nearly 96% of households in Malawi rely on illegally and unsustainably sourced biomass (charcoal and firewood) for domestic cooking and heating energy with rapidly growing cities of which 80% of the population uses charcoal and is  resulting in high levels of deforestation and forest degradation throughout the country

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Malawi is one of the least electrified countries globally currently at 11% overall, with 42% of the urban and only 4% of the rural population connected to electricity . The country generates 439 megawatts of installed electricity capacity which is not enough to meet the country’s demand for electricity.  The urban clean cooking sector in Malawi is at a nascent stage and trendlines point to an improved willingness to adopt new technologies to meet cooking demand in the future. This is likely due to the increasing cost of status quo cooking approaches (e.g. using illegal, unsustainably produced charcoal on an inefficient stove). However, the main question is: When will Malawi reach the tipping point that results in widespread adoption of improved cooking technologies? At the moment, there is an unprecedented opportunity in Malawi to scale up cleaner cooking. According to the Government of Malawi, the most relevant challenges to the Malawian energy sector are “…dependency on biomass from unsustainable sources; … reliance on end-use devices with low energy efficiency; … adverse impacts of the urban household energy mix on the environment and on health and safety” (Malawi Energy Policy, 2003).

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

1.    The lab is the space with the suitable skill-set and purpose to research and learn quickly on activities / nudges that can lead to behavior change and have communities adopt clean cooking technology 2.    The lab will use various research techniques that the external partners like Tetra  tech and internal undp projects can get insights for their project implementation 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Why are households in urban Malawi not adopting LPGs and green energy for cooking? UNDPMalawi #AcceleratorLab is exploring if access to small gas cylinders and charcoal alternatives can increase uptake of clean cooking energy fuels

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

To understand if  access to small gas cylinders and alternatives to charcoal can encourage adoption of clean fuels and technology for cooking in urban areas

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioral Insights - to understand the key barriers of adoption of  clean cooking technology  Collective Intelligence - To collect data on energy outputs and usage of various products  Ethnography -  conduct a study that should inform pain points experienced by users of various energy sources  Solutions Mapping - understand other alternative cooking solutions 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Scientific Research - An understanding of energy outputs coming out of  the products User Journeys- understanding of the pain points of the user  Tracking Data - track the continuous usage  of products  Participatory Observation- observe how the users are interacting with the products 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

There is a running project funded by USAID and FCDO who will use the insights in their project implementation  UNDP CO has a project related to the same which will also use the insights in the implementation.
