> Title of the innovation

Education Diversity Inclusion of Technology, Entrepreneurship, Sports, Arts and Music Initiative

> Brief description of the innovation

The current education system in Zambia is biased as it is focused on educating students in line with them eventually seeking formal employment.
This puts a strain on the government as it cannot be able to absorb all the graduates produced each year.
I believe different people have different abilities that they easily come to them, for instance natural talent in sports, music, arts entrepreneurship, technology.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It is my understanding that if the government creates an education system that allows learners to nature each ones relative talent as early as the 3rd grade, this will allow more job creation in entrepreneurship, sports, art, technology, and music. and furthermore bring revenue to the country as many of the Zambians will be able to compete at an international level in the above mentioned categories.

> Technical Feasibility

Basically the first step would be to overhaul the entire primary and secondary education system as it is obsolete.
From as early as grade 3 the syllabus will need to have options for each student to chose from, one sport, one art but entrepreneurship and technology should be compulsory upto secondary as to ensure learners always have an eye for entrepreneurship regardless of where they end up.
This will allow for learners to identify thier gifts at a young age so as to polish them up.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This initiative will eventually create more jobs and allow individuals to find thier comfort zones and be able to compete where they have the capacity to, as we are aware some are able to reach great heights on the football pitch but may fall behind in academics. So this will have a positive social impact as people will feel included and considered
