> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The invention, "Metrica," is a smart system that connects to both electricity and gas meters via special sensor modules and sends the received data to a central, two-piece display, wall device that is also linked to a mobile application. As a result, customers can see how much money they have spent, both on electricity and gas in total, directly on the screen hanging on the wall (or in your mobile phone) at any time. Instead of complex parameters, information displayed is GEL and tells the following: 1. how much the consumer has already spent on electricity and natural gas consumption,  2 Spending rate (GEL per hour) and the most important, 3. if customer continues to spend at the given rate, what is the total expected amount to be paid at the end of the month. Expected savings from using the system in practice is about 15%. The installation of the system is very easy.
