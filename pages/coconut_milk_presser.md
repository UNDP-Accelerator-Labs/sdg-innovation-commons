> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

Deviating the traditional or "Mano-mano" grinding of coconut meat, locally termed as "kagud". Proceeding to the "Mano-mano" extraction of "Gata"- this improvised presser/coco milk extractor has taken innovations to a higher level.

The extractor was made from an improvised Hydraulic jack, with a metal plate that squeezes out the juice from the coco meat.

To level up the grinding service, the coco milk flows down the plate through a seive on top of a plastic container. Thus, Gata has become readily available to consumers in a matter of 5 minutes, way faster than the usual- ingenuity at its finest
