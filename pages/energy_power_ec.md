> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

" Energy Power EC seeks to break the usual way of obtaining clean energy, transforming any type of movement into electrical energy. So today, the idea of ​​creating a country based on clean energy is no longer a dream. The main mechanism consists of a Motion-Cell that creates electrical energy, and this energy is stored in a Power-Box. Finally, it is distributed inside houses, parks or public spaces, only using a mobile application."
