Description: It is a portable pasteurization device that combines solar and thermal energy. It consists of a 5-liter polythene bag with a clear plastic bubble lining on the front and black plastic on the back.

It is placed under direct sunlight, where pasteurization is achieved thanks to the incidence of solar rays on the black layer. AquaPak has an indicator on the cap that warns the user that the treatment is finished.  

Interesting feature: It uses solar energy to operate.
