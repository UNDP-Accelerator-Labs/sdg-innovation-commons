## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

  1.      The value of prototyping from solutions mapping from a very human oriented design process, along with local authorities and citizens, through the “Chispudos con los Residuos Waste Pilot Project” has allowed to build a sense of belonging with the problem (challenge) as well as the solutions they are taking part of. 1.a. Of the 3 prototypes co-created and tested, the most successful has been the sticky label, and listening to the neighbors, as well as the collectors, the Acc Lab is improving the prototype together with the Municipality, to consider replicating it in other areas as well and making it easily accessible and use.   2.      The value of prototyping with public institutions supported by the Lab is 2.a. The reduction of costs and learning costs on solutions adapted and tailored to the needs of the local governments and citizens according to their socioeconomical context. 2.b. The reduction of time involved in learning curves by the counterparts on what works, what could be improved and what doesn’t work. 2.c. The reduction of the political cost of testing innovation mechanisms in which the prototypes costs have been assumed by the Lab and overcoming limitations of public budgets in innovation.   3.      The most effective ways to build trust with stakeholders and run a successful pilot project are: 3.a. Build an action plan with stakeholders 3.b. Run pre-testing sessions with local authorities (institutions) on solutions identified to adapt them – tailor them into the local needs considering economic access, education, urban context, and cultural considerations. 3.c.  Design customized guidelines for a) waste collection business owners; b) waste collection workers including those in informality; c) citizens; d) local authorities, on how to run the testing process. 3.d. Share with all counterparts the prototyping goals, testing processes, tools, and communication channels to support citizens and waste collectors during the process. 3.e. Have open channels of communication with participants in particular citizens, allows to clarify questions on the mechanisms of waste classification. The best vehicle to keep a fluid communication during the process has been the WhatsApp groups, although we understood that residents prefer to only use the WhatsApp group corresponding to their neighborhood and not the shared group for the 3 neighborhoods participating.   4.      The most effective ways to collect insights is 4.a. Through group and individual interviews, after the exercise we have collected the various suggestions that included: a.       Deepen pragmatic environmental education, make visible and raise awareness of the impacts of poor waste management b.      How our waste is connected to water bodies c.       Continuing reinforcing the mechanisms of responsibility in the management of waste in each one of the generators. 4.b. Instead of relying on printed or digital surveys, neighbors and waste collection workers rather join the focus groups as a safe space to share their insights, suggestions, troubles, or any other concerns around the exercise. All the main insights were received through customized sessions per each neighborhood. Even though we had Google Forms and printed forms to register all the process and learnings on the user experience, it was not the same as when we reached each citizen, holding a person-to-person conversation too.   5.      There are many prejudices and myths from government and local authorities, that most of citizens have no interest in environmental issues. We’ve overcome these myths through participatory and in person-to-person approach with neighbors, taking the time to explain the multi-dimensions of waste mismanagement, the relevance to get involved and why their actions could prove that we could achieve as community and city a better waste management. From this experience we not only learned that citizens runed successfully and creatively this pilot project, but they we’re seeking for more action afterwards:   5.1. Consider pragmatic environmental education, make visible and raise awareness of the impacts of poor waste management. 5.2. Explain to other citizens – communities how our waste is connected to water bodies, particularly with the Ocean, considering the current pollution to the Atlantic coast. 5.3. Continuing reinforcing the mechanisms of responsibility in the management of waste in each one of the generators. 5.4. Expand the program to other citizens, communities and city-wide.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1.      It is easier to work with local authorities and neighbors on the field, than with central government authorities from the headquarters. Although we invited the ministerial officers, they didn’t participate during this phase, because alternative ways of classification were promoted instead of the plastic bag set on the national regulation, considering that each municipality has the autonomy to set their own mechanism.  2.      The biggest barrier is to consider that one solution fits all municipalities, and with this pilot project, we’ve proven we need to adapt solutions to the local context and conditions. 3.      Costs on solutions is the largest consideration for local authorities and citizens to implement waste classification. No one is willing to pay more and from municipality if they implement what that would translate in their budget and political costs. 4.      The solution chosen was well received by the municipal authorities, however timing to coordinate with financial team to expand the solution, plus the political timing have been the two main reasons why escalating is pending. 5.      We also learned that classifying waste for those households in open neighborhoods might be a demotivating factor for the waste collector in particular the informal ones, due that their earnings depend on the amount of recyclables they get to collect and sell, however in open neighborhoods, other people including homeless take away the recyclable material, leaving only the organic (not valuable waste for them).

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

a)      User journeys (journals), user experience and surveys: the available data on domiciliary waste generators is scarce. We have learned about the general waste characterization for the city, however, isn’t segregated by communities consider the socioeconomic backgrounds. Is not accurate to generalize waste production patterns from residential sector, considering the city is quite complex with almost 2 million people and 3 million in the metropolitan area.   b)      Ethnography and in-depth interviews: from the beginning we understood ethnography was keyway to understand better the local authorities and their needs, the way the waste collection trucks operate and the most important, what citizens in the three neighborhoods chosen, felt towards the environment in general, waste management and their own practices at home. Through in-depth elements with these stakeholders during filed research, we tailored the solutions and the means to learn from the prototype testing phase. As mentioned before, there are many myths and misconceptions on citizens openness to classify waste before delivering to waste collectors, and we found the majority if not 100% is willing to get involved in best practices for waste management.   c)      Waste collectors’ collective intelligence and focus groups: Before, during and after testing, the insights provided by the waste collectors, and their field and operative experience was valuable to adapt the solutions, complement with other mechanisms, run tests and iterate according to results. We learned that the need for social – audit for waste collections for all households is key for them as business but also to reduce illegal pollution.  We also learned why they aren’t keen to waste classification in open neighborhoods, even though that would ease their job of sorting mixed waste; as they said, some unemployed people and homeless pick the bags of recyclable material taking away the material from waste collectors they sell as daily earning. Waste collectors also have the strongest and direct relationship with households, not even local authorities as we may think. They know their consuming patterns and what to expect from waste according to the residential area or sector within the city. Considering this, we could leverage this relationship to implement better practices for waste classification for households. Focus groups with waste collectors and the citizens involved in this pilot project were helpful to have a closer and trustful approach to citizens and learn about their opinions on municipal approach to environmental issues, their dreams, fears and why they are willing to keep going with waste classification and their desire to expand city-wide. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

This project was aimed for citizen’s participation on waste classification. Therefore, behavioral insights documented from regular patterns on waste delivery to collection service was the baseline to adapt solutions. Through a thoughtful process of different field visits with stakeholders, we were able to run ethnographic approach.   During the testing phase of 3 MVP’s delivered in citizen kits, evaluation was important to learn what was easier and wasn’t for residents to keep classifying waste. Same situation applied to waste collection workers, understanding regular behavior (before intervention) patterns and behaviors when using and applying solutions from households.   Prototypes (MVP’s) were result of a first co-creative phase with local authorities and citizens, however iteration and results delivered to Municipal authorities was product of collective intelligence applied in practice from all stakeholders during the whole pilot from early design stage to final presentation to scale solutions city-wide.  
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

 Neighborhood Council of Colonia Jardines de la Asunción – Arco 5-6, in zone 5, Guatemala City, and 30 families from the neighborhood.   Neighborhood Council of Colonia Vivibien, in zone 5, Guatemala City, and 40 families from the neighborhood.   Neighborhood Council of Colonia 20 de Octubre, in zone 5, Guatemala City, and 30 families from the neighborhood.    Even though families participated, the most enthusiastic and keen to participate in every stage and detail of the process were women, and most of them were adults in their 50’s or 60’s.  It has been rewarding to learn how neighbors, mostly adults, consider this experience as the beginning of a transformation from their communities, hoping that more neighbors join in. They have shared the initiative with other relatives, friends, other neighbors and even with their workplaces too.  

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not during this tactical intervention. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

1.      Waste collection – truck owners (Yellow Trucks – SME’s)   2.      Waste collection workers under payroll   3.      Waste collection workers under informality     We learned that the need for social – audit for waste collections for all households is key for them as business but also to reduce illegal pollution.  We also learned why they aren’t keen to waste classification in open neighborhoods, even though that would ease their job of sorting mixed waste; as they said, some unemployed people and homeless pick the bags of recyclable material taking away the material from waste collectors they sell their daily income.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

a.      Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN)Department for Solid Waste Management, DIMARDS, reviewing for official publishing on the “Environmental Guide from Citizens to Citizens” as product of knowledge from collected best practices and solutions from citizens to waste classification.   b.      Municipality of Guatemala, including the Municipal Council, Operations, and the Departments of Waste Management, Environment, in particular the Auxiliary Municipal Office of Zone 05 in conducting participatory processes and implementation on prioritized actions from the Transition Plan. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Elder women households and waste collectors within informality:  It was notorious to recognize that many of the neighbors gather inorganic waste to be delivered once a week, while the organic ones were handed to collectors during the 3 days a week. Inorganic waste presents a greater volume, than the organic ones, although organic might occupy less volume, is larger in weight.   Learning from the income opportunities waste collectors have on inorganic- recyclable material, we ask ourselves if the new methodologies for waste characterization is needed, due that the numbers traditional characterizations present a 50% of organic, while we are confirming at the field and through waste collectors, the amount of organic is reducing in comparison to inorganic with recyclable ones.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNDP CO, before the open – public tactical implementation, from Solutions Mapping we conducted a previous exercise within our staff to try out the 3 solutions delivering kits to all participants and collecting their user-experience when using solutions. We were happy to learn that many people are classifying their waste for recycling, and even though we had a 40% of interest, just a 20% committed to the whole process, sharing their experience as well as practical suggestions to other staff members to motivate them to join this process. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

This tactical intervention allowed us to learn more about the citizens behaviors (majority were women households), their concerns and what their aspirations in environmental in urban neighborhoods. In the other part, the insights from waste collection operators, was key to conduct the tactical trials more accurately identifying other needs such as the social – audit to acquire (pay) for waste collection services, today provided by private (within informality) sector.  All the insights generated from this social process were compiled in a document we’ve called “Guía Ambiental de Ciudadanos para Ciudadanos” which is translated “Environmental Guide from Citizens to Citizens” to share the knowledge from all the engaged women citizens who participated in the process of finding the best solutions to fit for average neighborhoods in Guatemala City.  We took the time to present it to the Ministry of Environment which has been keen to use it for pedagogic purposes on training teachers, environmental managers, technicians, and other local authorities on best practices towards waste usage. From their reviews, we invested efforts in the illustration of this guide considering the usage of a very amicable language, useful to citizens in urban and rural areas, that are well known for having low interest in reading documents.  The Environmental Guide from Citizens to Citizens is now ready to be printed and programed it’s launch with the Ministry of Environment as product of knowledge and as part of a waste management toolkit to be launched too with the Accelerator Lab.
