This solution was designed as part of a business continuity strategy for the informal sector during the period of lockdowns in Eswatini. When the lock down started, most informal sector activities were closed down. This particularly affected women who were engaged in the sale of second hand clothing.  It was aimed at providing them with e-commerce opportunities that would allow them to continue trading online even during these lock downs.
