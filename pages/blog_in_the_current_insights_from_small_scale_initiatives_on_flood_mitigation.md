Executive
Summary

In a nation prone to tsunamis and
heavy monsoon rains, flooding
has emerged as one of Indonesia's
complex challenges. This situation
has escalated significantly in
recent years, particularly with
increasing urbanization.

Given the substantial social and economic
impact of floods, there is a need for
interventions to effectively support efforts
to increase flood resilience in Indonesia.
Traditional flood risk management
approaches have primarily focused
on built infrastructure, but may often
overlook the social dimension of floods.

To investigate the social aspects and impact
of floods and water ecology in Indonesia, the
UNDP Accelerator Lab Indonesia embarked
on a series of community-level study. The
study is twofold; it consists of ethnographic
research across seven selected Indonesian
urban areas and digitalization of lake
mapping in Jabodetabekpunjur area.

Ethnographic Research Across Seven
Indonesian Cities Based on the existing 2020-
2024 National Medium-Term Development
Plan and referring to the formulation of
the National Urban Flood Resilience Plan
under the Ministry of National Development
Planning (Bappenas)1, the Accelerator Lab
conducted a research project to provide
input to the work of the Water Resources
and Irrigation Directorate of the National
Planning and Development Agency (DIPI
Bappenas) , particularly in regards to building
community resilience against floods and
water disasters. The project took place in
seven selected Indonesian urban areas
with a history of frequent floods, with data

collections incorporating quantitative data
through public surveys, as well as qualitative
data gathered through lean ethnography,
specifically immersion.

The research finds that the land use
change, citizens’ behavior relating to waste
management and community dynamics and
geographical features contribute to issues
surrounding floods. At the same time, it
also notes the value of integrating local
perspectives into formal policies to flood
mitigation. Local grassroots innovations exist
in these urban areas; some serve as short-
term coping mechanisms while others build
long-term resilience in these communities.
These innovation range from Islamic prayer
mats processed through textile waste to a
boat made of bamboo and jerrycans as well
as nature-based breakwater to anticipate
water-related disasters. Others relate more
to social systems: how communities develop
capacity and internal support system to cope
with the effects of flood. Lake Mapping and

No. 3 of 2022 concerning Organization and Work Procedures of the Ministry of National Development Planning/Bappenas stipulates the

creation of Directorate of Water Resources in the agency.

The Accelerator Lab also forged an unconventional
partnership with the Project Management Office (PMO) of
the Jabodetabekpunjur (Jakarta-Bogor-Depok-Tangerang-
Bekasi-Puncak-Cianjur) area, operating under the Ministry of
Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning/National Land Agency
(ATR/BPN). This collaboration investigated the potential
of utilizing natural and artificial lakes for flood mitigation
purposes. The team conducted digital mapping of more than
200 artificial and natural lakes, with a specific focus on the
Greater Jakarta area, in two phases.

The first phase involved a partnership with OpenStreetMap
(OSM) Indonesia to conduct surveys of 170 lakes and
interviews with local residents and lake keepers. The second
phase entailed an open call to the general public, inviting
them to map 52 additional lakes. The assessments revealed
that a majority of the lakes are in good physical condition,
with some receiving regular maintenance. However, while
occurrences of water overflow incidents are relatively
infrequent, 23 percent of the lakes mapped still encounter
this issue. There is still a lack of prioritization in harnessing
the lakes' potential for flood mitigation and an area for
improvement in terms of community-level governance.
Finally, change in land ownership has implication in the ways
in which lakes can be managed.

In conclusion, this publication calls for future policies to
adopt an integrated, transdisciplinary approach, which
takes into account not only experts’ view but also the voices,
lived experiences, knowledge, and even innovations from
grassroots communities in addressing systemic development
challenges, such as flood and other water-related disasters.

Introduction

1.1
Background

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
Accelerator Labs, in collaboration with the Federal Ministry
for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany
and the Qatar Fund for Development as founding investors,
serves as the world’s largest and fastest learning network
on sustainable development challenges. With support
from UNDP core donors, the Network spans 115 countries,
harnessing local innovations to generate actionable insights,
test solutions, and envision sustainable development for the
21st century.

In March 2021, the UNDP Accelerator Lab was launched in
Indonesia, aiming to expedite collective action in constructing
resilient systems to address development challenges through
grassroots solutions, innovative partnerships, and heightened
awareness of social innovation.

As part of our initial endeavors, we delve into the intricate
relationship between ecological crises and inequality in
urban environments, with a specific focus on water-related
issues such as flooding. Recognizing that water ecology
profoundly impacts everyone in Indonesia, the world's
largest archipelagic country, we acknowledge the intricate
connections individuals have with the water geography
around them, whether in coastal towns or highland villages.
While many benefit from these water bodies, supporting
activities like fishing and river crossing, it is essential to

recognize the potential for these elements to turn into
sources of catastrophe. In a nation prone to tsunamis and
heavy monsoon rains, flooding has emerged as one of
Indonesia's complex challenges. The situation has escalated
significantly in recent years, with a stark increase in recorded
flooding instances—from 86 in 2002 to a staggering 1,531 in
20202 , equivalent to approximately one flood every 8 hours.
Given the substantial impact on human activity and economic
assets, a crucial question arises: How can interventions
effectively support the development of a resilient society?

Traditional flood risk management has primarily focused
on built infrastructure, relying on structures like dams
and levees. However, these approaches often overlook the
social dimension of floods. To achieve sustainable change,
a holistic approach is necessary, considering the broader
context, including the history and the relationship that local
communities have with the water bodies. By understanding
the unique complexities of each area, flood management
can be approached in a manner that is both effective and
sensitive to the needs of the people and the environment.
The 2020 Human Development Report3 signals significant
inequality, with the HDI value falling to 0.583 when
discounted for inequality. The Gender Inequality Index (GII)
value of 0.453 in 2017 underscores the need for addressing
inequality in the development agenda. The government's
mid-term development plan (RPJMN) emphasizes urban
development, but the current crisis requires significant
investments in post-crisis socio-economic recovery.Indonesia,
with over 270 million people, faces natural disasters and
multiple hazards, with approximately 56.7 percent residing
in 98 cities by 2020, according to the Central Statistics
Bureau (BPS)4. Rapid urbanization, the fastest in Asia,
poses challenges, as economic growth lags behind due to
congestion, pollution, and climate-related risks. The recent

COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates these issues,
impacting urban areas, where over 80 percent
of positive COVID-19 cases occur. Lockdown
policies lead to significant unemployment and
income loss, particularly affecting MSMEs,
which constitute over 90 percent of the
country's economic fabric.

Urbanization in Indonesia has been a persistent
issue since the 19th century, driven by various
factors. While other countries experience
economic growth with urbanization, Indonesia
faces challenges, gaining only 4 percent GDP
growth for every 1 percent of urbanization
due to the congestion, pollution, and
climate-related disaster risks resulting from
insufficient infrastructure investment. Only 48
percent of households now have access to safe
water, compared to 50% more than a decade
ago. Sewerage coverage exists in only 11 of the
country’s 98 cities. Only 2% of city residents
have access to centralized sanitation systems.

In response to the current conditions and the
pandemic, the Accelerator Lab could play a
crucial role in addressing urbanization's impact
on communities. Focusing on sustainable
development solutions, economic growth,
and urban resilience, the Lab could explore
digitalization in governance, accelerate
entrepreneurship, and promote green and

resilient urban infrastructure to build a
better, more sustainable future.

Through immersive research methods,
the Accelerator Lab can gain a profound
understanding of communities’ journeys,
motivations, and key drivers, as well as the
current conditions and gaps in urban living.
Leveraging unconventional data sources,
such as satellite imagery and employment
data, could illuminate migration flows
and patterns across regions. The Lab can
facilitate foresight discussions and co-
creation sessions with stakeholders to
identify solutions and potential pathways—
ranging from regulatory frameworks to
technical guidelines—to address the rapid
urbanization challenge. Pre-identified
solutions can then undergo experimentation
to prioritize those with the highest
indications of success. Ultimately, the
Accelerator Lab aims to forge innovative
partnerships that scale up proven solutions
and contribute to ecologically sound
and socially just outcomes, fostering a
space for humanity to thrive. The Lab can
make a significant impact concentrating
on development solutions that prioritize
sustainability, contribute to economic
growth, and enhance the quality of life and
urban resilience.

Background

The project commenced with referring to
the formulation of the National Urban Flood
Resilience Plan under the Ministry of National
Development Planning. To grasp the intricacies
involved, we employed collective intelligence,
conducted ethnographic research involving
immersion, deployed public surveys, and
crafted solutions maps.

There is an opportunity to build upon this initiative to
ensure that the policy and programmatic intervention
takes into account lived experiences from citizens that
are affected by floods, particularly that of marginalised
groups. In our pursuit to delve into the intricate relationship
between water-related disasters and urban resilience,
we joined forces with the Directorate of Water Resources
and Irrigation, Ministry of National Development Planning
(DIPI Bappenas) to scrutinise the current state of affairs.
The government posed crucial questions about the
effectiveness of their interventions to date, seeking to
comprehend the relevance of their built infrastructure
in flood mitigation concerning the actual needs of
communities.

This illustrates how disaster resilience is a pivotal
focus within the Government's National Medium Term
Development Plan 2020-2024 (RPJMN 2020-2024)5. In
particular, there is a strategic framework for basic service
infrastructure, which incorporates disaster resilience
infrastructure across 29 provinces.

Comprehensive data on flood management plans spanning
30 cities, coupled with information on master plans for
drainage, hydrological and hydraulic modelling, and the
current state of drainage systems, is readily available.
Notably, 50 cities across 24 provinces were identified as
having a high flood risk.

These cities form the focal points for the implementation of
disaster resilience plans, emphasising a targeted approach
to address vulnerabilities and enhance preparedness.

Review of existing policy papers at the time revealed the
government’s primary focus on infrastructure disaster
resilience. This encompasses several elements, such as
disaster risk map and master plan to increase regional
resilience to disasters; flood prevention infrastructure
(strengthening cliffs, river embankments, flood control
and check dams); coastal area disaster resilience
infrastructure (coastal safety development); restoration
and conservation of natural infrastructure (normalised
lakes, rivers); flood Forecasting and Warning System
(FFWS) development; and multipurpose dam, natural
storage and irrigation rehabilitation. In pursuit of these,
data measurement focuses on the percentage increase in
the number of flood victims

While important, such focus overlooks flood disaster
victims' perspectives on built infrastructure, aspirations
for appropriate interventions, as well as local solutions
that already exist in the community as socio-cultural
input for inclusive and long-term resilience. Indeed, DIPI
Bappenas was keen to understand the specific needs of
vulnerable communities (including people with disabilities,
women, children, and the elderly), the correlation between
climate change and flood patterns, and the potential
adoption of government interventions by the community.

Therefore, the Accelerator Lab team, with support of DIPI
Bappenas, set out to delve deeper into the perspectives
of flood victims regarding built infrastructure, their
expectations for appropriate interventions, and the local
solutions already present within communities. These
investigations are designed to provide insights for the
development of inclusive and sustainable resilience
strategies.

Project Design & Methodology

Following the preliminary analysis (of secondary data/

design, aiming to incorporate both quantitative data, obtained
through a public survey, and qualitative data, gathered
through lean ethnography, to establish a robust foundation
for the government partner. While the survey is directed at
a broad public audience, the ethnography process has been
deliberately structured to encompass diverse topographical
landscapes (such as coastal areas and urban plains) and
various sources of flooding (including coastal/rob floods,
banjir luapan or flooding that occurs when river discharge
overflows beyond its normal limits and, banjir kiriman or
flooding caused by upstream heavy rain, etc.).

2.3.2
Immerssion
Process

In policymaking, governments often rely on data prepared
by other government bodies or organisations using a top-
down approach. However, relying solely on hard data does
not provide the complete narrative. At the grassroots level,
numerous perspectives and accounts are overlooked by
traditional methods. There arises a necessity to delve
into affected communities to comprehend their lived
experiences and contextual perspectives.

Ethnographic approaches prove invaluable in bridging this
gap. They offer insights that may escape traditional data
collection methods, enabling decisions that align with the
actual needs of the communities policymakers serve.
Immersion, a form of rapid ethnography, constituted a
significant portion of our research process. In this method,
researchers directly visited the studied communities,
engaging in casual conversations and participating in
local activities. The aim was to comprehend the locals'
perspectives from an emic standpoint, providing an internal
understanding rather than an external one.

The choice of immersion methods was deliberate, aiming
to capture firsthand perspectives and experiences of local
communities, especially concerning water ecology and
the impact of flooding. To ensure effective application,
we conducted a workshop on May 24, 2021, to deepen
local organisations' understanding of immersion methods
and prepare them for engaging empathetically with the
communities.

Findings

Following a series of field explorations, we worked with
relevant partners across seven cities to collect initial
findings that enhance our understanding of the context
within communities. Despite the brief nature of the
ethnography process, we successfully gathered rich
insights across these seven cities, reflecting the diverse
perspectives of the local communities.

3.1
Mapping of
Common Issue

Field visits to communities reveal flood as a
systemic challenge, resulting from an interplay
between various factors, including environmental
and socio-economic factors. Communities are
generally well-aware of the factors contributing to
floods in their regions.

In Jakarta, floods result from multiple causes, including water
overflow from Krukut River, banjir kiriman (flooding caused
by upstream heavy rain) from Manggarai watergate, intense
rainfall, disconnected water channels, the descending
contour of the Bendungan Hilir Street area, silting, blockage
of drainage due to waste, and unregulated construction at
the street's end without clear AMDAL-Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA). Similarly, in Banjarmasin, flooding occurs
due to water overflow from Riam Kanan Lake and Martapura
River, coupled with city drainage blockage.

In the recent flood, it
took a long time for
the water to recede
because there is no
channel or route for it
to flow. There is almost
no drainage in the area
where I live, so the
water does not move.

“

This area is affected by
floods because of water
flows from two directions,
namely the Martapura
river and the Riam Kanan
reservoir. The reservoir’s
floodgates were opened,
channeling water towards
our village.

In Surabaya, several identified flood types according to
communities include banjir limpahan/air lewat (passing
water) and banjir luapan (flood that occurs when river
discharge overflows beyond its normal limits). Again, in
these contexts, causes range from natural factors (village
topography, excessive rainfall) to infrastructure issues (e.g.,
limited ditch capacity, inadequate waterways for village
overflow), and human behavior (e.g., waste, garbage, and
debris obstructing canals).

3.1.1
The Role of the
Land Use Change

Given that each of the targeted cities has a unique
geographical background, it is also true that the citizens of
each area have developed a distinctive relationship toward
flooding. Throughout this process, the team observed how the
circumstances of flooding are inextricably linked to historical
perspectives and land use change.

Looking back, the history of a land may contain answers as
to why it experiences floods in the way that it currently does.
A few insights to note from our preliminary analysis are that
previous water locations and historical land use changes are
indicators of flood-prone areas.

This insight emerged when we explored the stories behind
flooding in Semarang, Central Java. One of the research
sites, Tambakharjo, used to be a village of farmers where,
in the 1970s, tambak (fish ponds) and sawah tadah hujan
(rainfed rice fields) were still prevalent. The expansion of the
settlement area aligned with the population increase in the
village, resulting in the shrinking of tambak and sawah tadah
hujan areas. Additionally, PT Graha Padma, a private company,
developed a housing area, Perumahan Graha Padma, covering
347 hectares. Based on the data collected, it is now rare
to find tambak and sawah tadah hujan amidst the dense
habitation, causing the area to lack sufficient catchment area
and waterways.

In another case in Cirebon, Kesunean demonstrated the
connection between landscape change and flooding.
Kesunenan, one of the most densely populated areas on
the seafront of Cirebon, is flanked by two large rivers. Local
elders mentioned that in the 1970s, the sea's condition near
Kesunean was 268 meters more than the current coast,
representing a 268-meter increase towards the sea over the
last 50 years.

The phenomenon of hoarded land (tanah timbun) partly
became the main cause, as there has been an increasing
demand for affordable housing, even without clear legality.
Residents' waste does not end up in landfills (TPA) but goes to
the beach as materials for stockpiling new land. The existence
of this landfill has affected the city's administrative area,
estimated to have increased by approximately 75 hectares
spread over four sub-districts.

River functions:
from dynamic to
static

Throughout history, bodies of water have been crucial for
the survival and development of communities. Rivers, in
particular, served as logistics routes, sources of fresh water,
and the foundation for irrigation and sanitation facilities.
Although they played diverse roles, modern infrastructural
development has offered communities alternatives to
meet these same needs. Consequently, the dependence of
communities on rivers diminished, allowing cities and towns
to evolve independently from them.

“

Back in 2002, this area
used to be covered with
rice fields. During that
period, I earned quite
a lot as many people
came to fish in the rice
fields and ponds and
shopped at my stall.
However, starting
about 10 years ago,
as more houses were
built, my sales turnover
started to drop. More
people have resided
here but they mostly
stayed home.

awareness regarding disaster resilience, particularly in relation to floods.

Rivers have played a significant historical role in Banjarmasin,
situated at the confluence of the Martapura River and the
larger Barito River. According to local accounts, communities
historically built their homes near rivers, making rivers a
central hub of human activity. Boats were a prominent mode
of transportation. However, in the 1980s, a shift occurred as
housing developments started emerging away from the river,
leading to a transition toward land-centric human activities.
The rivers, once dynamic contributors to urban life, gradually
became more static in nature.

b.
Brick and mortar,
replacing natural
drainage systems

In certain towns, the introduction of real estate and
infrastructural developments has impacted existing natural
water drainage systems. In Semarang, significant land
use changes unfolded in the 1990s with the construction
of housing estates near two urban villages within the city.
The construction of these structures disrupted natural
drainage systems, redirecting rainwater towards these
villages, resulting in flooding. In various cities, infrastructural
developments near rivers, including alterations to the river's
flow, influence the rate at which water can be absorbed into
the ground. Without adequate alternative drainage systems,
this contributes to an exacerbation of flooding.

Figure 7.

Housing Estates in
Semarang

Segoro, 2021

As conditions evolve over time, this
exacerbation of flooding is notably evident
in cities like Banjarmasin, which had
not experienced flooding until recently.
Historically, the city had a strong orientation
towards the river. However, factors such as
real estate development and environmental
degradation have shifted the city towards
conditions that are now more prone to
flooding.

3.1.2.
Waste Management
and Citizen
Behaviour

Waste has been identified as a significant factor contributing
to floods in various areas. For instance, in Bendungan Hilir,
Jakarta, riverside drainages are impeded by garbage, and
despite daily waste collection efforts, the problem persists.
Improper waste management is recognized as a common
factor behind flooding in many cities, taking different forms.

Communities in various cities highlight litter as a major
concern exacerbating flooding. In Cirebon, Jakarta, and
Surabaya, litter obstructs sewage systems, impacting their
ability to manage excess water. In Cirebon, high tide brings
back trash to the coast, affecting coastal communities.

Figure 8.

Littering poses a widespread issue in several cities,
blocking water flow and compromising drainage systems.
In Semarang's Desel Village, locals emphasize that
technical solutions like river deepening and floodwall
construction are insufficient if upstream practices, such
as obstructing river flows and hill-cutting, persist.

Littering by one community affects downstream areas.
Coastal communities in Cirebon note that waste clogging
their sewage systems originates upstream, from a local
market. Similar issues with waste flow from upstream
sources are reported in Surabaya, in the form of used
diapers, and Banjarmasin.

3.1.3.
Geographical Factors
and Community
Dynamics - Upstream-
downstream relations

The impact of flooding varies based on its underlying
causes, with geographical and topographical factors playing
a crucial role. For example, in Biring Je’ne Village, Makassar,
the land's wok-like shape directs rainwater to its lowest
point, a farmland area, facilitating absorption into the
ground. Conversely, Cirebon experiences coastal flooding
during high tide, further intensified by local community-led
coastal land reclamation.

Intercommunity social factors shape the local response to
floods, with some communities expressing dissatisfaction
that flood mitigation efforts are lacking upstream, leaving
downstream communities to bear the consequences.

This may be caused by differing policies and variations
in policy implementation across different areas. In
Banjarmasin, which sits at the meeting point of the
Martapura and Barito rivers, we saw the dissatisfaction of
environmentally-conscious locals who regretted litter would
still flow through the Martapura river from upstream. This
was also attributed to a lack of effective implementation of
city regulations regarding river management. Elsewhere,
coastal communities in Cirebon expressed that they often
find litter in the rivers leading to the sea, which comes from
the town market located upstream. As a result of this, the
litter ends up polluting the property of these communities
following high tide.

3.2.
Brief Reflections
on Community
and Water

Local wisdom influences how communities perceive and
handle floods. In Malaka Regency, residents anticipate
a significant flood approximately every 20 years. In
Cirebon and Makassar, residents rely on "flood calendars"
developed over generations,

based on observations of rain and flood patterns. While
evidence on the impact of climate change on flooding
did not come across very strongly during the field
research, some individuals in Cirebon and Makassar
communities mentioned recent changes as reflected in
their documentation of flood patterns. According to local
reports, Malaka Regency and various Indonesian regions
have witnessed the largest floods in years.

Community perception and local knowledge are crucial
not only in understanding flooding but also in mitigating
its impact.

Flood as Complex Systems
what are the other
interconnected sectors ?

Environment:
“Naturalize rivers, rejuvenate riverbanks
to minimize sedimentation, and expand
sewers and underground waterways
along highways, as many are insufficient
to handle the incoming water volume.
Enhance water absorption areas to ensure
they can adequately accommodate the
groundwater absorption to the surface.”
(Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta)

Socioeconomic:
“...Floods are a multifaceted phenomenon
intricately connected with ecosystems,
economic systems, capitalism, social
conditions, inequality, history, and more…”
(Bekasi)

Perception & Local Knowledge:
“Large pool of water/floods are
not always detrimental.” (Bogor)

Local perspectives significantly shape the
comprehension of how bodies of water
influence the socio-cultural fabric of an area,
with unique relationships established based
on geographic conditions, sociocultural
beliefs, and economic circumstances.

Examining tradition and locality reveals
diverse community relationships with water
and rivers, shaped by factors like location,
culture, economic background, and roles.
Some view rain as a divine blessing. In
Malaka, flooding is considered a sign of

nature's recovery. The Benenai River, for
instance, is viewed as a divine gift, reflected
in the names of places along the river.
Traditional houses and leaders in Malaka are
believed to possess supernatural powers,
enabling them to regulate river flows.
Conversely, in Jakarta, rivers are often seen
as disposal sites or flood sources, increasing
vulnerability for those in close proximity.
In Banjarmasin, differences exist in how
rural and urban communities perceive their
relationship with the river, although many see
it as 'the ditch' for their houses.

33 Flood Mitigation Report 2023

UNDP Accelerator Labs Indonesia

What floods mean
to those who
experience it

Communities along the Benenai River in East Nusa Tenggara
hold strong traditional beliefs about their water ecology,
viewing the river as a divine blessing. Large floods occurring
every 20 years are interpreted as nature's regeneration and
healing. According to their perspective, floods only cause
harm when there is a violation. Consequently, excessive
interference with the river's course and local water ecology is
discouraged to avoid “displeasing” the water.

Diverse communities adopt diverse approaches in
addressing urban flooding across Indonesian cities. Factors
such as lived experiences, local insights, and varying
disaster perceptions influence their decisions. Flood-prone
cities like Jakarta, Semarang, Surabaya, and Cirebon employ
adaptive coping mechanisms, utilising day-to-day, small-
scale, and short-term strategies. In contrast, communities
in Makassar, Malaka, and Banjarmasin, facing floods for the
first time or irregularly, exploring the causes, considering
climate change, landscape alterations, or other emerging
factors. The next chapter will explore some of these
approaches, including how community perspectives could
inform effective policymaking.

Potential
Solutions

Flooding impacts diverse stakeholders both directly and indirectly,
prompting a range of approaches to mitigate its effects. 'Top-down'
strategies are implemented by government bodies and individuals in
managerial positions, while 'bottom-up' actions are taken by those
with limited influence, especially those directly affected by the
issues. In each city, we observed the coexistence of top-down and
bottom-up flood mitigation approaches.

4.1.
Top-Down Efforts

Addressing the pervasive issue of flooding
in Indonesia, various local governments
have implemented measures within their
jurisdictions. Our ethnography across seven
cities allowed us to glean insights from
local communities about their governments'
efforts in tackling flood-related challenges.

For instance, the city government of
Semarang installed nets above the
river to prevent litter, addressing waste
management disparities in various cities.
In Jakarta, where daily waste collection
services operate but don't cover the entire
area, challenges persist.

Top-down initiatives encompass city
legislation (including mayoral laws or
Peraturan Wali Kota), planks, river keepers,
and infrastructural projects, often requiring
bureaucratic and logistical resources. This
includes the construction of embankments,
canals, and large structures to manage
water flow.

During field visits across seven cities,
communities shared what has worked
well: best practices resulting from
government-led interventions, ranging
from constructions of canals to mitigate
the impact of flooding to supporting
regulations and the appointment of
community focal points as river managers.

Nevertheless, findings from various cities also underscore
the need to reassess the role and effectiveness of built
physical infrastructures in mitigating flood impacts. Jakarta
and Banjarmasin grapple with issues like unconnected
drainage systems, while in Cirebon, Jakarta, and Semarang,
elevated and paved roads contribute to flooding by limiting
soil water absorption. In Semarang, roads, particularly in
Kampung Tambakharjo, have been raised multiple times
since the 1990s. Malaka's infrastructure development often
lacks community involvement and local wisdom, resulting in
inefficacy. Although embankments prove effective for small
floods in some cases, they fall short during catastrophic
events. The next chapter will outline some of these patterns.

Aspiration towards
government support

Aspirations towards govern-
ment support and assistance

While not strictly top-down, the role of local leaders as influential figures who
can mobilize communities into collective action is crucial. Trusted figures act as
intermediaries between formal government structures and citizens, performing
indigenous functions. At the same time, political dynamics may also cause social
tension at the local level, as those with resource mobilization power allocate
influence based on loyalty, creating divisions among supporters of political rivals.

Several aspirations for the government emerged from the research, revolving
around the need for better involvement of communities and local wisdoms in
policymaking processes:

Bottom-Up
Approaches

From field stories, we discovered varying flood patterns —
some regions face annual floods, while others contend with
recent massive occurrences. For instance, Jakarta encounters
floods almost every year, with intense flooding happening
every five years. In Malaka, a substantial flood in 2021
surpassed the one in 2000.

These cyclical flood experiences have led affected
communities to develop habitual and traditional coping
mechanisms. This contrasts with areas facing floods more
recently, where short-term coping strategies prevail.
Experienced communities elevate houses, while newcomers
modify existing structures to resist water, considering unique
geographical conditions. Hence, each community's flood
experience is nuanced, making broad generalizations unwise.

Makassar communities employ a 'flood calendar' outlining
steps for anticipating flooding. Preparing for the rainy
season includes elevating furniture, securing belongings,
and relocating vehicles. During heavy rains in early
January, communities seek sanctuary in neighbors' homes,
shophouses, or mosques serving as shelter centers.

Grassroots
Innovations

In addressing floods, communities across regions have
generated grassroots innovations, identified through the
UNDP Accelerator Lab's solutions mapping method. This
approach, grounded in the belief that communities possess
the capacity to design tailored solutions to their challenges,
emphasizes the emic nature of solutions, ensuring contextual
relevance.

Our researchers, immersed in community dynamics, identified
grassroots innovators tackling flooding challenges. These
innovations, born out of experiential knowledge, reveal the
complexity of community contexts, addressing unmet needs,
root causes, and community assets.

In Malaka, communities employ several effective adaptation
strategies for dealing with floods. They rely on flood
embankments, traditional houses known as "rumah
panggung" for those living in floodplains (dataran banjir),
and village forests or "hutan kampung" to divert water and
minimize flooding impact. Additionally, communities in
Surabaya demonstrate coping mechanisms such as acquiring
extra water bumps to redirect water flow, constructing
manholes for inspections, and establishing partial ditches for
specific areas.

Solutions mapping activities unveils physical solutions
grounded in tradition and local ingenuity, nature-based
solutions, and social capital as potential measures for
mitigation, categorized under disaster response/management.

Physical Infrastructure and Objects driven by Local Ingenuity
Throughout the ethnographic process, we repeatedly found
that local wisdom plays a role in the adaptation mechanisms
of local communities. In Malaka regency, East Nusa Tenggara
province, the traditional stilt house design effectively mitigated
the effects of flooding for the area’s residents.

When a campaign was held in the late 1970s to encourage
residents to move into “modern” brick-and-mortar houses,
many complained. But residents later discovered that these
houses were unable to withstand the conditions of the area.
The weight of the foundations of these houses, in an area
where flooding distributes sediment, causes the house to sink
relative to the land around it. Thus, in times of flood, residents
often seek refuge in stilt houses, or in houses built on higher
ground.

For grassroots communities, resourcefulness is crucial as
they may have limited access to funds or other means to
overcome the challenges they face. At the same time, it
presents an opportunity—how can communities leverage
what they already possess to build innovative solutions? It
forces them to think creatively, viewing objects that may
otherwise be overlooked in a new light.

A community living around the Biring Je’ne river in
Makassar presents two innovations that demonstrate their
resourcefulness. The first of these is a makeshift buoy made
of a huge chunk of styrofoam scrap. This buoy floats in
water and is used as a reference point for search and rescue
efforts during floods. The second innovation involves another
buoyant material: jerrycans. Used jerrycans are repurposed
to build a raft that is used to transport people through
floodwaters.

Furthermore, local initiatives in upcycling exemplify how
residents are repurposing waste into valuable items. For
instance, Titin, a community member, transforms textile
sold to friends and family, there hasn’t been significant
market demand for her creations. Another example is Boim,
a fisherman who cultivates a garden in his spare time. He
ingeniously uses available materials, such as pots made from
recycled rubber tires and plastic packaging. He has also
experimented with coastal sand as a growing medium instead
of soil, yielding mixed results. While his efforts demonstrate
sustainability, products may have imperfections, and market
demand remains limited.

Collaborating with the CSO partner Sinau Kota, we
also mapped innovative solutions in Cirebon's coastal
communities, revealing sustainable practices reflected in
nature-based solutions. Bamboo seawalls installed by a
community-level government office (RW) and breakwaters
made from used coconut shells are examples, offering
organic, scalable solutions to mitigate coastal erosion. Our
ethnographers found a seawall made of bamboo, installed
by a community-level government office (RW). According
to locals, this structure can last around 3 years, and can
mitigate coastal erosion. Further down the coastline, a
breakwater made of used coconut shells was found. Sacks
were filled with used coconut shells and then placed by
the coast. This structure is relatively new, and locals hope
that it can keep the tide at bay. Both structures are made of
organic material and offer sustainable solutions that have the
potential to be scaled.

other seamlessly. This could be seen in some grassroots
innovations that leverage social capital, creating an inclusive
social system to ensure no one is left behind during disasters.
Community members may be expected to contribute in
specific ways, such as paying dues to fund locally devised
solutions. The youth, in particular, can serve as agents of
resilience with the capacity to act in times of need.

Physical items can work effectively when supported
by established social systems, such as the communal
belief in selfless mutual assistance. The local community
in Malaka Regency, East Nusa Tenggara province, for
example, has ingeniously crafted solutions for inclusive
flood mitigation and response, catering to the elderly and
those with disabilities. In one instance, a family opted not
to evacuate, providing a 75-year-old stroke survivor with a
dry and portable seat—a stack of four plastic chairs. This
arrangement not only kept him dry but also facilitated a
smoother relocation to higher ground when needed. In other
cases, ropes have been utilized to help people navigate
strong flood currents en route to shelters. Communities
along the Benenai River, for example, share a collective
sense of responsibility, offering assistance to anyone in need,
regardless of their identity. Making use of social capital can
sometimes mean raising financial capital as well. Residents
of a neighbourhood by the Martapura river in Banjarmasin
collectively raised money to rent a water pump as a flood
mitigation measure.

UNDP Accelerator Labs Indonesia

Emphasizing the significance of coordination between
communities along rivers and the government is crucial for
updating flood data. In Jakarta, the research team found a
discrepancy between government-recorded flood data and
the actual field conditions, underscoring the urgent need for
enhanced coordination. Similarly, in Banjarmasin, our field
researcher identified a lack of implementation of government
regulations, particularly regarding river management. This
gap could potentially lead to a clash between communities’
aspirations and government expectations. Strengthening
coordination mechanisms is imperative for aligning
community efforts with government initiatives and ensuring
effective flood management. This coordination should extend
from the smallest community units, such as RT/RW, and focus
on disaster management, including the development of self-
sustaining infrastructure and flood evacuation plans.

How do we ensure such coordination in practice? A
comprehensive understanding of local contexts empowers
governments to implement more effective policies and
plans. In fact, creating such synergies is not impossible.
For example, In two districts in Surabaya – Pakis village and
Donorejo Wetan – the building of local infrastructure took
into consideration the local topography. In Pakis village,
a bridge’s design was altered following inputs from local
communities, so that water from higher ground would flow
towards the river, preventing the flooding of a market on
lower ground. In Donorejo Wetan, the installation of sewers
along the main road was able to alleviate flood conditions,
such that local residents would either experience shorter
floods or none at all.

Background

In alignment with its bottom-up and inclusive policy brief7 resulting
from the ethnographic study, the UNDP Accelerator Lab Indonesia
sought to expand its initiatives in flood mitigation. Beyond the
ethnographic work across seven cities, the Accelerator Lab forged
an unconventional partnership with the Project Management Office
(PMO) of the Jabodetabekpunjur (Jakarta-Bogor-Depok-Tangerang-
Bekasi-Puncak-Cianjur) area, operating under the Ministry of Agrarian
Affairs and Spatial Planning/National Land Agency (ATR/BPN).

Jabodetabek-Punjur, which encompasses
Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi,
Puncak, and Cianjur, stands as a crucial
economic center at the national level, housing
both the Core Urban and Surrounding Urban
Areas, thereby forming a metropolitan
region. The spatial planning for Jabodetabek-
Punjur aims to establish it as a pivotal hub
for international, national, and regional
economic endeavors. This necessitates
seamless integration among these areas,
emphasizing environmental sustainability and
cohesive management. The PMO is dedicated
to addressing a range of interconnected
issues such as congestion, conservation
area preservation, coastal development,
waste management, access to clean water,
flooding, and informal settlement, all of which
are fundamental aspects of urban life in
the Jabodetabekpunjur area. Consequently,

this collaboration is anticipated to tackle
the strategic challenges within the
Jabodetabekpunjur region effectively.

In alignment with a well-coordinated
flood mitigation strategy, a Presidential
Regulation was issued in 2020, highlighting
the importance of improving the conditions
and functions of lakes throughout the
Jabodetabekpunjur area. This decision
stems from the analysis conducted by PMO
Jabodetabekpunjur, which predicts an annual
cost of IDR 250 billion (USD 17 million) due
to flooding if lakes in the region continue
to shrink or are managed under a "business
as usual" approach. As a result, preserving
and enhancing the conditions of the lakes
have become a top priority for the local
government.

Gaps & Entry
Points

In 2021, ATR/BPN initiated an initial mapping project focused on
several lakes, prompting the UNDP Accelerator Lab Indonesia
to expand the project to the Jabodetabekpunjur area. Through
collaboration with PMO, this mapping effort aimed to assess the
potential of both artificial and natural lakes in mitigating flood
damage while updating the government's dataset. The primary
objective of this mapping initiative was to improve the quality of the
existing dataset, ensuring its accessibility to the public.

This dataset would serve as a crucial
foundation for comprehensive analysis and
decision-making regarding lake utilization in
Jakarta and its surrounding cities, particularly
for flood mitigation to bolster community
resilience.

In addition, the Accelerator Lab aims to not
only enhance the government data sources
but also to offer insights into the potential
of utilizing lakes for flood mitigation and
the associated governance requirements.
Drawing from previous ethnographic research,
the Accelerator Lab acknowledged the
potential for communities to utilize physical
infrastructure in combating urban flooding.
Furthermore, the initiative sought to pilot

an innovative approach to data collection,
advocating for citizen science and data
empowerment. This approach empowers
citizens to gather data, which can then be
analyzed by mapping experts and shared
with communities to inform decision-making
processes and facilitate positive change.

Therefore, this assessment of both natural
and artificial lakes encompasses qualitative
data pertaining to environmental, economic,
social, and governance dimensions, which
are integrated into the overall evaluation.
Additionally, the framework takes into
account the context of nearby communities,
delving into their relationships, perceptions,
and experiences concerning the lakes.

Process

The digital mapping process conducted from March to
July 2022 occurred in two distinct stages: 1) Digital Lake
Mapping, which involved the collection and visualization
of data through surveyors employed by OpenStreetMap
(OSM), and 2) Open Mapathon, which employed a
crowdsourcing approach to enhance the gathered data
utilizing a network of volunteers.

b.
Data Input to
Mapillary and
Ushahidi

The initial stage involved crafting a questionnaire for data
collection purposes. Following this, surveyors contracted by
OpenStreetMap (OSM) Indonesia conducted the mapping of
lake-related data. This process extended over a two-week
period, from 11 to 24 April 2022. The mapping endeavor
encompassed 170 out of the 218 artificial and natural
lakes within the Jabodetabekpunjur area. Subsequently,
the collected data underwent verification, digitization, and
validation by OSM. Finally, the data was furnished to the
government.

A quality assurance process was implemented to verify
the locations of lakes. During field surveys, surveyors
entered data into two platforms: Mapillary and Ushahidi.
Ushahidi is an open-source software application that
aggregates and maps data from user-generated reports.
It operates on the principle of crowdsourcing, serving
as a pioneering model for what is known as "activist
mapping" – a fusion of social activism, citizen journalism,
and geographic information. Meanwhile, Mapillary is a
platform that provides street-level images and map data
to facilitate mapping on a large scale and automate the
process.

Both platforms are employed in this phase. Mapillary is
used to track the surveyor's routes during the survey,
while Ushahidi records the coordinates of water bodies,
which are then converted into a basemap for Ushahidi in
OpenStreetMap (OSM).

c.
Digitizing and
Verification on
OpenStreetMap
(OSM) Platform

OSM Indonesia team proceeded to digitize and authenticate
data concerning precise locations and water boundaries
on the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform. Specifically, OSM
Indonesia employed the JOSM application to digitize all
collected data. The geographic data of lakes obtained
from Ushahidi, along with accessible satellite imagery
(Maxar Imagery Premium), were utilized to delineate the
existing lakes on the OSM platform. This process also
involved tagging the lakes' water boundaries and capturing
photographs of nearby facilities on OSM. For instance, as
depicted in Figure 24 below, the pinpoint for Lake Jambore
Cibubur is illustrated.

The verification process entailed cross-referencing the
pinpoint locations mapped by surveyors with Mapillary
data. In cases where water boundary data was unavailable,
surveyors can directly input it into the OSM platform. Once
the data was uploaded to OSM, it became visible on the
Ushahidi platform as a base map. Verification also checked
for misspellings or typos in lake narrations, paragraphs,
and descriptions. Surveyor-collected photos needed to be
accessible on the Mapillary website. By zooming in on the
location, the public could access photo sequences for each
lake. Photo documentation verified the real situation, such as
changes in land use or location.

volunteer mappers from the general populace, with a
particular focus on youths residing in the Jabodetabek area.
All mappers utilized Ushahidi (an open-source application) to
collect data on the physical condition of the lakes and upload
corresponding photos.

In total, 12 volunteers mapped 52 lakes across various
regions. Ultimately, three winners were chosen to receive
tokens of appreciation based on the quality, clarity, and
coherence of their submissions on the Ushahidi platform.

Findings

The collaborative mapping effort of 170 lakes in
Jabodetabekpunjur has produced a varied dataset. Notably,
a majority of these lakes are located in satellite cities rather
than Jakarta. The collected information encompasses the
physical characteristics of the lakes, economic activities in
the surrounding communities, the lakes' significance to the
community, lake management practices, and limited data
on flood mitigation efforts. This dataset holds promise as a
cornerstone for comprehensive analysis and policymaking.
The findings offer both positive observations and aspects
that demand additional attention from the government.

4.1.
Good Practices

The majority of the mapped lakes exhibit
good physical condition, featuring well-
functioning inlets and outlets, along with soil
or rock barriers. Positive insights extend to
waste management, with lake administrators
consistently cleaning the lakes, indicating a
grassroots community approach to anticipate

and mitigate urban flooding.

Additionally, as part of the flood mitigation
efforts as well as to maintain the lake's

functions, regular cleaning is performed.
Notably, 73 lakes undergo regular
cleaning sessions conducted by the local
communities. The government bodies, as the
lake administrators, also manage the water
flows by controlling the inlet, outlet, or water
discharge. This is a practice observed in 15
lakes across the Jabodetabekpunjur area.
In other instances, administrators address
unwanted plant growth, such as water
hyacinth, to prevent lake silting.

Challenges

While occurrences of water overflow incidents are relatively
infrequent across the lakes, a notable 23 percent still
encounter this issue. To supplement this data, field visits
were conducted to uncover essential qualitative insights not
captured in the charts, such as the water flow, which serves
as a crucial indicator for evaluating the functionality of the
lakes. During these visits, instances were observed where
water flow was redirected or directed into residents' gardens
or ponds to prevent overflow, presenting challenges.

Furthermore, the collected data highlights a lack of emphasis
on harnessing the lakes' potential for flood mitigation. Among
the 170 lakes mapped, only one is utilized as infrastructure
to mitigate flooding in its vicinity. The nearby communities
predominantly utilize lakes for everyday activities such as
fishing, retail (through small stores), recreational pursuits, or
irrigation for their gardens and/or rice fields.

Additionally, a governance issue persists concerning the
lakes, with unclear governance emerging as the foremost
challenge surrounding lakes in Jakarta and its satellite
cities. While administrators are appointed for 94 lakes, a
significant number (76 lakes or 80.8 percent) lack designated
administrators. This specific issue is underscored as a major
concern by the PMO. The data also suggests that although
relations between communities and local governments
were generally positive, the majority of government lake
administrators did not maintain specific connections with
local communities.

Changes in Lake
Ownership and
Implications

The PMO sought to forestall a decrease in the watershed's
ability to accommodate surface runoff. Hence, the
identification of alterations in land use/function and
ownership of the lakes became paramount. Based on the
gathered data, it was found that certain lakes underwent
transformation into residential areas, commercial buildings,
gardens, and even rice paddies. Additionally, a handful
also underwent changes in ownership, transitioning from
community-owned to being owned by private companies.

Of the 170 mapped lakes, 60 percent are managed by the
government (through village, sub-district, and provincial
entities). In contrast, 40 percent have had their ownership
transferred to private entities, resulting in discrepancies in
how they are managed and maintained.

Among the 170 lakes, some have
undergone conversion, with most still
being utilized by nearby communities.

Conclusion

This report presents the value of capturing the voices of grassroots
communities to inform formal policymaking processes. Through
two approaches – ethnographic study across seven cities and digital
mapping of lakes – the UNDP Accelerator Lab Indonesia and its
partners demonstrate the value added of bottom-up insights to tackle
the systemic issue of flooding. The message of this publication is clear:
the government cannot do it alone and it must wage partnerships,
often with unusual partners, to produce locally-relevant and effective
policies. Indeed, this conclusion is supported by two seemingly
contrasting approaches.

At one end of the spectrum, the
ethnographic work across seven cities, in
conjunction with a preceding public survey,
revealed various community-level patterns
related to water management. Overall, the
ethnographic study suggests how flood
should be understood as a systemic issue.
For example, the field research team noted
three key factors as the main drivers of
flood: land use changes, citizens’ approach
to waste management, and geographical
features, which also relate to the dynamics
between upstream and downstream
communities. In addition, communities
do have their own understanding and
knowledge with regard to the issue of

flood. As such, formal policymaking process
could benefit from local wisdoms and
understanding of community perceptions
on water. The ethnographic study also
signals how well-intentioned and successful
top-down efforts could be complemented
by local ingenuity, as reflected in various
bottom-up, community-driven approaches
to combat flooding. Across many cities,
the team witness a range of creative
grassroots innovation that should be
recognised and leveraged in conjunction
with existing policies. A better future outlook
of flood management seems to hinge upon
creating such synergies between policies
of the government and wisdoms of local
communities.

At the other end of the spectrum, the
collective endeavour to use digital
technologies also yields a similar conclusion.
At one level, the digital lake mapping and
open mapathon activities highlight the
capacity of the citizens at large – volunteers
and enumerators – as contributors to
strengthening government data for sites
management and as an extension of this,
disaster mitigation and preparedness. Apart
from improving visualisations of lakes for
government agencies, the digitalization

of lake map also showcases the power of
open citizens-generated data for effective
policymaking. These exercises reveal several
patterns that substantiate the ethnographic
findings: while on average, most of the lake
sites have maintained physical infrastructure,
there is a room to improve their effective
utilisation to mitigate flood and community-
level governance. In addition, the question
of change in the utilization and ownership
of lakes also comes up as an important
consideration for government policy process.

Taken together, this report parses the
different facets of urban resilience, as
reflected in government- and community-
driven responses in regard to water-related
issues, particularly flood. This publication
advocates for a transdisciplinary approach
that synthezise government-, expert-, and
most importantly grassroots communities-
led initiatives to tackle current and future
development challenges.
