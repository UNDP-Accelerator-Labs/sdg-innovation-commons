Co-design to refurbish existing trucks to transport waste sorted according to
recycling practices established in the governmental agreement 164-2021. The goal was to make the collection and
separation of recyclable waste inside the truck more efficient, in order to
increase the amount of material
recycled and  removed from the city's landfill.
