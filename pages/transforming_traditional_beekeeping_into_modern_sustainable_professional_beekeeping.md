> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation in this project is to transform traditional beekeeping into a sustainable professional beekeeping that would result in high income generation. Better beekeeping techniques like GPS monitored top bar beehives which lasts long. Beekeepers will be provided with modern beekeeping equipment's and necessary trainings. Honey will be harvested from our modern bee hives and from our farmers that will be organized in production zones. At those Zone centers, farmers will be trained in bees farming and equipped with mobile honey processing equipment. The overall process and packaging in well branded bottles and containers shall be done at the main business production unit. This will be certified by Zambia Bureau of Standards.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Currently Chimo innovations have acquired about 150 hectares of land of which part of the land is being used for Honey farming and a total of 20 Modern Bee hives are on site. So our enterprise is encouraging people in the community not to cut trees. Through employment, it will reduce poverty by engaging Beekeeping farmers. The farmers will be taught value chain. So the enterprise will solve poverty level and create employment in the community. The business also intends to train more than 200 out grower farmers in the modern bee farming once funds are available. We shall encourage out grower schemes where it will target more women and the youth. Not only that we shall also provide market for them. The sustainable development Goals impacted by the innovation are SDG 1, SDG2, SDG3 and SDG4. We shall generate income from the sale of honey syrup, bee wax and will also add value to the honey by making Honey peanut butter. This business will improve other business like the groundnuts, where will be making Honey peanut butter. Our customers are 
1.	Food processing companies
2.	Individuals
3.	Health facilities

> Technical Feasibility

Honey will be harvested from our modern bee hives and from our farmers that will be organized in production zones. At those Zone centers, farmers will be trained in bees farming and equipped with mobile honey processing equipment. The overall process and packaging in well branded bottles and containers shall be done at the main business production unit. This will be certified by Zambia Bureau of Standards. This will help us harvest, process and purify honey in order to maximize holistic benefits to beekeepers farmers, investors and the local communities. Currently we have honey as our product packaged in well branded bottles as our prototype.

> Anticipated Social Impact

By acquiring that piece of land where we have put our Bee hives, we have engaged the community to stop cutting down trees. We have educated them that, Once trees are not cut, the community will benefit as the forest will provide them with Mushrooms, caterpillars, and there animals will have good pasture to graze. The community will have also clean water. The land will also be free of Soil erosion. Once trees are protected, this helps to reduce chances of natural calamities such as floods and drought which in turn will help to maintain the environment. We aim to educate some Beekeepers some modern methods of Beekeeping that is sustainable. The innovation will help to mitigate climate change by sustainable use of natural resources. The more we keep Bee hives, the more we are going to sustain the environment. This will also increase productivity and reduce costs which in turn increase turnover and improve profitability in the operations of the business.
