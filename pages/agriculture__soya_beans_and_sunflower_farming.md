> Title of the innovation

Agriculture, soya beans and sunflower farming

> Brief description of the innovation

Soya beans and sunflower are very important in our daily life reason,we need cooking oil and make our food test good and better not only that it's nutrition level is best to non.where ever you go this product is on demand and it's income generating product, when famers produce soya beans and sunflower in abundance we can say goodbye to hanger and everyone can have a good meal which is nutritious.on top of that it's not so difficult to grow and it doesn't need so much fertilizer only fertile soil and good rainfall pattern, after havesting you can sale it directly or produce a variety of products for example;milk 
Cooking oil, transformer oil, animal feed, cake's,bread and much more.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

When empowered, for example with soya beans and sunflower oil making machines income generating can be everywhere even in the remote part of Zambia because everyone buy cooking oil, animal feed and soya beans milk.in terms of growing business operations it's a must because there's no lose crops farming, given an excellent example of what happened in the last farming season a 5okg bag fetched k500 to k600 making it the highest paying crop.with no doubt it's a business booster.The market is available cooking oil manufacturers, animal feed manufacturers,food reserve agence and there is ready market for export.in addition the value of this invention is great firstly it adds nitrogen in the soil,it helps in reducing pollution and cleanse the air in general above all it adds to our well being and health

> Technical Feasibility

The design of this invention is simple but technical firstly a farm land is a must have, technically machinery or cow is needed for tilling the soil suppose I have that capacity if not our usual one hoe.given a working capital of k30 000 I can go for 4 hector farm land assuming that each hector will produce 25bags am talking of 100bags of soya beans given the market price is per k500 per 50kg has i aruded to erea the net profit will be not less than k20 000.knowing very well that I have this money once a year I need to engage in gardening as well to ensure I utilise the land and the income wisily prudent.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Where I live people caver longer distance just to buy mostly this end product of soya Beans and sunflower example cooking oil, animal feed, bread, soya beans floor and milk but if they have someone producing all this nearby there lives can improve, there animals will multplay distance covered will be shortened and more there cost of living will reduce.
