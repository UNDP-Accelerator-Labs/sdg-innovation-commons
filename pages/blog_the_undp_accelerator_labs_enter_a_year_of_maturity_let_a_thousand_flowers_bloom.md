“The UNDP Accelerator Labs were born to be
an epicenter of innovation, for a green,
inclusive, sustainable future that was built
bottom up from the everyday inventions and
wisdom of the many, not the few. The stars of
this film, these real-life heroes and grassroots
innovators are proof that our ‘best world’ is built
on the daily, ground-zero choices that people
are making now and here.”

A Network in Motion
The Accelerator Lab
Network at a Glance

The UNDP Accelerator Labs were designed as an agile
and dynamic Network to allow communication and
information transfer between 91 Accelerator Labs in 115
countries, and with the global innovation ecosystem,
UNDP as a whole, and thousands of partners including
grassroots innovators and their communities. The
accumulated knowledge of this Network creates new
pathways to the solutions that hold the key to sustainable
development problems.

What it looked like and how it unfolded last year will be
illuminated in this annual report: The UNDP Accelerator
Labs enter a year of maturity: let a thousand flowers
bloom!

With thanks to our founding investors, the Federal
Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development
of Germany (BMZ), and the Qatar Fund for
Development (QFFD), and the support of partners at core
for UNDP, including the Italian Ministry of Ecological
Transition as action partner and the Japan Cabinet, the
Accelerator Labs are now a mature Network with visible,
tangible results.

.UNDP Accelerator Labs - Annual Report 2022

The Accelerator Labs were built in 2019 with the launch of
60 Labs, followed by an additional 31 -- an incredibly fast
construction -- resulting in an agile and ready-to-work force
of 273 social innovation experts, bringing unique
skillsets to bear in 115 countries.

From mapping local solutions, to exploring diverse
sources of data and signals of change to experimenting
to find out what works and what doesn’t in sustainable
development, the Accelerator Labs are constantly in
motion. The Labs are always learning new ways to meet
the most challenging sustainable development problems
and helping to plot a course through them. They inform
government policy makers, development practitioners and
community leaders to make better decisions that can
benefit all, leaving no one behind.

To date, UNDP Accelerator Labs have surfaced over

6,000 grassroots-led solutions worldwide covering all
17 SDGs, addressing issues such as food security,
circular economies, energy poverty and the impact of
climate change on agriculture.

2022 saw progress in evolving the Labs as a core part of
the front-line renewal function of UNDP. The independent
Midterm Evaluation validated the success of the
Accelerator Labs in their efforts to model how UNDP can
“reimagine development.” The Evaluation also explored
how continuous exploration and experimentation would
lead to a greater capacity for organizational learning and
renewal, responsiveness and stakeholder engagement.

.UNDP Accelerator Labs - Annual Report 2022

A year later, the Labs have now triggered a UNDP-wide
demand for continuous Research and Development
(R&D) to respond to ever-evolving demands of global
uncertainty, and this is the direction of future iterations of
the Lab Network. A pattern of integration is emerging: the
Accelerator Labs design proof-of-concept
experiments, and work as a core part of UNDP to
progress, expand and leverage resources, building out
new niches, responding to emerging issues and informing
government strategies in the Global South.

The report follows the structure of the results framework
established at the design phase.
In Chapter 1, the Report covers Output 1: increasing
capability for scanning, sensemaking, and
experimentation, with strong examples of this work, case
studies and profiles. Chapter 2 presents Output 2 on
scaling new sustainable development solutions, with digital
solutions and public sector innovation. In Chapter 3, you
will read about Output 3, the establishment of a global
learning and scaling network, discussing learning in the
ecosystem the Labs have built, and how they share out
that learning, with a deep dive on informality. Chapter 4 is
a place for partnerships to shine. The Accelerator Labs
develop strong on-the-ground partnerships and continue to
ally with new partners and to bring on board unusual
actors. In Chapter 5, advocacy and communications
achievements over the past year are presented, featuring
the global events surrounding the launch of for Tomorrow:
the Documentary. The Report concludes in Chapter 6 with
a look ahead towards building a global, public R&D
ecosystem to rapidly accelerate traction towards the 2030
agenda.

A race against time: how are the Accelerator Labs
contributing to the Global Goals?

With less than seven years to the deadline for the Global
Goals achievement, there is a clear need for drastic
systemic changes. This is the time to unleash learning
through continuous exploration and experimentation so
we can close the knowledge gap on what it will take to
achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

The Accelerator Labs are working to accelerate learning
across all SDGs. Over the past three years, experiments
undertaken by the Labs which address Affordable and
Clean Energy (SDG7), Industry, Innovation and
Infrastructure (SDG9) and Peace, Justice and Strong
Institutions (SDG16) have significantly increased. There is
also an increase in the diversity of SDGs addressed by
each Lab.

A niche for innovation within the SDGs

How do the UNDP Accelerator Labs add value in the quest to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goals? They fill data gaps by exploring new
sources of data. They shed light on emerging bottlenecks and source
innovations that create triple wins.

1. The Labs help fill data gaps in SDG monitoring

For eight of the 17 SDGs, internationally comparable data from 2015 or later
is dramatically missing1. Tapping into new and unusual data sources is part
and parcel of how the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network operates. Present in
115 developing countries, the Labs are using 45 new kinds of data
sources such as satellite or citizen data, and are in turn producing new,
timely and inclusive data that help monitor progress on the SDGs. This helps
fill data gaps in the Global South to inform where to best invest to support
the 2030 Agenda.

 Read “Data that tells stories”

Take the recycling rates (SDG Indicator 12.5.1), where currently available
data for recycling rates globally is limited. UNDP Tanzania, powered by its
Accelerator Lab, is producing new data through mobile surveys to measure
where recycling is happening and where it is missing in Mwanza, Tanzania’s
second largest city and one of the fastest developing urban centers in sub-
Saharan Africa.

On SDG 16, often recognized as one of the most difficult goals to monitor,
the Labs are experimenting with ways to define and measure what a good
public service looks like for its citizens. In 2022, 17 UNDP Accelerator Labs
explored how public service innovation can help increase efficiency of public
services. For example, the UNDP Paraguay Accelerator Lab, in
partnership with the Ministry of Health released a study to identify high-
performing health centers in the country and understand what constitutes a
good public health service for its citizens.

The Labs see an opportunity in using these new data sources for the real-
time monitoring of the environment which would help close a gap where 68
percent of environmental SDG Indicators lack data2. Imagine bike sensors
that can detect the quality of the air as one cycles in a city, or small devices
that can be used by children to monitor rainfall and predict floods in remote
areas. The Labs are experimenting with these new participatory ways to
generate real-time data which are being taken to scale and are feeding
evidence-based public policies.

As the process of data collection was dramatically slowed during the
pandemic, with 57 percent of countries having disrupted their face-to-face
data collection as of May3 2021, the need to leverage digital tools for timely
and accurate data collection has never been more acute. The Accelerator
Labs are uniquely positioned to power the transition towards digital data
collection, and make it stick!

For example, the Lab team of UNDP Uruguay tapped into Twitter data to
analyze the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccinations among the Uruguayan
population, providing the Ministry of Health with actionable data to measure
the I mpact of vaccination campaigns in real time.

2. The Labs pinpoint emerging bottlenecks that are in the

way of achieving the SDGs

Some of the roadblocks on the path to the 2030 Agenda are known. The
COVID-19 pandemic, the rise of intersecting crises and the full-fledged
climate emergency have a destructive impact on the achievement of the
Sustainable Development Goals. Equally important are emerging trends that
are complex in nature, hard to grasp on a global scale and off the radar of
most international institutions.

The UNDP Accelerator Labs are “a network of ecosystems that are
individually effective yet collectively even more powerful to address large-
scale challenges using insights gained from localized innovation and
expertise,” according to Elizabeth J. Altman and Frank Nagle in the MIT
Sloane Management Review 2020.

Every day, the 91 Accelerator Labs, covering 115 countries including 77
percent of Least Developed Countries and 66 percent of Small Island
Developing States, scan for signals of change and collect insights that are
context specific. They share intelligence across all continents in a matter of
hours to confirm emerging signals and they advance knowledge by
analyzing how these signals are woven in a complex web of interconnected
development challenges.

Informality and misinformation are two patterns that emerged from the
Lab’s work in 2022. They merit a much closer look from the international
development community as they undermine the assumption behind the
elimination of extreme poverty, a key pillar of the SDGs.

.UNDP Accelerator Labs - Annual Report 2022

With more than two billion informal workers worldwide and about 85 percent
of the economy in Africa considered informal4, a vast part of the economy in
the Global South remains under the radar of most international cooperation
initiatives. This calls for a rethink of the traditional approach to tackling
poverty. What if this popular economy could be seen as an asset rather than
a problem? By flipping this issue on its head, could we make strides on
Global Goal #1 (No poverty)?

Through ethnographic knowledge and partnerships with the informal sector
itself, the Accelerator Labs are helping UNDP open new conversations
within the UN system – notably with ILO – to imagine new pathways to
formality. The Labs are exploring hybrid models where formalization is not
the only way forward and supporting policy makers to realize the potential of
the innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem in developing countries.

 Read the deep dive on informality

Another major obstacle on the roadmap to 2030 is the quick rise of
misinformation, disinformation and hate speech online. With the intent to
tap into the collective intelligence of online users the UNDP Accelerator
Labs partnered with the Healthy Internet Project (HIP), incubated by TED,
and launched a browser extension that allows any Google Chrome user to
flag abusive content online. UNDP Accelerator Lab teams in Argentina,
Kenya, Lebanon, Namibia and Sudan helped test this tool and the concept
of crowdsourcing online moderation through a series of experiments and
pilot programs. The UNDP Accelerator Labs will continue to explore the
topic of increasing polarization in 2023 together with UNDP’s Human
Development Report Office.

3. The Labs source innovations that create wins across
economic, environmental and social aspects of the SDGs

After nearly three years in activity and running 400+ fast and agile learning
challenges, the UNDP Accelerator Labs are reaching a state of maturity.
Building on all the intelligence garnered along the way, the Network is now
starting to zoom out to observe which innovation method among the top
31 used by the Labs and their partners is best suited to tackle which
specific SDGs. Generated from action, these methodological insights are
shared publicly to inspire other actors in development and innovation
ecosystems.

 Read how the Labs are matching the SDGs with new ways of working

In addition to using innovation methods, the Labs surface solutions that are
innovative in nature, very often off the radar of most international top-down
organizations and have the potential to address multiple SDGs at once. By
virtue of looking for existing solutions that are bottom-up, scanning for early
signals of change and partnering with unusual partners that are driven by
action and anchored in specific contexts in the Global South, the Labs are
pointing towards cutting-edge sustainable development solutions as part of a
Research and Development pipeline.

Take seaweed. It is invading coastlines around the world and tends to be
overlooked. Yet it can offer alternative livelihood options, increase health
and food security (brown seaweeds are showing promise for the prevention
and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative
diseases), support adaptation strategies to the changing climate (from
sequestering methane to becoming a source for renewable biofuels) and
can even be used to build affordable houses. UNDP South Africa, powered
by its Accelerator Lab, is partnering with the Japanese Seaweed Resource
Institute to investigate this huge potential.

 Read: Japan Innovation Challenge snapshot: Seaweed in South Africa

Biowaste is another solution hiding in plain sight. Largely considered
useless, biowaste could be turned into an asset to fuel the circular economy.
The UNDP North Macedonia Accelerator Lab is looking at this solution
which could create new businesses, employment opportunities, and green
economic development as part of the City Experiment Fund (CEF) – an
initiative of UNDP and the Slovak Ministry of Finance, to support cities in the
application of innovative approaches.

Chapter 1: Using new
forms of data to catch up
with the speed of change

Over the course of three years, Accelerator Labs in more
than 100 developing countries, including most Least
Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States
have introduced 45 new kinds of data sources and used
55 innovation methods, some of which are now
mainstreamed inside UNDP.

It is time to look beyond the numbers. The Labs’ maturity
and ability to tap into granular, real-time and novel data
sources in ways most other development practitioners
have not done before, enable the Accelerator Labs to
make sense of complex problems and catch up with the
pace of change.

The Network is learning how to use innovation for
development issues spanning all 17 SDGs, at national,
sub-regional and local levels, offering a groundbreaking
overview of the best suited innovation methods to
accelerate progress toward the 2030 Agenda. An
additional benefit of this experience on the ground, is the
power of data to amplify the voices of people most
affected by the problems, include them in the decision
making and help elevate their stories instead of just
numbers.

1.1. Data that tells stories

Diversifying data sources to make sense of complex problems has been a
key pillar of the Accelerator Labs model. Since 2020, the Lab Network has
introduced 45 new kinds of data sources which allow us to catch up with
the pace of change, collect different points of view and find cost-effective
ways to understand the problems we are facing in development.

On average, each Lab tackles a learning challenge by using between four
and five different data sources. Around 90 percent of the data sources
used in the Accelerator Lab Network are new; they are collected for the
first time. This helps diversify information sources and, most importantly, to
generate data to understand development challenges where, in many cases,
there was no existing data. The Accelerator Labs play a crucial role in
bridging data gaps, advancing evidence-based policymaking and
strengthening the knowledge base for future research.

Throughout the network, the most widely used data sources in 2022 were
community-based focus groups, direct interviews and surveys. These
new sources are not only about collecting and collating quantitative
information. The Accelerator Labs are also using qualitative techniques
which create a connection with communities in meaningful and deeper ways.
Some examples include data generated by ethnography, cultural probes,
social cartography or sensemaking, which amplify the voices of those
closest to the problem.

Somalia snapshot: Using data to see “positively deviant”
communities who fare better in times of climate crisis
Finding “positively deviant” groups, communities or spaces can be like
finding a needle in a haystack. Yet, as part of the Data Powered Positive
Deviance approach which uses satellite imagery and social media data, the
Accelerator Labs and its partners are able to learn from the edges and spot
positive deviants.

In the past decade Somalia experienced
a series of cyclic droughts, and pastoral
communities were the worst hit. In 2022,
the UNDP Somalia Accelerator Lab
went into the field to continue to learn
directly from communities that have
successfully preserved their rangelands
and pastoral livelihoods. The Lab visited
multiple villages, validated information
and collected additional material from
communities. The aim is to find and
understand the factors which helped
women and men withstand the droughts
and reverse rangeland degradation, so
in future these practices and strategies
can be shared and scaled across
communities.

Tanzania deep dive: From a small AI experiment to

revolutionizing the travel experience for visitors in Zanzibar

“AI will revolutionize
the travel experience
for visitors in Zanzibar.
AI-powered solutions
can create
personalized
experiences,
increasing visitor
satisfaction and loyalty
to the destination.”
Ms. Hafsa Mbamba,
Executive Secretary of
Zanzibar Commission
for Tourism, Zanzibar

Zanzibar. The name itself evokes images of sun-drenched beaches, clear
turquoise waters and palm trees waving in a light breeze. Zanzibar has the
potential to be transformed into an upmarket and competitive tourist
destination in the Indian Ocean archipelagoes. One-time tourists however,
do not provide a sustainable economic model, so the question that must be
asked is: why do tourists love Zanzibar, but most do not return after first
visit?

In Zanzibar, only 18-20 percent of tourists return to the islands after their first
visit. If you compare that with Thailand’s return rate of 60 percent, it’s clear
that there is room for improvement. Zanzibar cannot only rely on its first-time
visitors to build a sustainable tourism economy. Tourism is the main industry
that connects all other economic sectors in Zanzibar. Travel and tourism
created over 1.3 million jobs and accounts for 28 percent of the GDP.

The available data, however, is outdated; for example, the International
Visitor Exit Study is only done periodically (last in 2017), and the National
Census is conducted only every 10 years. UNDP Tanzania, powered by its
Accelerator Lab, designed experiments to imagine how decision makers
in the tourism industry can see, in a structured way and near real-time, what
works and what doesn’t for visitors on the Zanzibar islands.

Analyzing compliments and complaints online
The Tanzania Accelerator Lab partnered with XSenseAI, a Tanzanian AI
company and the Zanzibar Commission for tourism (ZCT) to build an AI
algorithm which uses data scraping, analysis, interpretation and visualization
of the compliments and complaints left by tourists on websites such as Trip
Advisor and Booking.com.

After the Tanzania Lab team networked with experts at the Artificial
Intelligence for Collective Intelligence workshop in Doha in June (see call out
box below), the Lab and the machine learning engineers of XSenseAI
teamed up with the Two Sigma Data Clinic, Accern and the Qatar
Computing Research Institute's Social Computing Department (QCRI) of the
Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU).

Powering the government to design 21st century tourism
Tapping into this new form of data revealed that 75 percent of complaints
were about food in the hotels. It was a problem no one knew existed! And,
for the first time, this data has been shared back to help hotels, restaurants,
tour operators and tourist governing boards make more informed decisions
to improve the tourists’ experiences.

This new AI-powered model has many advantages: speed, accuracy,
automation, scalability, adaptability and improved insights. The model is
capable of analyzing data and even uncovering hidden patterns and
relationships that might not be immediately obvious, leading to new insights
and opportunities. It gives feedback in real-time (up to five minutes) while
conventional research can take up to three months. Currently, the
experimental model is being finalized for handover to the government in
Zanzibar to inform tourism investments.

Advancing artificial intelligence to get smarter together for people
and the planet
Development organizations and leading minds in data science from
around the world gathered together for the Artificial Intelligence for
Collective Intelligence (AI4CI) workshop in Doha, in June 2022. AI4CI
was jointly organized with the Social Computing Group at Qatar
Computing Research Institute (QCRI), UNDP Innovation in the Arab
States, and 15 UNDP Accelerator Labs from Colombia, India,
Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan,
Syria, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda and Uruguay.

The aim was to advance UNDP’s efforts to leverage collective
intelligence for sustainable development, under the theme “Getting
Smarter Together for People and Planet.” By diversifying the ways in
which development problems are understood, we can unearth new
insights, even potentially marking a move towards real-time intelligence
for better, faster, more accurate problem solving.

Energy deep dive: Learning from #PeoplePowered sustainable
energy solutions

UNDP’s Strategic Plan has set a target to mobilize partnerships for
sustainable, reliable and affordable energy to 500 million people. For 20
weeks in 2022, the Accelerator Labs launched #PeoplePowered, a
campaign aimed at surfacing grassroots solutions for energy conservation,
augmentation, generation, storage and distribution to learn about the
solutions of people to combat energy poverty.

Together with the Honey Bee Network, the Accelerator Labs engaged their
innovation ecosystems to source over 200 grassroots energy solutions
mapped during the 20-week and to identify weak signals of change in
sustainable energy access.

The Labs surfaced:

• 239 grassroots energy solutions mapped during the 20-week
campaign, for a total of 350 energy solutions from more than 48
countries.

• 95 solar-powered solutions, predominantly in Latin America and Fiji
• 76 thermal-powered solutions from across Africa and in Panama;
• and 82 clean cooking solutions mostly from Asia and Africa,
opening opportunities for cross-country learning and adoption.

The Accelerator Labs worked closely with UNDP’s Sustainable Energy
Hub as well as with the Columbia University School of International and
Public Affairs (SIPA) on the report, “Understanding the transformative
potential of grassroots energy solutions.”

1.2. Innovation to make decision making more
inclusive

In 2022, the Accelerator Lab Network continued to integrate innovation
methods into UNDP programming as part of the call to reimagine
development for the 21st century.

Notably, including and increasing peoples’ voices in decision making is a
key approach embraced by the 91 Accelerator Labs on the ground. In fact, it
is central to how the Network operates. By using collective intelligence
methods such as citizen science or micro surveys, the Labs are helping
build more participatory development strategies and this is being
mainstreamed inside UNDP. As of the end of 2022, 90 percent of the
UNDP Country Offices with the presence of an Accelerator Lab use
collective intelligence in their programmatic work.

New innovation methods also emerged in 2022. They help make inroads
towards systems transformation. For instance, by using micro narratives
the Labs are able to surface the experience of individuals through
storytelling, and they tap into the power of social network analysis to
observe patterns and connections by mapping complex interactions and
relationships to understand system dynamics.

Based on three years of experience: matching the SDGs with
new ways of working
Over the course of three years, the Accelerator Labs have used 55
innovation methods 1,600 times in 400 learning challenges — think
“units of work.” This has enabled the Network to learn how to use innovation
for the SDGs on the ground at an exceptional scale and speed. These
learning challenges are broad (spanning all 17 SDGs) and deep (specific to
each national, sub-regional or even local context), and provide a robust data
set to learn which innovation method has been more used for each SDG.

The next page showcases a heat map highlighting the connection between
the 31 innovation methods most used by the Accelerator Labs and the 17
SDGs. This groundbreaking overview could become a proxy to identify the

best suited innovation methods to accelerate progress toward the 2030
Agenda.

Collective intelligence is now a way of working mainstreamed within
UNDP. For example, it is often used to capture opportunities related to
decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). UNDP Colombia, powered by
its Accelerator Lab worked on an open challenge to identify, recognize and
reward innovative and transformative initiatives that contribute to the
increase in formalization of businesses in the country.

Community asset mapping has proven useful for policymakers to
introduce new ways of understanding multidimensional poverty (SDG1) and
to identify resources and strengths of local communities when needing to
build more sustainable and resilient cities (SDG 11). For example, the UNDP
Thailand Accelerator Lab undertook the use of asset mapping in two pilot
communities and was able to co-create a tourism management model that
puts local communities at the center. Their experiment improved the
environmental conservation awareness of the community and had positive
ripple effects on the management of waste.

Guinea Bissau Snapshot: Helping institutions reach people
where they are
Using behavioral science and ethnography, the UNDP Guinea Bissau
Accelerator Lab and partners tested out mobile justice units to reach
people in remote areas with legal aid as well as civil registration, a core right
that opens the door to education and other opportunities. The experiment
provided legal aid to 1,315 people and registered 1,656 people across seven

Argentina deep dive: bringing citizen science to the national

stage
“Pinch me, I cannot believe it is happening,” said Marcelo García Rodríguez,
Professor at the National University of Córdoba in Argentina to Maria
Verónica Moreno, UNDP Argentina Head of Solutions Mapping, as they both
shared the stage at the Argentina Ministry of Science, Technology, and
Innovation to launch the National Citizen Science Program.

Citizen data complements official governmental data
A few years ago, Marcelo finished his PhD in the United States and came
back to his own country, Argentina, to dedicate his time and passion to
science. Aside from his job as a professor, Marcelo is a fierce believer in
promoting the participation of youth and citizens in large in scientific work.

He founded MATTEO, a local initiative that empowers students of all ages to
collect hydrometeorological information, such as rain data, to optimize water
resources management. These eager volunteers, located in remote villages
near Córdoba, collect environmental data that would otherwise not exist and
fill the gaps of official public measurements. To date, MATTEO has helped
collect data in five provinces of Argentina as well as in Perú, the United
States and Colombia, involving more than 1,000 scientists and citizens
without formal training.

This citizen generated data can help anticipate floods and more broadly
equip policy makers with more accurate information to mitigate the effects of
other environmental risks such as droughts, fires, or pollution.

“This democratic and
participatory way of
doing science will
surely result in more
varied and effective
solutions to people’s
real problems and will
help promote federal
public policies that
improve the quality of
life of society as a
whole.”
Daniel Filmus,
Argentina Minister of
Science, Technology,
and Innovation

Flash floods in particular affect Argentina's central and northern regions
every year. In the province of Córdoba, nearly 400 water monitoring stations
are in place, but technical estimations indicate that there should be five
times more state-of-the-art automatic weather stations to monitor accurately
the vast region during a rain event. Data recorded by the communities with
simpler instruments help fill this gap in a much more affordable way.

From a small-scale experiment to a National Citizen Science Program
Marcelo’s grassroots initiative is part of 55 citizen science solutions mapped
jointly by the UNDP Argentina Accelerator Lab and the Ministry of Science
Technology, and Innovation. What started in 2020 as a small-scale
experiment to use citizen sensing to measure changes in air quality in
Buenos Aires has since scaled to reach more than 15,000 citizens involved
in collective intelligence projects related to 11 Global Goals. In fact, any
citizen science hero, like Marcelo, can now submit their initiative directly on
the Ministry’s website.

In October 2022, the Ministry announced the creation of a National Citizen
Science Program, in the presence of Marcelo, UNDP Argentina and
government representatives, including Daniel Filmus, Argentina’s Minister of
Science, Technology, and Innovation who shared that “research is not only
done in laboratories, but we can all be part of it. This democratic and
participatory way of doing science will surely result in more varied and
effective solutions to people’s real problems and will help promote federal
public policies that improve the quality of life of society as a whole.”

Scaling citizen science across the country
As part of this National Program, an open call for funding citizen science
projects was announced – opening, for the first time, public resources to
these types of collective intelligence initiatives. UNDP Argentina, powered
by its Labs, developed two experiments to test environmental citizen science
solutions with four local governments, and the city of Buenos Aires is
currently developing citizen science pilot projects for 60 public schools.

Chapter 2: Embedding
innovation for more
inclusive programming and
policy making

The Accelerator Labs continue to be prolific and contribute

to publicly available knowledge on sustainable

development. In 2022, they published 238 blogs in six

languages, and more than 50 knowledge products on

topics such as citizen science, futures thinking,

digitalization, informality and solutions mapping.

By being on-the-ground and agile experts on a wide range

of innovation methods, the Labs are best positioned to

advise and support government partners to address a vast

range of development issues from the bottom up.

The Labs are testing and scaling new solutions and are

embedding new ways of working inside governmental

bodies with the support of academia, private sector actors,

civil society organizations and grassroots communities.

In 2022, two out of three Accelerator Labs have
worked with governments to improve innovation policy
or capability. By doing so, the Network is supporting the

inclusion and participation of citizens in decision-making

processes.

2.1. Scaling innovative digital solutions to leave no
one behind

By design, the UNDP Accelerator Labs are committed to leveraging digital
technology to better grasp social, economic and environmental phenomena.
Integrating new technology and moving towards real-time data collection
also helps senior decision makers to keep up with an accelerated pace of
change. As COVID-19 exacerbated the need for digitalization, the UNDP
Accelerator Labs have been experimenting with innovative and inclusive
ways of bringing governments, informal businesses and the most vulnerable
population into the digital spotlight.

Namibia snapshot: Digitizing public services
The UNDP Namibia Accelerator Lab responded to demand from the Office
of the Prime Minister to digitize the manual paper-based process of
collecting data on declaration of interests in the public service. The team
collaborated with 350 public servants to co-design this new digital process
and understand the main issues such as poor response rates and duplicate
submissions. The collaboration demonstrated how digital tools support
increased transparency and accountability. The new, simplified forms are
being rolled out to three additional ministries: the Ministry of Home Affairs,
Immigration and Security, and the Ministry of Health and Social Services,
with plans to implement across the entire public service in 2023.

2.2. Embedding innovation into the public sector

Public sector innovation leads to developing creative solutions to address
problems in government. It's important for achieving the SDGs as it
prioritizes local needs and improves citizens’ lives through effective and
efficient public services.

In 2022, UNDP Accelerator Labs in 51 countries worked with
governments to improve innovation policy or capability. In a non-exhaustive
count, the Labs worked with over 4,300 civil servants in the Global South to
elevate innovation skills. Through this work, UNDP is either directly
supporting national innovation policy like in the Dominican Republic and Viet
Nam or helping with the establishment of an innovation lab inside the public
sector, such as in Ecuador and Burkina Faso.

The number of Labs involved in embedding innovation into the public sector
doubled since 2021, signaling a growth in government demand. In the past
two years, 22 new public sector labs have been incubated with the help
of the Accelerator Labs. Decision makers are increasingly keen on exploring
areas in which the Labs excel: network learning, collective intelligence,
foresight, frugal innovation and positive deviance to name a few, to tackle
societal challenges.

volunteer program of 300 young people operates as a
“mini lab” to identify local problems and innovative
solutions. The program also boosts young people’s
employability by providing them with a range of skills and
experience through their involvement in ongoing
innovation projects such as creating a mobile app for
tracking epidemics, recycling plastic waste into building
materials and providing solar-powered lighting to rural
communities.

Ecosystem in Kenya features a foreword from Kenya’s President.

This research highlights urgent steps required to unlock the potential of the
ecosystem of young Kenyan innovators and makes the case for an
Innovation Fund and a National Innovation Strategy, policy guidance and
investments on Intellectual Property Management and more coordination
among Government Ministries. Among the findings:



46 percent of more than 200 innovation centers mapped are in
Nairobi,

almost 63 percent of startups are less than three years old,
 while 80 percent of new companies fold before three years of

operation, signaling areas for government strategy in order to grow
the innovation ecosystem in Kenya.

of activity, Thinkia has supported the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock to
prototype an instrument to improve hemp production and public regulation
processes, developed an online course on open, public and social
innovation and supported the city of Quito to set up its own Social
Laboratory.

Addressing output 3:
Establishment of a global
learning and scaling
network.

Chapter 3: We have let 1,000
flowers bloom, it’s time for
harvesting!

As the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network matures, so does
its ability to connect the dots globally, strengthen its
influence in the development ecosystem and make strides
in finding new solutions to thorny, complex problems in an
uncertain world.

From using drones to recover faster from a natural disaster
(read the “Drone for Development” snapshot) to joining
regional forces to push forward a gender equality agenda
or leveraging groundbreaking AI capabilities to beat air
pollution (see India’s deep dive), the Labs are firing on all
cylinders and are a testament that well executed, agile and
out-of-the-box experiments can lead to large scale
regulatory action.

The knowledge they create is receiving an increased
amount of attention from development and innovation
actors, among which are the Harvard University Business
School and the European Commission’s Joint Research
Center. People, professionals and institutions are looking
to the Labs.

Yet the Network’s collective intelligence is more than the
sum of its parts. When the Labs start to make sense of
patterns and turn them into insights, they are giving life to
a global learning and scaling network capable of
developing groundbreaking value propositions that are so
desperately needed to rescue the Global Goals.

3.1. The Network Effect: sharing what we’ve
learned

The continuous use of WhatsApp messages, intra-network exchanges and
social media facilitate the rapid and transparent exchanges of ideas inside
the Network, with their partners and with the people they work with on the
ground. One spark can start a fire, and these sparks occur across the global
network. Thanks to the Network’s sharing culture and decentralized means
of communications, a learning from one Lab can be shared with and used by
other Labs in a matter of minutes. This helps fast track action so Labs build
on existing knowledge rather than creating it from scratch, and more
importantly it helps connect the dots globally and formalizes actionable
insights that address development challenges beyond country-specific
contexts.

Latin America and the Caribbean snapshot: Learning regionally
about misinformation and citizen engagement and informality
In the Latin America region, UNDP powered by its Accelerator Labs in eight
countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Guatemala,
Panama, Peru, and Uruguay) reflected on innovative ways to turn off the
taps of false information flows in the region and to reduce the reach and
impact of these flows.

Thirteen Labs in the region introduced a new way to engage citizens and
collect their perspectives for policy dialogue and solving development
challenges. Collective intelligence methods such as citizen-generated data
and crowdsourcing are shown to be powerful tools for turbo-charging more
traditional citizen engagement mechanisms. And Labs in UNDP Argentina,
Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Paraguay reflected on how to tackle the
issues surrounding widespread informality (in some countries in the region,
70 or 80 percent of workers are informal).

Arab States snapshot: Learning about how to
advance women in STEM
With the support of several Accelerator Labs in the
region, the Regional Innovation Team in the Arab States

initiative. 4YFN is a start-up platform for female tech-
entrepreneurs working on the SDGs. Accelerator Labs
in Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine,
Somalia, Sudan, and Saudi Arabia came together to
work with the Regional Innovation Team in the Arab
States on implementing the program. In its first two
rounds, the program delivered over 500 hours of one-to-
one mentorship to women-led, digital start-ups in 16
countries in the region.

Small Island Developing States snapshot: Joining forces to
combat shared concerns
The 14 UNDP Accelerator Labs in Small Islands Developing States (SIDS),
with support from the SIDS team at UNDP, regularly meet as part of their
own “mini-network” to exchange knowledge, build collaboration and inspire
each other, as many SIDS face similar challenges. One example of this
cross-country collaboration which happened in 2022 is the UNDP Haiti
Accelerator Lab working together with the Lab in the Dominican Republic
to explore ways to improve waste management at a binational market
located at the border of both countries. Plastic waste is a main challenge,
and the Labs are working together on recycling mechanisms and partnering
with companies to replace single-use plastic.

Colombia snapshot: Drones for Development
When Hurricane IOTA hit Providence Island in November 2021 almost
800km north-west of mainland Colombia, nearly all homes and commercial
buildings were devasted. With the support of the Accelerator Lab team,
UNDP Colombia flew to the archipelago equipped with drones and 360
cameras to accelerate the mapping of the affected areas and support the
government to build an accurate early recovery strategy.

In taking and analyzing aerial photographs of
1,241 infrastructure units, UNDP Colombia,
powered by its Lab, was able to get a faster
and more accurate diagnosis of the
hurricane’s impact, cutting the need for time-
consuming on-site visits. It also helped guide
recovery efforts by enhancing the traditional
House and Building Damage Assessment
delivered by the UNDP Crisis Bureau. Since
this diagnostic tool is publicly available, the
population can see with great accuracy and
transparency how resources are invested to
rebuild.

In addition, the Lab team mainstreamed these skills by training 20 UNDP
colleagues to become drone pilots and learn photogrammetry, the art and
science of extracting 3D information from photographs. This forms the basis
of a new “Drones for Development” programme which will be used for
recovery efforts, land tenure, cadaster and area mapping. They also
extended their support to UNDP Dominican Republic after hurricane Fiona
hit the island in September 2022 by bringing 360-degree cameras and
drones, sharing their learning and supporting the recovery response on the
ground.

3.2. Engaging with & influencing the broader
development ecosystem

Three years after its initial launch, the influence of the Labs continues to
grow and to be recognized by the development ecosystem, which publicly
acknowledges the work of the Labs globally, regionally and nationally.
Recognition by government partners, development and innovation actors
means the Labs’ experiments and expertise are valuable to the wider
ecosystem and are supporting the goal of becoming the world’s fastest and
largest learning network on sustainable development challenges.

From policy makers to UN organizations, private sector, NGOs, academia
and beyond, the Accelerator Labs’ knowledge is becoming a resource
for prestigious actors such as Harvard University Business School (see
below’s snapshot for details) or the European Commission’s Joint Research
Center who picked up on the UNDP Serbia Accelerator Lab’s work on
mapping diasporas using Google Trends.

Harvard University Business School Snapshot: the Labs as an
inspiration for corporate innovation models
The Harvard University Business School now teaches the case study

“Strategic Innovation at the United Nations: A Network of
Ecosystems,” which focuses on the Accelerator Labs and their impact at
UNDP. The case study is currently being taught to second-year Harvard
MBA students in the Innovations, Strategy and Technology class, most of
which have careers in the private sector. The case study focuses on how
UNDP succeeded in building a network of ecosystems of innovation, which
is presented as a valuable inspiration for corporate innovation models.

The Lab also conducted a broadcast television experiment by airing an all-
women TV show about politics and power to contend with generic male-only
shows. It garnered a massive TV audience and at least 160,000 people
online. The Lab demonstrated how to create a “norm” of gender inclusion
that offsets media and perception bias against women in politics.

UNDP brought together the World Institute on Disability and The Global
Alliance of Assistive Technology Organizations, the private sector, academia
and government partners during a webinar called “The Future We Create,”
to exchange good practices, discuss challenges and identify solutions on
innovation that support disability-inclusive development. In attendance were
also members of other UN agencies such as the World Food Programme,
UNICEF, UNFPA and UN Women.

In recognition of their contribution to this field, two Heads of Solutions
Mapping of the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network were invited. Paulina

at risk. Photo: Let me Breathe, with

support from UNDP Business and

Human Rights Asia Program and the

European Union.

India deep dive: Scaling an AI-model to combat air pollution
India's booming construction industry relies heavily on brick kilns, which
provide the majority of the country's building materials, but the industry's
practices have devastating effects on both people and the environment.
India is the second largest producer of bricks in the world, and the sector
consumes 40 million tons of coal per year. In the Indian State of Bihar, brick
kilns are responsible for 14 percent of air pollution. Although in 2017 the
Central Pollution Control Board of India mandated brick kilns to switch to a
less-polluting design, only about 70 percent of brick kilns in Bihar have made
the switch, and many of them are in remote areas that are hard to monitor.

It doesn’t stop with air pollution. Brick manufacturing puts very vulnerable
workers’ health at risk, causes soil degradation, groundwater depletion and
the kilns are hotspots for child and bonded labor.

In fact, the UNDP India Accelerator Lab first learned of the University of
Nottingham's research on tackling hotspots of modern-day slavery in the
brick manufacturing sector. They were proposing a new methodology using
artificial intelligence -- machine learning algorithms and geospatial analytics
-- to map the entire brick kiln belt in India, which could then be used by the
Bihar State Pollution Control Board to better target monitoring efforts.

GeoAI has increased
the efficiency of
government efforts to
monitor and enforce
pollution regulations by
over 40 percent.

When a small experiment leads to regulatory action
The India Accelerator Lab and the University of Nottingham’s Rights Lab put
their heads together to see how the brick kilns could be mapped. The Board
expressed concern about the large number of brick kilns and limited staff to
conduct field verifications on compliance. To address this, AI and data layers
were added to the model, and citizen science volunteers were brought in to
produce training datasets for AI algorithms. The result was the GeoAI
technology platform that is the first AI-driven effort to monitor air pollution in
India.

GeoAI is a novel approach combining geospatial technologies and artificial
intelligence to detect exact locations of brick kilns and classify them on
degree of environmental compliance. It brings together coordinated action
from diverse stakeholders – regulators, government agencies, civil society,
and volunteer groups to tackle the complexity around brick kilns. Using

GeoAI in the State of Bihar, the total number of brick
kilns was brought down to a manageable number for
staff to inspect. Around 7,500 brick kilns were first
analyzed by GeoAI, and it was determined that 1,655
kilns were high risk. Environmental regulators were
then able to complete an inspection of 1,013 of those
which led to the green transition of 1,000 brick kilns
and the reduction of 500,000 tons of CO2 per
annum (equivalent of 100,000 gasoline vehicles).

Going forward, with the GeoAI platform, the Bihar
Pollution Control Board will be able to monitor almost
9,000 brick kilns across the state. The platform helps
regulators report violations of relevant laws and
regulations, including human rights and access to
social security. It brings together regulators,
government agencies, civil society and volunteer

groups to take coordinated action and address the complexity around brick
kilns.

Scaling impact beyond India
Building on this successful experiment, UNDP India is now scaling out this
platform to two additional Indian states and Nepal has already voiced
interest in using the platform to beat air pollution.
The India Lab continues to work on the development of a cutting-edge digital
stack to scale this experiment up by providing open data and digital
infrastructure around air pollution, which will include vehicular pollution and
crop burning. The Lab's initiative is also scaling deep as it is becoming a
case study for educating Indian policymakers on the application of AI for
development challenges of large scale.

3.3 Learning through a network of ecosystems

The ability of the Network to accelerate progress toward the Global Goals
hinges on its capability to learn what works, in what contexts, for whom, and
how – within each Lab, between the Labs and with the wider development
ecosystem.

There is no simple way to do this. The aim is to measure and incentivize
networked learning on four levels:

• National: Within each Accelerator Lab, they test hypotheses, map

solutions and validate new ideas.

• Horizontal: Each Lab is an ecosystem and shares knowledge with

other actors in their local environment, setting up learning
partnerships nationally, spreading social innovation and looking
into local challenges.

• Vertical: The Accelerator Labs feed the knowledge gained in their
country work by sharing it with UNDP and the wider UN system in
country as well as with other government institutions. In 2022, virtual
and in person exchanges have been very vibrant, with 49 weekly
global calls and four in person regional retreats held in Istanbul,
Addis Ababa, Panama City, and Aman.

• Networked learning: Given the range of development problems

and solutions explored by the Network of Labs,
they contribute to seeing new patterns
or programming ideas, new insights
and value propositions, as highlighted
in the following two pages
on the topic of informality.

.UNDP Accelerator Labs - Annual Report 2022

A snapshot of Labs’ initiatives in

informality. This work transcends
technological, economic, institutional

and other systems.

Informality deep dive: from mapping patterns to surfacing
unique insights
In 2022, with Network learning in motion, the UNDP Accelerator Lab
Network continued its learning focus on the informal economy, a
phenomenon at global scale – two billion workers world-wide, yet lacking
policy options that recognize the innovation and entrepreneurship that
occurs in the informal sector.

A growing number of Labs are working on digitalization initiatives for the
informal sector. For example, the UNDP South Sudan Accelerator Lab is
working on digitalizing the traditional solidarity-based saving scheme called
‘Sanduk-Sanduk’ which is helping Sudanese women plan savings and raise
start-up capital. Labs in Uganda and Barbados are working on e-
commerce platforms, increasing the productivity of informal vendors and
enabling them to access online markets.

In Guinea, the Accelerator Lab has tested the use of images in banking
apps to improve financial literacy among women, bringing the unbanked
population closer to the benefits of digital payments. And on the educational
front, the UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab, along with leading
universities in the country, are measuring the impact of online micro-
credentials skills training and the feasibility of incentivizing such programs as
part of formal education in the country.

These patterns led the Network to redefine its R&D topic to focus more on
the intersection between digitalization and informality.

.UNDP Accelerator Labs - Annual Report 2022
.UNDP Accelerator Labs - Annual Report 2022

Expanding the edge of knowledge on the intersection of digitalization
and informality
As a contribution to the knowledge available on this global phenomena, the
Network is creating new knowledge on what it means to go digital within the
sector and the opportunities and risks digitalization brings to the informal
economy.

Using a systems mapping approach, the Network is exploring the drivers
and effects of digitalization in informal businesses and the role that the
private sector, governments, cooperatives and small and medium enterprise
(SME) associations play in jumpstarting digitalization. In addition, the
Network is looking into the relationship between digitalization and
formalization and how digitalization is shifting the formalization process for
businesses.

These insights are enabling the Network to develop new value propositions
to better support the informal sector—from using digital data, tools and
platforms to connect farmers, informal traders and business owners to better
credit and (group) savings schemes, to working with the International Labour
Organization (ILO) via a global UNDP-ILO partnership to develop alternative
pathways to formalization.

Three main insights
on the intersection of
digitalization and informality

1. Digitalization may be shifting how formalization of business

occurs. Governments can create enabling policy environments for
digitalization. But the private sector, by developing digital products,
may help informal businesses organically opt into elements of
formalization, such as tracking expenses, paying invoices and
securing loans.

2. Achieving formality is more of a “messy continuum” than an “on/off”
switch. Traditionally, a business registration indicates whether a
business is or isn’t formal. In the digital world, however, an informal
business can transact on WhatsApp, secure loans on another app
and find customers on Facebook, without seeking formal
registration.

3. Becoming formal may be non-linear and composed of “micro

pathways.” Again, the typical path to formalization is familiar— you
start a business, register it, secure licenses, make money and then
pay taxes. But with digital tools like WhatsApp, an informal business
can advertise its products and services, generating enough demand
for customers to start requesting formal receipts or quality assurance
guarantees — familiar signs of formality.

Network continues to catch the interest of a wide range of
partners. To date, the Network has created 1,502
partnerships from academia, private sector,
governmental partners, United Nations entities and civil
society. Among the partnerships that the Network creates
are “unusual suspects,” such as innovation hubs, mobile
phone operators, start-ups offering data, tech or digital
products and services (e.g., drone or satellite imaging
companies), informal sector groups (e.g., vendor
associations, women’s market collectives, waste pickers)
and social enterprises.

As reported in the independent Midterm Evaluation (2021),
the UNDP Accelerator Labs “convene unusual suspects to
gain a full system view on development problems.”
Unusual partners bring in new insights and help to
broaden the conversation. New partners also play into the
forms of data and innovation methods the Labs are using
to boost knowledge of ecosystems and stakeholders.
Through engaging with these actors, the Labs are bringing
disruption and learning into UNDP Country Offices.

The Accelerator Labs’ partners help the teams spearhead
new experiments, tap into novel data sources and
experiential knowledge, enabling UNDP to translate
these learnings into cutting-edge new value propositions
for UNDP and beyond. Partners help the Network in
facilitating the scaling of innovation by embedding new
ways to work inside governmental bodies and through
influencing policy makers and partners in the innovation
landscape.

Over time, the Labs have started to bring in new funding
and in-kind resources through partners in each country.

According to a survey with UNDP Country Offices, the type
of partnerships that the Accelerator Labs bring to UNDP
are their biggest value. UNDP partnerships with the
private sector have emerged at the core of the
Accelerator Labs model. In fact, more than a third of all
private sector partnerships are with new partners and
nearly one out of two partners from civil society are
new to UNDP.

Beyond the added value each Lab brings to its UNDP
Country Office and national partners, the global Network
itself creates and curates a wide range of practical
knowledge and globally actionable insights, increasing
value both with and for partners.

4.1. Partnering across the UN Development
System

In 2022, the Accelerator Labs established 69 partnerships with UN sister
agencies, more than 1 out of 10 partnerships reported during the year. This
reflects the demand for the capability of the UNDP Accelerator Labs across
the UN system including with UNICEF, UN Women, UNFPA, IOM, ILO,
UNCDF, ITU, FAO, UN UNIVERSITY and UNHCR.

According to a study led by UN Women in Bolivia (2021), only 20 percent of
women access finance and only 30 percent of saving accounts are held by
women. In this context, the UNDP Bolivia Accelerator Lab partnered with
UN Women and two Bolivian fintech start-ups to test out new financial
inclusion solutions for women entrepreneurs and vulnerable groups.

UNDP Somalia, powered by its Accelerator Lab, is partnering with UNFPA
(United Nations Population Fund) to improve and redesign several youth
centers across the country to better equip youth for the jobs of tomorrow, in
areas like the digital economy, innovation and research.

The Dajabón River, also called Massacre River, at the border between the
Dominican Republic and Haiti is a significant water source for the
northwestern part of the island. A binational produce market operates at the
cross point, increasing the negative environmental footprint on the river and
triggering possible conflicts between communities living at this border. The
UNDP Dominican Republic Accelerator Lab and IOM (International
Organization for Migration) are collaborating on testing new ways to collect
data, such as community asset mapping, which can help identify potential
emerging opportunities in the binational market area.

4.2. Private sector partners

The UNDP Ghana Accelerator Lab and the bank
Societe Generale Ghana PLC (SG Ghana) encourage
and support innovators, especially small businesses led
by youth, women and persons with disabilities.
The partnership created a tailored program, including
mentorship, business-to-business matching and pitching
masterclasses to connect innovators with investors and
markets.
Meet one of these women entrepreneurs, Nana Yaa
Manu Adjei, who produces eco-friendly cosmetics and
detergents and has grown her business by 50 percent
just under a year after being enrolled in the program.

The UNDP Panama Accelerator Lab partnered with
Coca-Cola FEMSA, a bottling distributor, to improve
waste management through recycling in Tonosí. Coca-
Cola FEMSA invited the Accelerator Lab to analyze the

we developed an
implementation plan
for aquaculture using
Japanese technology
by utilizing South
Africa's abundant
seaweed resources.
By conducting a trial in
the coming phase, we
hope to demonstrate
this solution will lead to
improving the
livelihood of local
communities.”

South Africa snapshot: Unlocking seaweed solutions, a
multiplier effect across the Goals
The seaweed sector is highly underdeveloped in South Africa, despite its
potential to create wins across the Goals: seaweed farming can contribute to
economic growth and job creation, bring health benefits, strengthen food
security, and introduce adaptation strategies to the devasting impact of
climate change on life below water. The government says the ocean’s
resources have the potential to contribute to up to $10 billion dollars to the
country’s GDP by 2033. With the length of coastline and number of endemic
species, seaweed could play a pivotal role in this burgeoning blue economy
while accelerating SDG progress in South Africa.

Through the Japan SDG Innovation Challenge, the UNDP South Africa
Accelerator Lab and the Japan Seaweed Research Institute designed a pilot
to test low-tech, low-cost seaweed cultivation techniques that can provide
alternative livelihood options to coastal communities. This partnership
created actionable intelligence on the most suitable species for cultivation
based on market opportunities in Japan, grow rates and ease of cultivation.
It also opened the door to developing relationships with Japanese firms to
create a local market for seaweed products and to support local
entrepreneurs.

About the Japan SDGs Innovation Challenge
Since 2020, the Japan SDGs Innovation Challenge has convened the UNDP Accelerator Labs, the UNDP Japan Unit
and the advisory of the Japan Innovation Network (JIN), funded by the Japanese Cabinet Office to generate learning
exchanges between seven Labs, the Japanese private sector, and business federations like Keidanren, one of the largest
in Japan. Successful experiments range from a seaweed cultivation project in South Africa (above) to a spice blockchain
solution developed in India. A new cohort of Labs was selected in 2022: Samoa and Start Up Sea Corp. (Tototo Leather)
will focus on creating high quality leather products out of fish waste, and Zimbabwe and Pegara, a company specializing
in AI technologies, will zoom in on food security.

4.3. Knowledge partners

Knowledge partners may take many forms, be they universities, groups of
local activists or informal workers, or think tanks. They all join the Labs at a
local, regional and global level to advance knowledge on sustainable
development.

In 2022, the Accelerator Lab Network positioned its global research agenda
on informality. By working with leading universities and research centers,
the Network combines the Labs’ experiential knowledge with the rigor of
academic research to feed UNDP and the broader development ecosystem
with actionable insights.

The Network has been exploring the intersection between informality and
digitalization, identifying what drives digitalization in informal businesses and
what effect it has on the formalization process. As part of this stream of
work, a new research partnership was signed in 2022 with Utrecht
University, the University of Johannesburg, and the MIT Sloan School
of Management to start understanding the relationship between informal
businesses, digitalization and innovation in Africa. In addition, the Network
continued its partnership with New Cities’ Global Network for Popular
Transportation to dig deeper into the informal urban transportation systems
of the Global South and learn about a new facet of the informal economy.
 Read the Informality deep dive

In 2022, the Network extended its partnership with the Honey Bee Network
and Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs
(SIPA) to keep exploring bottom-up, lead user, frugal and grassroots
innovations specifically in sustainable energy.

4.4. New and unusual partners help us learn from
the edge

As reflected in the independent Midterm Evaluation, “the Labs’ ability to
prioritize local relationships with unusual subjects over the usual big players
in the development sector is positively shifting practice towards grassroots
local solutions and ownership.” For instance, the Accelerator Labs partnered
in 2022 with a range of new private organizations, groups of informal actors
and cutting-edge academic centers to make strides on the following
sustainable development challenges:

• Working towards increasing food resilience in Mauritius and
Seychelles with three different farming associations, Val D'En
Dor, Seychelles Farming Association and FALCON Association. As
both islands rely heavily on imported processed foods and are
struggling to build local capacity to produce and consume locally,
the Lab decided to partner with these farms to get a better
understanding of the real issues being felt and dealt with on the
ground by these communities.

• Devising new ways to reach gender equity with Quilt AI in India,

a firm that converts millions of data signals into human
understanding. The UNDP India Accelerator Lab partnered with
Quilt AI to study the gendered nature of unpaid care work and
identify how to best change behaviors among men and boys to
increase their acceptance of and responsibility towards unpaid care
work.

The UNDP Philippines Accelerator Lab

and behavioral design agency KindMind

developed a campaign to shift attitudes

and encourage climate action.

• Understanding the consumers’ sentiments towards reducing
single-use plastics and marine pollution with KindMind in the
Philippines. The UNDP Philippines Accelerator Lab partnered
with KindMind, a behavioral design agency, to analyze a large
amount of social media conversations on the topic of plastic waste.
The wealth of insights uncovered enabled the team to develop
behavioral communications (see visuals) to shift attitudes and
encourage action towards more sustainable consumption patterns
and a zero-waste life. The study reached over 434,000 Facebook
users across the Philippines.

• Understanding what drives people to consume or combat

misinformation online:

The Busara Center for Behavioral Economics, a
research and advisory firm based in Kenya, led a live
experimental demonstration of the Healthy Internet Project
web browser plug in, in collaboration with the UNDP Kenya
Accelerator Lab, and the Healthy Internet Project
incubated at TED. Their joint research allowed for a better
understanding of a user’s motivations to voluntarily flag
misinformation online.
The Bunge & Born Foundation is an Argentinian nonprofit
organization focused on developing innovative, scalable and
evidence-based solutions in education, science, culture and
public health. UNDP Argentina, powered by its
Accelerator Lab, partnered with the Bunge & Born
Foundation to research the sources of misinformation
related to COVID-19 and the demographic factors leading to
vaccine mistrust and avoidance.

Chapter 5: Reaching New
Audiences & Winning
Awards

In 2022 the UNDP Accelerator Labs reached new levels of

media traction, branching out to new audiences beyond the

core target group of sustainable development practitioners.

5.1 for Tomorrow: the award-winning
documentary

The UNDP Accelerator Labs together with Hyundai Motor
Company released “for Tomorrow: the Documentary”
(available on Amazon Prime and YouTube) in September 2022.

Chapter 6: A Look Ahead,
towards a continuous

Building on a growing track record of results in changing
the way UNDP delivers, invests in and thinks about
development, the UNDP Accelerator Labs continue to
create new forms of actionable insights to understand and
solve 21st century development problems in 115 countries
around the world, including most Least Developed
Countries and Small Island Developing States.

As outlined in this report covering a selection of
exploratory work underway, the Labs are approaching
development from the bottom up by mapping thousands of
solutions and empowering grassroots partners on the
frontlines. They are exploring complex development issues
such as informal economies and air pollution and translate
this learning into cutting-edge new value propositions.
They are facilitating the scaling of innovation by
embedding new ways to work inside governmental bodies
and by demonstrating results of experiments to policy
makers.

Across 115 countries, the UNDP Accelerator Labs have
matured to create new value. They build upon national
capability to advance global digital public goods and
assist governments in determining digital readiness and
pursuing digital transformation.

.UNDP Accelerator Labs - Annual Report 2022

55

The Accelerator Labs track signals of change, convene
stakeholders to imagine and plan for alternative futures.
They also test out new methods of advancing UNDP’s
signature solutions.

Moving forward, in the next evolution, we will build on this
track record to learn about countries that have opened the
door for new partners, including the private sector, fintech
and social impact entrepreneurship. We will also learn
from strategic innovation investments that have facilitated
and prompted portfolio sensemaking and activation,
making inroads to systems transformation. The drive for
scale will increase ways to work with partners to create
new niches beyond UNDP’s signature solutions when it
comes to urban systems, as well as informal, circular, and
blue economies among other emerging global
development value propositions.

Scaling learning globally through the R&D cycle
In 2023, the Network will continue to learn about emerging
development challenges from the edges and move these
insights into action.

Our Network learning strategy in

action. Here are the key steps

we take in our research &

development practice to move

our learning into action.

.UNDP Accelerator Labs - Annual Report 2022

56

The Network identifies emerging patterns of insights,
signals and solutions surfaced by the Labs across the
world. As a learning Network, we codify insights to distill
new value propositions that can help respond to emerging
challenges sustainably and with agility.

This approach has proven successful in moving from
learning to action in 2022 and offers a strategic and
practical frame for the programmatic work of the Labs in
2023. As seen on the topic of informality and digitalization,
the Accelerator Labs’ learnings are translating into
alternative policy prescriptions.

Doubling down on open R&D to navigate
uncharted territory
The SDGs demand structural transformation of existing
systems. While UNDP and its development partners have
amassed significant knowledge on transforming
governance, environmental and economic systems to
create a fairer world for and with people in poverty, the
pressures of the current poly-crises means that what we
know is not enough. How do we transform energy systems
towards renewables while also ensuring an end to energy
poverty? How do we ensure fair elections in an age where
information integrity threatens democratic processes?
What does an end to multi-dimensional poverty look like
given global recessionary pressures?

The truth is, we don’t fully know. Which is why we need
exploration, experimentation and learning from grassroots
solutions. We need new ways of working that translate into
new value propositions. We need R&D for continuous
renewal in the face of emerging challenges.

.

.UNDP Accelerator Labs - Annual Report 2022

In the course of 2022, the Accelerator Labs have matured
and begun transitioning towards globally distributed

Research and Development (R&D) units that evolve
new value in the face of uncertainty. By learning from
the edges, attracting new partners and making inroads into
systems transformation, the Labs are providing a model for
the development ecosystem whereby new value
propositions respond to the demands created by
continuous uncertainty.

As we look toward this next phase of the Accelerator Labs
Network, 2023 will focus on taking the results achieved
with Germany, the State of Qatar, UNDP core donors and
action partner Italy’s investments to scale and make a
wider global impact in the public domain.

The UNDP Accelerator Labs’ focus in the next 12 months
will be to test out ways to build an SDG innovation
commons while expanding multilateral partnerships.
The SDG Innovation Commons will drive public domain
experimentation, inquiry and investment designed to
unleash action for intractable issues in sustainable
development. It will be backed up by the largest learning
Network on sustainable development challenges, the
UNDP Accelerator Labs, which now operates at scale in
115 countries, has sourced over 6,000 development
solutions, wins awards and attracts a diverse range of
partnerships. The SDG Innovation Commons – backed by
UNDP’s global learning Network capability – will create
new value by connecting insights, data, finance and
grassroots solutions to encourage action-based learning
on what it takes to reach the global Sustainable
Development Goals.
