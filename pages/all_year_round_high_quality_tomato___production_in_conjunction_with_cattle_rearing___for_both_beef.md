> Title of the innovation

All year round high quality tomato 🍅 production in Conjunction with cattle rearing , for both beef and manure( dung) production to be used in the production of tomato.Already I'm in possession of 16 heifers and two bulls( not big problem) with regards to bovine.

> Brief description of the innovation

Despite being a perishable agricultural product, tomato is a very good and all year round source of income if well managed and taken care of. Tomato growth has no limit so long it's fed with necessary  nutrients. Here in zambia  we have no farmers who are prominent and consistent tomato growers , when we have all it takes to grow tomato on an industrial scale,  only capital lacks . About 60 % of soil fertility will be from cow dung manure and tomato will be grown in different phases to ensure all time supply of tomato to the targeted markets. At the beginning , both oxen and rented equipment such as tractors will be used . But I'm very optimistic that within a reasonable period of time I (we) will be able to start purchasing such equipments instead of renting them. Cattle will be feeding on Natural grass especially at the beginning. Will make sure the location of the plant or facility will be near to the targeted markets.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Continual supply of tomato on the market will be a source of income, supported by selling of cattle for beef as numbers increase ( at the beginning) but intend to open up an abbottoir to be able to slaughter animals to ensure value addition of our products. Then I (we) will become cattle  ranchers consequently  and in all these activities employment will be an assurance. This will be a source of income for the employees as well. As a by- the - way thing , I/ we will able to supply undervalued products to the untarged markets that would need our products such tomato damages and orphos to sell on their small markets .

> Technical Feasibility

We will use rented tractors and the equipment in Conjunction with our animals especially at the beginning and later be able to purchase equipment for our facility.  Our target is to erect greenhouses as income/ Profits grow to reduce/ prevent natural challenges such as too much rainfall,  wind, higher temperatures, insects and pests, animals such as cattle, goats sheep etc from attaching our fields. Taking advantage of cheap labour as tomato requires much attention is a plus. Improvements of the roads and proper transportation facilities be a priority as tomato needs quick delivery as a perishable product.

> Anticipated Social Impact

People will have good income as our workers will be facilitating the flow of cash within and outside our perimeters. School and health facilities will be built around the areas. The innovation will be so relevant to the markets because most markets( big) import tomato from South Africa . Which is not good since we don't even export the product at all.These markets will have tomato to order within the country.
