> Title of the innovation

Fabric and clothing manufacturering

> Brief description of the innovation

I would like to start up a factory to manufacture clothing and fabric. This is project will utilise local cotton stacks already existing yarn manufacturing companies as well as local labour. This idea came from the back drop of reliance on imported clothing and the heavy leaning of most of most clothing manufacturers on chitenge. This area or manufacturing non chitenge clothes and fabric is not widely explored in Zambia.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project will get yarn from yarn manufacturers already exciting in the  manufactur of fabric. The project will also utilise locally made fabrics for some of the clothing items. 
This business has potential for growth and income generation from local and international sale of fabric and clothing.

> Technical Feasibility

The initial phase will entails capital injection for procurement of equipment, yarn, and fabric. This is for initial profit making and sustainability building experience. 
During the initial phase the project will also be trying out ways of improving on local resources and start using as much of local resources as possible until the project is weaned off to utilise 100% local materials. This will be the beginning of the fabric manufacturing factory as well.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project will provide direct jobs for factory workers as well as indirect jobs for cotton producing farmers as well as other sectors that will provide inputs to the factory. Jobs will in turn lead to better livelihoods for Zambian people.
