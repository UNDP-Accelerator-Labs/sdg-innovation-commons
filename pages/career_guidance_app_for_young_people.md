> Brief description of the innovation

Lifology is a career guidance ecosystem developed for young people. Statistically, less than 5% of young people choose the right career at the first attempt. Choosing the wrong career can have adverse effects for the productivity, progression and development of both the employee and the organisations they serve. Many times, people perform poorly in jobs because they are not well matched for them and this can be avoided with the right career guidance at the right time. Lifology developed a system to address these issues at a time when they can have the greatest impact between the ages of 13 and 19. The system accurately matches young people with the best fit career for them based on their personality, talents and other critical indicators. Apart from personal attributes,  the app takes into consideration labour market trends, future trends, as well as the skills required to keep up with the technological changes. The tools used are based on over 15 years of research and have been validated and deemed accurate for determining the right career path for a student with high accuracy. Additionally, it can guide students in choosing the right subject streams at the right time and avoid wasting time following a wrong career path. It can also guide students on which skills they should develop over time in order to be ready for their dream job. The prototype is a Guiness World Record holder and has  been voted the most trusted giu app. Zoomedin coaching is a Zambian startup that has partnered with Lifology to develop a Zambia-specific customised career guidance app for young people in Zambia.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income is generated through users paying for registration. Each registration requires a payment. The target market is schools, children in secondary school and parents of children in secondary schools. The app will greatly enhance schools' career guidance efforts; It is designed to provide tools for parents to guide their children well, as well as provide guidance counsellors with the tools to provide correct and accurate guidance based in accurate data. Many well intentioned parents and career counselors are unable to provide sufficient career guidance because they lack information about a student's actual abilities. Lifology provides a holistic picture of the student, allowing them to see how their abilities, skills, intelligence and personality match up with the best-fit career, enabling parents, guardians and counselors to guide students correctly and students to make informed decisions about their career future. This greatly enhances the goals of education which include preparing students for a future in which they can reach their highest potential, contribute to their society and have a good quality of life. In the long term it contributes to the country's economy by producing more focused and productive citizens with fewer mental health issues.

> Technical Feasibility

The prototype is an app and is available as a web-version as well, it was designed through years of research and input from top psychologists and educators from top educational institutions in the world. The initiative was born out of the realisation that many people feel they are in the wrong career. The idea is, rather than try to fix this problem in adulthood, it is addressed when a few right decisions can have the greatest impact on a person's career. It can be the difference between whether a person has a meaningful career or ends up depressed and unmotivated in a career that does not suit them. it will be the first career guidance app of it's kind to be implemented in Zambia. The implementation plan is to have the app customised for schools, have an administrator manage the backend for their students and register students as and when it is required in their career journey, whether it is to determine which subject stream to take or deciding what to major in at university. The schools can also provide access to the app to parents who require help guiding their children. 
Tha assessments take about 40 - 60 minutes to complete and the reports are generated immediately.

> Anticipated Social Impact

1. The Lifology career guidance system can help students choose the right subject stream or major 
2. It can help students choose activities that assist in developing skills in line with their career choice

4. It can help young people choose the right career and reduce the time spent pursuing career paths that are not a good fit
5. It can help organisations/institutions make better  hires because the right people will be matched with the right careers within their organisations 
6. It can provide data that would allow for individuals and organisations to leverage strengths and use them to achieve individual and organisational goals
7. It can ensure better mental health as wrong career choice greatly impacts mental health negatively over time
8. It can contribute to the country's economy by producing more focused and productive employees, meaning fewer job changes, greater expertise and higher productivity
