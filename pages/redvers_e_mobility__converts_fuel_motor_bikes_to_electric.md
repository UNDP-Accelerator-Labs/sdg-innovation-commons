From fuel Boda Boda to E-Moto: Boda bodas are a lifeline for tens of millions of Ugandans, providing affordable and accessible transportation. However, at the same time, they also contribute significantly to air and noise pollution and operate within a challenging market environment where drivers struggle with high fuel costs and thus limited income. Redvers saw an opportunity to address these issues while simultaneously creating positive social and environmental impact. Our Solution. Electric motorcycles (e-motos) are offered through a unique lease-to-own model and a network of convenient battery-swapping stations. These converted e-motos are not only cost-effective and environmentally friendly but also rugged enough to handle Uganda's demanding roads. Drivers can lease these motorcycles with an affordable daily fee and complimentary maintenance, significantly boosting their income while transitioning to clean energy.
