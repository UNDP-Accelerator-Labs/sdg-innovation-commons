> Title of the innovation

PROFITABLE INNOVATIVE GROWING SYSTEM (PIGS) : HYDROPONICS is growing plant without soil in a liquid or soil less media.This hydroponic systems expands from less crop pollution and a greater crop yield to mass environment conservation.

> Brief description of the innovation

PROFITABLE INNOVATIVE GROWING SYSTEM :
Introduction: PIGS* Will be designed to improve the lives of farmers in Zambia. It will reduce hunger and poverty within the communities via transformative,innovative and scalable market driven approach to economic development. It's going to be a hydroponic system of production, growing Fodder and later pepper, lettuce, tomato etc.This fodder will be the production of sprouts using seeds of grain (e.g maize or barley)and water 
  HOW IT WORKS 
# There's need to build a green house and the provision of water.
First step  * Soaking the seeds in water for a day or two.
Second step * Drain and spread the seeds into shallow  stray that have drain holes. Seeds should be spread half an inch in thickness. 
Third step * Water a couple of times per day,keeping themmoist and drain for the duration of the growing cycle at a Temperature of 60 to 75 degrees.
Fourth step * Harvestat the desired stage of growth. 
Then feed to the animals the green matter.e.g Rabbits chicken turkeys pigs goats cows sheep etc.
What is needed 
                 # water 
                 # media e.g stays
                 # grain e.g maize barley sorghum 
                 # green house

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Since the fodder will be growing in 8 days it means then that, the animals will be fed with high quality green feeds that will be available through out the year. 
There will be increase in meat production 
Increase in egg production and and in milk production and there resulting in more revenues and profits. 
IMPROVING EXISTING BUSINESS 
In the process the fodder will be made into pallets to improve on shelf live hence helping the market in reducing the prices of animal feeds. 
TARGET MARKET
# Small scale farmers the youths and women in chicken layering business 
# Livestock farmers in the country 
THIS INNOVATION ON THE  ENVIRONMENT 
# Minimize risk and limitations related to weather. 
# Minimize need for gasoline and diesel farming equipment

> Technical Feasibility

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 
# Once PIGS is operational we 'll work with the youths that will under go some training on the operation of the hydroponic systems. It going just the work force of 2 to 4 people. 
# The system is going to be fully operational and be 
 able to make profits in the period of 2 and half months knowing that our products will not be taking long to be grown and be taken to the market. 
# PIGS does not need a very big farm to do its operations but just the half part of the size of the football pitch to build a green house. # The system will be a success because it's going to supply the market consistently with high quality green feeds that will be available through out the year hence bringing a good competition into the market.
# The system will attract the budget of about K80.000
 As follows ÷ green house 
                      - Water tank 
                      - Water  Pump
                     - PVC pipes,taps,planting cups
                      - Labour costs  for 3 months 
                      - Aluminum plates
                      - Grain ( barley / maize seeds)
                      - Thermometer  e.t.c

> Anticipated Social Impact

IMPROVING LIVES
#In the sense that the innovation will produce contamination free fodder reducing the risk of diseases on animals 
# Saves water and labour 
# Fodder grown is highly palatable and nutritious leading into higher production in eggs meat and milk bringing more income. 
RELEVANCE TO THE CURRENT MARKET 
With the costs of animal feeds in Zambia currently this kind of fodder will help reduce the prices for the feeds since it will made in pellets.
