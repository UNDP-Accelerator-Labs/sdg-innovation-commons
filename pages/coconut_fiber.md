Description: Coconut fiber is a material that is extracted from coconuts, in order to reuse the organic matter that remains as waste when extracting the edible part of the coconut. It is very good for hydroponics as it retains moisture and is not compacted, which guarantees that there is oxygen, and that water circulates correctly throughout the crop.

Eventually it degrades and it is necessary to periodically change the substrate of hydroponic crops. One of the advantages of this product is that it can be obtained at a lower cost than other substrates, due to the fact of being extracted from a waste.
