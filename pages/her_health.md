- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Her health is a hygiene management system targeting the menstrual health economy by producing cost effective, chemical free, zero plastic, eco-friendly, safe pads. Our solution is unique as it is backed by a ussd system that enable girls to have access to SHRH information from the their basic phones. We are also employing an innovative plastic upcycling system that enables to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions. Our revenues stem from direct sales, monthly information subs for SRH and period hygiene. Our innovation has a savings cycle we designed aimed at empowering communities with limited resources access our products and services through, the innovation is currently on bank of Zambia sandbox and MTN. The purpose of saving cycles is to enable communities with limited resources to independently pool funds and purchase our products and services.
