# Malawi Accelerator Lab: Developing Local Innovation Solutions for Governance Challenges

### [[0:01]] Tell me please your name, your title and say I consent to this recording\.

I'm Suyapi Mumba, Head of experimentation with Accelerator Lab in Malawi and I consent to this recording\.

### [[0:16]] Perfect\. Over to you\.

### [[0:18]] Hello Suyapi\. Could you tell me about research and development activity you would like to share and how did it come about?

Yeah\. So in Malawi, we worked with the\. You got nervous, don't get nervous\.

### [[0:36]] What's the research and development activity?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
OK, great\. So in Malawi, we worked with the country office to support their public sector innovation initiative\. And then through that, we identified a, that a local council, a local District Council was, was addressing a challenge with revenue, managing their revenue information\. And to, to address it, they actually developed their own information system to manage the information and ensure that there's accountability and transparency in, in, in their records\. So the way we we came about the accelerator lab was avoiding Technical Support to the governance portfolio by training staff in the local councils on what is innovation and how they can submit innovation proposals\. And through those trainings, we saw that one of the innovation was was sort of popping up as an interesting innovation\. And so when we had an opportunity to submit a proposal for setting up an innovation lab, we proposed to test the incubation process with this innovation\. And yeah, that's how we came about supporting this innovation\.

### [[2:00]] Very interesting\. Can you tell us a little bit of, you know, what's the development problem that you were addressing? What's the situation now? And where do you want to get?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
Yeah\. So it's a governance issue\. They with decentralization, the local councils like in this case the District Council is mandated to manage its own, to collect revenue and manage its, its, its operations\. And, and they didn't have systems to properly track this\. And they were using paper registers to record what they've sold, like how many tickets they've sold, how much revenue they've collected\. And trying to concile this process manually was labor intensive and prone to errors and it was hard to track information\. So that led to a lot of money being lost through a privilege\. And so there was this need to have a system, a better system of tracking\. And the interesting thing is that they developed this system themselves using their own IT stuff\.

### [[3:12]] Excellent\. So can you also tell us a bit of who were your champions, who was involved and maybe how the diversity of the people involved helped come up with better ideas, better solutions and enrich the process?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
Yeah\. So the main activity on this one was to help refine the system because they started developing, but we came in to help them refine the the system\. So we being a system developed within government, within the public sector, we invited at different government departments\. The departments that are responsible for innovation are the ones that look at standards for digital systems, the line ministry, the local local government ministry and and other stakeholders, the academia and also the Commission responsible for science and technology\. All these came together to ensure that we help provide the technical capacity to help refine the system\. And so, yeah, UNDP sort of brought all these stakeholders together to work towards refining the system\.

### [[4:30]] And were there any particular tools and methods that you used through the research and development process that help achieve the goals?

### Yeah\. So in identifying the system, it was more of a solutions mapping, identifying existing solutions that are there that pop up that to be interesting and also for the refinement\. What was interesting is that the National Commission for Science and Technology in Malawi introduced this Technology Readiness Assessment Framework, which is the method adapted from from NASA for assessing maturity of technology systems\. And we we use this tool to identify areas of improvement and recommendations to help ensure that the system is mature enough when it's ready for implementation\. So yeah, I can highlight those tools and methods that we use\.

### [[5:22]] Excellent\. And how about some of the strategy? Do you use some tactics or strategies to be able to bring people on board that had resistance or, you know, how do you make people enthusiastic about it and and bring them into the project?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
Yeah\. So we encouraged stakeholders\. So we did stakeholder engagement, encouraging the stakeholders to not treat this as something a tool, a solution only developed for the council\. But we ensure that they all feel responsible to help nurture and support this system\. So encouraging them to Co own and and be part of it, to Co create the the tools and how we are going to do the assessments\. So for example, I mentioned the, the Commission for Sunset Technology introduced a tool for assessment\. We also had one of the universities, one of the public universities introduce a, a plan, a test plan for doing the field test\. When we went to the field, we had go through a test, a plan that was developed by University of Malawi so that Co creation and ensuring that stakeholders are able to participate and not take this as a UNDP initiative helped to bring Co ownership in this process\.

### [[6:46]] What about some of the principles? What would you say to other people who try to replicate or expand what you're doing? What are some principles that they need to keep in mind when doing research and innovation?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
Yeah\. A principle I can highlight on this one is recognizing that the people that are facing a challenge have the best, are best positioned to address those challenges\. So recognizing the role of user LED innovations in this case a systems analyst and and IT officers at ones at District Council\. So the challenges they were facing recognized the capacity they have and started developing digital system to address those challenges\. And this is one principle that is useful in recognizing that people facing a challenge are best placed to address the challenges they are facing\.

### [[7:48]] And which ones would you say were key skills, like thinking about the people involved in the team? What were some skills that were very useful to like this research and development process?

[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[skills:Partnerhsip coordination]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Yeah\. So the obvious ones are the technical ones\. The skills in understanding how to develop information systems, how to implement networks were important in assessing the the digital system\. But also some skills like stakeholder engagement, being able to bring various stakeholders together, being able to talk to government officials and get their buy in\. We also had to do a lot of buy in with other public investors in order to support this because this activity was being implemented under a larger project on implementing an innovation lab at A at one of the public universities\. So ensuring that not just that university is involved, but other investors and other departments, all of them work together with us at UNTP to help refine the system\. Some expertise skills, but also very important human skills\. The human skills, Yeah\.

### [[9:08]] Thank you\. So wrapping it up, what would you say is the is the impact that you're most proud of in this process? What's the result of this research and development process that you're most proud of and think it has the most value to people?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
Yeah\. So the impact is on 2 levels, 1 is on the actual system\. When we started working with the system, it was an early, early, early prototype\. So we helped identify the key technology elements that have to be developed, hope to document them, help to have them implemented and tested\. And at this point, the system is running, it's in production, running in, in once at District Council and trying to engage, they are engaging other councils to see if they can replicate and and also use the system on higher level\. They what we the refinement was a way of testing how the incubation process would work for the larger project of setting up an innovation lab at a university\. And we did identify some critical elements, for example, the stuff that need to be mentor the innovators and need to be, some of them need to be dedicated to the project\. We can't have staff that are also responsible for teaching because then they, they, they there was challenge in, in terms of availability of the staff\. And this has been identified and rectified in the implementation of the innovation lab\. So there's a solution that's digitizing, but also a way of working is a solution how to implement this, this I think that's very valuable\.

### [[10:59]] Sure\. If you were to do it again, what would you do different? What do you think are some of the learnings in the process?

[[principles:Empathy]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[skills:Systems leadership]]
Yeah, from what we've learnt now\. So one is ensuring that, OK, when we're trying to have mentors to mentor innovators at a university, they need, the mentors need to be dedicated\. It should be their primary role, not just a secondary row when their primary row is something else\. But one thing that we also learnt using the tool is that they, the assessment framework had so many questions, was very detailed\. We could not do it in, in a few, in a couple of days for, for the assessments\. And so we had to customize it\. We had to simplify it into fewer questions that still touched on all the areas that needed to be assessed\. And so we see this coming up with a simplified tool like if we have to do it again, would go straight to a simplified tool that is more realistic to to to work with\.

### [[12:07]] Excellent\. So as the last question, what, what strategies or approaches are you using to scale the the impact of the solution?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
[[tools:Design]]
And yeah, so currently the system is running in one district\. We are facilitating engagement with other councils to learn about the system and see if they can adopt the system and as a way of scaling up\. But other issues that we've identified is that they like innovating in the public sector\. There's a gap that there is no, there are no clear incentives for the innovators in, in, in, in the public\. If you come up with an innovation, how are you recognized and incentivized? And also as other councils are looking into adopting this system, their issues of intellectual property, how is the intellectual property of the council that developed the system recognized? Is the council able to sell to other or charge other councils or the fact that the council is under the government, then other councils or other government initiatives, institutions can use the system without having to pay\. So those are some of the gaps that we are hoping to address by supporting the public sector innovation policy to be implemented packaging distribution so that it can be replicated in other spaces\. Yes, but also addressing these challenges of the business model, how do you make it sustainable? Yes\. And ensuring there's the legal and yeah, the policies are in place to support innovation, especially in the public sector\.

### [[13:57]] Thank you so much\.

Thank you\.
