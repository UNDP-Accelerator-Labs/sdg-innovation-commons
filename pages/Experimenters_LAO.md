[[ai_summary:Korakot Tanseri is the head of experimentation at the UNDP Lao PDR, and he conducted research on waste management in his country. He identified that many people burn their waste or litter it due to a lack of accessible waste collection services. His team used co-creation techniques with community members, private sector stakeholders, and government officials to develop solutions, including empowering women who manage household waste. The main outcome of the research was the positioning of UNDP as a stakeholder working on waste management and providing grassroots solutions that can be implemented with minimal investment. Better waste management will reduce greenhouse gases, contribute to SDG 13 climate actions, SDG 9 economic development, and SDG 11 sustainable cities and communities.]]

# Laos Waste Management Experimentation Initiative

### [[0:00]] Tell me your name, your title, and say I give consent to this recording\.

My name is Korakot Tanseri\. I'm head of experimentation at the UNDP Lao PDR and I give my consent for this recording\.

### [[0:18]] Do you want your name tag on or?

I think it's OK\.

### [[0:23]] And I hand it over to Pierre for the first or the second question\.

OK\.

### [[0:32]] Could you tell me about a research activity, research and development activity you would like to share?

Yes, sure\. I would like to share it to you about the waste management research and that we have conducted in my country\. Waste management is a huge issue in Lao PDR\. That's why we wanted to do something to, to make some positive change\.

### [[1:03]] Yes\. Hey, how did you come about it? Where, where did you start? Can you tell us a little bit more?

[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Give the space to others to shine]]
[[principles:Frugality]]
Yes\. So in Laos, a lot of people are burning their waste or littering the waste in the street\. And we were wondering like why they are doing that? Because the service is there, yet the service was not everywhere\. We have maybe about like 40% of the household which has waste collections each services\. And of course, like we know that there's impact in burning waste on health, on the air pollutions and so on\. So we wanted to understand why people were keep doing that\. That's why we started the research on better understanding the waste management in lab PDR\.

### [[2:00]] Wait, what was the development issue that you were addressing? What did the what did the situation look like apart from doing waste on the on the street?

[[principles:Frugality]]
[[tactics:Share your value upfront]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
I think people were just like dog with the waste management in a sense where like the waste collector in Laos, they will come and then we they will mix every waste that you, you separate it because they don't have other options\. So people were like, why should I segregate waste while the waste collector will we collect them and mix them again\. And they were also like not happy with the price, which is a little bit high compared to other countries or the cities in the regions\. So that, that was also one of the, the struggles that we have at the same time that leads me and my team to walk on like, what A, is there any way to change the perceptions of waste for the people of Laos? And you know, we were wondering asking the question, if people seize value in waste, would they better manage it? Would they do differently? So that that's how we, we conceptualize and try to address the issue\.

### [[3:30]] Oh, great\. So who was involved in your journey on in the waste management field? How did you ensure diverse stakeholder perspective were considered in how their input shipped the No, I think it's fine\.

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Immersion and engagemen]]
[[tactics:Play do not preach]]
[[tactics:Undertanding the community]]
Yeah\. So instead of doing just like, you know, one experimentation, so I, we decide to do 3 experimentations to take into account, you know, the, the, the voices, but also to learn from different perspective\. So the first experimentation was we've the household\. So we use some techniques that, that, that we call like ethnography, rapid ethnography studies and also Co creation techniques in a sense where like we wanted to do some, we wanted to use the capacity of the people because people in the community, they know actually how to segregate ways, they know how to manage ways, they know how to, you know, collect the plastic and so on\. And what we need is to empower those who have the knowledge and having them sharing back\. So that's was the techniques that I use on top of the community\. I think it was important to look on how the private sector can make a change because the private sector generate waste, especially the retailers, because like we consume a lot of products sold in those retails\. And the last part is really to work with the Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment because we want them to be champions the role model for all the ministry or for the all the public in order to lead by example\.

### [[5:34]] OK, great\. So now can you tell us a little bit about the tools and me thoughts that you use through your work?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[tools:Co-creation]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
[[tools:Design]]
So I use co\-creation a lot because I feel like that's the way where you have like people in the room and make them participate and make them feel like they are part of the solutions\. I think that's very important\. I use also rapid ethnography studies\. I think that's, that's interesting and I didn't have to start from scratch because our colleagues from the Philippines who have very similar context, you know, have made already these studies and I just like copy and paste some of the personas that they identify\. And those personas was were very relevant to, to Lao context as well\. So it was easier for me to apply that in, in my country because our colleagues in the Philippines has already done some work on that\. The last part I would say is to use the I would like visual object, visual characters and visual tools to actually make people understand better\. That's very important because when sometimes you, you make a report or you write a lot about the rules and so on\. But if a picture, some type picture can represent all that, one picture can represent all that\. So the visual visualization was one of the tools that I use as well\.

### [[7:16]] OK, great\. So what factors can you tell us about what the factors that influence your choice of 2cm?

[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
I think it's the fact that we accelerate the lab a part of the network and that we have the opportunity to learn from what others does in the region, but also globally\. And that's the strength to accelerate the experimentation or accelerate the projects that we want to do in a sense, like we don't need to start from zero\. The Vietnamese colleague already started something on designing the bins\. The Philippines have made the rapid ethnography studies and other colleagues from Pakistan have done tremendous work on studies and solutions\. So the fact that we are part of the network globally, that we share information, we share knowledge and models that help us to define what kind of tools or method we want to use\.

### [[8:20]] Great\. So about tactics, is there any specific tactics that you use to engage the stakeholders? Is there anything you want to share specific tactics that you use?

[[tactics:Allies and champions]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[skills:Community building]]
I think the tactics would be about like finding your champions, your allies, You know, I think like when you, you, you work with the community, you, you, you will see the, the woman, especially woman who have already great knowledge, great access to the people and people trust them\. We need to use those people in order to, to, to making sure that they, they can help our project\. And the tactics would be like make them champions, give value to them, give responsibility to them\. And same from the ministry\. We want to make sure that they take pride of experimenting like plastic free meetings, plastic free office with us so that they can take the ownership of it\. I think the, if you find champions, you find your allies, it will help you to, to to successfully conduct your experimentation and you will ensure the sustainability of the actions that you started\.

### [[9:42]] Yes\. OK, so finding the champion was the the key\.

Yes\.

### [[9:47]] OK, great\. What about the principle? Can you elaborate on the principle that guide your research and development work? Why were they important?

[[skills:Creativity]]
[[skills:Information management]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[skills:Videos]]
So I conducted the survey to the community and the survey was asking like, you know, who managed waste how, how many minutes or hours you spent to manage waste, What would you like to have as a service and so on\. And the amazing finding was that 90% of the person that managed waste in the household was woman, especially woman in the age of moms or grandmas\. And I wanted to respect that expertise because it's an expertise, it's a local expertise\. So when I, I implemented the project, we've like finding champions, finding trainers, finding leaders within the, within the experimentation, it was an evident that I need to, to, to also represent the, the, the gender in there that that mostly that would be woman that we train and power and so on\. So that's the principle that I've tried to follow during the experimentation of that project\.

### [[11:11]] Wait, how about the ethical consideration like in closing equity? Did you think those ethical consideration into account during your journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
Yes, I think we try as much as we can, especially making sure that the the stakeholders or the partners of the experimentation are the ones that are already existing in the in the stakeholders\. For example, we've the experimentation that we made with the retailers, we make made sure that the informal W speakers that usually goes and you know collect the recyclable waste\. They are part of this project, meaning that we making sure that to help them because the waste in in those retail shop was segregated already\. They just go and come and collect instead of spending time to segregate, find where are the ways that they can collect, What are the ways that cannot be recycled? Then we simplify the work for them\. And I think it's kind of a ethic to have them involved and to facilitate work for them\.

[[12:28]] OK, great\. So what skills were needed to effectively identify and understand the challenges or needs that your research and development in to address?

[[principles:Empathy]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Adaptability]]
[[principles:Cultural adaptability]]
I think you need patience\. We we are called activity lab\. But at the same time, we need to be patient\. We need to have an active listening listen, to be humble and to again, be empathetic\. I think those skills are very important\. And then of course, like you need to have skills on public speaking to facilitate those, those workshop, those Co creation activities that we conduct\. And at the same time you need to be rigorous in, in term of M&E, you know, monitoring, collecting the data, the, the, the, the kilos of waste collected and so on\. So those are the tools and the skills, skills that we are really needed to making sure that you can record the impact and the result of your research\.

### [[13:39]] So what was the outcome the main outcome of your research in development journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
The main outcome is that we position UNDP in this stakeholders working on waste management and we position ourself on providing solutions, alternative solutions and so grassroots solutions, of course, like you know, they are big projects like land fields that use million of USD or like policies\. But at the same time we identify and we highlight and showcase solutions and experts and we empower people\. I think that's the main result of it\. And we prove that some models that doesn't need much investment can work in, in our context\.

### [[14:36]] OK, I understand now\. Can you tell us how all of this have an impact on sustainable development waste management?

Better waste management will reduce, you know, burning, which is contributing to greenhouse gases\. And it's contributing to, to combat the, the, it's contributing to SDG 13 climate actions\. At the same time, I think it's also about economy as well\. So that that's contribute to the, the SDG 9\. And it's also about innovation as well\. And also SDG 11 on sustainable cities and communities\.

### [[15:18]] Wait, what strategy? Can you tell us about the strategy and opportunities you employ to facilitate the division in adoption of your we certainly development outcomes\.

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
I think we partners, we've media that are focusing on environment that helps us to advertise about the experimentation that we have made\. We also like share those results of those research experimentation\. We've different partners and we also work closely with the ministries in order to inform them and to have them know about the result of our experimentation\. That's how like we are\. We diffuse the work that we have done and it create a lot of opportunities\. It create opportunities within the regions we've projects within UNDP, but also a lot of stakeholders will invite us to share about our experience to share the innovations that we have experimented in, in in the country office\.

### [[16:31]] Wait, now it was our last question\. Thank you for your time and insight\.

Thank you Pierre Open\. Thank you very much\.

### [[16:39]] That was it, huh?

That was very good\.
