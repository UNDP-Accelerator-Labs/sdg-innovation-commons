In an increasingly interconnected world, creative industries—encompassing arts, culture, media, design, and technology—are emerging as crucial drivers of economic, social, and cultural advancement. These sectors not only stimulate innovation and creativity but also generate employment, promote economic growth, and enhance cultural diversity. Globally, creative industries contribute approximately 3.1 percent of the world’s GDP and employ 6.2 percent of the workforce, with youth comprising a significant portion of this demographic. As one of the fastest-growing sectors, it is projected to account for 10 percent of global GDP by 2030. Understanding the potential of these multifaceted industries is essential for sustainable development and aligns closely with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Recognizing this, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP has been advocating for a greater emphasis on creative industries as a means of socio-economic development in various countries, including Kazakhstan.Creative industries are pivotal in driving economic development. They create jobs, stimulate entrepreneurship, and foster innovation. These sectors often require a diverse skill set, promoting a culture of creativity that leads to new business models and technologies. By nurturing innovation, countries can diversify their economies, making them more resilient to global economic fluctuations. For instance, the film and music industries generate substantial revenue and create numerous employment opportunities. In 2022, the global entertainment and media market was valued at over US$2.32 trillion and continues to expand. This sector not only offers direct employment but also supports ancillary industries such as tourism, hospitality, and retail, creating a multiplier effect that enhances overall economic performance.Beyond economic benefits, creative industries play a vital role in preserving and promoting cultural heritage. They provide a platform for diverse voices, fostering understanding and dialogue among various communities. In a world that often feels fragmented, the arts and culture can serve as a unifying force. They create spaces for dialogue, allowing communities to share their stories and experiences. This inclusivity fosters a sense of belonging and encourages active participation, thereby strengthening social cohesion. By celebrating cultural diversity, these industries contribute to social inclusion and help bridge divides between different social groups. Driving Sustainable DevelopmentThe development of creative industries is intrinsically linked to the achievement of several SDGs. By promoting lifelong learning and education, these sectors encourage skills development in areas such as digital literacy, arts, and design. Educational programs that focus on creative skills empower individuals, particularly the youth, equipping them with the competencies needed for future job markets.Moreover, creative industries provide opportunities for women to engage in the workforce, thus promoting gender equality. In many countries, including Kazakhstan, women have made significant strides in sectors like media, arts, crafts, and design, contributing to a more balanced economic landscape. Additionally, creative industries are essential for sustainable economic growth. They create high-value businesses and offer decent work opportunities, particularly for young people, helping to mitigate unemployment and underemployment. This focus is particularly relevant in initiatives aimed at preventing violent extremism, as employment can provide a constructive outlet for youth.Creative industries also enhance the cultural and economic vibrancy of cities. They contribute to the liveability of urban areas by providing cultural amenities and fostering community engagement. Furthermore, creative industries can lead the way in advocating for sustainable production and consumption patterns. By adopting eco-friendly practices and raising awareness through their platforms, they influence consumer behaviour toward more sustainable choices. Challenges and opportunities in KazakhstanWhile the creative industries offer numerous benefits, they also face significant challenges. In Kazakhstan, these industries are primarily concentrated in major urban centres like Astana and Almaty. Although these cities benefit from substantial infrastructure, investment, and a diverse talent pool, focusing development solely in these areas’ risks exacerbating regional disparities.To address this, the UNDP and its partners are launching initiatives aimed at fostering creative industries in the regions, specifically Kyzylorda and Mangystau. The approach is rooted in participatory practices, ensuring that initiatives are inclusive and representative of local needs. By involving a diverse range of stakeholders—artists, entrepreneurs, policymakers, community members, and investors—the initiative, supported by the Japan-funded project and powered by the Accelerator Lab, tailors strategies to the unique challenges and opportunities of each region. This collaborative effort promotes transparency, trust, and a sense of ownership among the community, ultimately leading to more effective and sustainable outcomes.Investing in creative industries in Kazakhstan is not just an economic imperative; it is a critical component of building a more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable future. By fostering innovation, promoting cultural identity, and aligning with the SDGs, these industries play a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of life for all citizens, especially young people. In conclusion, the development of creative industries offers a multifaceted pathway to sustainable development. By unlocking the potential of these sectors, Kazakhstan can pave the way for a sustainable future, ensuring that all regions benefit from the rich tapestry of creativity that exists within its borders. The journey may be challenging, but the rewards—economic growth, cultural enrichment, and social inclusion—are well worth the effort.
