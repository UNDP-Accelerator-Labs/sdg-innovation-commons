## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The AGRO-INNOVATEC in reverse project aims to explore how technological innovation can address climate challenges and improve agricultural practices. The goal is to develop smart technologies, like Small Meteorological Equipment (PEMs), to help farmers adapt to changing weather conditions and increase crop resilience.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is crucial for promoting sustainable agriculture and climate adaptation, empowering farmers with the tools and knowledge to better manage resources, optimize production, and secure food supply under evolving environmental conditions

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF smart agricultural technologies, are developed and implemented, THEN farmers will be better equipped to monitor climate conditions, leading to improved climate resilience and sustainable agricultural practices.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions to Test the Hypothesis:
Development of Small Meteorological Equipment (PEMs):

Design and build smart agricultural tools like PEMs to help farmers monitor weather patterns.
Collaboration:

Engage technology developers, agricultural experts, and farmers to co-create solutions.
Pilot Implementation:

Test PEMs in rural agricultural regions of Bolivia, particularly areas prone to climate challenges.
Training and Deployment:

Timeline:
The project phases span over 3 months to measure the impact on climate resilience and crop productivity
