> Title of the innovation

MGE Changing Agricultural Production Cycle of smallholder farmers in Mafinga District using available Technologies to feed increasing population while preserving environment by providing guaranteed market for cereal and legume crops grown by smallholder farmers as well as providing financial services at the local rural to the communities

> Brief description of the innovation

Muchinga General Enterprises Limited (MGE) is changing the agricultural production cycle of smallholder farmers in Mafinga and Serenje Districts Zambia. Smallholder farmers in the rural shall be provided with solar water pump systems for irrigation purpose as long term loans while providing guaranteed market for cereal and legume crops. This will provide solutions for food security for the fast increasing population, adaptation to drought and develop the culture for smallholder farmers at the local rural to having solar water pumps for irrigation in the rural and stop just depending on rain for growing crops. To develop necessary capacity for smallholder farmers to solve new climate change challenges in agriculture, knowledge and skills required to take agriculture as business. To meet current and future agricultural challenges  and food security by being able to design business models which will help smallholder farmers in rural areas manage natural resources as well as formulating innovative business plans that work for agribusiness while meeting rural community expectations and all stakeholders. To increase the volume and value of agribusiness based on the output of smallholder farmers in rural areas.
All smallholder farmers  as well as others in Mafinga and Serenje Districts Zambia with mobile phones will all be connected to banks and trained how to make transactions and banking services using their phones. This requires about USD10000 to complete the project within eight months.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

M.G.E. is a profit-making social enterprise and has a unique business model in that  we have customers at both ends. 
To prevent further man-made destruction of the environment, M.G.E. provides training to the smallholder farmers (including women) in the rural areas of Mafinga and Serenje Districts in Zambia on improved ways of farming using innovative methods by solar water pumps for irrigation on their farms by a long-term loan in order that during the dry season, the farmers are able to continue farming by using these solar pumps to pump water from their boreholes or streams or rivers for irrigation. Smallholder farmers in Mafinga will be empowered with solar water pumps for irrigation to discourage deforestation for charcoal as source of income. This will be made possible from increased revenue from sales of rice and beans from our outlet in Kabwe Town.

These farmers produce the cereal and legume crops which M.G.E. purchases to sell to bulk buyers and processors like milling companies and livestock manufacturing companies. 

Through this business model M.G.E. creates a guaranteed market for cereal and legume crops thereby enabling them to increase the volume of production of these crops creating increased value of agribusiness whilst providing guaranteed supply to bulk buyers and processors that meet the quality, type, and quantities at market price. 
Now we have the Covid19 challenge which requires Agile Business Strategy for all stakeholders in agribusiness to remain afloat. 
Interested investors could help with the required funding of USD 100 000 for the continued smooth operation of the enterprise. This will include the purchasing of tractors to plough the fields instead of using hoes by smallholder farmers in order to help farmers cope with the increased crop production due to the continuous irrigation farming. We need to register, connect and train more than 12000 smallholder farmers in Mafinga and Serenje Districts in four months about how to use any mobile phone to make transactions on mobile phone and banking services at the local rural to prevent Covid19 transmission by cash and face to face meetings. 

The benefits are that investors will help to feed the fast-increasing population with real nutritious food, prevent Covid19 and also help preserve the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

We are creating guaranteed market for cereal and legume crops grown by smallholder farmers in rural areas in Mafinga District Muchinga Province Zambia so that they increase the volume of production of cereal and legume crops thereby creating value of agribusiness while providing guaranteed supply to bulk buyers and processors that meet the quality, type, quantity and at market price. Selling solar water pump systems to smallholder farmers, sensitizing and training smallholder farmers about improved way to do farming using new innovative methods by installing solar water pumps for irrigation so that they have increased income and food security by growing crops throughout the year as well as overcome the risk of drought and adapt to climate change as well as stop cutting down of trees for charcoal as source of income. 
 We have customers at both ends. The agribusiness is for the smallholder farmers to be growing cereal and legume crops throughout the year under irrigation to adapt to drought caused by climate change as source of income because of the guaranteed market we shall provide at the local rural with the aim of discouraging deforestation for charcoal for sell as source of income. By so doing the culture will develop for the rural smallholder farmers and future generation to have solar water pump systems for irrigation which will provide us the market for the solar water pump systems for irrigation purpose. It could be similar to the way the culture of having a mobile phone for communication has developed.
The proposed implementation plan for connecting smallholder farmers and others  mobile phones  in Mafinga  and Serenje Districts Zambia  will start on 1st November 2021 and orientations and trainings will be made at Schools in these areas so that the enterprise will become Financial Resilient from sales and increased earnings from commissions by partnering. with local digital companies like Kazang Zambia Limited and Atlasmara Bank with the Tenga payment platform. The income earned will be used to purchase increased volumes of cereals and legumes from smallholder farmers at the local rural in Mafinga District. Smallholder farmers will become resilient and  have increased income as they will not be moving long distances to the bank since banking services will be on their mobile phones and crops aggregated from them will be paid using Atlas Mara Tenga platform by our enterprise.

> Anticipated Social Impact

More than 5000 Smallholder farmers in Mafinga District will become financial resilient since all with mobile phones with be trained by our enterprise do make transactions and banking services using their phones. Smallholder farmers will have increased income because financial circulation will be at the local rural using financial services of our enterprise. 
-Increased number of youths who have permanent jobs in both rural and urban areas in the agricultural processing and manufacturing industries. 
- Increased number of households that have taken farming as business.
- Increased number of girl children who have access to education because the parents are able to afford sponsoring the children from farming income.
- Increased financial literacy among smallholder farmers of using mobile phones for saving as well as linking to banking services
Improved health by motivating smallholder farmers growing more nutritious legume crops as source of cheap protein and food security at household level.
-By changing agricultural production cycle of smallholder farmers so that they could grow crops throughout the year.
- Training smallholder farmers to use local materials such as stones and sand for construction of water reservoirs for irrigation purposes.
- Women have reduced work because of improved houses.
- Created entrepreneurship to youths and women of agriculture as business.
- Empowering smallholder farmers with solar water pumps for irrigation purposes by making them affordable to discourage deforestation.
-Use of available livestock manure for fertilizing crops
-Training smallholder farmers through cooperatives sustainable agriculture practice like intercropping.
- Reduction of deforestation for charcoal as source of income.
