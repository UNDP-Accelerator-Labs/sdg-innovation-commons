## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Venezuela Migrant Incorporation.

## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to accelerate the incorporation process of Venezuelan migrants in their new status of residents in Colombia.


> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The political, social, economic and health crisis in Venezuela has made it the second country with the highest number of forced migrants who have left en masse with 1.7 million Venezuelan migrants, after Turkey with 3.7 million Syrian migrants (UNHCR, 2019).
Since 2015 the impact of migration has been more evident in Colombia. Between 2016 and 2018 there was an exponential growth of Venezuelana origin, from 211,716 in 2016 (Fedesarrollo, 2018) to 1.7 million in 2019 (R4V, 2020). According to the Administrative Registry of Venezuelan Migrants (RAMV), 23.6% of Venezuelans work in informal jobs, 21.9% are independent, 18.2% are unemployed, 9.7% work at home, 7.7% are students , only 0.8% have formal employment and 18.1% do not report productive activity (Fundación Corona, 2020).
In February 2021, the President of Colombia,  announced  the creation of a Temporary Statute of Protection for Venezuelan Migrants, which would function as a complementary mechanism to the international protection regime for refugees and it could potentially benefit more than two million Venezuelans.
The challenge of incorporating migrants into life in Colombia is more relevant than ever. The Venezuelan population presents major problems such as the difficulty in accessing basic services such as health, education or legal work status, adding to these, COVID and violence to which they are victims due to xenophobia or the reappearance of guerrilla movements.

> 

Between 2014 and 2018, more than 5,300 refugee applications have been submitted (R4V, 2020).
462,305 Venezuelans left the country through the Rumichaca International Bridge in 2019 (R4V, 2020).
Colombian Nationality has been granted to more than 24,000 children born in Colombia to Venezuelan parents (R4V, 2020).

97% of the migrants surveyed said that they are not part of associations and organizations that work for Venezuelans (R4V, 2020).
Most of the migrants are under 30 and economically active. (U. Externado + Semana, 2020)
Most of the employed Venezuelans are outside the General Social Security System. (Observatorio Proyecto Migración Venezuela con base en DANE - GEIH)

Myth: "Venezuelans take away work from Colombians"

Reality: There is no conclusive evidence


“Venezuelans in part created their own job opportunities in the informal market by offering basic personal services and developing small independent productive activities and in part they replaced Colombians in the lowest link of the occupational scale, especially in the commercial sectors, restaurants, hotels, construction and personal services.

Colombians abandoned these jobs and, instead of remaining in the job market as unemployed, they have retired to inactivity. For those who stayed, on average, job quality and job satisfaction improved.

Migrants and the host community share Unemployment / job loss as the main concern.


In Colombia, the relationship with the Venezuelan migrant is marked by a constant and pre-existing concern of insecurity / violence and by frequent interaction with Venezuelans on the street.


For the migrant, the cell phone:
it is the possibility of maintaining contact with his family and friends.
it is an indispensable work tool.
is the ability to access entertainment.

The migration experience is accompanied and shared with through social networks.

For the migrant, access to public information systems is not easy.

Migrants send money to their family through new means, such as Fintech and informal money orders.


Many migrants do not have their Venezuelan passport because it is expensive to obtain.


The variety of regularization instruments are complex for most migrants. Those in fair condition seek to maintain their condition, even if it involves leaving and re-entering Colombia.

Migrant are surprised to learn that access to health and education for foreigners is not guaranteed in the same way that it happened in Venezuela with Colombian migrants.


Every day, migrants from the latest wave of migration demand more rights from Colombian institutions.


Colombian rules do not facilitate the insertion of migrants, not just Venezuelans.

For the migrant, the available care is confusing.


 The response from communities, civil society organizations and international cooperation have generated duplication of actions that create difficulty in coordinating the supply.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Acc Lab systemic view of migration, allows us to understand opportunities in the incorporation of migrants in Colombia life and help the government in thier regularization and incorporation.

From collaborating with government and other allies to give electronic IDs, create community bonds within migrants and with the receptor communities and work with private sector to see migration as an oppotunity to invest.

Colombia Acc Lab has been working in linking different actors (internal and external) challenges and actions to contribute with a systemic approach and fast leargings to strenghten the value of the offering or solution.



Working with our moonshot: From Left Behind Hotspots to Hotbeds of Development, we plan to use Behavioral Sciences, technology and unseen opportunities for goverment and industries to build empathy and turn migrant perception into a positive opportunity for Colombia.


> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Acc Lab Colombia accelerates de integration of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia daily life and works with private investment in new ways of leveraging the migrant situation.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we foster empathy in Colombians and their industries to accelerate the incorporation of Venezuelan migrants?


> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We have designed "design sprints" as a way to build incremental experiments which result can be iterated or modified in order to better adapt to the constant changes of the migrant challenge.


> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioural data. We can understand past situations and actions from and to migrants when we see incidents in the news.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are currently working in the digital ID and the app to read it. This as a way to onboard more government agencies through the working prototype.
The second sprint of the app will allow to upload data such as education diplomas, health records and a virtual CV. This requires different types of users, so privacy and authenthicity of the information can be guaranteed.
A long term version of the project will not only allow the IDs to work as identification, but together with the app, will allow social /migrant connection for peer to peer advice and guidance when needed.
From there, we want to further build experiments related to closing the mind gap between Colombians and venezuelans, in order to facilitate the incorporation to daily life, basic services, employability and be seen as an oportunity for companies.
