> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

La Caja Verde consists of a container without electricity that allows to store all the vegetables in a single piece of furniture. This equipment works with water and allelopathy, which is the interaction between vegetables. The system helps keep fruits and vegetables fresh, like they were just picked, for more than two weeks. Hence, the solution makes it possible to take advantage of energy resources by minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, saving money, and to live healthily eating well-preserved food.    This solution is ideal for developing areas, where there is no electricity, and where constant and continuous access to electricity is a luxury. It can also be used in humanitarian disasters as a relief resource for people in need.

The product does not consume electricity and replaces the erroneously widespread use of the refrigerator for the preservation of fruit and vegetables, consuming 64kw/h. But the cold, contrary to what happens with meat and dairy products, which preserves them, ripens vegetables faster, accelerating their putrefaction. Do a search on Youtube to check: Putting "What fruits and / or vegetables go in the fridge for preservation? Nobody recommends keeping vegetables in the fridge.

In addition to not using electrical energy, chemical energy is used because it works thanks to chemical interactions and physical laws. Chemical interactions; ethylene which is the growth and ripening hormone produces the opposite effect on tubers such as potatoes and sweet potatoes, preventing them from sprouting and ripening quickly. To fleshy vegetables we add the water that air causes them to lose and to roots we avoid contact with air by burying them.

Our system is justified by the report of Laura Malvino, a scientist from the University of Illinois who specialises in crop technologies.

With the last 100 users we avoided 108 tons of waste that would go to landfill and generate methane gas into the environment.
