This is the real translation of the transformer garbage can. It is used here to collect garbage such as paper and plastics. And this represents a real opportunity for its users insofar as the community lacks the means to make normal bins available. Thus, these Plasto-containers solve the recycling problem but also and especially that of proximity to users.
