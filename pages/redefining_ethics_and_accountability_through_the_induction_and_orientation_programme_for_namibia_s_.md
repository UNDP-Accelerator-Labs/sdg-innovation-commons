## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

A Learning Government: Redefining the role of ethics and integrity through the induction and orientation: a learning experience for Namibia's public service
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Government is risk-averse and is not keen to try out new ways of doing things - our challenge is to introduce innovative ways of thinking and doing through a mandatory programme such as the induction and orientation programme provides opportunities to embed ethics and professionalism in its design.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The low scores on the citizen satisfaction survey in 2018 is a cause for concern, as well as the recent Afrobarometer and TI Scores on Namibia's governance rating.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Government is the largest employer in the country, employing over 125 000 public servants.  There are approximately 15% of new hires entering the system annually and in turn have to go through an onboarding, induction and orientation process.  This process is not necessarily managed very well, since there are different role players and coordination and governance is somewhat of a challenge.  Setting the right tone is crucial for systems thinking and a requirement for a service-orientation mindset.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Poor service delivery at all levels - inequality, gender - based violence, youth unemployment remians at an all time low.  There is also appears to be a lack of attention to  urgency


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab is considered to be more agile, and encouraging new ways of thinking and doing spur the required creativity and innovation to solve the current challenges of proper orientation.  A good rapport with the public service already exists following the success of the learning experiences with the integrity and the  innovation champions.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we introduce new ways of thinking and innovation for public servants to adopt a whole of government mindset? We need to explore the different avenues and platforms to spur change in skills knowledge and attitude by providing a proof of concept

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Through working together with the partners, collecting data, analyzing the trends and generating hypothesis which we will test

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

They aid in performing some type of gap analysis which will shed light on the previous versions and editions of induction and orientation to prove that the current models of training are not working.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Other Labs, Management Development Institutes across Africa, other public services that are looking at moving away from new public management thinking and wish to embrace innovative tools and methods to improve service delivery  from inside.
