Community-based food security and circular economy during pandemic

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

This weekend I visited the low income community located less than 2 KM from my place on the outskirts of the western part of Bogor, West Java. I came across this community which has created new initiatives since couple of months ago during the pandemic. Young people who were worried about the limited space for movement and the uncertainty of facing a pandemic, had a strong desire to carry out useful activities in their neighborhood. The inter-generational discussion showed the same anxiety experienced by the older generation who were also worried about meeting their food needs and the sustainability of their household economy. They started the initiative by asking permission from a landowner to use his plot of land as a farming location for the local community. With a limited area of ​​land, they decided to use planting media made of used goods such as plastic wrappers for cooking oil and detergent, used plastic bottles, used paint buckets, and so on. The residents are offered to grow the vegetables they wanted, especially for their own consumption. However, residents are also allowed to sell their crops to fellow neighbors. The need for planting media and compost answers the challenge of better waste management. People sort waste from households and the stream that passes through their dense settlement. As a result, in addition to obtaining planting media and compost, the river flow is clean enough for fish farming. In addition, the community also has access to clean water and an irrigation system. The caretakers of the plants are mostly men, especially those who have free time or do not work. Some women earn extra money by participating in marketing vegetables in the neighborhood. A bamboo hall has been built over the river that brings together members of the community across generations and groups. People expressed that being involved in community farming had reduced their stress, made them happy and increased their sense of community pride. Currently the community is in the process of building a greenhouse over the river. Community agility makes their social innovation more developed.
