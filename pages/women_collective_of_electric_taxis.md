The Guerreras Fénix of Umán, are a group of entrepreneurs, who started a women's taxi service to generate resources, without neglecting their children, families or their studies.

Within the group there are women between the ages of 18 and over 60, some divorced, retired, students, but all with the aim of doing good for their community. Their goal in a few years is to open work spaces for more women in other locations, and even entering the labor market in Mérida, “I wish the government would take into account all the sacrifices one makes; motorcycle taxis are not a regular job, and I am in it, I want the well-being of my workers. The last thing that I am doing, I am managing so that the ladies have the social security and the housing loans, like any company”.

They also continuosly create community initiatives to support health, children, and the environment. Their latest action is the electric transition of their motocabs to eliminate their pollution.
