## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Solar powered solutions were widely taken up by Nigerians during the energy crisis as a way around decreased supply from the national power grid, supply chain disruptions and soaring costs of fuels for power generating sets.  *


 'Access enablers are critical' The access to financing solutions was critical for customers looking for alternative energy situations. This partially addressed long-held concerns about the high costs of solar options.  *


 There are opportunities for alternative, decentralised, micro-power solutions to meet the needs of margin communities that are not connected to the national grid, which is the cheapest power source. Some innovators are beginning to explore this space.  *


The strong push for subsidy removal on petroleum products would drastically increase transportation costs. Alternative energy, micro-power solutions and financial access solutions could be critical for public transportation solutions such as the retro-fitted electronic tricycles, which are being tested in the ecosystem.  *


 There is an opportunity to accelerate the swing towards cleaner energy solutions that we saw in 2022, by supporting innovations in this space and advocacy for friendlier policies.  Nigerians spent over USD14bn on power generating sets and fuel in 2020, up from USD12bn in 2019. However the spend on solar solutions is growing even faster. The value of solar materials and components imported into Nigeria between January and March 2021 doubled from about USD8.4mn to USD19.2mn in the same period in 2022 before the peak of the energy crisis.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

There were limited opportunities to deeply explore and map solutions in rural areas. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These types of data were chosen because we wanted to access data that was being frequently updated and feedback from different categories of consumers. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We needed to understand why people and businesses were changing their minds about using solar options that had been available for a long time, but had not been widely accepted. These methods also helped us understand the impact of these experiments on the new users.  We were able to get perspectives from different actors and ecosystems in the energy value chain and track emerging trends. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Hardware Garage - Hardware Accelerator Electric City Energy - Renewable Energy player Solaris Greentech - Alternative Energy player

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Environment and Climate Change & Inclusive and Economic Growth Teams, UNDP Nigeria - We shared our insights and the solutions that had been surfaced with these teams. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

These methods helped us generate insights faster, and track public opinion and reactions across different platforms and socio-economic groups as the crisis unfolded at minimal costs.
