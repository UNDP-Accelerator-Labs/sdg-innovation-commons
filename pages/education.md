> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It's a new private existing school, which just wishes to help the community attain from education (vulnerable children only) together with the other children but because of less financial muscle the school plans to be taking only five vulnerable children from the community we operate from per class. 

The challenge prize may help us improve on the services to the community by giving good quality education and we can extend this service to even helping youths with craft courses to youths at very low fees  for we are also connected to an NGO called multi-service community youth empowerment organization and am the ambassador for solwezi district but service have not yet started because we are lacking support.

We wish to start implementing all our plans by January 2022.
