> Title of the innovation

The reduction of shanty compounds and increase/development  in the countries financial status as a whole

> Brief description of the innovation

Though I’m doing computer science  and I  have have a private  plan that will put Zambian on the map.
 The innovation plan I can share is that we make a bill where Zambians only   vote yes or no to the suggestion of all foreigners owning land in our country to pay rent for  it and not have the right to own land, because if every rich persons comes to buy land our future generations  will have be in a higher disadvantage in the world market and the money flow will be leaving the country more than it Enters causing not only the dollar but all currencies to gain power to our currency hence the economic status will plummet.
  For the shanty compounds to be reduced and cleaned a percentage of the money can be used to uneducated people to clean them up for a good fee per distance.
