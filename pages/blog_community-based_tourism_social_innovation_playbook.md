Introduction

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the tourism sector had been one of the key drivers of
the Thai economy. In 2019, Thailand received nearly 40 million foreign tourists. The
sector generated a revenue of approximately two trillion Baht, accounting for 11% of
the country’s GDP (Bank of Thailand, 2021). However, Thailand’s tourism
development was not without negative side effects: local communities not benefiting
from tourism, exploitative relationships between people and nature, and
environmental degradation, to name a few. While the pandemic has caused major
setbacks to the tourism industry, the disruption also provides an opportunity for
Thailand to reimagine and reposition its tourism industry to move forward on a more
sustainable and resilient path.

Alongside large-scale tourism businesses, Thailand has been fortunate to have
community-based tourism (CBT) developing since the 1990s and playing a role in
driving the sustainable tourism agenda. CBT allows local people to benefit fully from
the economic benefits of tourism and places key decisions in their hands. Being long-
term residents of the areas,
local communities are more incentivised to balance
economic growth and socio-cultural and environmental impacts caused by tourism
activities; at the end of the day, it is their home. However, it is crucial to clear the
misconception that CBT refers to ‘village tourism,’ limited only to certain styles of
tourism that take place in rural areas. CBT is a tourism management model that puts
local communities at the center of the process: tourism by the local communities for
the benefit of the local communities themselves. Thus, it can encompass diverse
tourism styles from rural tourism to urban tourism, nature tourism, or even luxury
tourism. Essentially, CBT is about community empowerment as it is a process in
which local people are empowered to uplift their own livelihood.

Like the overall tourism industry, CBT has been affected by travel
restrictions and changing customer behaviours due to the pandemic.
The speed of change seems to have been accelerated ever since. It is
evident to local communities now that we are living in a world of
volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA). Like COVID-19
which continues to develop diverse subvariants and keeps on
challenging us for more than 2 years now, uncertainties that we have to
face are endless – from newly emerging diseases to climate change,
instability, and possible economic crisis, among others.
political
In addition to the focus on sustainability, being anticipatory and
adaptive is now critical to the survival of CBT, especially given that local
communities might not have the same level of resources as large-scale
players in the tourism industry.

In 2022, the UNDP Accelerator Lab Thailand in collaboration with the
Designated Areas for Sustainable Tourism Administration (DASTA),
Local Alike, and Thailand Policy Lab invited stakeholders from local
communities, the government, the private sector, civil society, and
academia to exchange views on the way forward for CBT in Thailand.
While the discussion reveals multiple areas for development and the
need for multisectoral collaborations, capacity building for
local
communities stands out as one of the prerequisites for success. Since
local communities are the main drivers of CBT, they must be equipped
with frameworks and tools that will enable them to flourish in the VUCA
world and continue to be a driving force toward sustainable tourism and
the attainment of the SDGs.

This toolkit aims at empowering local communities that are involved in
community-based tourism (CBT) to have the capacity to develop their CBT
in a sustainable manner and become more anticipatory of uncertainties.

There are three categories of tools for your choosing.
Each category focuses on different stages of your CBT
journey. To take your CBT to the next level,

purposes. Feel free to look into each tool and pick the

Example

The Becoming of Our CBT

After decades of struggles and living in the
Halabala forest, the Malaya Communist
Party signed a peace treaty with the Thai
government in 1989 and established the
village. Distant relatives from Malaysia and
Singapore came to visit from time to time.
We built a community guesthouse and our
tourism started.

About eight years ago, Dr. Prachyakorn
Chaiyakot, a CBT expert, visited the village
and helped us with everything about CBT.
Afterward, the Tourism Authority of
Thailand organized a competition for
bloggers to film tourism villages. That made
our village’s fame rose exponentially.

Tool Template

Tourism Capacity Mapping

It is crucial to understand your current capacities
concerning CBT, where you are doing well and where
the gaps are. The Tourism Capacity Mapping, inspired
for Sustainable Tourism
by Designated Area
Administration’s and Local Alike’s framework,
is a
perfect tool to help you understand more about the
current situation of your CBT.

How:

Gather around and reflect on various topics relating
to CBT development. Each participant takes turns
giving their input on the areas that they are working
on. Map the inputs into the diagram, where you can
see an overview of all the components and identify
you are doing well, and which needs

Tips & Tricks:

Make sure to gain insights from those who
are most
involved in your CBT for each
component on the map, in order to draw up a
complete, well-rounded picture of your CBT.
You could also include stakeholders from
outside the community to provide their
perspectives.

Stakeholder Mapping

Different stakeholders, whether they are individuals,
groups, or institutions, can play an important role in
your CBT. Stakeholder mapping invites you to think
about who is involved in your CBT because they
may help you turn your dreams into reality.

Example

Stakeholder Mapping

Local Alike

Tips & Tricks:

Try to be specific. It is more useful if you can
pinpoint specific influential individuals/groups.
For example,
identifying ‘Auntie Hong’ and
‘women’s group’ gives a clearer picture than
saying ‘local community’.

Note:

This tool also comes in handy when you begin
developing new initiatives and must determine
which stakeholders to work with.

Tool Template

Tourist Data Collection and Persona

Businesses aim to satisfy customer’s
needs; but do we really understand
those who we are trying to serve? Data
collection and persona help you gain
insights on your customers from both
quantitative & qualitative perspectives.

➔ Quantitative Data: Who your
their
target markets
demographics, and opinions
on your CBT.

are,

➔ Qualitative Data: Understand
your customer’s behaviour,
their likes and dislikes.

How (Quantitative):
Let’s start collecting your tourist data!
Create a simple set of questions for
your customers to fill out before they
leave. It can be on paper or an online
form e.g. Google Forms is free and
easy. See example questions here but
feel free to add your own →

How (Qualitative):
Apart from quantitative data from
the survey, you can observe and
have a more in-depth talk with a
few selected customers. Get to
know them like you get to know a
friend: their background, likes and
little strange behaviours
dislikes,
and all.

Then try develop a few key
personas that represent who your
customers are and what they are
like as a person. Draw a simple
sketch of the persona and list out
their characteristics and favorite
saying!

Example

> Like to stroll around
> Take inspiration from the

Tips & Tricks:

Customer survey seems easy but
is often
forgotten. Try include it as part of the step that
cannot be missed. For example, place the QR code
of the survey at the last stop of the visit, etc.

After collecting the data, visualization of
the
results is very helpful for making sense of the
data. You can also compare the different
visualization over time to see changes in your
customers.

Note:

Customer surveys and personas can give you a
clearer picture of who your CBT is serving, areas of
improvement, and new opportunities in order to
better satisfy your target customers.

Tool Template

Hopes and Fears

Self-reflection is an important part of any
process. What do we hope to achieve? What do
we fear might happen? The answers to these will
provide the ‘why’ to our next steps. The Hopes
and Fears tool invites you to reflect inward on the
many hopes and fears for your CBT.

How:

The facilitator explains the main types of hopes
long-term, etc. The
and fears e.g. short-term,
crazy idea category is also included to induce
everyone to dig deeper or explore their hopes and
fears beyond the immediate practical thoughts.

Then, let each person take some time to reflect
and write down one’s own hopes and fears
concerning CBT. Once everyone writes their
ideas, place them all on the board and review
them together to see key themes across the
responses.

Note:

This activity can provide the direction for
the rest of the process. In later exercises,
when thinking about the future of their
CBT, everyone can refer back to this, and
ensure that their ideas are in alignment
with their hopes and fears.

Looking Forward to
the Future

Knowing where we want to head to will help you design your path and take meaningful steps.
However, thinking about the future is not always easy because it can be very different from the world
we know today. We can and should unbind ourselves, step out of the constraints of today, and
be imaginative! At the same time, we need to recognize the signals that may affect us and shape
our future. Thinking about the future is a balancing act...dreaming the future we want into being
as well as preparing for the uncertainties which we cannot control.

Future Triangle

Plausible futures do not exist in a vacuum; they are a result of
conflicting forces from the past, present, and future. The Future
Triangle is the tool for you to reflect on the weight of the past, the
push of the present, and the pull of the future. The interplay and
changing dynamics between these forces affect your plausible
future.

How:

Invite key members of your CBT to brainstorm on each of these
topics:
• Weight of the past: What are the things that weigh your CBT
down or hold it back from progressing? What are the barriers to
change? What are the historical patterns or structures that
resist changes?

• Push of the present: What are the current trends and drivers
that are pushing your CBT forward? What trends are hot
coming and will shape the future?

• Pull of the future: What are the ideas or visions that represent a
preferred or desired future? What do you hope to see? What do
you hope to avoid?

Example

Future Triangle

Tips & Tricks:

If you do not know where to begin, start by looking at your immediate surrounding
first: the changes in your community, what are driving them, what have been
obstructing the changes, etc. These factors can be revealed at a micro level like
your customer’s behaviour, or at a macro level like governmental policies.

Note:

the present

is something that you see
While push of
happening already and with implications that you are certain
of, pull of the future asks you to consider the ideal image of
the future which you may not be certain about but hope to
attain.

Example

● Push of the present: Environmental-friendly trend is
already gaining momentum and public support today, so
it is shaping the tourism industry in many ways.

● Pull of

the future: Metaverse is still early in its
development stage but has the potential to change the
entire landscape of human interaction, opening new
opportunities in tourism.

Headline of the Future

Let’s shake ourselves out of the present and hop on
a time machine to see the successes that we want
to make the news in the future. Headline of the
Future is a fun activity that challenges you to think
about what your community can accomplish in the
next 10 years concerning CBT.

How:

Let’s get creative! Grab a newspaper, get
into
smaller groups, and ask everyone to imagine future
accomplishments of
their CBT. Write catchy
headlines to capture these successes. What will
appear on the news on this day 10 years from now?

To get a more comprehensive picture, you are
encouraged to include news on major partnerships,
uncertainties and how your community will be
dealing with them.

Future Visioning

Through the Future Visioning activity, key stakeholders are
invited to bring the ideal future state of their CBT to life!
Participants can discuss what want to see in the future, be it
infrastructures, tourism activities, or management systems, etc.

How:

It’s time to get crafty! The facilitator should prepare a map of
the community, markers, crayons, and play dough. Then ask the
participants to discuss what they would like their CBT to look
like in the future, and add those elements using all the art
supplies provided. Things to think about include but are not
limited to…

• What will be your key attractions?
• How will your community look like? What facilities will be

there?

• Who will be the tourists and what will they be doing?
• Who will manage and be involved in your CBT?
• How will sustainability be managed in that scenario?

To achieve a sustainable future for your CBT, several
pathways have to be developed. This road-mapping
tool can guide you to comprehensively design your
pathways and actions to achieve your desired future.

your journey.

Note:

The topics in this roadmap are based on
Designated Area for Sustainable Tourism
Administration’s Pillars of CBT, which cover
every aspect of community-based tourism. If
you do not know where to start with new

helpful for you to identify areas to work on.

Taking Actions

Now that you dream it, next is to do it! After understanding your CBT from past to present and having
clear goals in mind, it is time for you to take the first step towards your dream. “Taking Actions” tools
can help you prioritize your issues, generate ideas, and test them before rolling out in full scale.

Ideation

It’s time to see our options! The more, the merrier! When it
comes to finding good solution ideas, you need to first
gather all your options. Imagine the chance of arriving at a
good solution when you only have three options. How
about when you have 50? Right, so let’s think of as many
as you can.

How:

• Each participant writes their own ideas without

• Do not judge your ideas if they are good or bad. Just

Experimentation and Reflection

Your ideas will not mean anything if you do not put
them into practice. They are only ‘hypotheses’ which
we think would work. Yet, you will never know for sure
until you put them into testing. So, do not be surprised
if you end up modifying your solution so much that it
looks totally different from the original
idea. That is
exactly the point of experimentation! You need to test
your idea, learn what works and what does not, then
develop from there.

How:

Step 1: With details from the idea canvas, write out the
hypothesis behind your solution idea and think of how
you can test this hypothesis on a small scale with
limited resources, so it is ok to fail and learn from the
process without major damage. Also, set a timeframe
for experimentation and start taking the actions!

Step 2: After the experimentation timeframe, revisit the
template and reflect on the results, insights, areas that
went well and areas for improvement. Based on these
reflections, you can develop further plan of actions.

Example

Experimentation and Reflection

Tips & Tricks:

Edison once said, "I have not failed 10,000
times—I've successfully found 10,000 ways
that will not work." Do not be discouraged
when things do not always work as planned
because every wrong attempt discarded is
another step forward. Learning is the ultimate
goal here! Try again. Fail again. And fail better
every time.

Note:

Although this tool
is the last step of the
process, keep in mind that you can always go
back to any of the previous tools as you see
fit. As you do the experimentation, you may
realize that you still
lack insights on your
customers and need to revisit the persona
tool. That is perfectly normal. Feel free to
explore and have fun with your journey!

Chulabhorn Pattana 9 Community,
Yala province

Surrounded by the world-famous Halabala forest, Chulabhorn Pattana 9
community has attracted nature lovers from within and outside the
country. The visitors are also said to enjoy its rich historical heritage
from the time of the Malaya Communist Party.

As part of the Malaya Communist Party, the community struggled with
conflicts and lived in the forest for decades. A peace treaty with the
Thai government was signed in 1989 and Chulabhorn Pattana 9 village
was established. Their ties with relatives and friends from Malaysia and
Singapore started the regular visits to this far-away village. The
community built their guesthouse and became familiar with receiving
visitors.

introduced to the community. Dr. Prachyakorn Chaiyakot, a CBT expert,
worked closely with the new generation in the community to develop
CBT. Given its rich natural and cultural capitals, the community soon
started to gain recognition from several organizations and the media.
With support from both public and private partners, the community has
become one of the leading CBT communities in Thailand.

Their success is not without challenges. The intergenerational gap is
reflected in different tourism management approaches of the pioneers
and the new generation. Recognizing the value of their natural capital
and the growing nature lover market, the new generation is seeking to
promote ecotourism and inspire environmental conversation practices
in the community while also creating economic opportunities for locals.

Here is how Chulabhorn Pattana 9 utilized the toolkit. UNDP Accelerator Lab and Local Alike
team conducted workshops with the community and local stakeholders with an original
plan to do sensemaking exercises, then invite everyone to think about the desirable future,
identify issues to work on, and start experimenting. Yet, you may notice that the process
turned out far less linear. We jumped back and forth in order to fill gaps of knowledge as we
found them along the way.

Nongsan Community,
Sakon Nakhon province

Unlike Chulabhorn Pattana 9 which attracts visitors with its rich natural
resources, Nongsan community’s charm lies in its simple rural lifestyle,
friendly locals, and indigo dye crafts.

Nongsan’s tourism business was an initiation of Pornpimon Mingmitmee,
a young artist who returned to her hometown in 2016 after years in
Bangkok. She learned of CBT concept and saw its potential
for
developing her community. At first, she wanted to start big but her plan
was questioned by many. Support from local authorities was also not
available at the time.

She had to start small, prioritizing the development of people within the
community first. She invited a few interested locals to join her initiatives.
Then, with the ‘King’s Wisdom for Sustainable Tourism’ project supported
by the Tourism Authority of Thailand, Local Alike, and UNDP in 2017, the
community became one of the CBT rising stars in Thailand. The success
helps gain local momentum and now neighboring villages such as Nang
Toeng community are also engaging in CBT.

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed both challenges and opportunities to
Nongsan community. Many locals who used to work in major cities lost
their jobs and returned home. Nongsan CBT is now joined by locals who
have built their skills from jobs in the cities. So, local micro-entrepreneurs
now loosely join hands to deliver goods and services, and take Nongsan
CBT to the next chapter.

Create action ideas but soon realize
that we do not have a clear
understanding of the customers, so
it is a back and forth process
between idea development and
understanding customers.

Here is a quick look into the process with Nongsan community. It is a rather straightforward
approach to the CBT toolkit, which is another way to demonstrate how flexible this playbook
can be. There is no need to use every tool kit in this playbook to obtain solutions for your goals.

Each individual community is different, so it is completely up to you on how you are going to
implement these tools based on your own context and goals!
