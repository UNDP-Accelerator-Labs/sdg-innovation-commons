Junior Agripreneur

> Brief description of the innovation

Junior Agripreneur  is an Ag Edu and Ag Tech innovation designed to equip future generations with relevant skills to be part of the 4th Industrial Revolution. We identify and nurture student s abilities and help them place them in the Food Systems(Agriculture Value Chain). We merge the student s professional dreams and assymetry the same with an entrepreneurial skill so they can be able to create employment for them and those around them. We change attitudes towards farming by showcasing  lucrative opportunities  that exist in the value chain

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We work with private schools. Students pay a sternly fee which we use to run the program afford the upkeep of our staff. To enter public schools we need a partner who will find the program  or be given funding by the Ministry of Education or Ministry of Agriculture.

We are in 20 private schools  in Lusaka only. There are more than 500 private schools in Zambia. There are even more public schools. 

The challenge money will help us procure modern advanced  equipment for kids to work with,advertise, improve our Human resources.( more employment)

We are environmental stewards who take interest In water conservation, organic farming methods as to keep our soil healthy. Healthy soil healthy food. Technological advantage ( precision farming) plays a role in reducing fertiliser use and conserving water.

> Technical Feasibility

We plan to grow organically as we are now branching out from Lusaka to new provinces where we are  finding high reception. Our innovation is dynamic as we add new tech as soon as it is released. We are also fusing Indegenous knowledge systems into application used for plant protection so it can benefit locals. We allow students to come up with all creativity as well.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We will employ more youths and women on top of those employed as we grow.  Spill over effects from students to parents has already shown results as some students are taking projects home. The innovation is relevant as the whole regime seeks skills that will enhance productivity and create value around.
