Since 2009, Glink started to attend HIV/AIDS workshops at HIV/AIDS prevention and control Committee (known as HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Centre). Along with being selected as one of the six most potential groups registered in “Develop Capacity for Self-Help Groups in Viet Nam” under the Health Policy Innovation (HPI) project, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Glink began to have adequate capacity and confidence to implement projects from 2010.
