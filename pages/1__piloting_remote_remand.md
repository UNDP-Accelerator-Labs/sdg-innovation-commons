## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Working with the judiciary in a country with politically volatile situation posed bottlenecks 2. Introducing a new modality of procedure is difficult where there are no standard procedures. This caused skepticism and delays among technocrats. 3. The use of technology in rule of law forums may seem like a developmental achievement in theory, however there are human rights issues that need to be considered in the rollout. 4. Data collection and monitoring the experiment is an ongoing challenge. Due to the sensitive nature of the cases, data could only be collected by officials in the magistrate. 5. Technical delays in the

The learnings of the frontier challenge were not blogged. 

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes we experienced bottlenecks in getting the Chief justice to draft practice directives for the implementation of the remote remand experiment. He has not released the draft to date, however we found other means of beginning the experiment. This delay and uncertainty in starting was difficult to resolve as the office of the CJ is a senior position in the judicial system.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Microwave internet provides a closed private network in which judiciary can use to remand cases, eliminating the risks of interruptions, it is much faster, resistant to whether conditions, and has a low latency.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Eswatini has 6 magistrate courts in total. The microwave internet innovation is not well explored and used in Eswatini, and the digitalization of the remands sessions is a new innovation. This helped unpack the system to open up to digitalization, exploring technology and new ways of conducting this form of court proceeding. 
## Partners
