> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation consists of:
-Producing a cheap source of protein -through egg production.
 -producing meat product (chicken meat)
-hatching black Australorp eggs, in order to lessen the waiting period for chicken delivery  for other farmers in my local community and the nation at large in time.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My project is aimed at alleviating unemployment levels in our community through self empowerment.
Chicken when ready will be supplied and or sold to local community as a source of protein hence generating a income.
The eggs produced will be sold to generate income.
hatched eggs will have a value addition to the project buy selling day old or week old chicks which cost more than an egg hence generating even more income from the project.

> Technical Feasibility

The project is a long term plan. Aimed at being among one of the zambian chick producers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project will Lessen the shortage of eggs in the community and the local markets(retailers).
