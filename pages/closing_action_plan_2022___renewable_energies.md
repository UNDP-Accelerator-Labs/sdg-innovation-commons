## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Our participation in the "Discover and Deploy" campaign allowed us to identify a wide variety of solutions with the potential to improve the quality of life of worse-off people. For example, we discovered "green boxes" that use allelopathy to keep fruits and vegetables fresh, wind turbines that can be built and replicated because they are open patent, and plastic bottle systems that allow water to be stored on top of house roofs and thus heat it to provide a "sun shower," among other solutions. These experiences and the related lessons learned have led us to expand our work in a learning cycle. From the data analysis derived from the solution mapping, we have highlighted the following patterns and insights:

• There is no one technology that can be applied in every situation. For example, in some locations with significant levels of solar radiation, solar energy-based solutions may be the natural choice over those that rely on other sources.

• Having access to technology does not necessarily mean that you have a solution. Habits are just as important. In addition, participatory processes and organizational models matter. Energy production and consumption refer to both resources and the way energy is used.

• Women are in charge of most of the domestic work and care duties. Therefore, they are responsible for many tasks that require energy solutions, such as cooking food and preserving it, doing laundry, or bathing their children, among other duties.

• Open hardware can become a great opportunity. Thanks to open patents, technologies can reach further regions in need, and it can be easily replicated.

• Many technologies were designed as prototypes, and some of them were manufactured with recycled materials, waste, or very simple elements. The use of this type of materials shows us the possibility of scaling these technologies at a different speed and being able to involve other communities in their creation. For example, Liter of Light uses plastic bottles and readily available and inexpensive materials (re-used panels, batteries, and simple power supplies) to provide lighting fixtures to communities with limited or no access to electricity.

There are emerging signals that the digitalization of the energy sector will be a major trend in the coming years. The Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence are tools used for the increasing digitalization of the energy sector. Also, there are increasing efforts for integrating renewables and other economic activities, such as agriculture. Another emerging signal is that there is greater attention to achieving a fair energy transition.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Internally, this learning cycle is being developed simultaneously with others that had significant growth during 2022. Therefore, the first barrier refers to the time the Lab could devote to it while working on other actions as well. However, we have been systematizing our findings and have participated in the #PeoplePowered campaign, and, in 2023, we hope to launch specific knowledge products, forge alliances, and conduct field experiments. Additionally, the energy debate in Argentina is an extremely sensitive topic, particularly concerning rates. Therefore, we will advance adopting a more organic approach alongside other CO areas to have a comprehensive vision of how to integrate ourselves into the national ecosystem and form alliances with public agencies.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

When we joined the “Discovery & Deploy” campaign, we started the solutions mapping. To identify solutions, the Co_Lab interviewed key informants and grassroots project leaders, studied complementary resources, and carried out targeted searches on mass and social media. This line of action led to the beginning of a learning cycle. For the exploration, we carried out a scan of emerging signals, identified through the review of reports and specialized publications, report monitoring, and data measured in real time by energy management agencies. These signals were systematized for the development of the report.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The selected methods will facilitate our contribution to understanding the processes through which available technologies become appropriated by communities facing energy shortages. To this end, we are identifying patterns and lessons learned linked to grassroots experiences promoting renewable energies.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We are establishing relationships with civil society organizations working with renewable energy projects in the territories. In some cases, we were able to map solutions with their help.  We also talked to organizations that work on open hardware. In addition, we are exploring emerging signals and, to help map the ecosystem, we are conducting interviews with key informants. We are also establishing different types of partnerships.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We are establishing relationships with researchers working on renewable energies and open hardware.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Although we have not yet explored this possibility, we would be interested in seeking out funds from the private sector to promote the portfolio of actions. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We had some exploratory meetings with government agencies such as the Secretariat of Energy and Behavioral Science Unit. We established contact with areas of the government, such as the Secretariat of Energy or the Behavioral Science Unit. In 2023, we will keep on looking for opportunities for coordination and collaboration with the public sector for the design and implementation of the portfolio of experiments.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The mapped solutions are being developed by stakeholders who, in general, have not had links with UNDP (except for one linked to a project of the TICCA Network, an initiative about territories and areas that are conserved by indigenous people and local communities). The Lab could build alliances with stakeholders from the areas of science, technology, and innovation (researchers, teachers, students, entrepreneurs, etc.) or civil society organizations in the territories (support organizations, cooperatives, etc.).

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In 2023, we plan to work using an organic approach alongside different areas within UNDP allowing the interaction between the program area in general and the communication, private sector, and environment cluster.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The solutions mapping has progressed, and valuable information has been gathered; the work cycle has begun, and we have already contacted key informants from different areas of the national government (such as the Secretariat of Energy and Behavioral Science Unit) and subnational governments (housing areas of the Province of Buenos Aires and Chaco).  As we have seen in our experience, these initial conversations are critical for establishing relationships that will hopefully facilitate the subsequent arrival to the territories for energy experimentation purposes and the possibility of scaling up, either in this instance or in other cycles, in any of the three stages of the loop.  In 2023, we will work to strengthen these ties and promote other alliances with the public sector to promote the growth of this learning cycle, and a portfolio of actions aimed at promoting public debate on this topic— with a "bottom-up" and prospective approach— or scale related interventions in Argentina.
