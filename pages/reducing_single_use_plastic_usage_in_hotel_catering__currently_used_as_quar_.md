Reducing toxic single-use plastics used for catering food and water in state mandated quarantine facilities in Samoa
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that despite the plastic ban in Samoa, the hotels, currently serving as state appointed quarantine centers in Samoa, excessively use-singe use plastic for serving food and beverages during the mandatory 21-day quarantine, exposing passengers to plastic toxins and generating plastic waste contributing to the already hellacious plastic waste management problem in Samoa. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Plastic in Samoa is still seen only as an environmental hazard and not a public health concern. Thus, the Ministry of Health (MoH) and National Emergency Operations Committee (NEOC) did not even consider the use of plastic at the quarantine facilities and provided no guidelines on avoiding/ reducing plastic in the government sponsored 21-days mandatory quarantine.   As a protective measure for covid 19, Samoa closed its borders to all international travelers. Only travels approved by the government can be repatriated to Samoa and must undergo a mandatory 21-day institutional quarantine managed and paid by the government. With the borders shut, international tourism is snubbed out. Therefore, to keep hotels afloat, many hotels are converted into quarantine centers.   Ministry of Health (MoH) and National Emergency Operations Committee (NEOC) have a clear health and hygiene guideline for the quarantine center ensuring no covid infections escape from the quarantine sites.  However, MoH and NEOC have no guidelines on food and catering supplies for the quarantine centers. In the absence of these guidelines, most of the quarantine centers use single-use plastic cutlery and to-go boxes for serving meals and packaged drinking water. Over a period of 21 days, this is not only exposing passengers in quarantine to plastic toxicity, and it is also leading to excessive plastic waste.   California’s Proposition 65, also called the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act, first became law in the state in 1986. It is intended to help Californians make informed decisions about protecting themselves from chemicals that could cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm.  The type of plastic containers used in Samoa for serving hot food are not food safe and are labelled with Proposition 65 warnings on the vendor websites selling these containers in California.   However due to lack of awareness and policies around plastic toxicity, there are no guidelines from the MoH on plastic usage in Samoa and more specifically in quarantine sites.   Additionally, all the waste from the quarantine site, including food waste and plastic is incinerated. The incinerators currently used in Samoa do not have required level of technology upgrade to be able to contain toxins released from incinerated plastic, adding to the air pollution and health hazard. Further, this also adds unnecessary cost to the government.

AccLab has still not come across quantitative evidence of plastic being treated as public health concern in Samoa. The types of plastic used in food and beverage services in Samoa are deemed as contributing to cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm under California’s Proposition 65.   Government of Samoa has recognized plastic as an environment concern. The Waste (Plastic Ban) Management Regulation 2018 was officially endorsed by Cabinet of the Government of Samoa in 2018 to manage the plastic problem in Samoa with commitment to protect the country’s oceans and marine environment. This ban prohibits the import, manufacture, export, sale, and distribution of plastic shopping bags, packing bags and straws effective from 30 January 2019.  However, plastic continues to be widely used in the catering industry. AccLab sees an opportunity to convince the government agencies to reduce the use of single-use plastic in its programs and set an example for others to follow.   To bring attention to the extent of the problem and make a compelling case, AccLab used product dimensions, mentioned on the vendor platforms like Amazon, to calculate the volume of single-use plastics like cutlery, containers, and plastic bottles that is currently incinerated. This volume is then visually represented for the audience to relate with the extent of the disposed plastic.

Samoan government is in its next phase of plastic ban, wants to eliminate plastic to-go containers. This ban so far is coming from the environmental concern perspective and mostly pushed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. By acknowledging plastic as a public health concern, gives a chance to engage the Ministry of health too in fight against eliminating single-use plastic usage.  There is a growing number of citizens that are concerned about the environment and champion better health. Samoa Recycling and Waste Management Association (SWRMA) informed AccLab about concerned citizens who collected water bottles from their quarantine period and brough for recycling at the same time urging SWARMA to act/ influence government to reduce waste.   AccLab in its exploratory study also spoke to several people who stayed in quarantine centers to understand their experience and many of the people concurred with excessive use of plastic that has easy alternatives.   All these signals point about it being the right time to put our weight behind eliminating various sources of single-use plastic and reduce plastic waste.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This challenge emerged out of personal experience of one of the AccLab team members who stayed in the state mandate quarantine and had no option of avoiding plastic.   Right after her quarantine, she raised her concern about excessive plastic use in quarantine centers and many people agreed to the problem, but no one in the eco-system took it up as a challenge and is currently working with the Ministry of Health to reduce plastic in the quarantine facilities.   UNDP with its huge focus on climate action and has a project on plastic waste management and circular economy where AccLab helped in designing experiments. By working with MoH in reducing plastic use, AccLab is trying to diversify the stakeholders who can be engaged in reducing plastic waste and deepen UNDPs portfolio.   Further, AccLab is also involved in understanding green livelihoods that can be integrated with Circular Economy and Rejuvenating Tourism aspect of the SIDS offer (UNDP’s strategy for the MCO). Lessons learnt from providing alternative to plastic in the catering services will help AccLab to champion the use of local eco-friendly solutions and green strategies which would be incorporated in AccLab’s work this year, especially in developing Rejuvenating Tourism vertical.  

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Plastic is both an environment and a health concern. AccLab Samoa is experimenting with sustainable alternatives for reducing toxic single-use plastic used in catering services at the state mandated quarantine facilities in Samoa.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Our learning question is how we can start a conversation on plastic being considered as a public health concern in addition to seeing it as an environmental concern, and therefore reduce/ limit use of single-use plastic in the catering services at the hotels.    By doing so, involving the ministry of health in pushing for reduction in single-use plastic containers/ cutlery and water bottles from government sponsored quarantine program. We assume this will encourage the catering industry, who bid for government programs, will reduce the single-use of plastic in their services.   We will also explore the locally availability of alternative to single-use plastic that can used by the catering industry thereby giving a push to the local economy and reducing plastic imports.   The lessons learnt will be included in our work on rejuvenating tourism.  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

By closely observing food and water catering both from the service provider's perspective (vendors/ hotels) and serviced customers (people staying in the quarantine facilities), we intent to surface behavior patterns that make disposable plastic as a preferred option for catering in the quarantine facilities. These insights will help us find suitable alternatives to plastics in the catering services, and make a switch with least resistance.  Next we want to run experiments in the quarantine facilities, that are managed as per the guidelines of the MoH and NEOC. By closely monitoring 5-6 quarantine facilities we want to generate data on customer feedback, cost of shifting from plastic to sustainable alternatives etc. and use these for proposing national guidelines around single-use plastic in first quarantine facilities level, followed by catering guidelines. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Currently MoH and quarantine facilities rely on anecdotal evidence, like stealing of steel cutlery by passengers, high cost of plastic alternatives, passengers refusing food in paper boxes etc., in justifying use of single-use disposables for catering in the quarantine facilities. Though the experiments, we want to bring in data to be able to make more informed switch. Further, currently, decisions are made just on the cost of procuring the plastics for catering requirements. However, Government of Samoa also spends significantly in managing the plastic waste generated. The actual cost of using plastic in the quarantine center therefore is much higher. Looking at the cost of transporting plastic bottles, incinerating plastic waste etc. therefore will give more data points to the government from moving away from the current plastic options.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Samoa Travel Authority (STA) and Samoa Hotel Association (SHA) could be our partners for the growth stage. Learnings from this experiment can inform the policies around catering industry.  Samoa is expected to open its borders for tourists by the end of 2022, this also gives Samoa an opportunity to pivot towards rejuvenating tourism moving forward.
