## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Grassroots Innovation "Mingas"
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to co-create solutions in participatory processes to solve common problems identified by market vendors from Quito´s largest herbal medicine market who currently face devaluation of their productive activities.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Historically, popular markets have been fundamental in urban food provision. In Quito, fresh products supply chain depends mainly on four wholesale markets which provide 63% of the total food crops available in markets and fairs. Despite their importance in supplying food to the city, the absence of public policies aimed at protecting and strengthening popular markets has caused them to weaken and lose customers, whose consumption patterns have changed. In fact, the number of chain supermarkets doubled to that of markets in 2019. (1) The consequences of change in consumption patterns are problematic given that popular markets are places of production and reproduction of culture, care and life, mainly in the hands of women.

The San Roque market is the main host location for indigenous population, expelled from the countryside since the 1970s, therefore, it plays a key role in the connection between rurality and the city. In this same area, the “May First Central Platform” has been operating since January 15, 1975, bringing together more than 200 merchants, of which more than 100 are herbalists dedicated to the production, collection and sales of medicinal herbs. In the early 70s, after continuous expulsions from streets and plazas where their informal sales occurred, herbalists self-organized brought about the “May First Central Platform”, originally a mud paddock, where with minga and with self-managed resources, they casted their concrete slab or “platform”.

The Platform became, from then on, the city's main medicinal herb distribution center. It supplies intermediary merchants from other markets in the city, including supermarkets and businesses that use medicinal herbs for processing packaged herbs, teas, essential oils, cosmetics, etc.), as well as direct consumers. Wholesale, however, does not represent an advantage or greater profit. In fact, more than 85% of these producers earn less than the minimum wage. Intermediaries impose ceilings on prices and raise the final price by up to 200%. (2)

Minga is a quichua word and an ancestral practice consisting of collaborative work to bring foward community needs such as the building of communal ditches, roads, planting and harvesting or any common needs.

The Grassroots Innovation Minga, coordinated by Ecuador´s AccLab, is a process of co-creation and testing of solutions to respond to challenges faced by herbal market vendors. The intervention culturally adapted Design Thinking Methodology to a popular context. Three thematic challenges were tackled: harnessing of medicinal plants, ancestral knowledge preservation, and climate change.

The minga consists of 4 stages: Empathize and define the problem, devise, prototype, and test solutions with accessible technologies in a constant exercise of collective intelligence.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

73,1 % of herbalists are over 60 years old and have been working for more than 31 years.

Their children are not interested in taking over the trade as they consider it too strenuous with very little income.

Herbalists hold the ancestral knowledge of identifying medicinal plants, pruning them, and understanding its uses from an andean cosmovision. They protect ecosystems and mantain health, life and culture alive.

By 2021, the food insecurity rate in Ecuador reached 13%, while food waste reached more than 46 thousand tons. In addition, it is estimated that 30% of the Ecuadorian population's expenditure on food is made directly in popular markets, of which 48% corresponds to trade in greengrocers, fruit shops and neighborhood shops. Thus, 75% of the food consumed in the city is supplied from popular markets. In this context, popular markets in Ecuador are fundamental places within the country's food system, since they represent an important contribution to food sovereignty and an alternative to the livelihoods of thousands of Ecuadorian families. In addition, they are connection points between rurality and the city, they keep culture alive and are intercultural spaces. However, the absence of public policies aimed at protecting and strengthening these spaces, and local economic models, has caused the weakening of the markets, putting at risk the life support structures of those who trade and those who go to the market. Likewise, the increasing perception of poor food quality, danger and little hygiene, has caused a decrease in customers and a change in consumption patterns that has favored commerce in large surfaces; increasing and making urban and environmental problems more complex. These threats mainly affect women, since market management and commercialization is led by them as well as the families economy.


When Ecuador´s indigenous uprisings occur, it becomes evident that the city depends on the countryside and agricultural work, yet it is not valued.

What if there this is the last generation of medicinal plant collectors and producers? The devastating effects are many: Loss of culture and ancestral knowledge, loss of a health system relied on by thousands of people from popular sectors, loss of ecosystems as their work protects mountains, reeves and natural settings.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Actors trust us and are willing to experiment and learn from this project. As Accelerator Lab, we have strong field work capabilities- combining popular education and ethnographic tools along with Design Thiking adopted to vulnerable contexts. Our perspective can bring in new results as there is a bias in development approach in other actors, who have worked in "capacity building" oriented in classical entrepeneural concepts and not a Solidarity Economy approach, which is best needed in this context. Our slogan, "no solution without the concerned" brought to practice and introduced to our CO as a gold standard.


> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Accelerator Lab, along with Quito´s Municipality, City Museum and Market Vendors from four main markets will co-create solutions in hands-on community process.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What problems and challenges do Quito markets face today and what are the possible impacts of those problems?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

During first and second phase of Design Thiking we will visit markets with innovators to do ethnographic observation. On the other hand, by using cartography, we´ll apply systems thinking to hightlight and understand the connections, flows , actors and interactions in "Territories that Heal" (herbs and food- collection and distribution).

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Herbalists and market vendors play an important role in connecting rurality and urban spaces and in preserving the environment. We want to make visible the multiplicity of roles, connections. For instance, ravines, are places where plants are collected by healers, becoming guardians of these ecosystems that are under pressure by urban projects and climate change. Where do plants come from? Where are they distributed? Who buys them? Is traditional medicine alive? Are there intermediaries? Where are the sacred places located for ancestral rituals in Quito? What are the interconnections?
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

In recent years, due to decreasing consumption in popular markets, lack of generational handover, endangered herbal species caused by urbanization and climate crisis, ancestral knowledge about the uses and benefits of medicinal plants is being lost. With herbalists we asked ourselves: How can we preserve that knowledge? How can we disseminate the rich offer of our market?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Over 45 years, no written registration has been done of the market sale products. We will crowdsource this information by deploying students in the market who will be in charge of speaking to herbalists, and collect data regarding medicinal plants, uses, and ancestral classification of these (cold and hot plants). From oral knowledge to written, we will be able to disseminate the diversity of plants and knowledge.


> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Validating the information will be challenging as there is no references to ancestral plant classification and ethno-illnesses.  For that, we will hold a workshop and validation with ancestral medicine man.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What low cost and innovative solutions are possible to reduce surplus production?  What are the benefits of drying with a solar oven than hang drying "as always"?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Surplus products, weather conditions or low sales, among other problems, mean perishable products, like herbs, are lost from one day to the other. As a consequence, they are sold at low prices or are discarded, causing economic losses. In response, herbalists have used rudimentary systems for drying the product, often exposing plants directly to the sun and the environment.

Prototyping a solar dryer will then be  tested to measure whether it has more effectiveness in shorter drying times, higher product quality than traditional hang drying.


> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Empirical methods rarely are measured so we want to measure level of humidity between traditional methods and solar oven dryer (not solar energy driven, but sun based oven). This can help herbalists increase their production and those, who do not have a place to hang dry, may be interested in the new method.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Undomesticated herbs come from wild ridges, but where exactly and under whose jurisdiction are those areas?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

*GEOREFERENING* (is our main method but I can´t add it. We will map ecosystems where herbs are collected.


> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The need to map recollection places was raised when herbalists expressed to the Ministry of Environment the obstacles they face in accessing recollection ecosystems: water contamination, deforestation, or guards impeding their passing. There is no certainty about the jurisdiction of those areas, therefore georreferenced data will serve as evidence and argument in discussions with government officials.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Empowerment and innovation to occur. Herbalists become visible and valued. We need national media, city museum as champions.
