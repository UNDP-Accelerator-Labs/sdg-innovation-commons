Introduction to the Drying Process

A drying process is a mass transfer process involving the removal of water or another solvent by evaporation
from a solid, semi-solid, or liquid1. Drying is often the last step in production before selling or packaging
products. It is one of the oldest production processes, with more than a hundred different dryer types currently
available2. Materials that are typically dried include food, industrial materials, domestic items, agricultural and
marine products, etc.

Drying processes are needed for various reasons:

Storage

a)
To prevent materials from decomposing quickly due to the activity of microorganisms. For
instance, agricultural and marine products must be dried before storage to prevent or eliminate
the growth of microbes that harm them.

Processing

b)
To produce a particular type of product. For instance, salted ﬁsh is prepared by soaking ﬁsh in a
salt solution followed by drying. Similarly, many vegetable dishes, including salted vegetables,
dried chiles, and others, are dried before being sold as a ﬁnal product.

Transportation

c)
The drying process makes transportation easier. Biomass or a material will be lighter and smaller
when its water content is lower, which improves its transportability.

The drying mechanism in the SMART Solar Dryer

The air recirculation process of the SMART
Solar Dryer is shown in Figure 7 below. The
drying chamber will ﬁrst be ﬁlled with products
that need
to be dried. The Solar
collector-heated air rising into the drying
chamber removes moisture from the products.
Crossﬂow fans located on the direct air inlet of
the drying chamber from the solar collector
ensure that the heated air is distributed across
the drying chamber. Air exiting the drying
chamber is recirculated to the solar collector
through the PVC pipe (coloured yellow) to

enable reuse of hot air. The water moisture
removed from the product is contained in the
recirculating air; the water content is removed
when the door is opened at 1-2 hour intervals
for product inspection.

The PVC pipe contains a blower to assist
recirculation of air from the drying chamber to
the solar collector. If the ambient temperature
is below 30 Celsius, a heating element in the
PVC pipe can be activated to supplement the
heating process in the solar collector.

Operating Procedures and Maintenance
for the SMART Solar Dryer

Drying is a process to reduce the water content of products. The extent of reduction of water content depends
on the product being dried and drying time. Testing and optimization needs to be done to determine the
duration of drying needed for each product.

Proper operation and maintenance of the SMART Solar Dryer is essential to ensure that the machine is in good
condition and meets the standards for the drying process.

The SMART Solar Dryer can be operated at any time of the day; please note that it operates most efficiently
under warm and sunny conditions. It is recommended that at least 1 person is available to inspect the products
being dried at regular intervals, as drying may be faster or slower depending on ambient temperature and
sunlight.

Before drying process:

Place the solar dryer on a ﬂat surface to prevent sliding, and away from surrounding high objects
that may cast shadows on the solar dryer.

Look out for mould or fungus, especially in the drying chamber, and wipe with a clean tray cloth for
hygienic purposes.

It is recommended that fruits, vegetables or other products be sliced prior to drying. This is to
increase the area of exposure and speed up the drying process.

There are four (4) trays available for placing products for drying. Take out each tray and spread out
the products evenly across the area of each tray. (75cm X 100cm). This is to allow the dry air to ﬂow
around the exposed areas of the products, increasing the efficiency of the drying process.

8)

“Preheat” the solar dryer by letting it sit exposed to the sun for 10-30 minutes to achieve the
optimum temperature in the drying chamber. Turn on the crossﬂow fan and leave the door ajar
during this period to remove any moisture from the solar dryer.

There are ﬁxed operational limits (relative humidity=45% or temperature=60 Celsius) for the heater.
The heater should not be used for more than 2 hours at a time because it is ﬁxed onto a PVC pipe
and overuse can melt the pipe. Replacing the PVC pipe with a metal pipe, applying interior air
circulation, or other changes may allow for longer operation of the heater.

If operating the dryer when sunlight is unavailable (e.g., evenings, during rainy weather, etc.), turn
on the heater (requires power source) and set the desired temperature. Do not operate the heater
for more than 2 hours. Allow a cooling period of 10-30 minutes before turning on the heater again.

If the product is not dry enough, extend the drying time. Insert the trays with products, close the
door completely and use the lock to secure the door. Every one to two-hours, open the door for a
minute to release the humid air and inspect the products.

Note: Please read the safety precaution in this manual.

After drying:

9)

Use gloves or a handcloth when removing trays as they might be hot to touch. Alternatively, allow
the trays to cool down inside the drying chamber by opening the door.

10)

Remove products and wipe the tray clean after each use. This is to ensure the hygiene of the trays.

11)

Turn off all electronics and electrical appliances, and the main power supply after use.

SMART Solar Dryer Safety Precautions

The SMART Solar Dryer contains electronic devices as well as electrical appliances such as a crossﬂow fan and
heating blower. The following precautions are important for the safety of the operator and the solar dryer.

1)

Heater
The heater is an additional heating mechanism to supplement the solar collector. When the ambient
temperature is not high enough for the solar collector to operate alone, or if operating in low sunlight
conditions, the heater can support or replace solar heating. The SMART solar dryer’s heater is controlled
by an Arduino-based humidity and temperature sensor located inside the drying chamber. If humidity in the
dryer rises above 70% Relative Humidity, the heater will automatically turn on until it decreases below 55%
Relative Humidity.

a. DO NOT turn on the heater for more than 2 hours. Let it cool for 10-30 minutes before turning on the

heater again.

b. Always check on the solar dryer and release humid air at intervals of 1-2 hours.

c. Perform a visual check on the condition of heaters and sensors before operating the SMART solar dryer.

2)

Controller box
The electronic components are kept inside an airtight, waterproof container box. However, small amounts
of condensation can accumulate on the clear plastic door. If present, wipe it off with a clean cloth before
and after operation.

3)

Crossﬂow fan blower
Do not to stick your ﬁngers into the moving fan. The crossﬂow fan blower will almost always be in operation
during the drying process.

4)

Tray
The trays can be extremely hot after the drying process. Use cloth or gloves when handling the trays or
open the door and allow the trays to cool before removing.

5)

Operation
Please do not leave drying products unattended for an extended period. Checking on drying products is
as important as maintaining the solar dryer. Check regularly at one-to-two hour intervals to prevent the
product from over-drying or burning.

If SMART Solar Dryer is not in use, switch off all electronics and electrical appliances and switch off the
main switch power supply. Always close the door to prevent pests from entering the chamber.

Pengenalan Kepada Proses Pengeringan

Proses Pengeringan

1.1
Proses pengeringan adalah proses pemindahan jisim yang melibatkan penyingkiran air atau pelarut lain melalui
penyejatan daripada pepejal, separa pepejal atau cecair1. Pengeringan selalunya menjadi langkah terakhir
sebelum menjual atau membungkus produk. Ia adalah salah satu proses tertua, dengan lebih daripada seratus
jenis pengering yang berbeza tersedia pada masa ini2. Bahan yang biasanya dikeringkan termasuk makanan,
bahan perindustrian, barangan domestik, hasil pertanian dan laut, dan pelbagai bahan lain.

Proses pengeringan diperlukan untuk pelbagai sebab:

Penyimpanan

a)
Untuk mengelakkan bahan daripada cepat reput disebabkan oleh aktiviti mikroorganisma.
Sebagai contoh, hasil pertanian dan laut mesti dikeringkan sebelum disimpan untuk mengelakkan
atau menghapuskan pertumbuhan mikrob yang membahayakan bahan tersebut.

Pemprosesan

b)
Untuk menghasilkan sesuatu jenis produk. Sebagai contoh, ikan masin disediakan dengan
merendamkan ikan di dalam larutan garam, lalu diikuti dengan pengeringan. Serupa dengan ini,
banyak hidangan sayur-sayuran, termasuk sayur-sayuran masin, cili kering, dan lain-lain,
dikeringkan terlebih dahulu sebelum dijual sebagai produk akhir.

Pengangkutan

c)
Proses pengeringan memudahkan pengangkutan. Biojisim atau bahan akan menjadi lebih ringan
dan
rendah, sekaligus meningkatkan
kebolehangkutannya.

Pengenalan kepada SMART Solar Dryer

TObpinai NIngkokoton KoBUruon KampuNG (TONIBUNG) atau Friends of Village Development, sebuah badan

tidak berasaskan keuntungan yang diterajui oleh orang asal, memenangi geran dibawah Cabaran Inovasi SDGs

Jepun (Japan SDGs Innovation Challenge), yang dibiayai oleh Pejabat Kabinet Kerajaan Jepun untuk

menghasilkan prototaip pengering solar (SMART solar dryer). Dengan Kerjasama multinasional, termasuklah

Japan Innovation Network dan AGC Green-Tech, SMART solar dryer dihasilkan di bengkel TONIBUNG di Kg.

Nampasan, Penampang, Sabah. Sehingga kini, dua prototaip telah dihasilkan dan akan dihantar ke lokasi ujian

untuk tujuan penanda aras. SMART solar dryer ini telah digunakan secara khususnya untuk mengeringkan

produk berasaskan tumbuhan seperti buah-buahan, herba dan sayur-sayuran.

Berdasarkan dapatan ujian prototaip pertama,
pengumpul solar kubah dicipta dengan tujuan
untuk mengumpulkan lebih banyak haba dan
menyalurkan ke pengering solar. Pada latihan
kedua di Kampung Kauron, Keningau Sabah,
Malaysia, TONIBUNG menguji mesin pengering
solar bersama dengan pengumpul solar kubah.
Hasil keputusan membuktikan bahawa hasil
proses pengeringan lebih cepat berbanding
dengan ujian sebelumnya. Ahli komuniti biasanya
meninggalkan produk di ruang pengeringan
untuk tempoh 8 hingga 24 jam, bergantung
kepada ketebalan potongan produk; potongan
yang lebih nipis cenderung dikeringkan dengan
lebih cepat. Tambahan pula, pengumpul solar
kubah juga digunakan sebagai pengering untuk
produk yang mengandungi air yang lebih tinggi
and produk yang berdaun seperti daun pandan
dan daun kelor.

Prosedur Operasi dan Penyelenggaraan
SMART Solar Dryer

Pengeringan merupakan satu proses untuk mengurangkan kandungan air dalam produk. Tahap pengurangan
kandungan air bergantung kepada produk yang dikeringkan dan masa pengeringan. Pengujian dan
pengoptimuman perlu dilakukan untuk menentukan tempoh pengeringan yang diperlukan untuk setiap produk.

Pengendalian dan penyelenggaraan SMART solar dryer yang betul adalah penting untuk memastikan mesin
berada dalam keadaan baik dan menepati piawaian untuk proses pengeringan.

SMART solar dryer boleh dikendalikan pada bila-bila masa sepanjang hari, tetapi sila ambil perhatian bahawa
ia beroperasi dengan paling cekap ketika keadaan panas dan cerah. Adalah disyorkan bahawa
sekurang-kurangnya 1 orang sentiasa sedia memeriksa produk yang dikeringkan pada selang masa yang tetap,
kerana pengeringan mungkin lebih cepat atau lebih perlahan bergantung pada suhu persekitaran dan cahaya
matahari.

Sebelum proses pengeringan:

Letakkan pengering suria di atas permukaan yang rata untuk mengelakkan gelongsor, dan bebas
daripada objek tinggi di sekeliling yang boleh menyebabkan bayang-bayang melindungi solar
dryer.

Perhatikan kulat, terutamanya di dalam ruang pengeringan, dan lap dulang dengan kain bersih
untuk tujuan kebersihan.

Adalah disyorkan bahawa buah-buahan, sayur-sayuran dan produk lain dihiris sebelum
dikeringkan. Ini adalah untuk meningkatkan kawasan pendedahan dan mempercepatkan proses
pengeringan.

Terdapat empat (4) dulang yang disediakan untuk meletakkan produk untuk pengeringan.
Keluarkan setiap dulang dan ratakan produk di seluruh kawasan setiap dulang. (75cm X 100cm). Ini
adalah untuk membolehkan udara kering mengalir di sekitar kawasan terdedah produk,
meningkatkan kecekapan proses pengeringan.

Panaskan solar dryer dengan membiarkannya terdedah kepada matahari selama 10-30 minit untuk
mencapai suhu optimum dalam ruang pengeringan. Hidupkan kipas aliran silang dan biarkan pintu
terbuka dalam tempoh ini untuk mengeluarkan sebarang kelembapan dalam solar dryer.

Terdapat had yang ditetapkan untuk penggunaan pemanas (kelembapan relatif=45% atau suhu =
60 Celsius). Sebab utama pemanas tidak boleh berfungsi melebihi 2 jam adalah untuk mencegah
kecairan paip PVC pada suhu yang terlalu tinggi. Cara lain untuk menangani masalah ini adalah
dengan menggantikan paip PVC dengan paip besi atau sistem pengedaran udara dalam
pengumpul solar.

Jika mengendalikan pengering pada masa cahaya matahari tidak optimum (cth., waktu petang,
semasa hujan, dsb.), hidupkan pemanas (memerlukan sumber kuasa) dan tetapkan suhu yang
diingini. Jangan hidupkan pemanas lebih daripada 2 jam. Biarkan pemanas sejuk selama
10-30minit sebelum proses pemanasan dimulakan semula.

Jika produk belum kering sepenuhnya, panjangkan masa pengeringan. Masukkan dulang dengan
sampel, tutup pintu sepenuhnya dan gunakan kunci untuk mengunci pintu. Setiap satu atau dua
jam, buka pintu selama seminit untuk melepaskan udara lembap dan memeriksa produk.

Langkah Keselamatan SMART Solar Dryer

SMART solar dryer mengandungi peranti elektronik serta peralatan elektronik seperti kipas aliran silang dan
peniup pemanas. Langkah berjaga-jaga yang berikutnya adalah penting untuk keselamatan operator dan
solar dryer.

1)

Pemanas
Pemanas adalah mekanisme pemanasan tambahan untuk membantu pengumpul solar. Apabila suhu
persekitaran tidak cukup tinggi untuk pengumpul solar beroperasi bersendirian, atau jika beroperasi
dalam keadaan cahaya matahari yang rendah, pemanas boleh menyokong atau menggantikan
pemanasan solar. Pemanas SMART solar dryer dikawal oleh sensor kelembapan dan suhu berasaskan
Arduino yang terletak di dalam ruang pengeringan. Jika kelembapan di dalam pengering meningkat
melebihi 70% Kelembapan Relatif, pemanas akan dihidupkan secara automatik sehingga ia berkurangan
di bawah 55% Kelembapan Relatif. Walau bagaimanapun:

a. JANGAN hidupkan pemanas lebih daripada 2 jam. Biarkan pemanas sejuk selama 10-30minit

sebelum pemanasan dimulakan semula.

b. Sentiasa periksa solar dryer dan melepaskan udara lembap pada selang waktu 1-2 jam.
c. Lakukan pemeriksaan visual keadaan pemanas dan sensor sebelum mengendalikan SMART solar dryer.

2)

Kotak pengawal
Komponen elektronik disimpan di dalam bekas yang kedap udara dan kalis air. Walaubagaimanapun,
sejumlah kecil pemeluwapan boleh terkumpul pada pintu plastik jernih. Jika ada, lap wap dengan kain
bersih sebelum dan ketika operasi.

3)

Peniup kipas aliran silang
Berhati-hati untuk tidak meletakkan jari anda pada kipas yang bergerak ini kerana ia akan berfungsi hampir
24 jam sehari, selagi proses pengeringan sedang berjalan.

4)

Dulang
Dulang boleh menjadi sangat panas selepas proses pengeringan. Gunakan kain atau sarung tangan
semasa mengendalikan dulang. Buka pintu dan sejukkan dulang sebelum mengeluarkannya.

5)

Operasi
Tolong jangan biarkan produk tanpa pengawasan untuk jangka masa yang Panjang. Memeriksa produk
yang dikeringkan adalah sama pentingnya dengan menjaga solar dryer. Periksa secara berkala pada
selang waktu 1-2 jam untuk mengelakkan produk menjadi terlalu kering atau terbakar.

Jika SMART solar dryer tidak digunakan, matikan semua peralatan elektronik dan elektrik dan matikan
bekalan kuasa suis utama. Sentiasa tutup pintu untuk mengelakkan serangga perosak masuk ke dalam
ruang pengeringan.
