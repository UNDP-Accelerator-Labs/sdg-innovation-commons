> Brief description of the innovation

By creating a smart platform where resource-constrained farmers, as well micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs) can easily access business support, we unlock higher value market for MSMEs growth through leveraging collectivized resources to ensure favorable regulations and cost-effective production, marketing, and supply chain channels under a more regenerative and circular system for wholesome socioeconomic growth.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

ZEST will aim to provide the following services to its members, as part of their membership fees:
▪ Facilitation of training sessions, and knowledge transfer.
▪ Provision of local business advisory service (eg council requirements, local laws etc)
▪ Advocacy services to improve legislative support for small and medium sized entrepreneurs.
▪ Help with accreditation, certification and advice, specifically regarding food safety standards.
▪ Provision of a minimal package of marketing (such as sharing of member pages onto ZEST pages, and appearance of the member on the ZEST website).  
ZEST plans to provide the following services, on an income-generating basis:
▪ Supply of Biodegradable Packaging.
▪ Supply of Stickers and branding materials.
▪ Provision of marketing services (eg website creation, social media marketing, social media management, material creation).
▪ Arrangement of Mkushi Meanders Tours.  

The challenge prize will really help ZEST to takes its next few steps and establish itself as a provider of vital services, especially for emergent farmers and entrepreneurs, which are the main target market. 

ZEST’s entire focus is on environmental protection and regeneration and it is all about building a brand which reflects this.

> Technical Feasibility

perating in the informal sector, MSMEs are very under-resourced, and their market potential is restricted due to key challenges faced, such as lack of knowledge to navigate complicated regulatory requirements, lack of marketing and branding capacity, lack of access to financial services, restrictive distribution channels, inconsistent product quality, and lack of adequate access to finance. These challenges keep MSMEs stagnated in Mkushi.
Moreover, with the dominance of agriculture in the Mkushi economy, in the pursuit agricultural development and sustainability, agriculture knowledge and technology transfer through agritourism is seen as being imperative for updated practices, in the quest for stronger value creation. Agri-tourism, although prevalent in the southern region of Africa, is a dormant sector in Zambia, and likewise Mkushi. 

Concluding, in offering innovative market solutions to the agriculture value chain, ZEST Society has a high positive socio-economic impact potential, and will have the effect of increasing the productivity and income of MSMEs and farmers in the Mkushi District and Zambia. Noteworthy, the relatively high -valued agriculture industry in Mkushi and Zambia provides great scale-up opportunities to ZEST Society’s business solution, thus making ZEST a high-value and high-impact organization, which is needed in order to catalyze needed transformation, for a thriving MSMEs and a climate-friendly regenerative agriculture value-chain in Mkushi, Zambia, and regionally.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Since it started with its prototype, a study has shown that existing ZEST members have experienced a 20-30% increase in their income levels (50% of them), as well as a 1-2% increase in income levels (25% of them). With extra funding, this community effect can be rapidly expanded. This innovation is highly relevant to the current market which seeks #local and #regenerative products.
