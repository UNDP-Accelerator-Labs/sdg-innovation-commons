> Title of the innovation

Irrigation small scale agriculture as a means of transforming economies at household level to give room for national economic growth.

> Brief description of the innovation

As the thriving industry, food production at small scale levels is easy to achieve with minimal resources. However, the economical reward are huge if the right approaches are taken. The use of drip irrigation methods brings about meaningful benefit on small pieces of land while accurately utilizing the limited waters available. Water is the most important resource in sustainable agriculture altough its becoming a scarce commodity in various subsaharan regions due to the impact of climate change. Drip irrigation comes in handy as it limits wastage of water and allows for intensive crop growing.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The ideal with such agricultural projects is to produce fresh greens and fruits for existing local markets which are not sufficiently supplied with such commodities. The stimulus to starting up such a project lies in the ever growing demand for food influenced by rapidly growing populations. Seeing that food is the only commodity whose local demand is exceptionally high time and again, and the lopsided production due to reliance on rainfall which is heavily limited due to climate change the irrigation projects come handy at micro level.
 These projects are easy to set up on small pieces of land but do have high retains on investment. Such project provide a good platform for providing employment to the local youths and serve as cycles of skills transfer for local farmers. 
Combining vegetable agricuture with poultry  and piggery will help our project interface in a manner that we will be able to produce feed required for the animals which will in turn provide our garden with organic manure for proper gardening and thereby reduce the cost of doing either business.

> Technical Feasibility

The design of the project is in such way that we have boreholes as a source of water which is connected to a well planned drip irrigation system for water economy purposes. This allows us to minimize on wastage of water. Our planting systems are that we have quick cash plant such as vegetables on a half acre piece of land, while we grow fresh corn and tomatoes of a segmented three acre piece of lan as our main crops under the irrigation scheme. These crops generate reasonable income over longer periods of time. However, such crops are planted in a manner that their is continuity in cycles of growth.
In the second phase, the project aims at introducing a poultry to accommodate a reasonable number of layer birds (3000) for the production of eggs.
In the third phase, the project will look to introduce a piggery to house to a minimum 100 pigs for pork products processing which will be send onto the market. 
The idea is to add value to every product from the project outputs and sustain production all year round.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation is already providing employment to youth and it will employ more as it grows in phases. The surrrounding communities are supplied with nutrition at affordable costs as well as giving them market to supply organic mannure including cow dung. This is able to give the community member a meaningful income as our project are strategically located to be in close reach for the local communities. 
The project will also serve as a skills transfer workshop for your and look to even capacity build ypuths by sending them for further skills training in suitable skills centers.
