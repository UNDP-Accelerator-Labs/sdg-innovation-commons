Call Umida - Safe spaces for protecting women and children from street harassment, chasing, and stalking
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that women face gender-based harassment in the streets and usually don’t have easy access to safe spaces to protect themselves or know how to act in these cases. At the same time, people do not have an adequate level of awareness of the gender-based violence/harassment issues in the streets and how they can help the victims.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

What is the history of your challenge?

GBV as an issue was tabooed issue for many years in Uzbekistan. Situation started changing with the new president coming to power and growing impact and spread of social media. In 2019, two important laws on GBV were adopted. Intimate partner violence was an overwhelmingly discussed topic, while other forms of GBV remain less addressed and among them street harassment. There is no legislation defining any forms of street harassment and thus no offense is considered.

 What is causing or driving it?

Street harassment is mainly caused and driven by pervasive gender stereotypes, impunity and systemic problems in the society.

Who is involved?  How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

It mainly affects young women. It hampers women’s mobility and in turn impacts women’s right to education, employment and leisure, as well as other rights which realization is dependent on mobility. Gender based street harassment is almost normalized in Uzbek society, if complained victims are usually blamed themselves.

 Street harassment is impacting young women’s mobility and thus rights. It is both a barrier for women to pursue higher education and employment and is used as an argument to restrict women’s right to mobility. There is extensive research globally that more than 90% of street harassment and abuse is unreported due to stigma and absence of criminal offenses for such behaviour. Growing conservative agenda in different parts of the world, as well as in Uzbekistan is worsening the situation with women’s mobility. Thus needs to be addressed with shifting the blame paradigm from women to abusers, diminishing the arguments of conservatives that women to be protected need to stay home. Awareness raising around street harassment is one of the key issues as this addresses stigma around it and can lead to legislative measures to be adopted.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

UNDP is well positioned in the country with a reputation as a leading actor in promoting gender mainstreaming with the necessary expertise. Most importantly, UNDP is seen as a neutral actor capable of bringing together government, private sector, and NGOs. UNDP also plays as an ice-breaker - first-mover. We announce and tell about the problem first, thus opening the way for the private sector and NGOs to clear them off any political statements and consequences.

UNDP plans to launch an alliance with the private sector and non-governmental organizations to launch an informal mechanism for protecting women and children from harassment, chasing, and stalking. The idea is to partner with the private sector (large retail chains and pharmacies, in the beginning, potentially expanding to other retail outlets – restaurants, and coffee shops) To create a network of safe places within the premises of the partner organization to get into safety, call the police or other emergency numbers, get essential information, as to link up with NGOs which can provide further support. 

Women and children who face harassment, chasing, and stalking will be empowered with the necessary information and can make informed decisions in the cases of street harassment.   




> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Streets must be safe, for all. We say no to gender-based harassment in the streets and launch #CallUmida - an alliance to make the streets safer for girls and women. In case of harassment, approach one of the partner locations to be provided with support and safety.
