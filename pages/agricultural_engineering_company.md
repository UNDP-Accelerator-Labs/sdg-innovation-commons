Agricultural engineering company

> Brief description of the innovation

I assemble agricultural implements from spares to a running machine .and rebuilds the old used tractors

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Once I have enough resources I want to employ youths who are willing to work with and help out farmers by repearing and servicing of Agri implements and generate the resources through the workshop

> Technical Feasibility

Based on the already belt parts . I have no rights to the parts

> Anticipated Social Impact

Skills will be passed on to the next generation even the time these people will be learning salaries will be given to them and I wish to make my workshop s training centre for the less privileged kids
