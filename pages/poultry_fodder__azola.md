Azolla cultivation, the green fern plant or the so-called "Azola", is spreading in different parts of Syria replacing imported livestock feed and other national fodder that are becoming more expensive. The plantis  is a good source of protein with almost all essential amino acid required for animal nutrition (notably lysine). Furthermore, it also provides macronutrients like calcium, magnesium, potassium and vitamins like vitamin A (precursor beta-carotene) and B12. Azolla is planted in manmade special ponds and is picked up after it reproduces (Azolla is a highly productive plant. It doubles its biomass in 3-10 days, depending on conditions, and yield can reach 8-10 t fresh matter/ha in Asian rice fields.)
