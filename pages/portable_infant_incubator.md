Union/village level health centers in Bangladesh don't have enough doctors, nurses and necessary equipment to provide emergency assistance to infants, so they often refer newborns in critical conditions to hospitals in nearby districts/divisions for incubation. Often there is a 6-12 hour wait time which can be fatal for the infact who needs urgent care. This portable incubation devise provides emergency assistance during that crucial transfer time.
