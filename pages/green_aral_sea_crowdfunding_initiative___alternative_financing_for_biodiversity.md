The drying up of the Aral Sea is one of the worst environmental catastrophes of the 20th century. The Green Aral Sea is an initiative by AccLab Uzbekistan which aims to mobilize the global community in supporting afforestation activities on the dry seabed of the Aral Sea through experimentation of Alternative Financing for Biodiversity. Covering desert areas that were once the Aral Sea with vegetation will prevent the spread of toxic sands, support the well-being of people living in the region, and increase biodiversity.
