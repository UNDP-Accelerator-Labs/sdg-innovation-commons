Tohe is a social enterprise established in 2006 with the mission of creating a creative playground for disadvantaged children. Through weekly playgrounds, Tohe gives children the opportunity to learn and experience creative and artistic activities on a variety of media. Their paintings are selected, redesigned and applied to decorate fashion and lifestyle products.

5% of product sales are returned directly to the child artists who authored the paintings used.

Tohe was established in 2006 by 3 founders: Nguyen Dinh Nguyen, Pham Thi Ngan, and Nguyen Thi Thanh Tu. 

The story of Tohe began in 2005 when a group of friends Nguyen, Ngan, and Tu began to visit the Center for Nurturing the Elderly and Disabled Children Thuy An, Ba Vi as volunteers. They organized art and painting activities for the children at the weekend; thereby understanding more about the difficult and needy life as well as the innocent spirit, love of life and simple wishes of the children. 

May 2006: The founding group came up with the idea of ​​​​founding "Tòhe" after visiting the Picasso museum in Barcelona and reading the famous quote of the artist: "It took me 4 years to be able to draw like Raphael , but had to spend a lifetime drawing like a child". Inspired by Vietnamese folk toys, we want Tohe to become a creative playground where children benefit from their own play.
