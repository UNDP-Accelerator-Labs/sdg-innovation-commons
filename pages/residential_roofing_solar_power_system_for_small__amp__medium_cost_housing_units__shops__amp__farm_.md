> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation comprises of four(4) constituencies.
1. Roofing Solar panel or Photovoltaic Panel
2. Charging Controller or Regulator
3. Battery Bank
4. Inverter
AC utility supply
Cables of 6-10 sq mm connect all components, from roof solar panel to charge controller, battery bank and finally to inverter. Roofing orientation should face south for maximum harvesting of the sun’s energy. Sun light is converted into electrical energy as the sun rays heat surface of the roof solar panel (Photovoltaic panel) causes electrons to be exited and to flow as an electric current through charger controller regulates the charging of the batteries, if batteries are fully charged, then the regulator stops the charging and the batteries are left on float to be used when the utility power supply is interrupted. The current and voltage generated from the photovoltaic panel is DC,therefore its minimal in ranges of 12 - 50 Volts and 2 Amperes or less, the output of the Photovoltaic panel is fed to inverter which converts the DC quantities into AC quantities at higher voltages and currents ready to be used by electrical appliances, equipment and lighting. This system is an ‘’On-grid system’’ in the sense that it is connected to the utility grid system.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If this innovation is implemented on a large scale, it can generate income in terms of installation, maintenance and training of installers. This system will also help in reducing electricity bills as dependency on the utility supply will minimize, this willbe to the advantage and relief to the utility company (ZESCO), this system can further be designed in a way that surplus energy generated from a residential solar power system can be fed back into the utility grid, in some countries there are financial incentives given for feeding back power into the grid. The target market/potential off-takers for this kind of innovation are farmers in farming blocks, owners of small/ medium cost housing unitsand shop owners. This system will help in reducing electricity bills and maximizing profits and savings. It also provides insurance against rising power prices as the population and the industry grows. This is a true renewable source; the system operates quietly,with no moving parts and emit zero pollution. Long service life and reliability in operation. This innovation can even be developed into a mini solar power farm on 0.5-6 acre land and power can be generated and distributed to near-by homes on a commercial basis.

> Technical Feasibility

Roof of the house is made of solar shingles or tiles of Photovoltaic panels, types of solar panels will be mono-crystalline, polycrystalline or thin film, size of the roof will be 4 by 4metres, Sun light is converted into electrical energy as sun rays heat surface of the roof solar panel (Photovoltaic panel) causes electrons to be exited and to flow as an electric current to charge the batteries, the battery bank consist at-least 3 batteries each rated at 12V,100Ah capacity, in total there is 300Ah and the batteries are connected in parallel, according laws of electricity batteries connected in parallel will maintain the same voltage 12V and currents will add up. the output of the battery is fed to inverter which converts the DC quantities into AC quantities at higher voltages (230V) and currents 10-20A depending on the rated power of the inverter ready to be used by electrical appliances, equipment and lighting. This system is an ‘’On-grid system’’ in that it is connected to the utility grid system.it can also be Off-grid when it is not connected to utility grid in any way. The popular tesla roof is made in this way as shown in the pictures above.

> Anticipated Social Impact

With the growth of the mining and manufacturing industry, not forgetting the ever increasing human population and new emerging technologies which need electrical energy like Electric hybrid vehicles (EHVs) and mobile phones for battery charging, the demand for electric power will keep on increasing, therefore the installed capacities of the grid supply will not be able to sustain the ever-growing demand, therefore other sources of electrical energy have to be implemented; therefore renewable energy is the way to go. This innovation will help in improving the lives of others to have affordable electricity especially in the rural areas of our country. This will enable Electrical appliances and equipment e.g. TV, refridgerator, water pump to be utilized even in villages, farms and the remotest part of zambia which are not yet connected to the national electricity grid. However this innovation will also be useful even to those areas which are connected to the national grid in that in the absence of power from the utility, during the day time solar power can be used for emergency purposes whereas during the night storage batteries can be used as a source of power.
This innovation will also help in accessing information and communication through the use of computers, radios and TVs for farmers in preparation of the farming seasons, home and shop owners to abreast with information.This innovation can also be used for Irrigation purpose by the use of water pumps.
