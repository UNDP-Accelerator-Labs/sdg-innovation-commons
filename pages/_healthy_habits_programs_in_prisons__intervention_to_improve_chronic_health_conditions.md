> Description

The idea is to create a General Health Program to promote healthy habits and the control of diseases such as hypertension and diabetes in the Coronel Oviedo Penitentiary. Within this program, the axes would be exercise, healthy eating and mental health. Within the exercise axis, treadmills, bicycles and other safe elements would be acquired to carry out a crossfit program in the Penitentiary together with a trainer. Within the area of ​​healthy eating, training will be carried out with nutritionists since food is prepared within the penitentiary, and drinking fountains will be purchased to promote water intake. A base measurement will be carried out before and after the implementation of the Program together with the support of the Regional Institute of Health Research of the National University of Caaguazú. It will also be measured whether this exercise and healthy eating program has positive implications for mental health.
