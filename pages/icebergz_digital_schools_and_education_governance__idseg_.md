> Title of the innovation

Icebergz Digital Schools and Education Governance (IDSEG)

> Brief description of the innovation

Icebergz Digital Schools and Education Governance IDSEG is a digital education software developed to assist and improve the education system in the country more especially when there are disturbances to the learning process like now when we have the covid-19 pandemic, it is developed to help everyone involved in the education process starting from the pupils, guardians, school staff, and the education offices both and district and regional level
It is a combination of webs that are 
A school web meant for the development of school academic statuses it has a section that has video lessons that will shot by teachers of the school for the pupils to continue learning even when they are out of campus, it has also another section that is an online library which will provide study material (textbooks, pamphlets and pastpapers both from ecz and all the exams set by the school) another section meant for news and announcements is provided to alert the learners and the public about anything that the school wants to address
This innovation also provides a section that will enable the learners and their guardians to be able to get the results without going to the school this is similar to the ecz portal though it's easy to use, and when entering the results it's easy because each subject teacher will be able to enter the results at the own place of choice using their own devices, it also keeps the records for results and attendance
Another feature is another web linked to all the school webs which belongs to the district and regional education offices that enables them to directly interact and monitor the schools without them going there

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will generate income for me and other web hosting companies as the schools will have to buy this and subscribe for them to be offered the service the company that provides hosting services will gain as they will be paid for the service,
The target market are the schools countywide via their district and regional offices each school will have to purchase the innovation but their offices will receive free ones as bonuses

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation is a combination of some websites and a software that are programmed to perform the commanded service I have a prototype that I developed but I couldn't show it here because I just saw this call a day before deadline and Im far from home I already developed the software and it will be implemented just the way it is each school will have their own web and a software plus the offices will also have their webs that are linked to each and every school web

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve the lives of every pupil, every teacher, education office, guardian and the country at large
For the pupils it will help them not be disturbed with their lessons even when their are circumstances that will need them to stay away from campus, it shall also help the slow learners that find it difficulty to understand on the first teaching since the videos will always be there so they can go through them over and over again, therefore improving the academic status of learners, it shall even enable the learners to be up to date with information in their academic clubs, it benefits the learners also by providing them with study material at no cost this also save the cost of schools losing hardcopy books that are normally given to pupils
The innovation will help the school to cut off the cost of printing report cards as the learners and their guardians will access the results via the web, it will also provide advertisment for school 
This innovation will also help the school to keep records of results, pupils attendance and staff 
It shall make it easy for preparing of results as it won't require everyone teacher to use the same device to enter the results but at the homes in using their devices and as they enter subject results report cards are automatically made
This innovation will also save the cost of the debs offices by as they will be able to interact and monitor the schools in their district without going their (exam standards monitoring, results monitoring, passing of announcements directly etc)
This innovation will also help almost everyone to be digital literate and also lead to the country's economic development as we know that technology is a key to economic development and also help meet the country's SDGS of having a smart Zambia by 2030
