> Title of the innovation

Village chickens value chain

> Brief description of the innovation

The village chicken ecosystem stems from egg production to incubation, then brooding until fully grown village chickens. We supply fertilized eggs, day old chicks and fully grown village chickens. Our breeds range from sassol, kroiler, black astralops, rowan ranger, opinington and sussex.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The demand for village is slowly increasing especially that most people have realised the health benefits. Therefore, we have demand for fertilized eggz which are sold at K5 per egg. Day old chicks for K15 per chick while currently, fully grown chickens are sold at K150 per bird. The business has been able to supply to numerous off takers including the Program against malnutrition_mumbwa. On a monthly basis, the business generates over K5000 net profit. The prize will help to fully mechanise in terms of acquisition of bigger capacity incubators, hatchers and brooders.

> Technical Feasibility

The business is already underway and is operating with a 528 incubator/hatcher plus a 200 capacity brooder.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The business upholds food security.
