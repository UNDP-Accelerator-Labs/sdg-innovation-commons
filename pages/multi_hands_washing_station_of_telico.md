Designed by the students of the TELICO institute in Mamou, this innovation cannot go unnoticed insofar as it is imposing by its architecture. Composed of a bucket of water (water tank mixed with disinfectant), a long iron bar, the lower walls of which are littered with small holes that are almost invisible if you do not pay attention to them; and a long half-channel allowing the flow of waste water.
