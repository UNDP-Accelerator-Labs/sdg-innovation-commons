> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

The solution is a Savonius-type turbine built from waste material, through which electrical energy is obtained thanks to the principle of energy conservation.

The Savonius Wind Turbine works thanks to the kinetic energy of the wind, which causes the movement of the turbine supported by the rotation shaft, transforming it into mechanical energy. This shaft transmits the movement to the pulley by means of a V-belt, which is connected to a pulley of smaller section to the rotation shaft of the alternator. At this point the mechanical energy is transformed into electrical energy (12 volts DC), where it is stored in batteries, to be subsequently converted into 220v AC with the help of an inverter, which must be connected to the network to be supplied.

-Construction of a motor generator with permanent magnets to avoid the excitation of the same and also to have several fields to obtain energy at lower RPM, since when the rotor circulates through fewer fields (as in any alternator) it needs a lot of speed to generate (approximately 1100 revolutions per minute) in addition to offering too much resistance due to electromagnetic induction. All this improves with a high field motor, as in conventional wind turbines, where the generation is at low RPM.
-Ideal bearings: In this case, as the barrel is placed vertically, the efforts are mostly axial and therefore a type of cylindrical roller thrust bearing (89308) or conical (30208) is necessary where the latter supports both types of efforts (both axial and radial).
-It is necessary to change the type of pulleys and belts for "poly v" or toothed ones, to reduce the loss of efficiency due to friction.
-Displace the drums from the centre, to obtain greater torque on the shaft, and at the same time make one more floor of drums placed above in order to achieve a greater surface area and thus capture a greater volume of wind.
Use deep-cycle batteries (gelled lithium) to store energy (the greater the quantity and size, the greater the storage capacity).
