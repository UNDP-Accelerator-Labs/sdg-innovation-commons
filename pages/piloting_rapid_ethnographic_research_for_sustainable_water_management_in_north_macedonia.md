## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Lazar Pop Ivanov

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

01 November 2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Intersection of three portfolios: Environment, Inclusive Prosperity and Democratic Governance

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Good governance, with a specific focus on the governance of water in communities in North Macedonia

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Can we engage and include citizens in core national development processes?


> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Academia

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

We conducted this activity jointly with a researcher from the Institute of Anthropology and Ethnology at the State University 'Ss. Cyril and Methodius
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We wanted to learn if there are any community practices for sustainable water management, that could provide us with actionable intelligence to improve the water governance in the country.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we deploy rapid ethnographic research on community-based water management practices, we will receive new actionable intelligence that will help us understand water stress in the country, while at the same time help us understand best community practices.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Rapid Ethnographic research

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

One urban and several rural communities adjacent to the city in question.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

As a qualitative research method, rapid ethnography approaches include spending time in a certain community, engaging with inhabitants and conducting formal or semi-formal interviews with a number of individuals in order to gain deeper understanding of community micronarratives. Central to this research method is the emic or ‘insider perspective’, a deeper insight through rich description into how community members themselves perceive their surroundings and lived reality (Sangaramoorthy and Kroeger, 2020). Rich description allows us to understand a community’s everyday reality in the context of wider economic or historical developments, providing insight into the types of micronarratives present in a community, from which researchers can abstract how community members personally relate to existing and potential practices. Through existing micronarratives, we understand how community members perceive the environment and their role within it,  informing bottom-up development policy approaches by identifying individual’s most urgent challenges in their everyday realities, existing solutions as well as potential impact of a certain intervention. Field stays in the Struga region entailed visiting a particular community and spending two to three days observing ‘public life’, engaging with inhabitants spontaneously in general conservations, as well as conducting one-on-one interviews. Spontaneous conservations, which in some cases took the form of informal interviews, provided certain patterns of important issues or elements of significance for the population. These starting points were utilized to create a focused questionnaire for interviews with key informants - inhabitants who held a local expert role, a public office (such as the local community), or individuals recommended by inhabitants. Our research focus was primarily oriented toward water for consumption, encompassing water catchment, distribution and management processes. Besides being foreshadowed by media reporting in the region, the issue presented itself naturally as a key point in conversations with inhabitants of the region. The effects of water insufficiency in the communities were varied, yet the issue was common to all in one way or another. In particular, water deficits are a frustrating topic for a region surrounded by water.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

We conducted the rapid ethnographic research in the months of July and August, in the city of Struga, and some of the surrounding villages in the Drimkol region and the Struga valley, including: Vevchani, Vishni, Frangovo, Lozhani and Draslajca.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

10% of the time of the Lab members for the period of two months.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The original hypothesis was proven. We learned a lot about how communities deal with water stress, and the institutions they have developed to deal with water governance and management. One insight that was not the primary goal of the research, were the perceptions and the differences of perceptions among communities in rural/urban areas, on the governance of water resources, and their ownership.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Community mapping of solutions for sustainable water management, is something that might be very useful and complementary to this process.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Four months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Circa 1000USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

In the upcoming period, we would like to take this initiative to tackle the intersections between water stress and food/agriculture & energy, but also to incorporate new collective intelligence tools to help learn more about the topic, but also to engage citizens in the process.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

In the upcoming period, we would like to take this initiative to tackle the intersections between water stress and food/agriculture & energy, but also to incorporate new collective intelligence tools to help learn more about the topic, but also to engage citizens in the process.
