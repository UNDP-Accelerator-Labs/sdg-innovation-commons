Integrated IoT systems, mobile application development, artificial intelligence (AI), as well as robotics and automation have made great improvements to the plantation experience and will make agriculture a highly appealing career option for many bright and talented Malaysians.  In this project, digital tools are used by smart farmers to continuously monitor a wide range of metrics, including water levels, the amount of nutrients that crops need to optimally grow, soil samples, fertiliser inputs. The solution has enabled the creation of conducive operational conditions through the application of IoT which will provide resource and time savings, heighten convenience, and minimise human intervention. The solution will benefit all segments of the society, where it can provide a platform for income generation and as a useful tool to empower targeted groups such as the youth, B40, and undeserved communities.
