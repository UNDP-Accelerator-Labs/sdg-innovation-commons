## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Tackling flooding in Kampala city especially the high-density neighborhoods/slum areas 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that for the past couple of years, Uganda has faced heavy rainfall during the rainy season and sometimes during what is conventionally the dry season. As a result of this, there is heavy flooding in Kampala city especially the high-density neighborhoods/slum areas leading to loss of property, diseases and even death.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Over the years, Uganda like the rest of the World has been experiencing erratic alternate drought and high rainfall seasons, which is a manifestation of Climate Change. Climate Change manifests in many ways including extreme heat conditions (heat waves), above normal rainfall which causes floods, melting glaciers, raising water levels.  

Whenever it is a rainy season and there's a heavy down pour, Kampala City floods and destroys property, infrastructure like roads become impassable. The mostly affected areas are the high-density neighbourhoods and slums.

In the recent reports for both the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) and Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) indicate that the black spots for floods in the entire Kampala metropolitan suburbs are Kyambogo on Jinja Road, Electoral Commission, Clock Tower, Makerere Kavule, Bwaise, Nalukolongo, Ndeeba, Katwe and Namasuba.

They attribute floods in Kampala to both natural and man-made causes. The natural causes include heavy rains, low-lying and flat terrain and underlying clayey soil of poor water infiltration. While the man-made causes include encroachers' developments such as buildings and cultivation in the drainage or wetland areas. Other man-made causes of floods have been identified as undersized and blocked drainage channels because of poor waste management.

Floods have had an impact on several areas of Kampala. There has occurred damage to property and Infrastructure such as buildings, roads, and others. Also, contamination of drinking water from springs, wells and leaking pipes has occured resulting into disease outbreaks such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid and diarrhea, mainly in the densely populated and poorly planned settlements.

Stagnant water pools near Bwaise and Kalerwe areas have developed into breeding grounds for mosquitoes which spread malaria. On some flood events, some people have lost their lives by drowning in the stagnant water pools, in situations where buildings and roads have flooded, business and traffic have been overwhelmingly disrupted. Engineers and environmentalists need to check the quality of designs, construction, and environmental aspects of the drainage channels.

Kampala is surrounded by channels such as Nakivubo, Lubigi, Nalukolongo, Kinawataka, Nyanama-Walufumbe and Kansanga. The functionality of this drainage system is limited because of its poor condition and lack of adequate maintenance.

In conclusion, Kampala flood problem needs to be tackled as soon as possible and this gives the Accelerator Lab the opportunity to present it as a frontier challenge focusing this initial phase of the intervention on one of the mentioned prone areas which is Makerere Kavule.

In the recent forecast from the Uganda National Meteorological Authority (UNMA), indicate that in the months of March, April and May, the Central Region and the Lake. Victoria basin will receive near normal (near average) to above normal (enhanced) rainfall. as per the attached communique.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

The weak signals that we have identified recently is that even after the warning from the weather forecasters on the heavy rainfall, the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) says that their budget to provide maintenance to communities was cut and therefore, there is not much to do. Already, the media reports the loss of lives in the floods and property in the recent down pour.

The floods also damage critical bridges and road links. Unpaved roads are often impassable. This has an extensive impact on the economy through effects on business and educational activities. Many areas close to water bodies have become untenable, forcing large-scale movements of settlements and businesses. In a report on Possible futures for urban East Africa under a changing climate, it was reported that the total amount of rainfall in the Long Rains has increased by around 25% and the Short Rains are about 20% wetter on average. The frequency, extent and depth of floods has increased in urban East Africa. Flash flooding is now more common and severe and can result in catastrophic loss of life, particularly after long dry periods. Drainage systems in urban areas are periodically overwhelmed leading to increased malaria and water-borne infections and in the slum areas, the situation is worsened by the poor waste management practices and a high population density. Critical infrastructure is frequently badly damaged by the floods with subsequent interruptions to business and educational activities. The increased intensity of these floods has led to more turbid flood waters, and increased costs of water treatment and drainage maintenance.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

By enabling/empowering communities and leadership structures within in designing low-cost resilient drainage systems in Makerere Kavule, will help overcome the impact of floods on their livelihoods (loss of lives, property, and diseases)

CLIMATE PROBLEM

Our challenge is that for the past couple of years, Uganda has faced heavy rainfall during the rainy season and sometimes during what is conventionally the dry season. As a result of this, there is heavy flooding in Kampala city especially the high-density neighborhoods/slum areas leading to loss of property, diseases and even death.

PRIORITISED STAKEHOLDERS

1. Households in slum areas particularly Makerere Kavule

2. Local leadership structures within the slum areas

HOW COMMUNITIES ARE AFFECTED

1. Destruction of Houses, personal items, roads drainage system

2. Spread of diseases like cholera and malaria

3. Death

VALUE PROPOSITION

By enabling/empowering communities and leadership structures within in designing low-cost resilient drainage systems in Makerere Kavule, it will help overcome the impact of floods on their livelihoods (loss of lives, property, and diseases)

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We chose to use open data, mobile phone data and geospatial data to help us map the geographical area of the community to identify suitable locations for the construction of the the small drainage tributaries that connect to the main drainage channel. They will also help in the identification of appropriate sites for waste disposal as well as other solutions to this problem.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are working with our Nature, Climate and Energy Resilience (NCER) and we intend to develop another programme from the lessons learned from this cycle.
