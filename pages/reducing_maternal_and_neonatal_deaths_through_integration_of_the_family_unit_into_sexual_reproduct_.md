> Title of the innovation

REDUCING MATERNAL AND NEONATAL DEATHS THROUGH INTEGRATION OF THE FAMILY UNIT INTO SEXUAL REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, PREPARTUM INTRAPARTUM AND POSTPARTUM CARE.

> Brief description of the innovation

Description of the innovation
The family is the oldest institution, important and fundamental to humanity.  Integration of the family unit in health service delivery is an important element in preventing unwanted pregnancies and preventable maternal and neonatal deaths. This can be made possible by empowering every member of the family with adequate and accurate health information in relation to sexual, reproductive and maternal health so that informed decisions are made at appropriate times.
Once empowered with health information, the family members will be able to recognise the need for pregnant women and indeed women of child bearing age to access the health care and know when and where to access it.  Once this is implemented, 3 causes of the first delay (lack of recognition of an emergency, lack of access of information and gender inequality) would be adequately dealt with. 
When both males and females are given the same health information and demonstrate an understanding, decision making will be quickened as there will be no need to wait for only the man of the house to consent to health care choices.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As the saying goes 'prevention is better than cure', the cost of health care will reduce as only a handful of medical and surgical supplies would be used for clients who are brought to the facility in stable conditions. This can only be possible if the family members are able to recognize the emergency through health education provided at various religious groupings and schools for school going teenagers.

> Technical Feasibility

Innovation design
Analytical cross sectional qualitative study approach will be used. Focus group discussions will be the main communication channel between the families and the task force.

> Anticipated Social Impact

When this innovative comes to life, high risk pregnancies will reduce significantly as the very young and those with advanced maternal age will be able to prevent these pregnancies by accessing family planning on time or booking their pregnancies early so that they are adequately managed at a health facility.  
Maternal and neonatal mortalities and morbidities will also reduce as the first delay would have been  catered for.
Parents and guardians will no longer be unavailable to discuss sexual and reproductive health with their teenage children. This is because they would have had adequate health education from the religious groupings they belong too.
