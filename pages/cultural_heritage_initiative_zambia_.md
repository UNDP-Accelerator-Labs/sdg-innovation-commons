> Brief description of the innovation

A cultural heritage NGO  called "Cultural Heritage Initiative - Zambia" (CHI-ZA) is hereby initiated, established and registered with the Government of the Republic of Zambia in Lusaka, the national headquarters and central city of Zambia. CHI-ZA will focus on providing cultural heritage interventions aimed at safeguarding cultural heritage of 73 plus ethnic groups found in Zambia and provide educational efforts that inspire people to take cultural heritage not only as legacy but equally and  importantly as a resource which can generate so many social and economic benefits for the country in the present and in the future. The latter consideration being even important as the country makes inroads to participate in the newly introduced and promising continental initiative named African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). It is expected that through the providing of operations, services, information and support to native populations in Zambia or and any other African country, it will be possible to have a direct and positive effect on the development and cultural wellbeing of the people of Zambia and Africa.
