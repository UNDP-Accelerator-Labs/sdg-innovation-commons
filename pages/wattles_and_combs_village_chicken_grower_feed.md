> Brief description of the innovation

Formulation of village chicken grower feed that enables improved village chicken breeds grow within good time shorter than indigenous breeds. In this way allowing for households/small-scale farmers to realize an financial benefit within a shorter time period.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through the selling of feed. In the last one year demand for village chicken has increased due to the scarcity of broilers. Through selling of feed we enable farmers to supply what should be the cheapest animal protein to their farmers. We are simply creating an avenue for households with chickens and small scale farmers to grow their village chicken within a shorter time but still maintain good taste- allowing them to make a profit within 3 months as opposed to 1 year +. We also provide technical support for free. 
The material used in manufacturing of feed are by-products of food manufacturing processes therefore we are reducing evironmental waste.

> Technical Feasibility

Its a formulation of grains and trace elements. 
Its is commercially viable we piloted in August and have already sold more than 6 tons of product.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Chicken is the cheapest form of animal protein. Due to cartels in Zambia, the price of broiler has risen from K30 to K90 in one year. This has forced households to move to village chicken albeit the time needed to grow it. In 2020 alone 83 million broilers were sold on the Zambian market. Wattles estimates that it can impact 1 000 000 individuals through the expansion of this venture. This is primarily through 
1. Our agents for feed who we are hoping to increase throughout Zambia.  
2. Household/ small scale farmers who rear village chicken 
3. Marketeers who resell chickens from small-scale farmers to mass market of low income earners.
4.  Consumers who have access to cheaper meat protein (compared to price of broilers)
