## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Accelerating access to Market through an integrated approach for informal sector Agri-preneurs.  
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to use collective intelligence to understand why Informal crop and livestock producers ( male and female producers) in Mauritania face many challenges and barriers to becoming sustainable farm entrepreneurs. These include lack of access to markets, lack of timely and relevant advisory information, limited access to tailored finance and insurance products or social safety nets, few entrepreneurial decision support tools, and lack of access to commercial markets and options for selling.  Equally challenged are the value chain stakeholders who rely on inefficient and analog systems to reach farmers. Progress in agricultural modernization in Mauritania is threatened as climate change is increasing weather variability and farmers’ ability to predict, adapt and absorb risk. As recent events have shown with COVID-19, informal farmers are extremely vulnerable to compounding shocks. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The agricultural sector  plays a pivotal role in advancing economic growth in Mauritania. Informal Sector farming system is a key element. Growing populations and a changing climate exacerbate the challenge for Mauritania. Informal agriculture producers will require more efficient and diversified agricultural production and a transition from predominantly subsistence farming to small-scale producer (SSP) entrepreneurship to enable, access to market, improvements in quality, quantity and diversity of food production. Additionally, SSPs will need improved connectivity to inputs, finance and markets. Moreover, promoting agricultural entrepreneurs will guarantee a financial inclusion as well as independence of many Mauritanians and thus decrease the impact of poverty on these generation of entrepreneurs.

The informal agro-pastoral sector is a major employer in the country and accounts for 30% of the labour force. It provides income to approximately one (1) million inhabitants and plays a key role in food security and resilience. However, according to the latest ONS report on the poverty situation in Mauritania, households headed by persons working in the informal agriculture and livestock sectors are the poorest, with an incidence of 59.6% and 41.8%, respectively (2014). The UNDP country office in Mauritania is collecting survey data on SME’s in Mauritania which includes the Agricultural sector.

The informal agro-pastoral sector is strategic in Mauritania and contributed 23.4% to national GDP formation in 2017. Agriculture has considerable potential: nearly 500,000 ha of arable land, including about: (i) 365,000 ha for rain-fed crops; (ii) 135,000 ha for irrigated crops; (iii) 19,700 ha planted with palm trees; and (iv) 22,500 ha under dam-irrigated farming. There is also an undervalued irrigable potential along the Senegal River, with 46,100 ha of developed land. Livestock is another strategic sector. It contributed on average 20% of GDP over the 2014-2017 period, and accounted for 85% of rural value added and 78% of the national value added in the agricultural sector. Mauritania’s livestock population is significant and estimated at 21.05 million sheep and goats, 1.95 million cattle and 1.47 million camels (ONS, 2016). The informal agro-pastoral sector is the largest employer, despite the many obstacles that limit its development (access to market, finance, vocational training, new technologies, etc.). It has great potential that remains untapped in terms of mobilization (intensification, productivity improvement, preservation, etc.) and enhancement to promote agricultural sector value chains. The institutional development of agricultural research, advisory and service structures, the reorganisation of professional structures, the structuring of strategic sectors and the upgrading of value chains are all challenges to overcome.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab intends to facilitate the grouping of agricultural Small Scale Producers (SSP) products into a bigger production scale for market supply. This initiative is inspired by the Agricultural Grameen Bank, founded by the Nobel Prize winner Mohamed Yunis and a Banking platform in Mauritania – Bankily. This innovative approach has a potential to scale, integrate and bundle SSP products in to one big product for market. AccLab will use collective intelligence approach to address value chain challenges facing small scale crop and livestock producer entrepreneurs in agricultural input supply, finance, market access, and decision support tools. This challenge as designed, provides an opportunity to consolidate, extend and support transformation with a view to enhancing the linkages of informal SSP to market, and scaling up the pilot action. Therefore, it prepares a solid foundation for innovative and high value-added transformative agriculture that is consistent and fully compatible with the countries reform programmes aimed at diversifying the economy and advocating support for the agro-pastoral sector

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How do informal Agri-preneurs perceive themselves? What are the barriers to access the market for informal agri-preneurs? What institutionalization frameworks support Agri-preneurs in Mauritania? What are the available possible solution?  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

 Acclab will use sensemaking exercises to decompose the informal system to have a broader picture of the situation of Informal Agricultural workers in Mauritania. Acclab will use system thinking to explore better ways to integrating informal workers in to government schemes and training programs for business development.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is no individual level data on informal agre-preneurs in Mauritania.  
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

A local partner will be in-charge of the intervention to coordinate big buyers such as supermarkets, hotels etc. This gives the opportunity to SSP to consolidate their different small productions into one big sale. It is evident that when selling in small quantities, it is not as sustainable for big buyers as in one big quantity. SSP would have the opportunity to create a bigger market from their small farms and supply collectively to meet market demand. This will contribute to market data and demand dynamics, which would help to inform SSP which crops to grow, and which crops sell most.
