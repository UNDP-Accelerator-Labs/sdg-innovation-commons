## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.      If sustainability on methodologies is aimed, the key is to work with local actors, on complex challenges such as solid waste management at a country level. The value of understanding local conditions is more valuable when implementing national regulations: raising awareness about local challenges and building a local vision is essential to comply with regulations and therefore promote better management from the pyramid base, not top-down. 2.      Let’s eat the cake piece by piece. For a complex national regulation, the methodology on building a local strategy as and approach to waste management was successful. We called it “Co-design Transition Plan” along with municipalities and ministerial officers. The participatory process outlines a more approachable critic route for waste management, has been key to reducing the political risk of the failure of a national regulation, as was the Government Agreement 236 -2006 on wastewater treatment, which has been rejected and postponed for almost 20 years, increasing the severity of contamination of water and water bodies. 3.      There are no one-size-fits-all solutions. Although the laws and regulations must apply without distinction, it is extremely important to consider that, in the bills and regulations, they must promote principles of sustainability and grant the conditions and flexibility so that each territory, according to its context, allows the formulation of the best strategies, identifying solutions according to the local conditions. 4.      Various data sources and analytical methodologies have shown to be promising for monitoring environmental policies in two municipalities of Guatemala: (1) Satellite imagery for identifying waste from aerial view was found to be easy to use, with small learning curve and moderate computational requirements, however a major limiting factor is not having enough high-resolution for the target areas. (2) Land surface temperature (LST) have also shown a potential to identify high temperature sites that are associated to unmanaged waste sites, but is associated to a steeper learning curve, more complex models and high computational resources needed. More work is needed in the above methodologies for more conclusive results, while involving the support of technical and domain experts like academic institutions. 5.      Citizen science and open mapping tools / methods present another opportunity to complement official statistics and inform better the monitoring of environmental policies. In order to design and execute data collection mapping activities, it was identified the important to understand the context of the problematic in the areas of interest while involving key local actors in a codesign process. Involving organizations with high expertise in open mapping with common goals have also shown an advantage to plan and execute related activities within the learning cycles.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1.      Working along with institutional partners has been our big bet in three main levels: a) With the Ministry of Environment as the government lead in Waste Management; b) Ministry Departmental Delegations; and c) municipalities. However, we have witnessed there is a gap when understanding the municipal management and its legal framework from the centralized institutions such as the Ministry and even the Departmental Delegations.  The 164-2021 Ministerial Agreement (waste management), dictates requirements and deadlines for municipal governments, which although under the Municipal Code (with higher hierarchy), is alien from the municipal technical and financial capabilities to address a comprehensive waste management.  In addition, The State Contracting Law which applies to all public institutions is also very narrow and contradictory by constraining municipalities to seek finance for infrastructure in more than a 4-year administrative period.  How are municipalities are supposed to comply with law and environmental requirements (set for August 2023) if there’s no legal nor financial support?  Our challenge is bigger then. 2.      Although the 164-2021 Ministerial Agreement (waste management) intends to improve waste management across the national territory, this regulation was drafted and launched without considering participatory processes, particularly with diverse types of municipalities which present different territory conditions and financial capabilities. The results have been a climate of uncertainty and distrust on the part of the municipalities. During our participatory workshops with municipalities, it’s perceived the rejection and disagreement with the regulation. Some even have considered in early stages to annul or postpone its deadlines, taking the 236-2006 regulation on water treatment, that was launched in 2006 and its compliance has been delayed up today. 3.      Probably the biggest barrier on waste management is the clarity on who’s accountable for waste management.  Today we’re facing a very complex culture of avoiding external costs of pollution that goes from producers, public institutions, and many citizens who aren’t aware of the costs of waste management, and if they do, many pretend it could be covered with current budget from municipalities to national government. This is worsened by the fact that there’s no municipal fee for waste treatment and final disposal. In certain municipalities, there’s a fee for waste collection. From Solutions Mapping, this is the hardest part to breakthrough from the status quo to sustainable practices, and acknowledging sustainability is not for free. 4.      Obtaining access to high-resolution satellite imagery involves a considerable effort in investigating and understanding available mechanisms. 5.      Finalizing non-financial legal agreements (with academia and international NGO) has been a lengthy process in which for some cases had to be escalated to HQ UNDP and executed Due Diligences which involved more time and effort than initially expected.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

a)      Systems map, user journeys (journals), and waste collectors’ collective intelligence: We began to deep in by understanding the complexity of the “waste management” ecosystems which are emerging systems with many unusual stakeholders aside from public institutions. By acknowledging its complexity, we could also learn more about the informal incentives that promote waste classification and an economic system many vulnerable people depend on. These ecosystems aren’t acknowledged by the public institutions; however, it will be a mistake to conduct waste management processes ignoring them. b)      In-depth interviews and focus groups were used to compile qualitative data and build diagnose on current waste management with local governments from budgeting, actions taken, services operating, costs and understanding of local generators. The only available data on waste management is: a) population with or without waste collection service; b) how is waste is disposed (open burning, bury, thrown away or collected without considering treatment and final disposition). c)      Geo-located data have shown promising results for identifying unmanaged waste site in specific municipalities and complementing official statistics. However, a major limitation was to obtain a high-resolution enough for performing the intended analysis in the geographic areas of interest.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Participatory Design through Design Sprints has been our key element to:  generate a sense of belonging in the challenge, raise awareness on why is important to address waste management and most important validate a genuine process from bottom-up where municipal officers have co-created their own approach to comply with national regulation.     To attain a viable and sustainable strategy it has been useful to build a “municipal” asset mapping on the services they provide as well as other conditions they must overcome.   For the strategy proposal we have used a simple future analysis projecting what would the future looks like for each municipal territory if actions are taken or if the mismanagement keeps going along. This has helped us to raise awareness on the severe challenges that awaits if no action taken, also allowing municipal officers to understand the impact is not only about the seashores polluted with waste, but also how their local territories in mainland could be impacted.   As shared before, the current waste management happens along with informal workers, from waste collection to waste picking. We also have considered them as essential part of the approach and therefore, the collective intelligence methods have been helpful to understand and build a systems map. For monitoring environmental policies and identifying unmanaged waste sites in selected municipalities using geo-located data, innovation methods involving co-creation with domain experts (i.e. academic institution and international NGO) helped discovering specific analytical methodologies and proof of concept definitions to be tested further by the lab in the next cycle.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

For these cycles we have worked with women leaders and members of 12 Local Development Councils in Estanzuela as well as the leaders from 3 Neighborhood Councils in Zone 5 of Guatemala City.   Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, an international NGO, have supported with the definition of outcomes and related activities in order to perform open mapping data collection on solid residues and waste management.   “Plogging” with civil society participating in the Sweden Embassy stand for waste classification during the City’s Cultural Festival, where the Lab made live demonstrations on how to classify and compost for public audience. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Carnegie Mellon University, U.S. based, supported identifying and performing initial tests (PoC) of analytical methodologies for monitoring environmental policies, through a Capstone project of graduate-level students advised by a faculty member.   Promoting solutions on waste classification and the value for circular economy within the UN Year of Glass 2022, we have engaged with 2 main private universities: Universidad del Valle de Guatemala and Universidad Francisco Marroquín, conducting conferences, open dialogs and recyclethon. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

With the processes of Transition Plans we approached the waste collection trucks, known as “yellow trucks”, starting from the owners (who are associated) to conduct local research with the workers, half of them under payroll and the other half under informality and how the system works.   Celebrating the UN Year of Glass 2022, we partnered (without MoU) with Vical, the largest company in the region that processes glass with a 90% rate of recycling as a lead example of circular economy. We conducted diverse process of raising awareness in usage of noble materials that recyclable in a 100%, such as glass, but also the benefits on a more conscious consumption reducing the pollution in our lakes, rivers, and seas.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

·         For complex challenges, is important to identify early champions who join the process of co-design of waste management creative strategies. Within the process is easier to understand solutions, many grassroots solutions, that not only cost less but also are suitable enough to accelerate waste classification and collection.   ·         The most important of the process has been the openness and engagement with counterparts, including public officers, allowing to build relationships based of trust. Showing that we’re together in this challenge and walking aside them along all the process, sometimes through rough paths, has allow us to strengthen our relationships, our reputation and how are work is done. ·         Validate what could work best from the people involved. ·         Stablishing a rhythm of work that allows participation of everyone, who also feel the pressure to resolve challenges and want to be part of solutions too. ·         Bringing together technical and domain experts (e.g. academia, NGOs, UNDP GIS specialists) with common goals can greatly facilitate identifying and testing more quickly data methods that otherwise would require from the lab more time and resources. This despite the challenges associated to finalizing non-financial legal agreements.
