> Brief description of the innovation

L4LSC was established in January 2017 and has been gradually expanding since. It offers the international education curriculum and is currently incorporating the Zambian curriculum. It provides both primary and secondary education. The school is an examination centre. It provides tuition for students seeking certification from the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The school also accommodates learners with Special Education Needs (SEN). 
The school currently does not have the most ideal infrastructure to attain all its objectives and enroll as many students as it should. The facilities are insufficient and could benefit from more space for sports fields. 
The proposed design for L4LSC was developed by the Assistant Director, Miss Choolwe Kalinda aged 23, who graduated from the Copperbelt University in April 2021. She was pursuing a degree in Architecture and developed the school design as her final year thesis project. 
The design concept is that of a symbolic adaptation of the human expression of a welcome embrace or “HUG”. It was from this concept that the design was developed. The school would like to have this innovative design constructed and contribute to building the future of our large and growing population of young ones.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

L4LSC is the only Cambridge Associate school in Kitwe, supervised directly by British Council Zambia. Only two schools offer the international curriculum in Kitwe. In contrast Lusaka, has over twenty (20) international schools. 
L4LSC solely relies on the revenue from fees to operate. Despite the lack of financial support the school has experienced growth; from 4 learners in 2017 to 95 learners in 2021. The main hinderance to further growth being lack of sufficient funding to purchase land large enough to house all the facilities needed and have extra-curricular activities.
Throughout the pandemic all our employees have been and continue to be paid in a timely fashion. The school is breaking-even and pays all taxes. It is self-sustaining.
Zambia has a number of international investors that have made the country there home. An expatriate guide website had the following to say about international schools in Zambia:
“…many international families choose to send their children to international schools, mostly in Lusaka. International schools can be the perfect solution in Zambia.” ( dotExpat Ltd , 2020)
International schools are thus, the most favoured schools for expatriate workers in Zambia. 
The target market  is both local and international learners. The staff currently are all Zambian.

> Technical Feasibility

The basic requirement is to create a school environment that develops the whole child, instils enthusiasm for learning, and encourages positive social relationships. The design developed is meant to encompass all of these needs. The practical methods used in the design link behavioural objectives to spatial needs. Additionally, the design is cost-effective and makes use of local construction methods and materials.
“Contemporary Architecture” was chosen as a design inspiration because it employs different architectural styles. Sustainability is also an important feature of contemporary architecture. Thus the design implements sustainable design materials and concepts that make the building more environmentally friendly.
The major sections of the single-storey building are as follows:
i.	Administration
ii.	Primary
iii.	Secondary
iv.	IELTS and SEN
v.	The Multi-Purpose Hall
The building layout is such that it follows the shape and form of the concept of the ‘hug’.
The building is designed in such a way that local bricklayers, welders and craftsmen can easily execute the design. Those in the informal or formal sector can easily execute the design and this could provide them with an opportunity to raise money to provide for their families. A project like this is thus feasible economically and technically.
The project is in three phases. Currently our greatest need is assistance in starting and completing only the first phase. We are confident that the school itself will be able to generate enough revenue to complete phase 2 and 3.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Currently the school has employed 34 indigenous Zambians. The school thus supports 34 Zambian families here in Kitwe. Majority of those employed as teachers are aged 22 – 40. A greater number being below 35 years of age. The school also accommodates students that have not yet graduated from university as interns for them to gain experience and insight into the teaching environment, also as an extra source of income. Amongst those employed are those that recently graduated from our Zambian Public Higher Learning Institutions who we are assisting in paying back their student loans. 
The growth of the school will thus be able to have a positive social impact on the community. It will provide more jobs to indigenous Zambian citizens. The country has over 50,000 teachers that are unemployed.  A larger school that can accommodate more learners will definitely provide employment to some of these teachers, with the ripple effect of alleviating poverty in our community.
An international school aims to include ALL students including those with learning disabilities, promote learning of other cultures, and teach healthy social skills in a multicultural setting. The positive social impact of complete inclusivity in the learning environment can never be underestimated.
