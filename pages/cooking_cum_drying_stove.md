This is a wood charcoal-fuelled cooking stove with several drying trays below the gas top, to dry various food items. The stove is a self-standing one, which also serves as doubling as a workplace having a work platform at a height of 75 cm from the ground and measuring around 60 cm x 90 cm. Two cooking stoves have been provided at the top and a third one for drying purposes at the bottom in the center. The stove emits very less smoke and also dries the food items effectively. As the entire system is made in galvanized sheet metal/aluminum, upon use it gets warm and dissipates the heat to the surrounding, keeping the room warm as well. The stove has been tested at IIIT, Manipur, Imphal where the system was found to be more efficient than available charcoal burning chulha. This is possible because the air used to burn the charcoal comes through the enclosed box, where it gets preheated. So some part of waste heat gets recovered and hence the efficiency of the cooking stove cum dryer is about 10 % more than the conventional system. The air intake to the stove is regulated through a proper vent system and depending upon the type of food cooked can enhance the fire or reduce the burning of the fuel. For ease of circulation, a small fan has also been incorporated into the system. IIT Manipur has suggested modifications to the cooking stove cum dryer to make it more efficient and user-friendly. Over the years Deben Singh has participated in and displayed his stoves and dryers in several exhibitions and fairs at state, regional, and national levels. He has also received several awards for his contribution to the development of useful technologies and skill development. Recently, the Department of Commerce and Industries, Govt. of Manipur has allotted him a permanent work shed at an Industrial Area in Imphal where he would now get an uninterrupted power supply, which will help him scale up his production. NIF has also supported him through its business development grant and recently through the Micro Venture Innovation Fund (MVIF) for scaling up his business. Their rights to his Innovative fish dryer and Emoinu stove have also been acquired under Grassroots Technological Innovation Acquisition Fund (GTIAF) by NIF for wider diffusion. Deben Singh is also planning to impart skill development training to interested local youth so that they can work with him or start their enterprise.
