Sport For A Health Society

> Brief description of the innovation

I strongly believe that sport is a key component for a healthy society. Sports can enable one to be productive in many things e.g thinking, strength.....
If we were to introduce sports at different levels and sensitize our communities on its importance then we would have a healthy poeple in our country,  also the reduction of poverty, diseases prostitution e.t.c

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Sports can benefit our communities. For instance if we were to have men and women to compete at international level and are able to win at such events, then our country is beign recongnised. Sports facilities used would also be other sources of income by charging spectators renting them out and so forth. To already existing businesses spirts brings alot of people together hence alot of businesses benefit at different levels e.g hotels, spurs only to mention a few. 
Sports doe not pollute the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

Introduction of sports in communities in the sense of having healthy sports men and women. If we would start teaching children at early ages then we would have beaten the sydrome of alcoholism,  prostitution.
Children need to be groomed so that they become accostomed to this habbit. There is need for introduction of various sports to identify who belongs where . there is need to encourage sports in schools from primary to college, also in communities

> Anticipated Social Impact

Health is important to all young and old. It makes one productive hence our communities would have atleast everyone doing something. Sports also brings in foreign exchange if we have sports men that are able to participate at national level we would host games which would attract thousands from other countries.
