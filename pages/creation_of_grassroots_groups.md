> Description of the solution

Chispa Arizona, a grassroot group is organised and directed by Masavi Perea a construction worker. The grassroot group fights for clean air, water, healthy neighbourhoods and climate action in Latino communities. One of his top priorities is to protect the people in West and South Phoenix who are likely to suffer, get sick and even die from extreme heat. Phoenix does have protocols in place for when extreme heat hits, and was the first city in the country to fund an Office of heat response and mitigation.
