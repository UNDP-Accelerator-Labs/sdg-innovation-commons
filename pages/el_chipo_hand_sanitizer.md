Public places have been found to be challenging places to maintain high hygiene practices namely market places, schools and hospitals among others. Further, there is limited access to clean water and soap that can be used to ensure cleanliness. Certain environments are very busy thus making it difficult for people to remember to wash their hands as often as they should. The result of this is the spreading of communicable diseases and that increases pressure on the already congested health facilities especially in the context of COVID-19

El-Chipo hand sanitizer is a locally developed hand sanitizer using organic products. This is a powerful germ killing product which kills 99.5% of bacteria on contact and is made from natural ingredients extracted from organically grown plants. The use of locally sourced organic materials, makes the product affordable and easily accessible to low income earners.
