> Title of the innovation

Long term solutions to ending Unemployment

> Brief description of the innovation

Using school to Provide Innovative solutions to National problems affecting Humanity such as Youth Unemployment, among others... 
One way of achieving this, was the introduction of anti ~EXAM Malpractice club in Zambia which was officially launched on 27th September, 2019 and ZNBC covered this event.
Before that, school was producing half baked graduands that have become a burden in the labour market because most of them passed their Examination with the help of EXAM Leakage. So they are not be creative enough to survive outside employment circles.
We thank God that from the time we officially launched Anti ~EXAM Malpractice club in Zambia, there has been few or no recorded cases of Examination Malpractice during Examination periods. 
Anti ~EXAM Malpractice club in Zambia is an official certified innovation under the author Mr Kapi Katungu , who is also the founder of Intellect EXAM Solutions company. [Anti ~EXAM Malpractice club is a certified program by PACRA].
