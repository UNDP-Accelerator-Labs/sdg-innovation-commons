> Brief description of the innovation

Poultry farming is our business. The idea is to expand and create employment and reduce poverty among youths and disadvantaged women and increase household income Poverty is widespread in the Gwembe district, which has been severely affected by HIV / AIDS and now Covid19, and resulted in many orphaned households. To achieve these goals it is necessary to increase both mass production and production by masses of free range chickens, with an emphasis on empowering the poorest of the poor farmers to become entrepreneurs.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I will set up a local office at my home for all poultry works. Chickens produced will be sold in two forms. 1. Live chickens sold to local markets 2. Dressed Chickens supplied to super market stores such as shoprite and choppies. I will engage other households in the production so as to increase stocks produced. I seek to enroll at least 20 farmers (youths and women) for the first phase of programme. Our pricing will be reasonably low as we seek to mass produce. The market price of a chicken so far is between K50 and K100 within Gwembe District. Village chickens meat is organic in nature and thus low chemical usage will be applied in the growth of these.  We will try to collect chicken manual too for production of organic fertilizers for sale to local vegetable farmers.

> Technical Feasibility

In order for scaling-up poultry production and additionally introduce high-yielding chickens and layers:  It is to be liked that beneath the scheme of under 50 chicks according to beneficiary will be set up. This  model  is  an  extremely  low  input  model. The intention is to improve the small farmers into mainstream of monetary activity. It  is  therefore  proposed  to  move  incrementally  from  a  subsistence  model  of  outside poultry  farming  to  a  scaled-up  entrepreneur  model,  up-scaling  up to  500 chickens according to harvest. Implementation will contain a two-tier approach. 1. Farming guide - to encompass inputs like delivery of chicks, feed, fitness cover, management, schooling and outputs (e.g. advertising and marketing of chicken eggs, meat). 2. Financial support - Adequate monetary support is important to offer preliminary capital inputs (housing, equipment, birds, feed, fitness cover, insurance) to man or woman beneficiary.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Poultry farming will create employment thereby increasing household incomes. Increased incomes will translate into low levels or complete elimination of poverty. It will also enable the youths and disadvantaged women to have a better livelihood. Socially, many households have been affected by early pregnancies and young men engaging in drug abuse. With continued meetings twice a week to train and learn, there will be a reduction in such social misbehaviour.
