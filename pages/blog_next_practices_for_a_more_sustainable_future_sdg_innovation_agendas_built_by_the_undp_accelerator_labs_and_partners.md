SDG innovation agendas built
by the UNDP Accelerator Labs
and partners in 2024

Co-building the Accelerator Labs as a joint venture with:

UNDP
Core
Partners

Through globally distributed R&D,
the UNDP Accelerator Labs create value
through experiments in hundreds
of countries in the Global Majority.

Bottom-up R&D means we map and learn
from local experimentation across many
sectors to point to where there is traction,
what can be scaled and how innovation
can accelerate sustainable development.

Developing
new value
propositions

Positioning UNDP at
the edge of sustainable
development. Responding
to emerging development
challenges with agility,
curiosity and systems
transformation capacity.

Codifying
insights

Mapping, codifying and
amplifying promising
solutions, data sets and
innovation ecosystems to
inform the strategic plan-
ning, design and delivery
of development programs.

Identifying
patterns

Identifying opportuni-
ties, gleaning patterns
of insights, signals and
solutions from a global
learning network of local
ecosystems.

Three
emerging
opportunities
to drive SDG
acceleration

Throughout 2024, UNDP’s
innovation network has
prototyped a new kind of
research and development
(R&D): learning from signals
of change to see patterns
that create global business
intelligence. As we evolve
into UNDP’s open, globally
distributed R&D capability,
we’ve built coalitions in three
high potential niches to show
new ways to accelerate job
creation, entrepreneurship and
sustainability: digital finance,
food systems and circular
economies.

This document outlines an
innovation agenda based on
patterns we see across Africa,
Latin America, Asia, Europe
and beyond:

The growth of digital
finance in the wake of the
pandemic with an unclear
impact on poverty.

Combining grassroots
knowledge and AI to build
sustainable food systems.

Business and governments
working together to create
value from food and plastic

Digital Financial Inclusion

An R&D agenda
for action
Digital Financial
Inclusion

More than 1.4 billion people in the Global
Majority do not have access to bank
accounts. And yet, the demand for credit is
massive—the credit gap for African small
and medium-sized enterprises alone is
US$330 billion.

Our R&D agenda
Financial inclusion creates access to useful
and affordable financial products and
services—transactions, payments, savings,
credit and insurance. Technology is being
used to deliver financial products and
services more cheaply and to more people.
But does this move us closer to a world
without poverty?

What needs to take place in order for digital
finance to put more money in the pockets
of rural women and men in poor countries?
This is the question UNDP and partners are
exploring through R&D.

Digital Financial Inclusion

While taking stock of the UNDP Accelerator
Labs’ finance work across a hundred countries,
a common trend emerged. Over two thirds of
the Labs that were working on finance focused
on financial inclusion facilitated by digital
tools. Impact on financial inclusion is
accelerated by:

Local practices

Digital tools are most inclusive when
they’re designed to support existing
(good) practices and community
knowledge. These practices tend
to be endemic, through traditional
practices like community saving or
the use of local languages.

Focus on community

Digital tools also work well when
people can access them close to
where they live and work. The
groups most underserved by
finance—such as women, the
elderly and low-income commu-
nities—can greatly benefit from
in-person support that helps them
understand and use digital financial
tools. Without it, digital financial
services risk becoming exclusionary
because it’s often easier and more
profitable to serve existing users
rather than to expand services to
reach the poor.

Digital Financial Inclusion

Our focus on digital financial
inclusion grew organically from
work in nearly 20 Accelerator Labs
across five regions.

The DFI toolkit prototype
showcases Lab work that
helps people understand
how to use financial
services, save, pay, borrow,
derisk and certify.

We support informal
businesses in Cape Verde,
Congo, Eswatini, Guinea,
Morocco and Zambia.

We include rural commu-
nities in Colombia, Congo,
Egypt and Sudan.

We engage with women
in Argentina, Bolivia,
Cape Verde, Morocco and
Senegal.

Next practices for a more sustainable future
The crux of our R&D
agenda is a hypothesis for
how digital financial inclu-
sion connects to economic
development. It’s an
exploratory response to
the question, “How does
digital financial inclu-
sion put more money
in the pockets of rural
men and women in poor
countries?”

Through this hypothesis,
we’re suggesting that dig-
ital financial inclusion can
unlock the latent value
of networks and collec-
tives and new value or
sources of income as a
contribution to economic
development.

Tech-driven
microloan
monitoring

A web tool developed by the UNDP
Accelerator Lab in Cabo Verde sup-
ports the monitoring of microloans.
This data allows a quick analysis
of each micro, small, and medium
enterprises’ (MSMEs) position, and
lists ones with non-compliance
issues for faster action. The objective
is to monitor microcredits, allowing
the agents in charge of non-com-
pliant loans to proactively propose
solutions to the MSMEs affected.
As a part of the solution, the Lab
provided a physical customer service
desk at the main street market in
Cabo Verde, Sucumira.

Microinsurance
and payments

Waste pickers and
microinsurance in
Tanzania

The UNDP Accelerator Lab in
Tanzania, in partnership with the
Taka ni Ajira Foundation, launched
the Waste Banks initiative. This
project not only collects daily waste
data from pickers, but also creates
a credit score matrix based on this
data. TakaBima, developed with
Jubilee Insurance Tanzania, is a
microinsurance product designed
specifically for informal waste
pickers. As waste pickers collect
more waste, they accumulate credit
towards their insurance premiums,
making it an accessible safety net.

Payments at
neighborhood stores
in Argentina

The Red Con Vos (“Network With
You”) is a network of neighborhood
stores in Argentina, whose owners
and managers own the necessary
equipment for online payments
and have been trained in how to
help their fellow citizens complete
different kinds of online adminis-
trative processes. Residents gain
the convenience of accessing digital
payments; store owners charge a
small fee for each transaction they
facilitate and benefit from residents
visiting their stores more often.

Digital Financial Inclusion

Do digital
wallets
catalyze
access
to other
(financial)
services?

Digital (mobile) wal-
lets are widely used to
facilitate the movement
of money. Providers of
financial products and
services such as insur-
ance might deliver them
via wallets, extending
access to other services
to wallet owners.

What are
the minimum
ecosystem
conditions
for digital
financial public
infrastructure?

For services to flourish,
the right ecosystem
conditions mut be in
place, e.g., policy for
incentivizing the entry of
new players that intro-
duce new services for
consumers. Barriers to
entry around policy and
the interoperability of
data and systems should
be addressed.

Potential
R&D investments

Rapid research

What barriers are there to
mobile wallet usage?
Accelerator Labs in Cameroon,
South Sudan and Zambia are
conducting desk research and an
ethnographic survey to help them
understand barriers to and
benefits of digital mobile wallet
usage, e.g. remittances used to
fund small businesses.

Positive deviance
case study

What can we learn from com-
munities that have delivered
more financial services through
wallets?
Identify communities that use
digital wallets more than others
and learn from them, e.g. wallets
used for lowering interest rates
and increasing group savings in
South Sudan.

Solutions mapping

What financial products and
services are commonly built on
mobile wallets?
Identify use cases for digital wal-
lets being used beyond payments,
e.g., to deliver value added services
like insurance. Do a comparison
and analysis of results from an
inclusion perspective.

Adapting technology
(new service)/case study

What are innovative ways
to extend financing to small
businesses?
Explore how digital wallets are
catalyzing access to working cap-
ital financing, i.e., factoring. The
Accelerator Lab in Colombia is
developing an experiment to iden-
tify barriers to financing access for
MSMEs.

Assess and benchmark
results

What ecosystem investments
can catalyze the distribution of
financial services?
Adapt the SDG Digital Finance
Ecosystem Assessment (or a similar
assessment), which provides an
in-depth understanding of the
drivers that make a country digital
finance ready in 10 countries.
Compare and analyze the results
from an inclusion perspective. For
example, the Sustainable Finance
Hub worked with the Accelerator
Lab in Morocco to use data to
help the Moroccan government
understand where the gaps and
opportunities for financial inclu-
sion existed as input to its national
development strategy.

Digital Financial Inclusion

How can
alternative
data sources
improve credit
assessment?

Banks often won’t lend to
small businesses because
they can’t properly assess
risk. While alternative data
sources don’t increase
creditworthiness, they can
help with assessment. For
example, startups offering
credit might use mobile
phone or social media
usage records, SMS patterns,
etc. to inform a credit score.

Potential
R&D investments

Experimentation

What existing data sources can
be used to improve credit scoring?
Data is generated by payment systems such as mobile
money transaction data from cash in, cash out (CICO)
points and merchants buying goods with mobile money.
Using this data could enhance the credit assessment
process.

What alternative data sources can be used
creatively to improve credit scoring?
For example, the Accelerator Lab in Trinidad and Tobago
is exploring how non-traditional approaches to assessing
credit risk can reduce exclusion. This includes exploring
what sources will work in context; what is adoptable by
institutions; and how easy it is to collect data (such as
informal sector skills, unconventional assets like fruit
trees, and intangible assets like specialized knowledge)
that can be monetized.

How can the use of alternative data
improve financial behavior?
There are apps that deliver financial education alongside
its product or service. It might be useful to test whether
alternative data that leads to better credit scoring
coupled with education incentivizes better financial
behavior, such as an increase in repayment rates and the
use of savings and investment products.

Digital Financial Inclusion

What new
services can be
unlocked with
technology?

Technology can help exist-
ing products and services
be adapted to new contexts
and geographies, help
reduce barriers to trust
and extend products and
services to the last mile.

Potential
R&D investments

Solutions mapping &
acceleration campaign

Hackathon

What innovative digital financial
services are gaining traction and
driving inclusion?
Launch targeted campaigns to accel-
erate the mapping, adoption and/or
scaling of inclusive digital financial
services, mobilizing stakeholders
and resources across the ecosystem.

Prototyping &
experimentation
(adapting technology)

How do you remove barriers to
adapting tested technology to
new markets?
Explore the bottlenecks, e.g., policy
and legal frameworks, cultural
incompatibility, cost, etc. that
constrain use. For example, the
Accelerator Lab in Colombia is
testing how to design a product that
enables fintech factoring for SMEs
(specifically small shops), using alter-
native data.

How can users’ distrust of finan-
cial services be deconstructed?
Accelerator Labs in Bangladesh,
North Macedonia, Paraguay, Syria
and Zimbabwe plan to host a global
hackathon to determine how the
use of digital financial solutions can
be increased by decreasing distrust
between communities and service
providers, making digital financial
services more accessible.

Prototyping &
experimentation
(testing last mile
products and services)

What can be done to extend
access to products and services
to underserved and excluded
consumers, markets and
communities?
Identify markets with untapped,
high potential and prototype/
experiment with new services in
partnership with the private sector.
For example, the Accelerator Lab in
Uganda worked with Jumia Uganda
to help informal market traders sell
produce through its e-commerce
platform during COVID-19.

12

Digital Financial Inclusion

What does data
empowerment for
digital financial
services look
like?

There are opportunities
for consumers to own
their data and monetize
it. Another dimension
of data empowerment
might be boosting
creditworthiness by
helping people better
understand what might
improve their credit
scores, etc.

Potential
R&D investments

Solutions mapping

What are best practices in consumer protection?
Map examples of privacy, data protection and owner-
ship, as well as literacy in digital financial services such
as lending. For example, Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)
loans enable consumption for consumers whose spend-
ing power is constrained by inflation. But consumers
may be confused by interest rates, misuse the loans and
fall into indebtedness.

Ethnographic
research

What are the key design guidelines for building prod-
ucts that inform and empower?
Research basic principles of data empowerment and how
to operationalize them. For example, neobanking app
Fingo prioritizes financial literacy as part of its service
delivery.

Experimentation

What do products and services that allow consumers
to monetize their data look like?
Test out business models for consumers to own and
sell their data, building on the hypothesis that data
empowerment leads to access to credit. For example, the
founder of tappi, an app that digitizes small and medium-
sized businesses, advocates for consumers to own and
monetize their data.

Food Systems

An R&D agenda for action
Food Systems

Food is a primary human need. There can be no
development without thriving food systems that can
address that need in a secure and sustainable way,
forever, leaving no one behind.

Global food systems at the time of writing are in a state
of disarray. Far from fully delivering on Sustainable
Development Goal 2 of zero hunger, they leave
hundreds of millions of people in a state of acute food
insecurity, fueling grievances that can, and sometimes
do, escalate into violence. For the rest of us, they do
provide food security, but at very high costs for the
human health and the natural environment – costs that
amount to borrowing from the future and cannot be
sustained for long. Meanwhile, food systems reproduce
inequalities both between and within countries, with
a large share of the value they produce captured by a
small number of powerful actors.

Systemic problems require systemic solutions. The
white paper “Supporting Food Systems Transformation
Towards Sustainability and Resilience”, unveiled in
2024, reorganized UNDP’s strategic approach to food
systems, as well as its collaboration with other United
Nations agencies such as the Food and Agriculture
Organization, the World Food Programme, the
International Fund for Agricultural Development, and
other partners. UNDP argues for a holistic approach,
which is well served by its whole-of-government and
whole-of-society approach.

Food Systems

R&D in the UNDP Accelerator Labs focuses on
areas where food systems can be made fairer
and more resilient by learning from and with
communities, with relatively small investments
and in a relatively short time.

This approach often implies set-
ting out to learn about systemic
issues by prototyping and testing
components of their possible solu-
tions, rather than attacking them
head on.

For example, the Labs’ R&D
approach helps develop business
models for food banks and soup
kitchens to help food-insecure
groups in context of relative food
security—a tractable first step
that yields learnings about the
broader issue. It also tests differ-
ent types of behavioral incentives
to increase nutritional diversity in
different contexts, solving for the
local dimension while gaining valid
insights in general.

The Accelerator Labs’ use of partic-
ipatory methods, rapid prototyping
and iterative deployment of solu-
tions implies a strong preference
for open and often digital tech-
nologies. For example, the climate
resilience of a rural community can
be improved in a few months by
experimenting with methods of allo-
cating the community’s water based
on simple sensors to measure soil
humidity and collective intelligence
to interpret the data.

Systemic problems require systemic
solutions. The UNDP Food and
Agricultural Commodity Systems’
white paper “Supporting Food
Systems Transformation Towards
Sustainability and Resilience” pre-
sents UNDP’s strategic approach to
food systems, as well as its collab-
oration with other United Nations
agencies such as the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), the
World Food Programme (WFP), the
International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), and other
partners. It argues for a holistic
approach, which is well served
by its whole-of-government and
whole-of-society approach.

Five working hypotheses

Against this background, the UNDP Accelerator Labs
organized, in 2024, a bottom-up process to learn from
country practice and identify directions for R&D with a
high potential to accelerate food systems transformation.
This led to formulating five working hypotheses for
promoting sustainable agrifood systems.

01

02

03

Integrating farming and food
traditions with context-specific
technology can drive sustaina-
ble development by building on
local knowledge.

The interconnectedness of
cultural practices with food
production and consumption
creates leverage points for sys-
tems change.

Gender, generational and geo-
graphic inequalities are built into
the current food system but also
produce constituencies keen on
systems transformation.

04

05

Technological and policy innova-
tions can alter the cost structure
of the agrifood value chain to
incentivize sustainable practice.

Tapping into wasted and
underutilized assets offers
potential for creating sustainable
food value, reducing waste while
enhancing resource efficiency
and economic inclusiveness.

19

The five working hypoth-
eses led to a theory of
change to guide an R&D
agenda on food systems
transformation, with
three opportunities to
boost their fairness and
resilience.

System diversity serves as
an indicator of success—
more diverse systems
tend to be more resilient
and offer more agency to
the people in them.

Combining new technologies,
collective intelligence and
traditional knowledge

This opportunity space is about discovering and
testing and combining techniques for producing,
processing and distributing food. Combining
new technologies, collective intelligence and
traditional knowledge uses building blocks from
scientific research, grassroots innovation and
traditional and indigenous knowledge to make
food systems fairer and more resilient. Some
related activities could be:

De-risk investment in fair and
resilient food systems.
Food systems transformation
requires private investments,
and investment entails risk. For
example, farmers know that
they could switch to climate-re-
silient crops, but they are not
sure whether the demand
for those crops will be there
when the harvest time comes.
Bringing together the collective
intelligence on different stake-
holders could allow to reduce
(by shaping consumer demand)
share (by affordable insurance
schemes and collective pro-
duction arrangements such as
cooperatives), and distribute
risk across the value chain (via
institutions such as contract
farming) the associated risk.

Prototype non-conventional
techniques for food
production and processing.
Prototypes and demonstrations
of the simplicity and compet-
itiveness of traditional and
traditional-modern “hybrid”
techniques are helpful in collect-
ing more data and knowledge,
as well as in encouraging adop-
tion by farmers and other food
industry actors.

Test out ways to combine local
knowledge and data with
scientific knowledge.
With mobile phones and simple
sensors, rural communities can
aggregate hyperlocal informa-
tion into datasets and use them
to make better decisions, for
example on pest control inter-
ventions or harvesting, building
on lived experience and gener-
ating local action.

Map local foods and
traditional techniques in
agriculture and look at them
through new eyes.
Some farming techniques that
were all but abandoned with the
advent of modern agriculture,
like polyculture, turn out to
be ecologically advantageous;
some traditional foods and
crops turned out to be both
highly nutritious and climate-
resilient. There are doubtlessly
many more we don’t yet
know about.

The UNDP Zimbabwe Accelerator
Lab and Japanese technology
company Pegara are working on
technological solutions – like drones
and soundwaves – to pest control.
Combining them with traditional
techniques, they can capture large
numbers of quelea, a species of
small bird which threatens small
grain crops all across Africa but that,
once captured, provides
a valuable source of protein.

The UNDP India Accelerator Lab
prototyped DiCRA (Data in
Climate-Resilient Agriculture),
a collaborative digital public good
to provide open access to key
geospatial datasets relevant to
climate-resilient agriculture. These
datasets are curated and validated
through the collaborative efforts
of hundreds of data scientists and
citizen scientists across the world.
After successful testing, DiCRA
was handed over to the National
Bank for Agriculture and Rural
Development, the government of
India’s main financial institution
tasked with financing agriculture.

Traditional, but orphaned, crops have a potential to

again by applying food processing technologies, like
transforming the stalks of human-edible plants such as
sunflower into animal fodder.

Food Systems

How can new
technology,
collective
intelligence
and traditional
knowledge work
together?

Technologies like drones, robotics
and AI are changing the way food
is produced, processed, trans-
ported and sold. There is some
evidence that when smallholder
farmers and their communities
have access to these technolo-
gies, they use them in unique
ways, combining them with their
knowledge of the local context.
R&D in this direction is likely to
lead to democratization of these
technologies and creation of more
real-world use cases in the Global

How can private
sector actors align
their business
models with systems
transformation?

The private sector can be a pro-
tagonist in the transformation
of food systems if companies
manage to spot and seize the
associated business opportunities.
R&D can play a role by taking a
holistic perspective, and engi-
neering shifts that create such
opportunities. For example, new
marketable products can be cre-
ated from climate-resilient crops
that are currently neglected.

Improving the position of women
and youth in value chains

Several successful prototypes have shown that the position
of women and youth in value chains improves when
farming communities move from simply growing crops to
marketing and transforming them. Some related activities
could be:

This is often even more true
for women within those
communities, who are typi-
cally tasked with post-harvest
transformation. Processing,
marketing and finance in food
systems are often concen-
trated and global: developing
local and decentralized pro-
cessing technology, short
value chains and local access
to the finance needed, unlocks
new pathways to sustainable
development in rural commu-
nities. To address it, R&D can:

Test appropriate technologies
and solutions for farming
communities to process the
crops they grow. Simple, robust
technical solutions optimized
for use in rural contexts carry
the potential to bring process-
ing close to where crops are
grown. Local food processing
can open new spaces for women
and youth to participate in
production, reduce wastage
and greenhouse gas emissions
associated with globalized value
chains and allow rural communi-
ties to capture a higher share of
the value.

Risk insurance for small

The UNDP Ethiopia Accelerator Lab
is engaged in the development of
an insurance product to shield small
farmers against the risk of crop failure,
made more acute by fluctuations in
rainfall patterns associated with cli-
mate change. Currently, few insurance
companies provide micro-insurance.
The implementations that have been
tried were under shorter-term pro-
grams that have never been taken to
scale. The Lab is working closely with
UNDP’s Insurance and Risk Finance
Facility: its role is to work with farm-
ers, through surveys, co-creation and
experiments, in order to design a
product that can both be attractive for
small farmers and achieve full sustain-
ability for the insurer.

merce, and provide them with
longer shelf life foodstuff thanks to
the dryer. Women have taken the

Agricultural informal work-

over-represented—are in a “poverty

their skills and income, but their
income is too low to allocate time
and money to it. To break the trap,
assess training needs for informal
workers; pilot a cash-for training
program; track productivity improve-
ments; measure changes in output
and income.

Digital tools offer opportunities to
vendors in food markets—who are
often women, and often part of
the informal economy—to connect

Small farmers—the great

those who grow most of
the world’s food—have next

that are secure and viable
both for small farmers and

Gender gaps persist in food
systems. Nevertheless, the
first results from R&D in
UNDP are encouraging:
when local food systems
take on new functions (for
example adding processing
or e-commerce to growing
crops), opportunities open
for women and young

Creating value from food waste
and underused assets

One third of the food produced is lost and wasted;
contemporary food systems provide 60% of the world’s
calorie intake with just three edible plants—rice, maize and
wheat—when Earth has 50,000. Much value can be created
from food waste and underused assets. Some related
activities could be:

Prototype circular products
based on food waste. Many
products are possible to man-
ufacture from food waste. To
be successful, they need to
overcome some technological
difficulties and attract market
demand. Prototyping and qua-
li-quantitative market research
can speed up their development
and reduce their time-to-market.

Food waste and orphan
crops—well adapted to the
environment they evolved
in—have the potential to
reduce the consumption of
freshwater and chemicals;
create market opportunities
for local producers and small
enterprises; and provide bet-
ter access to healthy food for
marginalized individuals and
groups. To explore this solu-
tion space, one could:

Map food waste streams to
enable circular food systems.
Collecting food waste at the
source (for example street mar-
kets) opens opportunities for
processing it back into food, or
non-food products like livestock
feed or bioplastics. Quantifying
and mapping food waste
streams puts these opportu-
nities on the map for private
sector investors and policy
makers.

Explore the nutrition and mar-
ket potential of orphan and
heirloom crops.
The global market trend towards
“eating local” offers inroads for
reviving the traditional practices
of making food from plants
that are no longer grown or
foraged, like enset in Ethiopia.
Experiments with processing
and preparing these plants, as
well as innovative partnerships
with chefs and private sector
food transformation companies,
can detect promising opportu-
nities and hand them over to
smallholder farmers and rural
communities.

The UNDP Pakistan Accelerator Lab
collaborates with the high-mountain
communities of Hushe Valley, in the
Himalayas, whose main cash product
is apricot oil. The region produces
high-quality apricots, cherries and
other fruits and vegetables, that are
consumed locally but are difficult
to sell on the market because of
the difficult logistics of getting the
product to market before it spoils.
Through successive prototypes, the
local communities and the Lab singled
out transformed products that can be
produced locally and have a longer
shelf life than fresh produce, like jams
and several types of herbal tea. The
communities also created a ”Made

Prototypes

Every country has heirloom foods and crops, which are
suitable for human consumption but are not grown as
cash crops. Since they are adapted for the local climate
and soil, they tend to be resilient to supply-chain shocks
(for example from conflict) and require less water and
pesticides than non-indigenous plants. Some could
become the next superfood. Identify market opportuni-
ties for indigenous crops. An interesting specific case is
medicinal plants: they can deliver additional sources of
income to farming communities and, in fragile settings
where access to modern pharmaceuticals might be inter-
mittent, provide extra resilience.

Food Systems

How can heirloom
foods and crops
drive new markets
and farmers’
resilience?

Earth has over 50,000 edible
plants, but just three of them
(rice, maize and wheat) provide 60
percent of the world’s food energy
intake. R&D is a good tool to
explore the potential of heirloom
foods and crops, some of which—
like enset in Ethiopia—could be
marketed as superfoods, or in
connection to traditional cuisine.
This opens up paths for farming
communities to capture a higher
share of the added value from
food products.

Which circular

and climate
resilience in niche

Food systems are a major
employer and climate stressor.
R&D is needed to reveal paths
to their transformation that
pursue multiple goals, including
the generation of high-quality
jobs (necessary to counteract
the tendency of young people to
abandon farming and move to
cities en masse) and the shift to
climate-resilient crops. How will
small producers in the Global
Majority serve consumers of fair-

offers the opportunity to
shorten food supply chains,

example in street markets),
where it is relatively easy to

Heirloom and orphan crops and
other foodstuff that currently are

assessing how these uses enhance
regional identity; collaborate with
the tourism and cultural sectors

Increasing systems diversity

Diverse ecosystems are more resilient than monocultures; a
plurality of crops, food produce, food cultures and business
models provide more opportunities—potentially also more
security and more agency—to the women and men who
grow, transform, distribute and prepare food. R&D activities
to directly address system diversity include:

Designing next-generation
tools for dietary diversity for
marginalized individuals and
groups. There is considerable
scope to upgrade the institu-
tions commonly used to provide
food to vulnerable groups,
such as food banks, soup
kitchens and schools for the
most vulnerable in food secure
countries. This requires better
knowledge of how vulnerable
individuals and groups interact
with these institutions, so they
can be designed with them, and
not only for them. Ethnographic
methods, experiments, behav-
ioral insights and participatory
evaluations can contribute to
this knowledge.

Enhancing traditional, sustain-
able production techniques
with technology. Many national
and local food systems expe-
rience pressure to abandon
their traditional production
techniques to increase their
output of commodities that can
be traded on the global mar-
kets. Prototypes and collective
intelligence have the potential
to enhance those traditional
production techniques with
scientific knowledge and mod-
ern technology, rather than
replacing them with intensive
agricultural methods.

Accelerating the scaling of
early successes in agritourism.
Agritourism has emerged as a
model whereby applying agroe-
cological techniques aligns with
business success. Despite suc-
cess stories, difficulties remain
in diffusion. Ethnographies and
qualitative analysis in general
can help see the big picture
behind these difficulties and
inform growth strategies.

four weeks. As a result, the dietary
diversity was significantly higher than
that of the control group, proving
that farmers market vouchers are a
promising tool to increase access to
nutritious food, and not just empty
calories. This type of intervention also

concluded that agritourism can
help create resilient livelihoods,
especially benefiting vulnerable
populations like women and youth,
while also promoting climate-smart
agricultural practices that preserve
biodiversity. As an additional bene-
fit, agritourism would enhance the
range of experiences available to

An R&D agenda
for action
Circular Economy

Global circularity is in decline from 9.1%
in 2018 to 7.2% in 2023—a 21% drop over
the course of five years. Municipal solid
waste generation is predicted to grow from
2.1 billion tons in 2023 to 3.8 billion tons by
2050.

Meanwhile, in just the past six years, we have
consumed over half a trillion tons of materials—
nearly as much as in the entirety of the 20th
century. If we persist on this trajectory, we will
require resources equivalent to nearly three Earth-
like planets by 2050.

Research shows that the circular economy could
unlock US$4.5 trillion in economic growth and
create 6 million jobs through activities such as
recycling, repair, remanufacturing and sharing.

Additionally, it could reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by 6% to 7%, translating to cumulative
savings of 67 to 76 gigatons of CO2 equivalent
between 2026 and 2050. Also, less plastic waste
in the ocean would benefit industries like fishing
and tourism, as plastic pollution currently leads to
US$13 billion in costs and economic losses per year.

Which indigenous
practices can we
bring back to support
circularity?

Many indigenous cultures have
long-standing traditions of sus-
tainable resource management
that align with circular econ-
omy principles. This R&D area
explores how these practices can
be integrated into modern circu-
lar systems, potentially offering
culturally appropriate, locally-
adapted solutions that enhance
resource efficiency, promote
biodiversity and strengthen com-
munity resilience in the transition
to a circular economy.

How to overcome
“trust” barriers
with multinational
corporations on data
sharing?

Data sharing is vital for opti-
mizing resource use and closing
material loops in a circular econ-
omy. However, corporations often
hesitate to share data due to com-
petitive concerns. This R&D area
seeks to identify strategies to
build trust and facilitate transpar-
ent information exchange, which
is essential for tracking material
flows, improving supply chain
efficiencies and fostering collab-
oration across sectors in circular
systems.

Understanding the waste
life cycle for decision
making

Panama’s waste collection service
currently reaches only 65% of the
population. To address this gap,
the Lab is employing interactive
workshops and data visualization
to better understand and engage
with waste management challenges.
By leveraging digital tools and GIS
technology, the Lab maps waste col-
lection routes and visualizes waste
generation patterns. Mobile appli-
cations and online platforms are
also used to gather data and collect
feedback from the community. This
digital-first approach fosters collab-
oration between local communities
and policymakers, enabling them to
co-create solutions to the growing
waste problem. It also raises aware-
ness about recycling. For instance, in
the San Felipe Neri market, the Lab
discovered that 99% of food waste
could be recycled.

Detecting waste hot spots

The Lab in Viet Nam took a two-
pronged approach to understand
solid waste management in Da
Nang City. First, they dove deep
into the informal waste sector,
combining participatory sensing,
GIS mapping, and interviews with
informal workers. This created a
detailed map of the informal waste
management system, highlighting
its crucial role in the circular econ-
omy. Second, the Lab conducted
a pilot using satellite imaging
data and spectrum analysis to
detect and map waste hotspots in
Da Nang City. This data provided

Focusing on incentives...

This opportunity space explores the crucial role of
incentives and disincentives in shaping behaviors and
driving (or hindering) the adoption of circular practices.
It recognizes that while technological innovation and
infrastructure are essential, they are not enough to motivate
widespread change. We need to understand the complex
web of motivations and barriers that influence individual
businesses and collective choices. This could involve:

Designing and testing
innovative incentive
schemes: Developing and
piloting new incentive
mechanisms that are
tailored to specific contexts
and target specific
behaviors.

Evaluating the impact of
incentives: Assessing the
effectiveness of different
incentive schemes in driving
behavioral change and
achieving desired circular
economy outcomes.

Identifying and analyzing
existing incentives:

Exploring the effectiveness
of various incentive
mechanisms, such as
subsidies, tax breaks,
rebates, recognition
programs and how different
types of incentives influence
the adoption of specific
circular practices.

Unpacking disincentives:
Identifying and analyzing
the factors that discourage
or prevent the adoption of
circular practices. These
disincentives can be
economic, social, cultural, or
regulatory.

From Waste to Livelihoods

The Lab in Tanzania partnered
with Jubilee Insurance to create
TakaBima, a microinsurance prod-
uct for informal waste pickers. By
delivering waste to designated
Waste Banks, pickers have their
contributions weighed and logged
into a digital system via mobile apps
and GIS technology. This waste data
is then tokenized to establish their
creditworthiness allowing access
to insurance coverage for medical
emergencies and income loss. With
over 10,000 waste pickers estimated
to be working in Tanzania, this initia-
tive has the potential to significantly
increase recycling rates and provide
financial inclusion and social protec-
tion to informal workers.

Incentivizing waste
sorting in Indonesia

The Lab in Indonesia is tackling
urban waste management by
mobilizing communities through
GRADASI, a behavioral change
campaign launched in partnership
with various ministries and faith-
based organizations. Leveraging
the strong religious values in the
country, the Lab is promoting waste
sorting and recycling through
places of worship, incentivizing par-
ticipation by offering rewards and
recognition to those who actively
contribute. Their experiments
show that combining religious
messaging with incentives can
significantly increase the number
of recyclables collected. To date,
the campaign has resulted in over
143,000 kg of waste donated across
various institutions in 24 provinces,
demonstrating the potential of this
approach to boost urban resilience
and promote circularity.
