> Description

Companies That Change Lives supports high-impact businesses through a gender-focused blended financing mechanism. They invest in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the early stages and promote economic opportunities for women, while also contributing to climate change adaptation and mitigation.


The objectives are:

To support the development of financially underserved SMEs in the 'Missing Middle,' with special attention to gender justice and climate change.

To increase social impact by accessing new philanthropic and private capital aligned with impact goals.


To leverage Oxfam's expertise as a pioneer in the development sector and in promoting gender and climate justice in the impact investment sector.


Investment is made in women-led companies and in businesses that primarily support women throughout their value chain and have an impact on gender justice: women's leadership, decent work for women, inclusion of women in value chains, and transformative products and services for women.


In the climate context, sectors that support adaptation to climate change and climate change mitigation are included.
