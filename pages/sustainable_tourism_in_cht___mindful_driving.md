Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT. A key complaint of many tourists visiting the CHT is that the drivers often drive in a risky manner and do not have legal documents, which discourages many tourists from venturing into different parts of the region. To address this issue, a solution is to provide training for the local drivers on maintaining safety protocols while driving in the hill tracts region and also helping them access driving license following the completion of their training.
