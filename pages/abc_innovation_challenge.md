## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Bridging the Financing Gap for Women and Youth Cross Borders Traders
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is the negative impact presented by COVID-19 lockdown on informal Cross Border Traders (CBTs) with limited capital and subsequent requirement to present a COVID test certification whose value ranges from US$55 to US$80 once the borders are opened every time one wants to travel across the borderlines.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Following a UNDP and UNCDF Zambia Country Offices scoping study on the impact of COVID-19 among women Cross Boarder Traders (CBTs) conducted in three boarder areas, it was discovered that the boarder closure resulted in a drop in trading while other CBTs changed to low value products that could be sourced locally. The decreased income among the CBTs made it difficult for them to travel, instead arrangements were entered into with truck drivers to deliver their goods. This posed security risks on their goods and created the challenge for the CBTs not to have control on the movements of their products. The result has been increased vulnerability among the women CBTs, who have not even been able to participate in informal savings groups that tend to offer respite for a trader when facing challenges to meet the financial costs of staying in business.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Two innovations are being tested in partnership with AccLab Zimbabwe, to offer a solution and promises to increase CBTs’ resilience from the effects of COVID- 19. One is the Zimbabwe sourced innovation called Thumeza whose offer is delivery services to informal businesses using a digital platform that tracks movement and guarantees security of goods instead of reliant on truck drivers. The second is a Zambian sourced solutions called VillageSavers one of the top 20 awardees of the during the AccLab's National Innovation Initiative Call, a nation-wide solutions scouting fair held every year since 20202. VillageSavers  offer is to digitize financial transactions through automated digital platforms for the CBTs Self-help Savings Groups. VillageSavers also guarantees security of funds and 100% accurate data of savings and offers required income data that has previously been hard to capture and could be used to access financial products from established institutions. It also explores the potential of enrolling traders to formal social security and health insurance schemes long denied to informal business owners. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

VillageSavers automated digital App to take the place of the ‘money-box’ for peace of mind and increased confidence for small saving models that guarantee financial inclusion.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

If trade transactions and financial opportunities for Small Scale Cross Border Traders are digitized, then they will be provided with a business continuity path in the current COVID-19 context and other related trade barriers.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The innovations were identified during previous solutions mappings conducted in the field following sense making workshops and explorative visits conducted with various stakeholders to identify the key issues in the country. A prototype in real life using data from the two Apps as evidence of the traders acceptability of the two innovations. The learning from this cycle will be used to develop  a Proof of Concept. The learning cycle is being supported with award received from Africa Borderline Centre (ABC) to support  joint implementation by AccLabs Zimbabwe and Zambia.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The gaps being addressed are informal traders capacity to use digital platforms and acceptance to conduct their business on the e-marketplace as crossing the borders to conduct their businesses is challenging
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Cross Border Traders Association as they have a wide reach to membership from all CBTs operating on the borderlines of all the eight neighboring countries of Zambia. The Association is strategically positioned to work with government and other stakeholders are they are the first point of contact on cross border trading.
