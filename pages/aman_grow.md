## SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION SYSTEMS

AMAN Grow designs and operates Integrated Aqua-Vegetable Systems (iAVS), a sustainable farming technology that combines fish farming (aquaculture) with crop cultivation. Their Modular Food Production Systems (MFPS) allow individuals and organizations to grow fresh fish and nutrient-rich vegetables using minimal water, energy, and maintenance. Based in Amman, Jordan, AMAN runs the largest iAVS farm in the Middle East, known as AMAN HUB, which showcases their innovation in eco-friendly food production. Their work focuses on sustainability, efficiency, and food safety, offering a scalable solution for healthier, more resilient food systems.
