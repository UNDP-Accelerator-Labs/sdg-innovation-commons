> Brief description of the innovation

Unless the mind is used, it will cease to expand. The student can see only to the depth of what he has explored. Two things, scientific laws that will revolutionalize the entire education system 
1. Ficks law 
2. Langmuir adsorption isotherm 
Penalizing said "to have knowledge without practical power, to have insight, and yet to be incapable of applying in in everyday life, what more dreadful fate could an unfriendly spirit devise for us".

- yes

These principles applies will boost my economy help my country have more involved and recognised scientists, it will have more people making their scientific contribution to the environment of Zambia ..which will thus boost my economy at large

> Technical Feasibility

I believe all nature, humans inclusive are governed by law, and the laws that govern nature are obeyed by nature, human inclusive. I believe behaviour in order to be successful in this context should be governed by nature's laws ..these laws of respect will prove to be of greatest good to all of zambia..take time to understand..therefore I will begin to employment these ideas as soon as I can an opportunity to stand before a class, here I stand I can do no other, God help me
