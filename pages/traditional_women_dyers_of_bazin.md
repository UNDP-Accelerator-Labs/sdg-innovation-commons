## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Creating social value for traditional malian women dyers of bazin
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to understand the challenges faced by women traditional bazin dyers in Mali.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Mali is renowned for its appreciation of bazin, the damask fabric imported from Germany, Austria or China, through its know-how in traditional dyeing. Whether for festive ceremonies or on Fridays, everyone wears bazin.&nbsp; A real industry but evolving in the informal sector, this sector involves many people: importers of bazin, sellers of bazin, sellers of dye for textiles, dyers, assistants, tappers, embroiderers, seamstresses, etc.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to quantify the contribution of the bazin industry to the economy. Little or no data exists on this.


Although it is losing ground due to the entry of industrially dyed bazin into the market, traditional dyeing is still innovating by introducing more original patterns and tones than the others.
Nevertheless, traditional dyeing has harmful effects on the health of women dyers (and their children) due to the inhalation of gases produced during the dyeing of fabrics, but also harmful effects on the environment (water pollution).

A laborious work that has been encountering obstacles for some time now, particularly of a financial nature.&nbsp; Until recently, the center was running at full capacity. Built in 2011, as part of a "governance and culture" project coordinated by UNESCO (World Heritage Centre and Bamako office) and co-financed by the European Union, it housed over 200 women. Gathered in a huge courtyard, under the sheds, they came from all the districts of the Malian capital to work by hand the white fabric of the shiny damask cotton basin, which generally comes from European countries, especially Germany and the Netherlands, but also from China, says one of the workers, dipping her immaculate fabric into a large barrel to dye it. "The center was full, there was not even a place to set foot, but the dyers have left for the most part because there is little money coming in, people are in difficulty since the crisis of 2012 (a rebellion unleashed in January 2012 in the northern regions plunged the country into instability)," laments another dyer met by Anadolu. Today, the dyers rarely earn more than 1,000 CFA francs (US$2) per fabric processed, almost half as much as when the center opened, they say. These pieces are then sold for between 6,000 and 6,500 CFA francs on the Malian market (between 12 and 13 dollars), which is always in demand.<div><br></div><div>In addition to the lack of money, the dyers also deplore "the problem of lack of water and electricity, which means that they cannot work at night" and appeal to the Malian authorities to improve their working conditions.&nbsp; Despite all the difficulties encountered, the fifty or so courageous women who remain at the center continue to dye, every day, under a scorching sun, the fabric that is so prized by West Africans. Blue, red, purple, green... Everything is allowed to give life to the white fabric used by a large part of the population, especially during baptism or wedding ceremonies, during which women, children, young people, old people, poor and rich people display their "Malian identity" through the bazin, explain the workers. For Hannah Larsson, who has studied textile dyeing in Mali and was quoted in a recent UN paper on bazin dyeing in Mali, the problem with the dyeing center is that the bazin industry is still informal, so the dyers are not eligible for government assistance despite their pleas for help.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, there is an alternative, according to the same paper, which states that women's entrepreneurial success usually depends on micro-loans from non-governmental organizations like Freedom from Hunger, based in the United States. Launched in 1989, the organization's "Saving for Change in Mali" program has so far benefited more than 350,000 Malian women, with total funding of about $7.5 million. According to Christopher Dunford, a researcher with this NGO, quoted in the same UN document, several women working in bazin production have benefited from this program, which offers affordable credit and savings services with flexible repayment terms.</div></div>

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We were approached by the regional hub of Dakar to accompany a Japanese company producing bazin, within the framework of its CSR policy, in the sensitization of women dyers on their health and the environment. However, as a lake we suggested that it would be appropriate to exchange according to a specific framework and a given methodology with groups of women dyers to better understand the challenges they face and see the relevance of such training.&nbsp;
