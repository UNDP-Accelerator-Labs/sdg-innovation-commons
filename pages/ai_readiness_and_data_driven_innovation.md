## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Unlocking AI for Humanity: Taping Into SDG Leverage Points and Navigating Risks at the Country Level.  

## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Over the past decade, employment growth in Morocco has only risen by a modest 2.5%, primarily fueled by male employment, while female employment has significantly declined. Despite a decrease in the proportion of youth employment relative to total employment, youth unemployment rates continue to rise, adding pressure on initiatives aimed at reducing unemployment. This trend contributes to an ever-rising brain drain especially in tech and others high value addition sector, with personal remittances reaching a record high of 8.3% of GDP in 2022, surpassing foreign
direct investments by a significant margin[1].
At the same time, the country AI readiness ranked 88th in December 2023[2] with vision, innovation, and human capital scoring as some of the lowest globally.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



There is an uptick in digital connectivity in Morocco that is consistent in time and space with the government's vision and efforts to reap the benefits of digital technologies for inclusive growth. The countryis going through its third stage, out of five, of the digital transformation journey according to UNDP’s Digital Development Compass. However, the country’s digital divide, compounded by widening inequalities, underscores disparities in digital access, savviness, infrastructure, and opportunities, calling for a rights-based, Inclusion-first approach to digital inclusion. Additionally, UNDP-UNCDF SDG-anchored Digital Finance Ecosystem country-wide assessment in 2022 points financial inclusion and digital innovation up as the two strategic areas with the highest priority to achieve national digital inclusion targets. 
AI Readiness and Governance :
There is a growing recognition by local partners that digital is not a panacea and that its transformational impacts lie

in designing reflexive policies and regulations that places vulnerable groups of people at the center and that account for new technologies’ emerging risks and challenges. One of the most pressing challenges facing the government today is unlocking AI innovation safely and bias-free as the country ranked 88th by Oxford’s AI Governance Index. This would mean addressing local data and research gaps in identifying critical drivers for the development and deployment of ethical and inclusive AI.​

Youth and Women In Tech :
With urban youth unemployment reaching a worrying level of 46.7 percent in 2022[1] and a female workforce participation as low as 21% —  one of the world’s lowest[2], tech skills bring in tremendous opportunities to curb unemployment and

underemployment connecting underprivileged young people and women with remote overseas learning and job opportunities where demand for coding and relevant tech skills are high. Due to historical chronical levels of brain drain and skills and demand mismatch, the local skills gap in emerging tech and AI is enormous, specifically for the most marginalized youth, including those from the poorest backgrounds, women and girls and youth with disabilities.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

The Global AI Index by Tortoise, the Government AI Readiness Index by Oxford Insights, and the Scimago Journal Ranking all have ranked state of AI in Morocco in a an early development stage with no vision and weak areassuch as lack of skills and an nonconductive innovation ecosystem.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Our Lab is designing workstreams on AI, data-driven innovations and Tech jobs for SDGs, based on a stakeholders-rich approach using collective intelligence methods and spearheading grassroots innovations and cocreation with the people

served. Leveraging knowledge-based partnerships and tapping into open-sourced innovation such as GitHub — Microsoft’s
world home of code. With this in mind, the Lab is aiming for an AI readiness assessment and at the same time experiments that would help provide exposure and opportunities to underprivileged youth and women. Whilst supporting a more conductive local digital innovation ecosystem and enabling alignment to the SDGs. Also, the learning portfolio hinges on the link, that is now stronger than ever, between innovation, technology and multilateral cooperation in order to achieve the SDGs. Particularly when it comes to AI Governance and evidence-based policies and development areas to promote more effective and ethical usage of AI technology in order to achieve the SDGs​.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Would the country much-needed AI regulations and policies impede an already nonconductive and stifled innovation ecosystem or would they provide it with a data privacy, ethics and inclusivity safety mattress that would help bounce it up ?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Enable a more conductive local digital innovation ecosystem. Equip youth and women with AI fluency and tech skills of the future.

Advice through research and thought leadership in AI readiness and governance. The country’s AI readiness assessment is conducted with evidence-based strategic advice and research-powered insights. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The global scores on AI readiness lack granualirity and local agency of the governement and key stakeholders from private sector, academia and CSOs. This also will be couped with experiments and indepth insights.

## Closing
