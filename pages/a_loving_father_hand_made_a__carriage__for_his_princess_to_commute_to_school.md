Kyrgyzstan News Attatyk reported a story of a father with disability living poor.  Amidst the pandemic crisis, it is not safe for children to commute to schools in public transportation. Worse, the family have been poverty-stricken, since the father lost his job after he got injured at the construction work place. 


Poverty with deteriorating health conditions doesn't stop this loving father from taking care of his children. Father, Maksatbek, used his innovative ideas and unconditional love to design and hand-made a special "carriage" for his 7-year-old daughter. Everyday he bikes with this carriage where his daughter sits inside with all necessary facilities equipped. Neighbors and passengers kindly call the girl "Princess", whenever they see this biking father with the carriage passing by. 


Kyrgyzstan AccLab would like to share this moving story to present the empowered family with innovation, despite poverty and all life difficulties. This grassroots invention ensures children's safety in the pandemic crisis. Moreover, it is an eco-friendly transportation tool that can be adopted by other families in poverty.
