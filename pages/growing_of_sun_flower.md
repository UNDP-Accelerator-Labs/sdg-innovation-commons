> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation of making feed in a simple way will reduce the cost of layering these livestock and maximize on the profits and the other hand the income will be created by growing this product on large scale and sell some to Companies who who use this product as a raw material for production of cooking oil.

> Technical Feasibility

For the start I'm planning to grow an hector of sun Flower and an hector of maize to start with for producing this self made feed this farming season. Then by July 2021 I'm planning to buy about 100 chicks to be fed using own made feed.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Looking at poultry layering there a number of people layering chickens and realise less profits this is due to high cost of feed which has made several to stop this business and make the chickens to cost at a higher price.  From this innovation several people will learn how to make this feed and i will start layering this chickens again and create the income for them selves.  On the other hand the production of this product will increase and some could be sold to companies.
