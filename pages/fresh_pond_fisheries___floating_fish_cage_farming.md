> Brief description of the innovation

Fresh Pond Fisheries is a registered aquaculture business whose vision is to develop a sustainable aquaculture investment that promotes fish farming as a business at a community level in Kafue District. 
Our aim is to support the emerging youth driven fish farming cooperatives in Kafue without necessary resources of land and water by providing them with an opportunity to access our investment infrastructure of fish cages to initiate their start-up of fish farming. Our target is to empower the disadvantaged groups that include the differently abled, female youths, etc.
Fresh Pond Fisheries will achieve this as it has secured a land with abundant water resources in its initial investment. The land is strategically located as an island having access to the Kafue river on one side and access to a stream on the other side, making it highly suitable for fish farming using floating cages.
Fresh Pond Fisheries model is therefore to invest in infrastructure of floating fish cages fabricated using locally available materials of polyethylene drums and light steel / bamboo. The drums will be used as floaters whilst the light steel or bamboo fabricated for the cage frame where netting is attached. These cages will be installed in our surrounding water resources and used to culture fish primarily Tilapia and Cat fish.
Fresh Pond Fisheries will provide access to this infrastructure to on-boarded fish farming cooperatives who will utilise it to initiate their start-up fish farming business at agreed profit sharing.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Fresh Pond Fisheries investment model will have two streams of income generation. The first been through its own cultivation and stocking of Tilapia and Cat fish for market and the second through its community inclusion model of fish farming cooperatives.
With the latter, Fresh Pond Fisheries aims to support emerging community fish farming cooperatives in Kafue without key resources of land, water and infrastructure required for a sustainable venture in fish farming. 
Fresh Pond Fisheries will therefore provide access to our fish cage infrastructure to on-boarded fish farming cooperatives who will utilise the resources to initiate their start-up fish farming business at an agreed profit sharing with Fresh Pond Fisheries. Fresh Pond Fisheries will only charge a minimal profit fee from the cooperatives as our aim is to empower them so that they can grow and be able to afford investment in their own resources.
Fresh Pond Fisheries will market and sell its fish to local traders at wholesale price. This will promote availability of fish supply on our local markets in Kafue and further support existing fish trading businesses. Through our supply, we shall provide increased opportunities for value addition. Traders will able to process our stock as dry fish and supply locally and surrounding markets.

> Technical Feasibility

Fresh Pond Fisheries business model incorporates key strategic objectives. 
1. Security of land use rights with abundant water resources. Fresh Pond Fisheries has bought and secured the land. The land is strategically located having access to the river on one side and access to a stream on the other side (inland). 
2. Investment in floating fish cages - as a cost effective measure, Fresh Pond Fisheries will use locally available materials to fabricate its fish cages. The materials been plastic drums, light galvanized steel and fish netting. As of September / October 2021, Fresh Pond Fisheries will have started fabrication of its first prototype fish cage in preparation of stocking fish as warm temperatures promote the growth of tilapia fish. 
The size of each of our prototype fish cages is 6mx6mx2m. Our initial start-up quantity is 5 cages of 6mx6mx2m.
3. Registration of fish farming cooperatives - Fresh Pond Fisheries has already signed fish farming cooperatives on-board targeting youths, women, and differently abled person's. We have 5 cooperatives on-board this far, who have an initial start-up stocking capacity of at least 1000 fingerlings each. 
By November all cooperatives should have stocked their fingelings inclusive of Fresh Pond Fisheries own stock of 3000 fingerlings as initial start-up using own injected financial capital.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Fresh Pond Fisheries model of incorporating emerging fish farming cooperatives in our investment structure will contribute towards creating employment, income generation and promote food security in our community.
For instance, each farming cooperative been incorporated has a minimum of 10 members and we target to on-board 10 cooperatives in our first year, i.e., 5 in the first semester (fish season) and 5 in the second semester. This translates to 100 beneficiaries in the first year. 
The advantage of using fish cages is that they stock a large quantity of fish per unit volume as compared to earthen or concrete ponds in addition to been cost effective. Use of fish cages therefore provides us an opportunity to empower as many cooperatives as possible provided adequate financing is available to fabricate fish cages as we have abundant water resources that can support our stock without impacting negatively on the environment. 
Utilization of floating fish cages is environmentally friendly as compared to excavation of earthen or concrete ponds. The continuous flow of water in floating fish cages enables clearance of fish excretion instantly and provides sufficient oxygen to the fish promoting healthy growth. 
Fresh Pond Fisheries investment model will support Governements and Non-Governement Organizations stakeholder efforts in the promotion of fish farming at a local level. Supporting fish farming cooperatives to start up fish farming business will not only contribute to income generation, employment creation and raising of food security but will also contribute to bridging the existing fish deficit gap in the Country. Zambia has an annual deficit of around 60,000 to 80,000 metric tons. 
Fresh Pond Fisheries will support local community production of fish as well as contribute to increasing the supply side at community level leading to access of affordable fish on the local market and establishment of fish trading businesses.
