Echoes of the Past: How Historical Narratives Can Help Drive Modern Progress

Echoes of the Past: How Historical Narratives Can Help Drive Modern Progress

By Victor Apollo and Dr. Winnifred Mwikali Since independence in 1963, Kenya has enough mileage in herself and can look back at the past and know that there are things she wishes she had done differently. As development practitioners, how can we learn from it all? The past can always teach us about the future. This applies to the political context too. Politicians often feel the need to be perfect. This impulse is understandable. Admitting to mistakes can result in being clobbered on television or social media. But in avoiding this, they might also be making a tactical error. Research shows that people rarely think less of each other when we reveal our mistakes and vulnerabilities. Politicians should be able to say, “We made a mistake. Here is what we learned from it and what we will do in the future."

A recent initiative(link is external) by the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Kenya sheds light on how historical perspectives, can offer invaluable insights into contemporary challenges, such as water scarcity. The initiative, focused on Tana River County, sought to address the pressing issue of water scarcity through a multidisciplinary approach. By engaging various stakeholders, including historians, the project aimed to develop a collaborative platform for decision-making(link is external). The History of Marginalization in Tana River County

Historically, water resources in African societies were often managed through complex institutional arrangements based on communal ownership and shared access. In the case of Tana River County, water was considered a common good, essential for the livelihoods of local communities. However, the colonial period marked a significant shift in the management of water resources, with infrastructure development primarily focused on regions favored by European settlers. This neglect of areas like Tana River County laid the groundwork for continued marginalization and exacerbation of water scarcity. For instance, the British colonial administration introduced several policies that significantly impacted the indigenous systems of water use and management in Tana River County. The construction of the Kenya-Uganda railway (1896-1901) was pivotal, with Nairobi becoming the capital and receiving substantial infrastructure investments, unlike the Coast region, which includes Tana River County. Colonial focus was on exploiting natural resources for economic gain, neglecting the needs and rights of the local communities. Tana River County, despite hosting Kenya's longest river, faced neglect in infrastructure development, including water systems. Colonial irrigation schemes, such as the Tana Irrigation and Settlement Scheme initiated in 1953, disrupted local ecosystems and communal lands, leading to loss of access to vital resources. Post-independence, the centralized government inherited and perpetuated colonial policies, focusing development efforts on already privileged regions. Development plans prioritized economic growth over equitable resource distribution, further marginalizing Tana River County. The construction of upstream hydropower dams in the 1960s onwards, such as the Masinga Dam (1981), altered the natural flooding patterns of the Tana River. These changes disrupted traditional agricultural practices dependent on seasonal floods, leading to decreased agricultural productivity and increased water scarcity downstream. Large-scale agricultural projects and land allocations to commercial enterprises, often without consulting local communities, exacerbated environmental degradation and water scarcity. These schemes prioritized economic gains over the livelihoods of local communities, leading to conflicts and further marginalization.

Despite efforts by the Tana River County government to formulate policies related to water source management water scarcity remains a significant issue, with many residents still lacking adequate access to water for domestic and economic use. Cyclic floods, droughts and insufficient infrastructure development continue to affect both human and livestock populations, leading to recurring crises.

History provides a deep understanding of the socio-political, economic, and cultural contexts of a region. This knowledge helps in designing interventions that are sensitive to the historical and current realities of the communities. Additionally, history reveals long-term trends and patterns that can help in anticipating future challenges and opportunities, leading to more strategic planning. Recognizing and respecting the historical experiences of communities can build trust and legitimacy which can then help foster stronger partnerships and community buy-in for development projects.By understanding the intricate connections between past policies, societal structures(link is external), and environmental impacts, we can better inform present-day decision-making and pave the way for a more sustainable future. About the authorsVictor Apollo is the Head of Solutions Mapping at the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Kenya. In this role, he is responsible for leading lab efforts in deep community immersion to explore, document, and increase understanding of emerging methods of tapping into bottom-up solutions related to sustainable development. Furthermore, he is tasked with designing specific field research and participatory methods to focus on the most vulnerable populations and those not usually engaged in public policy debates on development methods.Dr. Winnifred Mwikali is a Lecturer of History at Pwani University. Her research interest is Economic history, focusing mainly on the political economy of colonialism and post-colonial regime policies. She also has a keen interest in gender especially in the transformation of gender roles through time and space.The views expressed in this post are those of the authors and in no way reflect those of UNDP.
