> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The fashion industry is notoriously know to be one of the most unsustainable and highest polluting industries in the world. However, Mark One Apparel, a clothing manufacturing facility in Fiji, has taken big first steps in becoming a cleaner company by drastically lowering its carbon footprint since switching to solar power. The company is also able to save money since most of the power now comes from a renewable source, and are able to offer more competitive prices for their garments, as well as attract a whole new target market in customers who are environmentally conscious.
