> Title of the innovation

First and foremost, this innovation is agriculturally based, with a straight eye on improving the quality of Moringa Oleifera or Miracle Tree plantation and this will be done through effective scouting of suitable climates for the crop and fortunately,   the research mentioned above is a formality. Therefore, this innovation aims to make the Moringa tree plantation farming a more viable and improved farming venture all over Zambia. With the vast Knowledge about plantation requirements, procedures and not forgetting the vital know-how of growing the Moringa  crop, Moringa farming will surely be intensified under this innovation.     And of course not forgetting the most definite benefits of the Moringa tree plantations which include Job creations, health benefits and as well as social benefits such as the exportation of finished and packaged Moringa brands to the outer world. Surely, this is a possible milestone possible by being possibly and properly handled.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It’s been called “the Miracle Tree,”  “the Tree of Life” and “Mother’s Milk.” It is one of the most nutrient-dense plants on the planet, it is becoming increasingly important part of plans to combat malnutrition in the global South – while in the West it is fast gaining popularity as the new “superfood.”

So what is that’s so special about the moringa tree?  Moringa oleifera, also known as the drumstick tree or horseradish tree, is a fast-growing, drought-resistant tree native to the southern foothills of the Himalayas in northwestern India. It can reach a height of 10–12m, it has fragile branches, delicate, feathery leaves and long, three-sided seed pods which hang down in clusters. 

Moringa was used in perfume manufacture in ancient Egypt, classical Greece, and the Roman Empire. It has been prized for centuries for its nutritional and healing properties in Asia and Africa, where the young leaves, stalks and pods are eaten as a vegetable.

When grown from cuttings, the first harvest can be taken within six months of planting. Fruits often do not appear in the first year and for the first few years yields are generally low. By year two, a single tree can produce around 300 pods, by year 3 around 400-500. A good tree can yield 1000 or more pods.

The leaves and stems can be harvested from the young plants 60 days after seeding and then another seven times in the year.  Typical yields are six tonnes of fresh matter per hectare per year. Harvests vary sharply between the rainy and dry seasons, with around 1120 kg/ha per harvest and 690 kg/ha per harvest respectively.

Once cut, the leaves should not be exposed to direct sunlight so in some regions they are traditionally harvested in moonlight. The leaves are then washed in purified water and naturally shade-dried.

The anticipated social impact of this innovation as of employment wise, it will promote youth empowerment and as well as healthy living among Zambians as vividly centering and corncerntrating on the nutritional value of the Moringa leaves as it is a supernatural super food considered relevantly and it will surely help people make good use of the land and therefore as well contribute to afforestation of Zambia to help reduce global warming.

> Technical Feasibility

The technical feasibility of this innovation is purely 100% as any process involved in the farming of the Moringa Oleifera is simple and easy to go about. Only about 12 to 15 farm workers would be required to handle a two hecter land of the Moringa plantation. The germination process however is no problem for the Moringa seeds as at temperatures between 30 to 35 degrees Celsius the seeds are able to germinate thus this makes it more easy as the seeds can even be germinated indoors. The process process's feasibility is 100% as with the presence of companies like CAMCO, processing of raw Moringa in this innovation/project can as well utilize the available equipment for better sellings.
