Introduction

1.1 Background

The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) was first confirmed in Kenya

The pandemic has had a drastic impact on businesses and industries

in March 2020. Current evidence suggests that transmission

demand chains. The impact of COVID-19 on MSMEs in Kenya is

Thus, the undertaking to assess the impact of COVID-19 on MSMEs

would not only advise measures to support the resilience of MSMEs

but also explore the gaps that impact on the development and

adaptive capacity of the sector.

COVID-19 pandemic

Overview of MSMEs in Kenya

The classification of companies in Kenya is mainly determined by

the number of workers hired by businesses and their turnover.

The Micro and Small Enterprises Act (2012), defines:

• Micro enterprises as any company, exchange, service industry or

business operation, formal or informal, with an annual turnover

not exceeding KES 500,000 and 1-9 people employed (or rather

engaged). The total assets and financial investment or the

registered capital of the enterprise does not exceed KES 10 million

in the manufacturing sector and does not exceed KES 5 million the

service and farming sector.

• Small enterprises as those firms, trade, service, industry or

business activities that post an annual turnover of between KES

500, 000 and KES 5 million and have an employee list of 10 to 50.

In the manufacturing sector, investment in plant and machinery

should be between KES 10 million and KES 50 million and registered

capital of the enterprise between KES 5 million and KES 25 million

in the service and farming sector.

• Medium enterprises comprise of those employing between 50 to

99 and with a turnover of between KES 5 million and 800 million

(Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, 2016).

country.

2.2 Challenges faced in registration of MSMEs

Figure 1

illustrates challenges

faced by MSMEs

in registering their business with the respective

government authorities. Various reasons were offered

for non-registration such as inadequate awareness

on registration requirements, high cost of registration

exacerbated by the COVID-19 economic disruptions,

inadequate awareness of benefits of registration

and the processes involved in registration. The major

registration bottlenecks mentioned included lack of

familiarity with the registration processes as cited by

Gholgholo enterprises, a PWD led enterprise in Tana

River. A sole proprietor dealing with banana business in

Meru County mentioned unawareness of the benefits

of registration; A cycle repair entrepreneur in Siaya

County mentioned high cost of registration; According

to a dealer in auto paint and spares in Kirinyaga County,

the registration procedures were cumbersome while

the proprietor at Mama Gakii Banana Store in Meru

County had a negative attitude towards registration of

enterprises. Awareness raising and capacity building of

MSMEs on legal and structural responsibilities is critically

needed and will affect the ability and potential of MSMEs

to access information, networks, technical and financial

support that will bolster their businesses. Further, it is

important to highlight that ease of accessing information

is as critical as the availability and awareness of such

information. Facilitation is required for MSMEs to access

information and services that are both decentralized

and centralized.

•

•

There has been an increase in MSME establishment in the last 10 years

Only 56.4% of surveyed MSMEs had their businesses registered with Government authorities. Many

unregistered businesses expressed unfamiliarity with requirements and benefits for business

registration.

•

Three out every five MSMEs had women in employment with Micro-enterprises featuring the most

women in employment. Women were mostly employed in the Manufacturing and service sectors.

•

Despite 85.5% of MSMEs having youth in employment, only 22.9% of these had youth in leadership

positions. More support is needed for leadership development amongst youth and in the expansion of

opportunities for youth led businesses to take off and thrive.

•

Only 29.8% of MSMEs had PWDs in employment and 16.4% of MSMEs had PWDs in positions of leadership.

• Most Micro and small enterprises engaged within manufacturing, service, agriculture and infrastructure

sectors while Medium-sized enterprises engaged mostly within the infrastructure sector.

•

The proportion of enterprises with membership in associations increased with size of enterprise.

Enterprises in the manufacturing sector had the highest affiliation with associations.

• Membership to an association did not seem to cushion enterprises against the impact of COVID-19.

• Most enterprises (65.6%) of the MSMEs were Sole Proprietorships followed by Partnerships and Limited

Liability companies.

• Whereas Micro and Small enterprises were predominantly Sole Proprietorships, Medium-sized

enterprises were mainly Limited Liability Companies.

Impact of COVID-19
on MSMEs

3.1 Overall impact of COVID-19 on operations

Figure 11 illustrates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operations of

enterprises. An overwhelming 67.9% of enterprises reported that opera-

tions had severely reduced following the COVID-19 pandemic. 15% of MSMEs

reported slightly reduced operations, 13.4% enterprises had operations

totally halted citing issues such as closed markets, lockdown interrupting

commodity supply chain, reduction of staff and of working hours due to

cashflow bottlenecks among others. However, 3.6% enterprises reported

either normal or improved operations. These included those that dealt with

COVID-19 related businesses such as manufacture and distribution of pro-

by size of enterprises. The COVID19 pandemic had

greatest negative impact on Micro enterprises with 35.8%

reporting complete loss of income, 39.8% reporting

partial loss of income and 2.2% reporting substantial

loss of income. About 10.3% Small enterprises suffered

partial loss and 4.8% complete loss of income. The major

reasons were attributed to reduced access to customers

cash flows and other financial deficits. There were no

Figure 16 shows relationship between youth leadership

and impact of COVID-19 on operations. Although it

had been observed that 85.5 % of enterprises have

One out of every ten enterprises shut down their businesses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Enterprises in the manufacturing sector experienced most adverse impact of COVID-19 on operations

The negative impact on operations and on income was inversely proportional to the size of the

enterprises. Micro enterprises bore the burden of closure and complete loss of income. No medium-

sized enterprise was completely shut down.

The COVID-19 pandemic had greatest negative impact on micro enterprises with one in every 10

having complete loss of income.

Closure of schools early on in the pandemic also had a significant impact on MSMEs. Almost 10% of

the respondents interviewed expressed a challenge related to the closure of schools.

Enterprises in the Manufacturing sector experienced most adverse impact of COVID-19 on operations

and income and infrastructure least affected in both.

Enterprises reported varying degrees of reductions in operations. A majority of MSMEs reported

greatly reduced operations.

• Women and youth leadership did not translate into a reduction on negative impact on income in

Digital Transformation
among MSMEs

Following the crisis brought on by COVID-19 digital technology proved to be a critical lifeline for

many businesses and may continue to be so beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital technology

will likely be a critical accelerator and enabler of business recovery and continuity. However, the

aptitude and capacity for adoption digital technology in MSMEs is very varied. This survey looked

at factors that would enable and support engagement of MSMEs with digital technology as well as

factors that would limit or make it difficult for the same to happen.

5.3 Digital maturity of MSMEs

The Digital Maturity Assessment looked at four key driv-

ers of digital maturity, encompassing 7 endogenous

(“capabilities”) and 7 exogenous (“enablers”) parame-

ters. These were:

• Digital readiness: Overall comfort and trust in digital

technology; Digital for personal use; Digital for business

or financial use.

• Micro enablers: Type of device; Device ownership;

Level of digitization of business partners; Customer de-

mand for digital.

• Financial and business readiness: Level of trust with fi-

nancial services provider; Complexity of digital transac-

tion; Transaction independence; Business record keep-

ing and marketing.

• Macro-enablers: National or County digital readiness;

Cost of data; Access to internet.

Based on the endogenous and exogenous parameters,

the score ranged from zero to 14. This placed digital

maturity into four categories. We used four scales for

digital maturity segmentation of MSMEs from lowest to

highest maturity (NASCENT, EXPERMENTING, EMERG-

ING and ENABLED). Score of 0 - 3 were categorized as

NASCENT, 4 – 7 as Experimental, 8-11 as emerging and

12 -14 as digitally enabled. Low scores indicate low dig-

ital maturity.

SUMMARY FINDINGS

•

Digital technology was identified as an enabler for marketing interventions. The use of tools such

as social media, e-commerce platforms, and websites may support MSMEs to access wider markets.

This is an area to consider capacity building and investment in.

The majority of MSMEs are at the lowest level of digital maturity. MSMEs with higher digital maturity

had lower levels of negative impact on income.

Digital technology was needed for marketing products and services, development of products and

services, procurement, financial management and customer care.

For digital transformation, enterprises overwhelmingly needed skills development, technical and

that accrued from the pandemic and government

measures for the prevention and control that were

implemented. It further narrates actions that were

taken including any assistance that the firms either

received or did not as well as their vision for the

future. Six case studies are included for firms of

different sizes and managed by different gender.

Situation before COVID-19 pandemic

We are a women group composed of about 25 members

dealing with beauty and decoration products and ser-

vices. We were assisted by the Kenya Women Finance

Trust to establish our business and ever since, we help

ourselves. Before COVID-19 our business was doing very

well save for competition in beauty related businesses

like ours. We had many customers and our financial sta-

tus had improved very much.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

We have really suffered since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Customers have not been coming because some fear

COVID-19 and others do not have money. Whereas we

could previously get 20 or more customers in the sa-

lon a day, we now get very few or none. They seem to

give priority to basic needs. The financial turnover went

down by almost 75 %. What would bring KES 100 you

now get KES 25.

such as Facebook and WhatsApp. We therefore post our

products and attract some customers. This response

resulted in a moderate improvement of operations and

income.

Situation before COVID-19 pandemic

We have a hides and skins business stationed at Elwak in

Mandera county. Before the COVID19, our business was

booming. We received stock of hides and skins from as

far as Rhamu, Wargadud, Takaba, and Banisa and sold

them in Nairobi. Stocks were being received and sold

out as soon as possible such that there were hardly any

storage problems because of the balancing of stock-

in and stock-out. We were able to sustain families and

have surplus money. The financial turnover was very

good and we made huge profits.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

The COVID-19 restrictions significantly reduced busi-

ness. Suppliers were unable to reach our stores. We

also could not take any more stock because there was

shortage of storage space and the stock-at-hand could

not be sold-out. Our store has over 10 thousand unsold
