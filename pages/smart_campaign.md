> Brief description of the innovation

Our Vision is to create the most sustainable digital  and online platform that allows political parties and their supporters to freely and safely interact during future campaigns, elections and voting periods. The App was created with the aim to fill a gap between the political sector and the youth as well as age groups that are eligible to actively participate in national matters such exercising their constitutional right to vote . 
We believe that a platform such as Smart Campaign will work alongside the Government  and the political regulatory and monitoring bodies in reaching  both the national and  global goals of Development and Sustainability.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Smart Campaign  account will  be a free mobile and web application that is accessible to anyone with a smart phone or access to a computer. The use of the account requires the use of internet data at low costs to allow access for all users. 
The subscribers will be charged  monthly / annual fees or through a taxing system with the government  for using the platform for various features according to the target group as stated below. Bigger Organizations will be charged annual fees to sustain them and help them to plan for long term projects and activities.
 
 Our target group of subscribers  include the Political parties, supporters, the general public who are over 18 years and are eligible to vote and participate in related matters, political publications who would want to contribute valuable information for the general public, political community contributors who share blogs on related topics, as well as political studies institutions who will be given a platform to educate the youth and other groups who may not be well informed about political matters  and political know how of their country and the leadership, political mentors and coaches, media production organizations that will report current news about the political scene or televise any positive impact around politics. Forums and summits event organizers will be given an open platform to discuss various key matters around politics.
The platform serves with the values  of Smart Campaign  namely, SERVICE, EXCELLENCE, INNOVATION, EDUCATION, INTEGRITY, INCLUSIVE, RESPONSIBILITY  and TRANSPARENCY. 
Smart campaign is a platform whose aim is to create partnership opportunities and employment opportunities and empower the community.

We intend to run a social media campaign to create awareness of our platforms and how they can make a difference in the community.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently we have designed the Website  application, which we intend to develop into a mobile application for easy access and user friendly features for our mobile user subscribers.
Once our project receives access to funding or investment, we will list the Smart Campaign application on iStore  and Google Play stores for our subscribers to download our free App. The other option to access the app is via our website where they can register for free and open an account to access our services and educational products.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The social impact of our innovation will bring about a vast improvement in the tech industry, promote innovation and drive the need to build the required infrastructure to support the proposed solutions.  Among other sustainable development goals that our innovation will bring about is part of the UN SDG's number 16 ( promoting peace, justice and strong institutions in the nation) , and number 10 ( reducing inequalities in society ) and number 17 ( through Partnerships to achieve the goals ) . 
Our solution will also help eradicate educational poverty around politics for the youth, Increase  an interest to participate positively in politics and aspire for careers around political studies.
There will be a creation of employment  in the tech industry and other departments as our platform grows.
We intend to be interactive on social media platforms to engage with various groups and educate them about the positive impact of politics in a nation.
As a platform Co-founded by a Woman ,we are leading as an example of empowering women and gender equality in being a part of working towards attaining the Global Goals or the Sustainable Development Goals of the UN together within our communities and  build resilient economies.
