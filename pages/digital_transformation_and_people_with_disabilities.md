## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



Importance of Specialized Training: The digital skills training for visually impaired youth must be tailored to their specific needs, as their learning methods differ from those of sighted individuals. Standard online courses are often not suitable for them.

High Relevance of Digital Skills: In the current digital era, digital literacy is increasingly crucial for employability in various industries. For the visually impaired, these skills are even more essential as they enable access to global information and facilitate communication with sighted peers.

Lack of Accessible Training Opportunities: There is a significant gap in accessible and inclusive training opportunities for visually impaired youth in Thailand, which hinders their employment prospects and ability to compete in the job market.

Collaboration for Enhanced Impact: The partnership with organizations like the Thailand Association of the Blind (TAB) is crucial for developing an effective curriculum and advocacy, highlighting the importance of collaborative efforts in addressing this challenge.

Need for Inclusive Curriculum Development: The training curriculum must be inclusive and accessible to accommodate varying degrees of visual impairment, ensuring that all participants can benefit from the training effectively.

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



Updating the Curriculum with AI Integration: Enhancing the curriculum to include updated computer programs and AI technologies. This may involve developing new training modules or materials that specifically address the use of AI tools which can aid visually impaired individuals.

Training of Trainers: Developing a 'train-the-trainer' program to prepare new instructors in other regions of Thailand. This could involve training sessions for potential trainers, providing them with the necessary skills and knowledge to deliver the updated curriculum effectively.

Partnership Expansion: Collaborating with local organizations and institutions in other regions, similar to the partnership with the Thailand Association of the Blind (TAB) in Bangkok. This would help in adapting the program to regional specifics and ensuring local support.

## Data and Methods

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



Testing Effectiveness in a Controlled Environment: The pilot method allowed the project to test the effectiveness of the training curriculum and methodologies in a controlled environment. This approach was essential to validate the training's relevance and usability for visually impaired individuals before a broader rollout.

Gathering Targeted Feedback: Pilots are excellent for gathering specific feedback from a small, focused group. In this case, feedback from visually impaired participants helped understand how well the training met their unique needs and what adjustments were necessary for improved accessibility and learning outcomes.

Identifying Challenges and Barriers: By implementing a pilot program, the team could identify specific challenges and barriers faced by visually impaired individuals in accessing and benefiting from digital skills training. This understanding was critical in adapting the training to be more inclusive and effective.

Refining the Curriculum and Methods: The insights gained from the pilot phase enabled the team to refine the curriculum and teaching methods. This iterative process ensured that the training was tailored to the specific requirements and learning styles of visually impaired youth.

Building a Case for Scaling: Successful pilots provide evidence of a program's potential effectiveness and impact. This evidence was crucial for advocating for additional resources, support, and the scaling of the program to other regions and potentially to other types of disabilities.

Understanding System Dynamics: The pilot helped in understanding the broader system within which the challenge exists, including social attitudes towards disabilities, existing gaps in education and employment for visually impaired individuals, and the role of technology in bridging these gaps.

The partnership between UNDP Thailand and the Thailand Association of the Blind (TAB) focuses on enhancing digital skills training for youth with visual impairments. This collaboration aims to address the challenge of limited employment opportunities for persons with disabilities in Thailand, particularly those with visual impairments.

Key aspects of this partnership include:

Curriculum Development: TAB's expertise in understanding the needs and challenges faced by visually impaired individuals is instrumental in developing an inclusive and accessible training curriculum. Their insights ensure that the training is tailored to effectively impart digital skills to the participants.

Advocacy and Awareness: The partnership also involves efforts to raise awareness about the importance of digital literacy for visually impaired individuals. This includes advocating for more inclusive practices in the workplace and broader society.

Resource Sharing and Expertise: The collaboration likely involves sharing resources and expertise between UNDP Thailand and TAB. This could include sharing training materials, methodologies, and technical expertise.

Feedback and Improvement: TAB's involvement ensures continuous feedback from the visually impaired community, which is crucial for refining and improving the training program.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?



Innovation Methods: The use of innovative methods like sensemaking and proof of concept allowed for a deeper understanding of the unique needs and challenges faced by visually impaired individuals in learning digital skills. These methods facilitated the development of a more tailored and effective curriculum. By experimenting with different teaching techniques and technologies, including AI integration, the project could identify what works best in this specific context.

New Forms of Data: Utilizing both quantitative and qualitative data, including in-depth interviews and satisfaction surveys, provided a comprehensive view of the effectiveness of current training programs. This data helped in identifying gaps in existing programs and informed the development of a curriculum that is more inclusive and accessible. The feedback from these data sources was crucial in understanding the real-world impact of the training on the participants' skills and employability.
