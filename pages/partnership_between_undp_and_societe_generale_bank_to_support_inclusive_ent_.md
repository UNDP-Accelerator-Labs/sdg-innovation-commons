## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Partnership between UNDP and Societe Generale Bank to support inclusive entrepreneurship and innovation.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

1.    Our challenge is that many of Ghana’s talented youth have innovative ideas and solutions but are still unable to unlock economic opportunities.

2.    As our understanding of grassroots innovation has increased, we are now looking at understanding which models and structures best support the scaling of youth-based innovation and entrepreneurship in Ghana, create employment opportunities, and ensure that those often “left behind” such as women and PWDs find dignified and fulfilling employment.

3.    We recognize that UNDP cannot tackle this issue on its own, so we looked to form partnerships with Ghana’s private sector, while elevating voices of the youth, learning from them and providing support to improve their circumstances. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Despite significant commitments and investments made by African governments, the private sector, civil society and others to create employment opportunities for the youth (including support for networks of accelerators and innovation hubs), there are still significant challenges remaining. The increase in Africa’s youth population is not always positively correlated with the creation of employment opportunities. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Currently, Ghana’s youth constitute about 36% of its population, and the youth population continues to grow rapidly. According to the 2021 census, about 9.9 million Ghanaians are employed and 1.5 million are unemployed. More than two in five unemployed persons (45.5%) are available for work but not seeking employment, and youth (aged 15-35 years) constitute two-thirds (65.8%) of them. While Ghana’s overall unemployment rate is 13.4%, the unemployment rate for females is higher (15.5%) compared to males (11.6%) i.e. women seeking employment face even greater obstacles than men in their search for work. In Ghana, 35% of young women are not in employment, education or vocational training, compared to 20% of young men. The situation is even more challenging for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).

It has been estimated that about 74% of start-ups in Ghana fail (higher than the African average of about 50%), due to a variety of reasons such as a lack of  systems and pathways to support development and scaling of innovations.

Over the 3 years of the Accelerator Lab, we have been working with grassroots innovators, and have noted the paucity of support systems and pathways which focus on supporting development and scaling of innovations. This situation calls for rapid action, including by developing models and structures to support youth-based innovation and entrepreneurship, and building the capacity of Africa’s youth to develop innovative solutions which create employment opportunities for all.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab “model” (using short learning cycles to explore and identify potential solutions to development challenges, then experiment, and scale them up as appropriate) has attracted interest from Ghana’s private sector, particularly the ability to generate portfolios of mutually reinforcing solutions to tackle complex development challenges from multiple angles. The Ghana Accelerator Lab was approached by Societe Generale Ghana (subsidiary of Societe Generale, the French multi-national bank) to form a partnership to help selected grassroots innovators to scale up. This partnership was formed through the UNDP Ghana Country Office.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

In 2022, powered by the AccLab, UNDP and Societe Generale Ghana PLC (SG Ghana) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to develop an inclusive entrepreneurship partnership.

This partnership aims to encourage and support innovators, especially small businesses led by youth, women, and persons with disabilities (PWDs) to scale up their innovations towards sustainable development. UNDP through the Accelerator Lab, and SG Ghana through its Innov8 Hub and the SG Home of Business, are running the partnership.
