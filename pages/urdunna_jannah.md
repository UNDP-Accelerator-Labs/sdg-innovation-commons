## National Tourism Support Program

Urdunna Jannah is a national initiative launched by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities to promote domestic tourism across Jordan. The program offers over 50% financial support on a wide range of tourism experiences and destinations, making travel more accessible for Jordanian families. Through the platform, users can explore curated experiences tailored for all age groups, learn more about each destination or activity, and easily book their trip through one of the program’s certified travel agencies. The aim is to encourage local tourism, support the sector, and allow Jordanians to rediscover the beauty of their country.
