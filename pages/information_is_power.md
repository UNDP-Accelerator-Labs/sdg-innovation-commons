## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Information is power: empowering citizens to protect water through actionable information".
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that information around the different dimensions of water in El Salvador is hard to access and eminently technical. This creates and entry barrier for people to understand its complexities and engage in action.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

During and after our first learning cycle around water access, quality and livelihoods, we came to understand that water is a complex issue that generates a vast amount of information and learning paths, which most of the time, gravitates in more technical, political or institutional spheres of knowledge that rarely permeate to the general public. Actors involved are political, environmental government agencies, NGOs, development agencies, civil society organizations, academia, that generate knowledge products and critical information that, according to our hypothesis, could motivate communities to take action if they were not only able to easily access it, but also understand it to take and demand action accordingly. Undesired effects range from lack of basic understanding of general information for example, on how the water cycle works, to misinformation to oversimplification of water related issues.

Official data sources: 2020 Rivers water quality report - El Salvador https://cidoc.marn.gob.sv/por-categoria/?cat=recurso-hidrico The results of the CCME-WQI Index, for this year, show that 71.3% of the evaluated sites present a “bad” water quality, which restricts the development of aquatic life; 21.3% of the sites have “regular” water quality, which limits the development of aquatic life; and 7.4% of the sites have a "poor" water quality, which makes it impossible to the development of aquatic life. Sistema de Información Hídrica (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales de El Salvador) http://srt.snet.gob.sv/sihi/public/ SIHI is a computer system for the management, analysis and consultation of water information, in support of decision-making in the management and planning processes of water resources in El Salvador. This platform has been designed and developed by personnel from the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources with the collaboration of the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) through the Cooperation Fund for Water and Sanitation (FCAS) La situación del agua en El Salvador/ Agua para el desarrollo sostenible  report El Salvador is considered by organizations like FLACSO, as a country "on the brink of water stress". According to analysis carried out by the FAO in El Salvador, the level of water stress (WS) or sweet water extraction vs. Available resources is around 10% and 25%. Which is considered a low WS, on average. However, regions like Cara Sucia-San Pedro and the Jaltepeque estuary have medium WS levels and others such as the Rio Grande de Sonsonate-Banderas, Goascorán and some areas of the Lempa river have high WS levels. (UNDP, 2020).

The topic of water has also gained prominence on the public agenda. The president of El Salvador has designated a water commissioner to guide the country water agenda, and has hinted that a water law will pass under the new Legislative Assembly in 2021, vetoing a proposal brought by the current legislature. Also, the attention drawn by Surf City, one of this administration’s signature project aimed to transforming the coast of La Libertad into an economic growth pole based on surfing tourism puts the finger on water challenges faced by local population, that could be critical to leverage the project’s potential. According to Google Trends, water related topics searches are reaching an all-time high in El Salvador, being the main concerns expressed in lookups: privatization, potabilization and preservation. (https://trends.google.es/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=SV&q=%2Fm%2F0838f). An informal survey conducted by the Lab in late march 2021, showed that people are concerned about water quality in El Salvador; in general, the resource is often perceived as dirty or not suitable for human use; this notion is reinforced in touristic coastal areas, where existing plastic waste and contamination results in wider consumption of bottled water by visitors

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We think this as a very relevant opportunity to synthesize complex information, often missed, coming from many sources, and design formats to increase awareness importance and relevance of water to the general public. The Lab's nature of cooperation allow us to touch base with different stakeholders without limitations of UNDP projects. Empowering society with relevant and trustworthy information it's a necessity in a world with fake news and unchecked sources of information.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Action changes things. We´re learning on how accessible and easy to understand information about water and its challenges, can lead citizens to take action and influence behavior, public policy and culture.

The Presidential Water Commision is working closely with UNDP in identifying needs regarding the development and implementation of the water agenda. They are working with UNDP/The Lab in defining the geographic scope of our Frontier Challenge and some priority issues. Any collaborations between our offices will be supported by the WC and publicized widely. It´ is the first time a Water Commision is appointed by government, in that sense it´ is considered an unusual partnership.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can opportune and useful information on water change perceptions and behaviors, and drive change through participatory action? what makes decision makers tick and reach agreements to create better policies around water access, quality and preservation?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation We´ll execute cocreation workhops both with UNDP portfolios and strategic partners for signal mapping, sensemaking design, validation and prototyping processes. Collective Intelligence We´ve planned learning spaces on the environmental and social imbalances aspects around water involving a diverse group of stakeholders and decision makers, tapping also on unusual sources information such as sales figures of bottled water in coastal areas, unexplored open data from public institutions and microfinancing sector. Also, we´re exploring the development and prototyping of a Community Readiness Index to help determine a community´s potential of assimilating a new concept, idea or solution. This will shed light on the decision making process of testing and growing solutions in a particular context, not only over water issues, but also other complex development challenges. Data Visualisation The application of data visualization methods will produce dynamic geospatial data map on georeferenced water quality measurements and community profiles in the coastal area of La Libertad, which could serve as a model on how to visualize correlations between otherwise disconnected environmental, social and demographic variables. Solutions Mapping The Open Innovation for Water Challenge will be the first event of its kind in El Salvador inspired by the methodology of the UNDP Acceleration Laboratories, prioritizing user-led design over co-creation and designer-led design. The objective of the challenge is to test grassroots solutions to be scaled up in El Salvador, as well as innovative business models that focus on SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. The first phase (prior to launching the challenge) coincides with the Solution Mapping methodology of the Acceleration Laboratories. In this phase, two main activities will be carried out. (1) The Mapping of Solutions in situ, where visits will be carried out to coastal communities of El Salvador (to be defined) to identify the solutions that the inhabitants give to the problems related to access, quality and water management in their communities and (2) A curation of solutions documented in sustainability repositories such as Appropedia, The Honey Bee Network, among others. The results of this phase will be systematized and presented to the public as inputs for participation in the innovation challenge.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Sharable and Accesible Data. Current water related information tend to be addressed to researchers, academia and institutions. We are designing a diverse and cultural data structures. Understanding and sharing the complex perspectives of water in El Salvador helps not only in identifying and testing context-based solutions but also raising awareness and foster action.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Dissemination of validated appropriate solutions through government entities, development organizations and NGOs. Results from the AH2Ora o Nunca Open Innovation Challenge will be documented and made available through Appropedia, and disseminated in digital and print formats. New sustainable water-focused business opportunities identified and presented to private sector investors. Results from the experiments around learning pathways related to water will be shared with the Presidential Water Commissioner, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and other government stakeholders. Additionally, they will contribute to the NDC consultations supported by the CO, for the upcoming COP in the fall of 2021.
