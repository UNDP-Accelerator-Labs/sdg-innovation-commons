> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The invention's goal is to create and commercialize a solar-powered beeswax heater and hot water receiver in one combined device. Beeswax can be melted with water, steam, or in a heating chamber, which are all expensive and environmentally harmful technologies that produce low-quality wax. 
Solar melted wax is of high quality, partially sterile due to exposure to ultraviolet and infrared rays of the sun. Solar energy allows for year-round access to hot water, regardless of the ambient temperature on sunny days.
Our solar-powered device operates in hot water mode all year long - on sunny days - whereas wax melting is primarily seasonal - spring, summer, and autumn. The load of the device for wax melting is determined by the size of the beehive. The process of melting the wax and heating the water does not interfere with each other, but when the melting of the wax is finished, the efficiency of the water heater increases. Therefore, hot water can be used for different purposes.
The presented equipment saves 350-400 GEL annually for a beehive consisting of 100 bee families, taking into account all components.
There are at least 14,074 beekeepers in Georgia, and at least 5,000 of them will use the above. The received economic benefit is impressive and amounts to 1,750,000 GEL.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

The invention's efficiency is defined by one axiom: it literally does not use any energy to melt the wax and produce hot water. The amount of melted wax and hot water received is solely determined by the device's size. It should be mentioned that if we regulate the temperature with additional small energy, we can create a device that can for instance heat the building and dry fruits
