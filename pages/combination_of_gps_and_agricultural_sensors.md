> Description of the solution

This technology involves sensors, GPS, big data, and IoT. Integration of these enables better management including precision fertilization and water control, and environment adaptive strategies. Future trends focus on the development of agricultural IoT and AI assisted decision making.

> Type of the Solution

- variablerate_applications

> Subcategory

- fertilizers/ lime

> Who led the solution

- professional organization

> Timeline for implementation

- short term (up to 1 year)

> Lifespan of the solution

- long term (5 and above)

> Additional notes

This technology has been conducted in several provinces in China, such as in Shandong for wheat "one spray three defenses", in Hainan for corn "fall armyworm" prevention and control, and in Heilongjiang for rice pest control. However, it is also applicable globally., This paper doesn't clearly mention which organization specifically conducted this project.
However, the combination of sensor and GPS technologies in precision agriculture is a comprehensive project, it involves many professionals in various fields, so it more likely to be a professional organization.
