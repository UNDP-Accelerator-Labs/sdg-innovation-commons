## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Shamar Ward 

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

14/07/23

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Blue Economy portfolio/work. 

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Digital transformation and formalization of the Blue Economy. 

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

What is the best way to digitally transform fisherfolk operations for enhanced sales, productivity and data-informed policy decisions?



> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Barbados National Union of Fisherfolk Organizations
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

This experiment seeks to learn whether a phone based fisher logging app can sync with a vessel mounted monitoring device to establish batch traceability of artisanal and pelagic fish species in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean region.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

There are three (3) hypothesis: 1.  If catch activity is logged by date, a vessel location system can provide accurate batch traceability. 2.  If batch traceability (fish journeys) are communicated effectively, public consumers will report elevated sustainability awareness 3.  If vessels have image recognition technology, it can be used in combination with VMS technology to establish stronger batch traceability.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment
- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

BlueFish app prompts FISHERS to log batches caught daily PDS location data is imported and cleaned into BlueFISH App Custom analytics displays vessel activity locations for cross reference with FISHER entries.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Downloads, usage, sales completed on the platform. 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

App-based

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

This experiment will require training of participating volunteer fisherfolk, as well as about 3 months working time from the team.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Disproven - update/use of BD was limited. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Yes- this experiment would likely have worked better if designed from bottom up with greater input from the beneficiaries. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Approximately 1.5 years. 

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Approximately 35K USD. 

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, This experiment is the base for incorporating a traceability function into the BlueFish app.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes. If batch traceability can be achieved, it will be refined and scaled to the Barbados fisher communities and stakeholders, and then the remainder of the Eastern Caribbean countries within the MCO.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

TBD

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We learned that fisherfolk require support in financial management and overall require enhanced digital literacy in order to properly participate in an experiment like tihs. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Low digital literacy among participants. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Anyone trying to formalize/digitize persons/actors in the fisheries/blue space. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Actors involved in fisheries/Blue Economy due to growing interest in formalization and digital transformation. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes- we applied several iterations. For instance, we removed focus on image recognition from the system as it was not gaining traction. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Ensure that you speak with the end users first and that their interests are represented in the initial design stages. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes- so long as the area includes some kind of marketplace or vending process. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The sense and explore phases were present but we likely needed to invest more time and energy into those phases to truly understand the audience.

> What surprised you?

Fisherfolk interest in financial formalization, access and inclusion.
