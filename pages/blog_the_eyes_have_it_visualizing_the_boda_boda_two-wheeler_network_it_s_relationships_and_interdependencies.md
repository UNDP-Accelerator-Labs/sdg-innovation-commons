Background

Kenya’s economy is characterized by a formal sector

that is experiencing an environment of shrinking

employment opportunities and an informal sector that

is increasingly expanding and absorbing entrants from
schools and training institutions to the labor market2.
The failure of the formal sector to generate sufficient

wage employment to accommodate all entrants to the

labor force has led to many young people starting their

own businesses or seeking employment in the informal

sector. Today, informality is more than ever a complex
system. It is so large3, ramified, and intertwined that its
organic structure seems like a tangle of activities. Day

by day informal sector members contribute to keeping

these structures alive with their actions, behaviors,

and thoughts. Given that we all rely on their daily
practices, the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Kenya4 hopes
to untangle the network of the informal sector’s daily

practices through the concept of affinity and the ways

to visually represent it. The attempt is to represent the
informal sector dynamics to foster new synergies. How
do we design for “ecosystems” of things and agents

that are interacting in a networked fashion, adapting
and evolving; what we call complex adaptive systems?
Designing interventions for such complex adaptive

systems requires a holistic approach to design that

goes far beyond just things and end-users but takes a

holistic perspective to deal better with whole networks

of interacting elements that evolve. To build a shared

vision of the informal sector, there is need to apply the

approach of systems thinking to help reveal how we

have created what we currently have as the informal

sector. The concept of affinity maps can thus help us

understand and analyze the informal sector as a social
network. The first of these maps covers the boda-boda

sector.

The boda-boda
sector provides
one million direct
jobs for riders earning
Sh1 billion daily

Context
In his Op-Ed5 titled the urgency of boda-boda reforms,
the Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiangi estimates
the number of boda-boda operators to be 2.4 million. A
study of the sector by Car & General (C&G) – which sells
motorcycles, their spare parts, and other automotive and
engineering products - shows that the boda-boda sector
provides one million direct jobs for riders earning Sh1
billion daily. This underlines the importance of the sector to
Kenya’s economy. The boda-boda sector can be described
as a demand responsive, unscheduled and flexible public
transportation system that fills a market need, especially
in peripheral areas6. The sector’s existence is motivated
by several factors: From the rider’s perspective: even
though it is informal employment, the income earned
can be more than a minimum wage offering an important
source of income and poverty alleviation to a segment
of the population that often finds itself superfluous to
the formal economy. Additionally, the growth of informal
transportation is ascribed to high unemployment, ease of
entry and the promise of immediate financial gain. These
factors often attract new urban immigrants to this activity
in the absence of better alternatives to earn a livelihood.
From the user’s perspective, informal transport can be
ubiquitous, convenient, affordable, especially for low-
income populations, and practical given the absence or
inefficiency of last mile connectivity to public transport
stops and terminals. Evans et al.’s research7 in Kampala
shows that the city’s boda-boda drivers serve as time-space
compressors who provide improved mobility and income
opportunities, weaving the city and the lives of its residents
together. This resonates with studies in Bangkok, where
motorcycle taxi drivers operate between four to six million
trips per day and keep the city moving during massive
traffic jams8. Informal transportation is thus seen as crucial
to access jobs, goods and services.

Methodology
Like complex systems, the idea of regulating the boda-
boda sector calls for looking at the sector from a holistic
view and the relationship between the parts instead of
just focusing on individual parts. We have attempted to do
this through a Social Network Analysis (SNA). The aim of
social network analysis is to understand a community by
mapping the relationships that connect them as a network,
and then trying to draw out key individuals, groups within
the network (‘components’), and/or associations between
the individuals. While the research conducted for SNA is
interested in individuals, the analysis itself focuses on
connectivity: how individuals collaborate.

The Eyes Have It: Visualizing the Boda-Boda (Two-Wheeler) Network, (It’s Relationships and Interdependencies)
In this case, we designed the approach to aid us in the
analysis and understanding of the boda-boda network.

We sought to get answers to the following questions:
1. What organizations are formally or informally
connected to the boda-boda ecosystem?

2. In what ways do these organizations contribute to

the ecosystem?

Methodologically, we adopted the snowball approach by
interviewing a core group of 35 (1F:34M) boda-boda network
members in Nairobi and Tana River Counties representing
their different stages/stops as group officials and collected
data on their connections. Several waves of interviews
were conducted with the actors mentioned during the first
wave, until the same names started to appear again and
again, meaning that the boundaries of the network had
been reached.
Then, we reached out to the new connections and collected
data on their connections as well. Worth noting is that we do
not have a complete understanding of the network as we
did not interview all the mentioned connections. In addition
to individual interviews, group discussions were conducted
with a group of young boda boda operators. This method
allowed us to capture collective, group-specific orientations
of group members. It thus supplemented the narrative
interviews.
Sampling a population in which the connections between
actors are unknown is not pertinent as, by randomly selecting
some of the actors, many relevant connections would be
ignored. To address this issue, snow-balling techniques
are used as an alternative that allow identifying new
economic agents from among the subjects’ existing
acquaintances9. Snowball sampling does not presume that
the network is consciously experienced by the actors or
that the investigator can impose preconceived boundaries.

It is particularly adapted to the study of actors such as
informal traders, who do not necessarily belong to a formal
professional institution in which insiders could easily be
distinguished from outsiders, and whose number and
activities are difficult to evaluate from the investigator’s
perspective10. A snowballing survey will typically start with
identifying a first wave of interviewees, who will be asked to
name people they are related to in particular ways (family,
friends, neighbor, colleagues, organization member),
people they can trust or rely on, or people the feel close
to11. A few related attribute data, such as age, gender, or
education, can be collected simultaneously.
At the end of it, this technique helped us generate a system
map in the form of a rich picture visualization to show the
relationships between individuals that are contained in the
data collected.

The eyes have it - visualizing complexity
The boda-boda sector epitomizes a complex network.
Visualizing networks can help us navigate complexity.
Network mapping lets us quickly find patterns and deeper
meaning. Thus, we sought to create a structured visualization
to allow many people to visualize, comprehend and interact
with the complexity that is the boda-boda sector. To achieve
this, we adopted a system map to visually represent the
main constituents of the boda-boda system and enable
systematic, deep and broad exploration of challenges and
opportunities in the boda-boda sector. Our system map
illustrates the various stakeholders involved in the boda-
boda ecosystem, helping us understand who is involved
and how these people and organizations are connected,
their relationships and interdependencies. Additionally, we
have illustrated the network of value exchanges between
stakeholders to help us understand the flow of values such
as money, goods, services, information or trust.

operators to be 2.4 million

visualizations that are often based on systems thinking.
This includes a huge variety of constituents such as
people, stakeholders, processes, structures, services,
physical products, digital products, channels, platforms,
places, pathways, and more. A visualization of a system
usually takes a specific perspective at a specific moment
in time. By visualizing all the main components of a
system, the interplay between these can be analyzed
and designed. Complex problems become more
comprehensible when they are visualized, which is
particularly useful for wicked design problems. System
maps can be used to map out not only existing (“current-
state”) systems, but also various scenarios of future
(“future-state”) systems to understand the impact of
decisions, new components, or changed relationships.
A system map can be used to find or predict intended
or unintended benefits as well as disadvantages in the
system.

Findings
In the first wave, we identified key nominals to begin the
process with by selecting thirty-five persons who were
officials representing their boda boda stages/stops in
Kangemi (Nairobi County) and Hola (Tana River County).
Each boda boda stage/stop had an average of 10-15
members. Out of the thirty-five interviewees, one member
was a female operator while thirty-four were male. Three
of the thirty-five operators were riders operating not only
at their stops but also ride-hailing motorbikes. Twenty-
five interviewees were below the age of 35 and five
were married. Interviewees were asked to describe in
the last six months who they had communicated with,
learnt from and how often this person had provided
them with information they had used to do their work,
who they had collaborated with and how often they had
worked together and who they had sought out while
indicating the primary benefit they had received from
their membership in the network.

1. Authorities could consider adapting safety
practices from the ride hailing platforms like Uber
and digital lenders like Watu Credit to address gaps

in urban transportation networks. Studies have been

undertaken that demonstrate the positive effects

on boda-boda operator behavior from deploying

digital monitoring devices. Local authorities can

work in partnership with existing and new start-ups

to provide new and better mobility options, while

continuing efforts on formalization and regulation

of informal services.

2. Money lenders can utilize new kinds of data
available through digital transactions to profile the

social and economic background of the boda-boda

borrowers. Banks and micro-financial institutions

(MFIs) may, thus, practice cash flow-based lending

by mapping beneficiaries with digital platforms and

building fintech-enabled credit-scoring systems to

ensure and scale new models of financing. They

could combine the voluminous data points gleaned

from riders’’ wallets, payments, locations, and trips

to build their own credit scores.

weak enforcement of the regulations, owners who

buy the two wheeled motorcycle taxis also need

to be involved in the discussions around regulation

and the government needs to devise a mechanism
to engage them and other unusual partners.
4. From the system map, it is apparent that the effects
of regulation are wide and deep for the ecosystem
with knock-on effects not just on the operators but

on the entire boda-boda ecosystem. Authorities

could approach market participants to help create

regulatory sandboxes where new approaches to

regulation can be tested.

5. Listen to Voices Unheard: Policymakers need to
envision and build participatory scenarios with

all stakeholders by streamlining communication

channels between regulators and boda-boda

ecosystem players to create an appealing vision

of the informal transport system. A leverage point

identification activity with all stakeholders identified

through the system map can help identify where
the places the network might focus its efforts to

shift the system, what actions could most make a

difference and where has some new opportunity

opened that could make change easier and more

likely.

6. There is need to better collect, make use of and
embed boda-boda operators’ insights to develop
policy to stem the weak and biased enforcement

of policies and regulations. Through this, actions

are enabled in which the various potentials and

knowledge of riders can complement state policies,

that are geared towards increasing the common

good for all citizens and the environments in which

they live.

9

The Eyes Have It: Visualizing the Boda-Boda (Two-Wheeler) Network, (It’s Relationships and Interdependencies)
7. The question of what is going on here and how we

got here is key. The emergence of motorcycle taxis

as a mode of transport is a bottom-up response to

the larger problem of mobility demands that are

not sufficiently met by public services. The nature

of urban mobility developments over the years,

which is largely car centric, promotes informality.

Mobility is an intrinsic need yet most urban and

rural dwellers in Kenya cannot afford a car, hence

they must find other means to move. This calls
for identifying ways to shape urban mobility
development and engaging built environment and
urban design practitioners to reduce informality.

8. The system map indicates that regulation alone is

not a silver bullet to the challenges dogging the
sector. Consequently, there is need to design a
portfolio of solutions that takes into consideration
operators’ working conditions such as hazardous

conditions, social security and protection, long

hours, high threat of robbery, road safety, poor

mental health, poor physical health (pollution,

hearing loss, back pain), low wages/earnings; high

daily expenses (fuel, co-op fees, boda-boda rent,

phone credits).

Conclusion
Social Network Analysis and ecosystem

mapping provide useful approaches for

helping us see the interrelationships within

complex systems such as

informality.

Through both approaches, we can get a

sense of how the minute parts fit into the

big picture and opportunities for process

innovation that have not yet been addressed

on either the downstream or upstream side.

To be effective in regulating the boda-boda

sector, we need to take a step backward,

observe

thoroughly and

intervene only

after having made sense of the big picture

and determined the leverage point where

authorities can focus their efforts about

regulation.
