> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can we create an appetite for the private sector to adopt climate-resilient input? where can we influence business practice at scale towards more sustainable supply chain? 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If an appetite was found or created for climate resilient crop input in the supply chain of high trade products, then this could open an opportunity at scale for small farmers to harvest that benefit and economically justify shifting to climate resilient crops. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

test appetite of private sector to invest in climate resilient product innovation by: - scouting and selecting a company that works in high trade products and has R&D function - approach collaboration on a certain product mix - push for an R&D cycle on new resilient product by the company - test sustainability model

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

product pilot

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

secondary and primary research

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

4 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 1

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

time allocation from the team and partner.  use of R&D facility of the partner
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

partially. we proven appetite of private sector to start integrating climate resilient input in the supply chain, but still testing sustainable incentives model. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We had difficulty with ownership which affected the sustainability of the solution. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 months for initial hypothesis. One year (ongoing) to test sustainable model

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

in sourcing raw material for the R&D pilot (quinoa flour for a new quinoa integrated pasta as an example of climate resilient products)

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. We are supporting the organization in initiating a sustainability strategy around a climate-resilient supply chain, as a more sustainable approach to the solution beyond single product innovation. This is intended to integrate sustainable practices that take into consideration business risks and opportunities and engage relevant stakeholders and key partners that are critical to bringing about change. With this pilot strategy, we hope to inspire other key players in the ecosystem to join climate adaptation action to support the livelihoods of millions of people engaged in agriculture and the food system and to put the agenda 2030 at the very heart of all processes.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Tentative plan is to hand over to inclusive growth and policy team as part of their work on impact investment and INFF. And from the portfolio build a new offering on transformation of agri-food system (production-market-consumption).
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1.     A clear finding from our research is that risks and costs are set to rise for food and for the agricultural sector as a whole, making it imperative for business to adopt sustainable practices. In this sense the needs and concerns of business can potentially drive positive socio-environmental outcomes while responding to consumer trends and business risks. 2.     Partnerships are key. The private sector cannot bring about such transformation by itself. One way of supporting an increase in demand would be to establish a new regulatory environment. At present, getting a new and more sustainable food product formula to market would entail a long process of authorization incommensurate with the urgency of climate change. A more agile regulatory system could thus be a major accelerator of innovation for sustainability. Food policies and regulations must also start adopting a more flexible framework to support food systems to adapt and evolve. 3.     Approaching sustainability practices in product differentiation is internally a multi-stakeholder conversation. It speaks to innovation, operations, commercial opportunity/conflict etc.   Aligned with the core business, moving ownership of climate resilience to the private sector would push a bold new ambition of systemizing sustainability action within the food sector.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Initially the experiment was treated as an ad-hoc R&D stunt or a CSR project not a potential sustainable solution and we had to navigate the use of language the follow up activities to change that.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

 inclusive growth and policy team as part of their work on impact investment and INFF

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Food regulatory authorities to design more agile policies to accelerate innovation for sustainability.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes one iteration, where we shifted from a product innovation approach to integrated sustainability strategy with our food company partner

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

to have a better incentive model from the beginning and test with more than one company in parallel

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes it can be in other sector beyond food, integrating climate resilient input into any supply chain.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

the experiment relied heavily on sensing and needed more in depth data. 

> What surprised you?

Speed of initial uptake by the partner
