> Description

"Chacha Entrepreneurs" ("Chacha" means man in aymara language) s an innovative development program for indigenous young men, aimed at promoting new masculinities and socio-emotional skills. The project is grounded in reducing violence, expanding access to opportunities, and fostering equity, with a proactive focus on engaging men from the community. It provides them with opportunities to connect with prominent figures in the Bolivian business sector and alumni of prestigious scholarships from the Spanish and U.S. embassies. Besides, it focuses on new masculinities, featuring discussions with leaders from diverse organizations and individuals representing various social and sexual identities. These experiences have been highly enriching for participants.


The program also offers mentorships to help men develop a business pitch, conduct market research, and access seed funding. By the end of the program, the indigenous young men involved gain greater awareness of their surroundings and explore a renewed vision of masculinity that emphasizes peace over conflict. They are creating solutions adaptable to markets, capable of launching triple-impact enterprises that also reclaim their indigenous identity. In doing so, they reshape the concept of 'chacha' or man within their communities, moving away from associations with violence.
