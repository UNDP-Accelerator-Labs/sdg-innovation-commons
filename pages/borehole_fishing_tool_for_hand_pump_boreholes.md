> Brief description of the innovation

It's the tool that I use to fish out pipes, rods and cylinder pump for hand pump boreholes whenever their are dropped down, have manage to use it to fish out pipes at some schools and community boreholes in the District of Mufumbwe.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

1. Whenever I receive those case of pipes drops down, I charge the clients the minimum amount which there can afford.
2. When all those boreholes which the pipes dropped down, for them to start functioning well there will be need of buying new borehole parts that will make the supply of 
borehole spare parts will be on demand.
3. Households and schools will continue using the existing boreholes instead of digging shallow wells that  may cause waterborne diseases to children.

> Technical Feasibility

1. The borehole fishing tool is designed by measuring the radius of the borehole types and weld the suitable funnel then weld the rod with female threads together and the same method using the pipe with a socket and other one with male threads.
2. Depending of the cases arising but weekly works very well .

> Anticipated Social Impact

1. According to the areas where have managed to use these tool,schools and community have continued having clean and safe water, when areas with the dropped down borehole pipes are helped it helps them to reduce the covering long distance and avoid them from using or drinking contaminated water which can led to waterborne diseases.
2. It will increase demand of borehole spare parts from sellers,also increase access to clean and safe water.
