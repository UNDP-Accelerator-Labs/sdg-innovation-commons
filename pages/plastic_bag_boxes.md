Solution: Plastic Bag Boxes

On one of my walks on Woodbine beach broadwalk, I noticed several wooden boxes attached to Lamp posts, where people can deposit empty plastic bags as well as pick plastic bags to pick up trash.

Each box is hand-painted and has instructions with 3 steps:
"CLEAN OUR BEACH
1) Pick a bag from the box
2) Pick up garbage from the beach (even if it's not yours)
3) Put your bag full of garbage in one of the receptacles.
*please don't put your bag full of garbage back in this box"

These Waste Bag Boxes provide people with a place to deposit empty plastic bags for direct re-use on the beach to keep the beaches and lakes clean from plastic bags as well as other types of garbage. One great use case will be for dog-owners who might have forgotten to take a dog waste bag before walking their dogs.


Need: Sanitation - Clean Lakes and Beaches
According to the article in the link below, there was a littering problem on Woodbine beach.
