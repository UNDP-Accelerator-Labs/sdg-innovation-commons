Mbarara University of Science and Technology Biomedical Engineers designed a low-Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine that is said to be the preferred diagnostic method for infant hydrocephalus. This is low-cost MRI technology is under development by reducing the strength of the magnetic field and the use of alternative technologies to create the magnetic field which is cheaper in terms of cost and uses less power. The final design was validated by stakeholders from the Ugandan Healthcare Authorities.
