## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



The first phase of the project focused on how to improve the success of small businesses in innovation, by strengthening skills and knowledge development offerings at higher education institutions like universities. The first review was done on technical vocational education and training (TVET) colleges. Key insights include:.

1. Technical vocational education and training (TVET) colleges train for the local labour market, and have minimal involvement in innovation or enhancing innovation entrepreneurship capacity of students. 

2. However, there is a growing case for why TVETs have a natural place within National Systems of innovation. 

3. This project and other studies, showcased examples of innovation within TVETs - many are cases of process innovation versus product innovation, pointing towards a niche area for innovation in TVETs

4. Key areas to deepen innovation within TVETs includes deepening industrialization, advancing innovation skills among lecturers and students, and deliberately engaging in issues related to 4IR, and forming innovation strengthening partnerships. 

5. Technological advances in automation, machine learning, IoT, robotics, etc., will transform the labour market and therefore the type of education TVETs provide. 



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)


- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country
- Our private sector partners have expanded our joint work through their own resources in our country or internationally

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



Innovation entrepreneurship has been mainstreamed at the department of science and innovation (DSI) through their entities who have devised new programmes on this topic. DSI has contributed USD 900 000 to UNDP to advance work in this space. This is now a new Country office project within the Inclusive Growth Unit, being managed by the AccLab. 

The Allan and Gill Gray Foundation has joined UNDP and DSI in supporting the innovation entrepreneurship sector. Together in 2023, we jointly hosted the Makers Festival, which showcased innovation entrepreneurs from TVETs, who participated in a national innovation competition. 

DSI, through its Technology Innovation Agency will pilot a new project with UNDP, which will upskills youth and women on innovation entrepreneurship skills, and provide seed funding to businesses in the sector. 

All the above partners are cofunding the projects.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



- Data gaps being addressed - The extent of support at higher institutes of education for innovation entrepreneurship.  

- why data types were chosen - most suited to providing information that exists informally, or in an unstructured environment. Good for surfacing data that is unreported traditionally but is a merging field of interest to promote socioeconomic development. 



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



Micro Narratives and social media analysis helped raised discussion trends among key stakeholders in the sector. It provided insights into how stakeholders are evaluating the strengths and weaknesses in the sector, towards bolstering it in future. 

Asset mapping and ethnography - allowed us to survey the system and system constituents for what is actually happening in the sector, and potential opportunities.
