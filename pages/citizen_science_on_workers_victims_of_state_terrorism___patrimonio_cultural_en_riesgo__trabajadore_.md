## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection.

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process.
## Overall goal

Jointly reconstruct the stories of workers in Tucumán

during the years of State terrorism, by safeguarding the documentary collection

of the Federación Obrera Tucumana de la Industria Azucarera [the Tucumán

Workers Federation of the Sugar Industry] (FOTIA, by its Spanish acronym). 
## Specific goals

Identify workers who were victims of State terrorism in Tucumán and contextualize their individual

stories as part of the provincial sugar industry culture, the FOTIA, and trade union organizations. 

Recover, order, classify, describe, and safeguard the FOTIA's documenting material, as well as documents, photographs, and objects from private and union archives related to the victims.
## Description of citizen participation

This project was initiated as a result of a demand from the citizens for the preservation of FOTIA's documentation and the reconstruction of the stories of workers of the sugar industry, presented by workers from the federation, to the National University of Tucumán (UNT, by its Spanish acronym) and the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET, by its Spanish acronym). Citizens participate in the elaboration of the list of missing workers linked to the sugar industry, while union leaders provide names

of unregistered victims and qualitative information along with photographs. In addition, residents of different municipalities accompany the team in conducting fieldwork to learn more about the target population. The community finds old institutions and ways of circulation and living in each space visited, and provides information about the old settlers and the events that took place. Families and union leaders collaborate with the analysis of the data, participating in the reconstruction of the victims' life stories. 

Citizens are responsible for the maintenance of FOTIA's archive, which operates from the union's headquarters, while workers of the Archivo Nacional de la Memoria [National Memory Archive] are in charge of the technical maintenance of the collection.
