## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Formation of a vision and support framework for Green Economy development in Belarus
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to build a general view on the Green Economy as a system with the main stakeholders and actors from the various and unexpected sectors, define links and lack thereof, identify systemic issues, address systemic issues with key stakeholders and socialize the map with the key players.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The history behind the challenge is that UNDP and the AccLab is heavily engaged in the preparation of the Second National Action Plan on the Green Economy. During this work, one of the issues which has emerged  is a lack of cooperation between government actors and actors from other sectors. Ministry of Natural Resources and Academy of Science asked the AccLab to support in elaboration of the systemic vision of future of the Green Economy in Belarus. There are also other identified issues which might be a key for development of the Green Economy which are insufficient green jobs, low support for business which want to pursue a green agenda, Circular Economy as part of the Green Economy has low priority on the state level.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Preliminary assessments (hypothesis) shows that  Green Economy development affects more than 500 000 workplaces and can create additional 170 000 workplaces, which will be 14,2% of overall workforce which is 4 700 000 people.

Green Economy can decrease Greenhouse Gas Emissions on additional 13%  (official assessment) Preliminary and a little bit outdated assessment of Mineconomy forecasts that Green Economy can accelerate GDP growth by +13 %, but this assessment needs refreshing after COVID and crisis.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The AccLab is pursueing a portfolio approach, which goes beyond the programmatic units approach, within the Green Economy subject.  The AccLab promotes platform approach, bringing together various ministries and agencies to formulate and continuously support the common vision of GE development. The AccLab is a neutral side in pursuing the Green Economy agenda, not supporting any particular side or interest, not interfering into market competitiveness.  On top of that, the AccLab team has various skills in various areas which can bring additional layers on how the Green Economy can be developed. For example, the AccLab adds to the discussions on the Green Economy a more specific focus on its inclusiveness, gendered focus, and digitalization and elaborating additional IT products. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The UNDP AccLab in Belarus works with national and international partners for bringing smart, inclusive, and digital Green Economy that creates additional worklpaces.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How to land the Green Economy to the level of particular stakeholders to make GE development a priority for them?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

System mapping – map issues related to Green Economy and Green Growth  Hackathons – browsing for Green Solutions and new possible partners  Crowdsourcing – development of actions to promote Green Economy and putting it into National Action Plan on Green Economy  Participatory design – development of ideas jointly with different stakeholders within workshops related to Green Economy  MVP – drafting of schemas / maps showing the interdependency of sectors of Green Economy 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The assessment of different aspects of Green Growth needs to be repeated. Previous assessments that GE can increase GDP growth by 13% and add 170 K new workplaces needs to be recalculated taking into consideration COVID impact, crisis and sanctions. This gap needs to be fulfilled by mid-2022, and AccLab will carry it out.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

For the UNDP CO Green Economy can be the subject for portfolio design approach Within Belarus the Green Economy Action Plan can make the work of key stakeholders more cooperative, cohesive and coherent.  On the level of RBEC Belarusian experience in supporting the Green Growth can be the model one for other countries. Belarus already exchanged with Kazakhstan and Ukraine its results on GE development and will continue to work within the RBEC on future diffusion of approaches on its improvement.
