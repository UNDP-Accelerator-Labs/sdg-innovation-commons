## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Use of Behavioral Insights in understanding household waste segregation behavior
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is poor quality of waste segregation at household level. There is lack of awareness and knowledge on solid waste management amongst urban residents.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Over the past few decades, Bhutan witnessed rapid economic growth resulting in improved livelihoods growing urban population, and changing consumer and production patterns. The complex linkages at various scales across these factors have led to an increase in the amount of waste generation. The Royal Government of Bhutan has identified waste management as one of the key flagship programs for the 12th Five Year Plan (2018-2023).  The 2019 Waste Management Strategy aims to achieve the goal of ‘Zero Waste’ by 2030.  To meet this goal, the strategy proposes an integration of circular economy and targeted intervention of  reducing landfill waste disposal  from  over 80%  to less than 20% by end of 2030 The ever-rising concentration of residents in urban areas are exerting immense pressure on landfills. Waste management has particularly emerged as a significant challenge in the capital city of Thimphu.   Around 30,672 households in Thimphu  are depended solely on the Memelakha  landfill, the lifespan for which may have already been expired (reference). Several factors have led to the poor management of waste in the capital as per the NWIS-2019 report. They include  unsustainable consumer patterns, , infrequent waste collection and poor attitude of waste collectors, limited awareness of households on responsible waste management. Additional factors include inadequate waste infrastructure and lack of human and financial resources and people’s “out of sight, out of mind’ attitude towards waste management. There are only a countable number of recycle drop off centers across the country with the capital housing two such centers. Waste segregation at source is the first step in a complaint waste management strategy and the key component to effectively reduce the amount of waste going to landfill.

> 

As per the 2019 National Waste Inventory Survey Report (NWIS-2019) carried  out by the National Environment Commission (NEC),  Bhutan generates a total of  172.16 metric tons of solid waste   daily. Of which, 47.34% comprises of household waste, followed  by  commercial waste(39.09%). An average urban household, generates around 0.7 kg of household waste daily, while an average rural household produces 0.4 kg per day. Food waste constitutes 46% of the total waste production.  The NWIS-2019 also reported that 60% of the total households in the country lack access to waste disposal facilities..

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We are using Behavioral Insights to understand household waste segregation behavior. In partnership with the National Environment Commission Secretariat (NECS), the Lab is undertaking a social experiment on waste segregation centered around Randomized Control Trial (RCT) method. The experiment aims to test the effectiveness of the distribution of 3-colored bins to the households in the capital. As part of the waste flagship program, the government will be commencing a program of distributing 3 coloured waste separation bins to every household by first quarter of 2021 to reduce waste and increase recovery quantity.  We will carry out an RCT to assess the effect of the 3 coloured bins on the quality of waste segregation.
