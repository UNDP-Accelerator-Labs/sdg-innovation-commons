> Title of the innovation

EJODA MOVERS

> Brief description of the innovation

A three wheeled motorcycle designed to carry about 500kgs of goods. I plan to use it in delivery of learning materials to learning institutions under Ejoda  Book Shop, a business which was registered in 2016 and began operations in 2017 as well as carrying various merchandise of customers from one place to another at a fee.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I envisage to make about K500 per day, bringing monthly total to about K13,000 by delivering marketeers merchandise (general farm produce) from farms/soweto market to their trading places at a minimal fee. In addition,  Ejoda Book Shop currently makes an estimated K6,000 net profit per month from Book sales, but with improved transport, that will  double. With improved incomes, clients will invest in other ventures thereby contributing to the nation's GDP. The challenge prize will help me procure this machine. In terms of value addition, marketeers will have their merchandise delivered on time and in good condition with no risk of pilferage, theft or damage which is the current case with wheelbarrow pushers and public transport.  I plan to be saving half of the monthly proceeds in order to increase the fleet.

> Technical Feasibility

A three wheeled motorcycle proposed for immediate implementation of transporting merchandise for clients from one place to another and facilitation of movements at Ejoda Book Shop during prospection and delivery  of orders.

> Anticipated Social Impact

EJODA MOVERS will provide a cheaper and reliable transport where there will be no pilferage, theft or damage to goods whilst in transit, which is the case currently where wheelbarrow pushers fall with overloaded items severally before reaching their destinations, sometimes steal them altogether. With Ejoda movers,clients will now order goods in the comfort of their homes and Ejoda Movers will be there to deliver for them to their designated destinations, thereby saving costs.
