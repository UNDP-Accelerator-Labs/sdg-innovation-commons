Knowing What We Don't Know: Immersion Method for Inclusive Urban Infrastructure Policy

Knowing What We Don't Know: Immersion Method for Inclusive Urban Infrastructure Policy Knowing What We Don't Know: Immersion Method for Inclusive Urban Infrastructure Policy

Author: Yulia Sugandi, Head of Solutions Mapping, Indrajit Joyosumarto, Intern, Ajeng Larasati, Intern, Yevonnael Andrew, Intern, UNDP Accelerator Lab IndonesiaVarious coping mechanisms to flooding (clockwise): (a) social capital; community members pool resources to rent a water pump as a flood mitigation measure, (b) grass roots innovation; a jerry can boat initiated by young people to evacuate the elderly, mothers, children, valuables and motorbikes during a flood (currently in the maintenance process), (c) inequality matters; a wall less than half a meter high has been built in front of the house to prevent water from entering.
Reoccuring floods are part of wicked problems in Indonesia. Even when flood mitigation floods are available, current data(link is external) shows that flooding in Indonesia is on an upward trend, costing losses of around 4.63 trillion Rupiah(link is external) each year.
This raises the question of how to formulate an effective and efficient policy on flood mitigation History shows that current infrastructure solutions have not been able to provide the desired protection. In contrast, the infrastructure approach(link is external) has environmental impacts and increases the risk of flooding elsewhere. We must abandon our tunnel vision to look at multiple other approaches.
The Learning Begins: Curiosity and Openness to Listen

Previously(link is external), we looked at the importance of communities’ ecological relationship to water, social cohesion, and human security to understand the whole system better. Policymakers need to reduce disparities with affected communities to understand the complexities and remove key barriers to mitigating water-related disaster.
In a collaboration with the Directorate for Water and Irrigation Development at National Development Planning Agency (DIPI Bappenas(link is external)), Accelerator Lab Indonesia explored the relevance of their built infrastructure intervention. While national-level plans have already incorporated statistics of flood survivors, DIPI Bappenas strived to listen to aspirations of affected communities.
Together with the Rujak Center for Urban Studies(link is external) and seven community-based organizations we dove deep and immersed among flood-impacted communities in seven cities across Indonesia to understand the context of the issue. We were supported by participatory tools, survey, and solutions mapping method with its canvas that we co-designed with Design Ethnography Lab(link is external)- Bandung Institute of Technology.Landscape change, livelihoods and inequality. Drums were used to pack fish in the old days when people worked in ponds and farmed the fields. The area was converted into flood-free housing for the upper middle class. People who have lost their livelihoods become construction workers or domestic helpers. Even though the new residential area is free from flooding, the residents living next to it are still suffering from flooding. Other areas in the same city experienced road elevation as an effort to prevent flooding. "It's useless dredging the river if the upstream area is damaged, because the potential for flooding is still large." (community member) Infrastructure solutions for road elevation exacerbate flood risk for residents who cannot build houses.Immersion: Learn to Unlearn

We dove into the affected communities to understand their perceptions, needs and grassroot solutions regarding flooding and infrastructure. Immersion led by community representatives was carried out collectively and iteratively through sense making.
Immersion is a participatory method used by policy makers and development workers which considers cultural values ​​and the plurality of knowledge systems in society. This method allows exploration into emic or insiders’ perspectives to understand the context of the communities in which they work. Some scientists categorize immersion as ground-truthing, namely efforts made to relate to social realities in the field.
Immersion means deep mental involvement and is done by opening oneself to understand and feel the in-depth context by applying experiential learning and informal conversations. Empathy, openness, humility, reflexivity, active listening, awareness of one’s biases and assumptions form the basis for understanding context from another’s perspectives.
The key to uncover unexpected discoveries during immersion lies in the ability to maintain an interpersonal stance that is other-oriented in relation to aspects of cultural identity (cultural humility(link is external)), and the recognition that knowledge of the world is always interpreted, structured, and filtered by the observer (epistemic humility(link is external)).Context Discovery: Complexity of Community-Based Resilience

Through immersion, we learned that communities have different strategies to face floods, determined by the geographical context of their settlements which cannot be separated from their social and economic status, ecological relationships, belief systems, and cultural and religious practices. Communities that view floods as a blessing have the adaptive capacity to overcome it, while those who see flooding as a threat scramble for short-term mitigation strategies.
The social cultural construction on water governance, for example customary views on waterways, are yet to be recognized as part of social infrastructure. Besides weather changes, people are also concerned about economic pressures and globalization that erode cultural practices and local assets in dealing with floods.A traditional house on stilts whose design allows floodwater to flow under the structure without affecting the occupants of the house. Although the stilt houses have great benefits as a place to evacuate residents during floods, currently they are neglected. People are encouraged to build modern houses because houses on stilts are considered old-fashioned, unhealthy, and uncivilized.
People shared with us about the interrelationships between floods, flood infrastructure and other elements of social and ecological systems – like history of the area and landscape change. People explained that physical infrastructure alone cannot control the changes of the water landscape, because there are various bottlenecks covering human behavior and policies, such as waste and disposal problems to name a few, that affect the entire ecosystems.
The people we spoke to said that their involvement in the construction of flood infrastructure such as canals and river management, has proven to be effective in flood prevention. While they are also aware that the lack of participation in the urban system renders less effective flood infrastructure.
Some communities devised local solutions to mitigate flooding, like growing plants along the riverbank or trees around their settlements as a “water diversion” method. Communities utilize social capital in their disaster response and are not limited to biophysical infrastructure.Integrated community-based flood prevention from immersion in seven cities in IndonesiaTo be Continued: Reflective Learning

The learning path toward immersion begins with cognitive flexibility(link is external) showing agile and divergent thinking, interest in developing new approaches, ability to see and make use of new connections, willingness to learn from experience and recognize outdated approaches. Intellectual humility and courage to take risks are important to challenge established long-term paradigm.
Immersion allows us to sense and feel the context deeply such described in this quote, "When a flower doesn't bloom, you fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower (Den Heijer)." Instead of focusing on single reality and approach, immersion takes us to multiple realities and ecosystem approach. Unlearning makes room for the context to reveal itself, which will shape our understanding of the relevance of an intervention, thinking, strategy, policy and so on.
As a method, immersion carried out by the community of seven cities resulted in a policy brief as the basis for evidence-based policy. However, the value attribute attached to immersion should be owned by any reflective learner.
