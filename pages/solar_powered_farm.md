Kaushik Chand, uses his electrical and electronic engineering experience to build a solar-powered irrigation system. His design was influenced by other farmers overseas, and was created to help his father overcome costly irrigation systems on their farm. They have now ventured into creating and selling customized  solar-powered irrigation system packages to other farmers and offer free installation. The four types of irrigation systems they offer are rain pipe irrigation, flood irrigation, drip irrigation, and sprinkler irrigation
