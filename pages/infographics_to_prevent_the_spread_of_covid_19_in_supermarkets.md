Local service design company at the very early stage of pandemics gathered a group of health and retail experts to create an infographic about do's and don'ts during quarantine in supermarkets with a focus on 60+ age group. This infographic was sent to multiple retail chains possibly saving many lives. 



Later in April, we hired this company to provide us with the infographic on missing points in the existing communication campaigns targeted at residential buildings in Ukraine.
