The trial exchange between the "Svit Kavy" cafe shop and the National Botanical Garden of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. The progressive city cafe provided a 3-day stock of coffee waste to the rose garden management, who in return thanked them for the roses that are now displayed to the customers of the cafe - raising awareness about the circularity. The garden management was inspired by the example of Kew Garden (London) and now is actively using organic matter collected elsewhere in the garden to feed roses. They are especially interested in bringing coffee waste which would be very beneficial for sustaining 3.5 hectares of blossoming roses. Such a symbolic exchange of material "gifts" seems to have a great potential for spreading the message about the circularity. The AccLab and the coffee shops in the area are now exploring possible ways to create sustainable supplies of coffee waste (with a very limited return of roses, of course).
