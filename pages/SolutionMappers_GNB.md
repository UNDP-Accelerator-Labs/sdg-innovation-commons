# Solutions Mapping for Public Spaces in Guinea Bissau

### [[0:00]] Can you please tell us your name and your position?

Yeah\. Hi, my name is Anna Dju\. I'm the head of solutions mapping for the accelerator lab in Guinea Bissau\.

### [[0:11]] Could you give us the R&D story that you wish to share? Yeah, That you would like to share a little bit about?

Yeah, sure\. So the story I want to share today is revolving our experimentation around\. Sorry, I'm going to sneeze around the use of public spaces in the city of Bissau\.

### [[0:35]] Can you just elaborate on that? What did you do? What did you do it with?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
So essentially we were undergoing a training surrounding design thinking and at that time the university, the local university which is called whenever we see that lose often reached out to UNDP and they wanted to create a partnership for the use of green spaces in the city because they had a partnership with the KTH Architecture school in Stockholm and they wanted to create green spaces, but first they wanted to understand the use of the spaces in the city\. So essentially, since we were working already with the design thinking, we thought let's apply these learnings of the design thinking in understanding how the use of the green spaces are in B South\. So what we did at first was we did a behavioral study where we identified where were the green spaces\. And when I say green spaces, I don't necessarily mean that these are your typical green spaces\. They're green spaces in a sense that they're to be used by the public for social leisure activities\. So what we initially did was we did a behavioral study in three locations around the city where we kind of tried to understand how people are using those spaces and for what activities\. And what we came to find out was that people use the spaces mainly for economic activity\. They used it for a little bit of exercise on two locations, not the three, they used it for leisure\. So a lot of kind of, let's say, activities that engage more and older public\. So there was some gambling, there was drinking bars in these public spaces and also unfortunately some prostitution\. So we kind of observed this before actually interacting with those that were using the space to try and understand what was happening\. The second stage was to kind of begin to interact with the people using the space\. So we gathered a group of researchers to go and do these questionnaires and the questionnaires were very much open\-ended questions so we could capture the things that we didn't capture through the behavioral studies\. So very open\-ended questions and using the design thinking methodology, very few questions to allow for kind of like the conversation to flow\. And what we came to find out was that people didn't feel ownership of the green spaces\. They felt like it wasn't their responsibility to upkeep the spaces\. They felt like the spaces didn't meet their needs and they felt like they didn't really need authorization to use the space in the ways that they wanted to use the space\. So we kind of conducted a mapping to understand how we could leverage these findings to create not only an ownership of the space, but also to allow for bringing in other groups that maybe we didn't see using the spaces like young people, children, families, because these were the groups that we didn't really see using the space\. Once we did that mapping, we did a second presentation with the Bissau City Council and we showed them what we found and we basically told them, look, this is what people think is missing\. And the components were there was no seating space, there was no shaded areas, there was no water\. And also they felt like it was not clean and tidy\. So it was not welcoming in on a caveat also, the fact that people use the space for drinking for economic activity, they felt like if they were to use the space for leisure, then they weren't welcome to use the space\. So after we presented the findings to the B South City Council, they called for a wider conversation that then brought in our partners, which was UN habitat, obviously UNDP and then the B South City Council\. And kind of the in Portuguese we say Alpha and the DESH, which is kind of like the there's a ministry that is close by some of these spaces and particularly the space where we identified where we wanted to do the test\. So we had a little bit of a workshop to try and understand how we could bring these solutions and these problems that the community had presented\. So we could kind of solve this issue of lack of ownership of the public spaces and the use of public spaces\.

### [[5:35]] So could you just tell us what was the outcome of that workshop?

[[tools:How might we]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
The outcome of that workshop was that we went back to the office and we synthesized and we came up with the test\. And the test essentially was that we would insert these amenities into a one of the parks that we because we did three, we looked at 3 parks\. We would insert these amenities into one of these parks and then we would see how people would interact with the space given that the conditions that they said were missing in the first place would work\. So if they would have\. So the hypothesis here was to understand, if we inserted these amenities into the space, would the community have more ownership? Would other groups, children, families use the space and would they feel the responsibility to maintain the space? So we added bins, we added seats, we added shading and we added water stations to wash your hands and drinking water\. The results of this test was that we saw an increase in number of use of the space, but unfortunately we didn't see an increase of the use of space of those groups that we were tailoring the test to\. So families, young people, children\. And after the test we presented the findings and actually what we came to see is that the way in which people were interacting with the space although was better and in in that there wasn't so much, let's say rubbish dotted around the park\. And there was more people using the space for leisure, but there was still economic activities and there was also gambling and other activities that maybe didn't allow for those specific groups to feel as if they were safe and if the space was for their use\. So we presented those findings and that was kind of where we would say the main parts of our work ended\.

### [[7:52]] Just wanted to find out, was there a critical moment in during this\. That Osteo like was saying that you should move, you should pivot? Was there a critical moment where the team looked at the situation, you're like, we need to pivot? If that if there was, what was it and why?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
A critical moment that I would say that we had to pivot would be definitely when we saw that the Bissau City Council wasn't having interactions with key partners outside of when we were having our weekly meeting meetings to kind of debrief\. And we understood that we needed to pivot in that sense, because if we were the ones bringing everyone together, then ultimately there's no sustainability\. And it meant that in our absence, things wouldn't move forward\. So what we decided to do then was to kind of design A strategy where we would appeal to what was the priorities of the B South City Council\. And at the time, it was waste management\. So even though it was one of the components that we tested, it wasn't a heavy one\. So we decided to make that into a bigger thing because we're working, as I said, with UN Habitat and that was also one of their projects\. So we started to see how we could change our approach with the Be South City Council for them to see the Waste management as a big component of having people use the space in complementing the other items that we also had in mind\. So I think what this led to was that this was a component they took ownership with and we can say is one of the most successful components within this exploration or this learning cycle\. Yeah, that's what we had to prepare\.

### [[9:51]] Can you speak to diffusion when you come, when you're looking at the experiments that you had and the solutions that you came up with, the testing, can you just speak to diffusion like what your thoughts were? Did you manage to do it? If you did, on what level?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
Yeah\. When I think this cycle was one of the cycles that we had as at as at a lab, we had a lot of trouble kind of seeing the impact straight away\. Because I think we tested a number of things and we had this idea that all of those things would be of interest and all of those things would solve the problems that we had designed in our hypothesis or that we had explored and that the population had raised\. But going back to where we pivoted, we realized that actually the ownership only came when a key institution, which in this instance was the South City Council had interest in taking it forward\. So when it comes to the diffusion, now we see that there is a huge funded project by the EU and Indian Navy S, which is solely on waste management and green cities\. And we know that the findings from that learning cycle influenced that decision\. It wasn't that the if it wasn't for the lab, we wouldn't have gotten there, but the lab was able to provide key statistics that weren't available\. You know that helped to paint the picture that helped them to really see this as a priority and put it in the agenda\. And I think it was also a success in a sense that it's like you see how the community and how these institutions have their own agency in wanting to make change happen\. But sometimes it's about making the picture clear and who are the stakeholders involved to kind of push this agenda forward\.

### [[11:50]] Thank you\. Looking like standing from where you are now\. If you had to start again, what would you do differently?

[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
If we could start again, what I would do differently would definitely be to engage stakeholders like the EU earlier on, because I think from the beginning, we didn't think that the funding would be so necessary\. We thought that only a little bit of funding would be enough to take it forward\. But actually a learning was that the diffusion specifically for what we wanted to do, there was a greater interest\. And in this instance, we, the EU had a greater interest in this and had we engaged them from the beginning, maybe not only the Waste Management would have been one of the key components to be taken forward, but maybe all of the other amenities that we kind of gathered would have been able to create this whole picture\. But the results were still good\. But from the view of the lab and the image that we painted, obviously we thought that it could have been more wholesome, but it was still a really good outcome\.

### [[13:09]] Thank you so much\.
