## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Learning from local innovative climate change adaptation and energy initiatives
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that a large part of our population still lacks access to energy and urban spaces are full of poorly managed waste, which is a problem for climate change.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Global estimates indicate that 41% of the world’s population, does not have access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking and 17% of the world’s population, doesn’t have access to energy at all. The slow progress in the adoption of clean cooking has contributed to the release of toxic pollutants into the environment endangering the health of billions globally. The lack of access to clean fuels has gendered effects whereby women are disproportionately exposed to the unhealthy pollutants which are mostly released by cooking with biomass fuels. As evident in many rural areas, the time dedicated to cooking and collection of fuel takes time hampering their participation in other activities such as school attendance and generation of income. Without expedited action to scale up clean cooking, the world will fall short of its target by 30 per cent come 2030. Women disproportionately bear this cost through poor health from pollution, as well as lost productivity and safety risks in collecting fuel. 

Cameroon has more than 95% of the population depending on wood fuel as a source of cooking energy and 869,519 tonnes of wood exploited, representing approximately one million in the Far North region (GIZ 2017) is a palpable example. Indeed, between 2002 and 2012, the distance travelled by women and girls in the Far North region to obtain fuelwood increased from 6 km to 20 km (MINFOF 2021). This situation has been aggravated by the phenomenon of insecurity and the influx of displaced and refugee populations in the said region. There have been efforts to prevent the illegal exploitation of charcoal in the Far North which has resulted in 30 tonnes of charcoal taken from the Waza National Park. On the environmental front, heat peaks of 45°C in the shade have recently been recorded.  At the same time, the effects of the problems around access to clean cooking are perceived differently by the population of the region and not well understood from an environmental and gender perspective which is why innovation around such challenges is more than ever critical. 

A part this lack of access to energy, As in most sub-Saharan African countries where the population growth is increansing, particularly in urban areas, it is causing enormous difficulties in environmental management, including waste management. The city of Yaoundé, for example, produces about 1800 tons of waste per day, i.e. 700,000 tons per year, which is a major concern for waste management. As part of its missions, the company HYSACAM in charge of Hygiene and Sanitation has installed waste bins for the collection of waste in all the neighbourhoods of the city as well as in points of concentration of the population such as the markets. Teams collect waste at regular intervals to ensure that the area is clean. In addition to this measure, the borough councils have set up a number of schemes, including "clean days", which are mornings or whole days during which residents and workers clean up shared spaces.  These actions, although significant, do not achieve the expected results. In fact, despite everything, there are anarchic deposits of rubbish in several corners of the city, particularly in the markets. 

The markets are public places frequented by the vast majority of citizens to buy foodstuffs and other basic necessities. From the data collected and observation, several markets in the capital are faced with an approximate management of waste. Waste of all kinds obstructs the roads, thus reinforcing urban disorder. From an environmental point of view, this poor waste management undoubtedly has repercussions such as the risk of flooding; air, soil and water pollution (greenhouse gases). As a point of convergence for the masses, regardless of social class, income or residence, markets are also places where microbes are spread and thus dirt and epidemics. The clean days instituted as well as the periodic collections by the company HYSACAM are not enough to make the markets viable. Furthermore, the closure of markets causes significant economic losses (both customers and traders), which could be avoided by developing more sustainable and durable solutions.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The present learning challenge is a rather complex one that has been around for many years and for which many traditional solutions have proved impotent and inadequate. As the laboratory is dedicated to addressing complex development issues through a learning cycle, we decided to take it on. 

Our added value in doing so can be analysed on two levels: our ability to conduct a learning exercise to detect local and unique innovations that can effectively address the challenge, and the global learning network of other accelerator labs around the world.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Energy access gaps & poorly managed urban waste plague our society, posing significant climate change threats. Let's work towards innovative sustainable solutions for better living.
