> Title of the innovation

Aluminum Can Recycling Project

> Brief description of the innovation

The project aims at recycling aluminum cans into ingots that can be sold and remade into different shapes and products or be used as an alloy in producing things such as roofing sheets and construction beams and other related materials in the construction industry. There has been a growing trend of the consumption of energy drinks over the years, packaged in Aluminum Cans like Kungfu and Kombat energy drinks. 
These Cans are indiscriminately littered, especially by beer drinking consumers who mix the energy drinks with other liquor and the cans eventually find their way to the landfills. If the Aluminum Cans can also be recycled, it will provide many environmental, economic and community benefits. Aluminum recycling is the process by which scrap Aluminum can be reused to create new products after its initial production. This is done by simply re-melting the metal, which is far less expensive than creating new Aluminum through the electrolysis of Aluminum Oxide. Aluminum is one of the most cost-effective materials to be recycled. This is because recycling Aluminum uses only around 5% of the energy needed to make it from the raw material bauxite. The metal can be recycled time and again without loss of properties, so getting the Aluminum recycling habit is one of the best things that can be done for the environment and most importantly reduce the amount of cans discarded in the landfill.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

There are some socio-economic and environmental benefits to be gained from the proposal. For instance the economic benefits will include direct and indirect employment opportunities for local people with some permanent positions. It is estimated that the proposal will generate around 300 new jobs in the next 2-3 years. Some employees will be running the day to day operations of the aluminum recycling plant, while others will be working in the field in collaboration with relevant stakeholders to collect as much cans as possible and establish networks. And perhaps 2 or 3 truck drivers. The workforce is expected to peak during the construction phase.
Aluminum recycling is economically beneficial to the automotive, construction, and recycling industries. The cost of producing aluminum is already well known to be far less expensive than producing new aluminum from its bauxite ore. The Zambian construction industry which is already booming will benefit a lot when the targets and objectives of the project come to fruition.
The aluminum ingots and billets that will be produced already play an integral role to the production of new aluminum items such as sheets, foil, bars, wire, rods, window frames etc. These products are produced via pressing and rolling the ingots which are cast from the molten aluminum. The ingots are simply material that are cast into suitable shapes for further processing. This is the very stage alloy elements may be added to make quality goods like roofing sheets. Collaborations with other companies in the construction industry will be another resultant impact because of such products. 
The environmental impact of the project on the other hand will aim at inculcating the attitude of waste separation at source among Zambian consumers. Bars and other shop outlets that sell drink cans will be encouraged to have specific bins for can disposal and hence reduce indiscriminate littering. This will of course be achieved via sensitization campaigns and promotional media efforts. Educating the public and advocating for the city council to establish recycling programs in collaboration with such programs as the “Keep Zambia Clean Campaign” may be one way of encouraging consumers to get into the recycling habit. 
As a matter of fact, aluminum scrap recycling in developed countries have proven to be both economically valuable and environmentally sound, such that recycling and recovery of aluminum has become a big industry in its own right. This proposal aims at translating that level of success to the Zambian context.
The recycling of aluminum as earlier noted is cheaper and significantly saves a lot of cost, as compared to producing new aluminum. It is for this reason that the long term projections include: the reduction of capital costs associated with landfills, mines and imports of aluminum made products from abroad. The aluminum recycling industry in Zambia will also grow because supply will likely grow in proportion or possibly in excess of market demand.
The proposal will also result into the establishment of a new aluminum recycling plant in Zambia that will supply many industries with alumina ingots and billets.

> Technical Feasibility

STAGES OF RECYCLING PROCESS
Aluminum ingots are produced through the smelting process.
1.	COLLECTION
This is the stage where cans are collected. Drink cans and foil trays can be collected from homes including steel food tins. For the purposes of this project Steel made tins/cans will be separated from the Aluminium made tins/cans so that each metal can have a specific recycling scheme. After the cans/tins have been collected, they will be taken to a treatment plant.
2.	SORTING
In the treatment plant the Aluminum is sorted and cleaned ready for reprocessing. The metals will be separated with magnets, and then the Aluminum and Steel are compressed into bales
3.	REPROCESSING
The compressed bales will be taken to be reprocessed through four stages which include: shredding, decoating, melting and casting. It then goes through a re-melt process and turns into molten Aluminum, this removes the coatings and inks that may be present in on the Aluminium. The molten is cast into ingots in the final stage
4.	ROLLING
Ingots are transported to rolling mills and rolled out to make Aluminium sheets from which new packaging can be made.

5.	CONVERTING
Aluminum sheet is converted into a diverse range of packaging products such as cans, and ready meal packaging. 

REQUIRED ALUMINUM RECYCLING MACHINERY
The following machines will be needed to get the project up and running:
METAL BALERS
Metal balers crush, cut and bale a wide range of scrap metal. Metal balers are designed for the various industrial applications in processing steel, aluminum, copper and other metals in variable shapes and sizes.
HAMMER MILL
Hammer mills are used to crush or to shred various types of aggregate scraps into smaller particles. 
ALUMINUM SMELTING MACHINE
Aluminum smelting machines turn the shredded aluminum scraps into molten state ready to be shaped into ingots.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The approval of the proposal will lead to further spending in the local community which will result in more employment opportunities and returns on investment for local businesses. Support for partnership training programs and youth empowerment opportunities will increase. The proposal will also result into the establishment of a new aluminum recycling plant in Zambia that will supply many industries with alumina ingots and billets. However, if the proposal is not approved or given the opportunity to proceed, the following will be the case:
•	There will be a lost market opportunity  
•	Missed employment opportunities for the locals 
•	Reduced economic growth potential
•	Missed opportunity to improve the environmental outlook of Lusaka city from a waste management’ point of view.
