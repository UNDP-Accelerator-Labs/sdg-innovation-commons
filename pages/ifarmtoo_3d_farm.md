> Brief description of the innovation

We are developing a remote controlled three dimensional farm, our 3d farm uses hydroponic and aquaponic system system which means growing of plants in soilless nutrients rich solutions and can be controlled from a computer or mobile phone

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our innovation will generate revenue through sales, installation and servicing of our technologies. We also intend to run our system on rental basis where farmers can rent a floor of portion of the farm, this would give an opportunity to young farmers who don't have enough capital to setup their own farm. The system is eco friendly as it use 80% less water and does not deplete soil resources, the innovation will help increase productivity of farmers especially those who are land constrained. The 3d farms will help bring farms to cities which will reduce the cost of transportation and ensure freshness of food consumed.
Our primary target market are urban farmers as these lack land to engage effectively in farming.
The challenge prize will help us commercialize our innovation and bring farms to cities.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation uses an indoor cultivation method that uses mineral solutions instead of soil to grow plants. The main structure of our prototype is made of metal and pvc pipes through which water circulates, our platform consist of three main parts;
1. Modular structure: PVC pipes and metal structure to support the hydroponic system
2. Electric circuit: this is the brain of our system and will use the arduino uno board circuit to control other system parameters
3. Sensors/ actuators: measure and control all the data of our system.

We intend to continue working on our prototype till the end of 2021 in order to perfect it in readiness for implementation hopefully starting 2022 once enough funds are available

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation will help farmers farm more effeciently, productively and easily. It will give an opportunity to urban dweller who mostly lack farmland to engage in farming effectively which will in turn increase food production and lead to food security, this could help reduce hunger and poverty.
Our platform will also give an opportunity to physically challenged people to engage in agriculture as this group has been left behind in the agriculture sector because of their physical limitations to engage effectively in farming activities.
