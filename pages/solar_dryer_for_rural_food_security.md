## Title

Solar Dryer for Rural Food Security
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is on increasing the efficiency of food management and supply chain with appropriate know-how and technologies in our long-term goal of improving food security and livelihood opportunities with rural communities in Sabah.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In response to COVID-19 pandemic, Accelerator Lab Malaysia worked closely with TONIBUNG and Moyog Innovation House (MIH) to map out new market value chain to connect rural produces to consumers in the urban areas. The food supply chain was severely disrupted during movement control orders as all travels were restricted and local markets were prohibited from operating. This threatened the food security for both rural and urban communities as they were unable to access essential items from each other eg. oil and salt for rural communities, and fresh produces eg. vegetables, rice, meat for urban folks.  Many of the fresh produces and raw meats that was meant to be sold to urban markets ended up as food waste as rural communities have limited facilities and infrastructure such as refrigeration to store and preserve foods. Long traveling time and poor road conditions to rural farms also poses as a challenge in maintaining quality of delivered goods. Thus, capacity building for food processing and quality enhancement of produces were conducted in the current project. Necessary technology and equipment eg. vacuum packing machine, oven for food drying, and chest freezers were supplied for rural farmer and entrepreneurs.   Building on the Rural Economy Inclusion portfolio for the Sabah Rural e-commerce project, we continue to experiment on greener and more economic method in processing and storing  to improve product shelf life and reduce wastages from unsold goods and long last mile delivery. The team started using solar dryer in partnership with University Malaysia Sabah (UMS) and TONIBUNG who are prototyping a community solar dryer that is climate-conducive and testing out the optimum drying time and temperature for different produces. More technical expertise is required in improving drying and preservation methods for fresh produces.

Focus group discussions were done in 2020 for UK Pact Proposal submission with stakeholders from the government, energy companies, CSOs, and academia. The results showed the various challenges for rural electrification and its effect on community livelihood and food security. We also conducted FGD and interviews with the entrepreneurs, mostly women, in over 20 villages over the past 3 years to gather constant feedback from the community on their needs to recover from the pandemic.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Food security is a new frontier challenge that have not directly been explored in the current project and programmes of CO. It is however intricately linked to the climate change and biodiversity conservation as well as poverty eradication portfolios in our CO. Food security is closely tied to the overall system that has unequally affected people's livelihood, health and conservation of natural resources.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

 Prototyping green energy for improvement of food security and livelihood opportunities- portable solar dryers are making its mark among the rural communities.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Our lab is trying to answer the question of “How food preservation methods can be enhanced with green technology to support rural community in tackling food security and improve livelihood resilience?”

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation: Collective Intelligence: Hackathons: Participatory design: Design according to the needs of the entrepreneurs,producers and communities in the rural area based on geographical and eocnomic needs. Prototyping: Test out solar drying methods in terms of temperature, materials and portability for rural community use.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Open data, geospatial data: These data are useful in helping to determine the market condition and physical condition of the locality to design the solar dryer prototype. Eg. weather patterns, geographical terrains and traveling distances. User journeys: User journeys will be documented to gain insight on the gaps and benefits of the prototyped solar dryer and assist in further improvement and commercialization. Scientific research: Research on solar dryers in the past using different types of materials are explored and used as design for the solar dryer. Issue mapping: The current challenges of food drying processes are documented to tailor design of new solar dryer to the needs of communities. Primary data: Data on fruits drying temperature, duration, types of insects/pests, energy used are provided by the communities to assist in the detailed design of the prototype.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Rural farmers and producers in Sabah will  benefit from this work with the potential of scaling to South East Asia (SEA) rural communities with similar challenges and produces. Currently TONIBUNG, a grassroot innovator who have design and build various agricultural and energy machineries eg. micro-hydro electric, pyrolysis etc are our champion to inspire other local communities in building simialr capacity.
