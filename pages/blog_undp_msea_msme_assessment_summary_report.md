IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON KENYAN MSMEs - Summary Report
There was a significant relationship between registration and

size of enterprise with the proportion of registered enterprises

increasing with size (49.4 % of Micro enterprises, 82.3% of Small

enterprises and 90.9% of Medium enterprises).

About 69.3% also indicated membership in an association such

as Jua Kali Associations, Self-Help Groups, Kenya Association

of Manufacturers and Kenya National Chamber of Commerce

and Industry among others. The proportion of enterprises with

membership in associations increased with size of enterprise

(Micro enterprise 68.2%, Small enterprises 71.9% and Medium

enterprises 81.8%).

The level of inclusion of vulnerable populations both in employment

and in leadership of MSMEs was average. Employment of women

was found to be above average with 69.7% of the enterprises.

3 out every 5 MSMEs had women in employment with Micro-

enterprises featuring the most women in employment. Women

were mostly employed in the Manufacturing and service sectors.

Their inclusion in leadership positions was also above average

with 56.4% representation of women in leadership. It was

observed that the sector employs a large number of youth. A total

of 85.5% of enterprises had youth between the age of 18-35 in

their employment. Despite this, youth were largely excluded from

positions of leadership as less than 15% of the MSMEs had youth

in leadership. Persons with disability (PWD) were most excluded

with only 29.8% of enterprises having employed PWDs and a mere

16.4% of enterprises having included them in leadership positions.

Impact of COVID-19
on MSME operations

All the enterprises queried were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pan-

demic in various ways and degrees. Reduction of customers, low sales, mar-

ket closure and supply chain disruptions were common experiences across

the enterprises. 1 out of every 10 enterprises shut down their businesses

as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was observed that 13.4% of en-

terprises irrespective of size had operations completely halted. Micro and

Small enterprises appeared to have operations more greatly reduced than

Medium enterprises. Enterprises in the manufacturing sector experienced

most adverse impact of COVID-19 on operations and income while enter-

prises within the infrastructure sector experienced the least impact. The

negative impact on operations and on income was inversely proportional to

the size of the enterprises. Micro enterprises bore the burden of closure and

complete loss of income. No medium-sized enterprise was completely shut

down. Closure of schools early on in the pandemic also had a significant

impact on MSMEs. Almost 10% of the respondents interviewed expressed a

challenge related to the closure of schools.

MSMEs and Adoption of
Digital Technology

The survey also captured information relevant to understanding the digital preparedness of

MSMEs. COVID-19 has provided impetus towards digital technology adoption, integration and

reliance. While the immediate benefits of digital interventions may vary between sectors and firms,

adoption of digital solutions can help MSMEs in areas such as: logistics, finance, marketing and

advertising, customer engagement and business management. The survey therefore looked at

the development and maturity levels of MSMEs with regard to adoption and engagement of digital

technology. It also captured data and information on the gaps existing to support the digitalization

of MSMEs.

Digitalization means the use of digital technologies and

Digital technology was identified as an enabler for

marketing interventions. The use of tools such as

social media, e-commerce platforms and website may

support MSMEs to access wider markets. This is an

area to consider capacity building and investment in.

The majority of MSMEs are at the lowest level of digital

maturity. MSMEs higher digital maturity had lower

levels of negative impact on income.

Digital technology was needed for marketing products

and services, development of products and services,

procurement, financial management and customer care.

For digital transformation, enterprises overwhelmingly

needed skills development, technical and material

support.
