> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

This solution consists of an innovative high-efficiency metal stove (rocket combustion system) of 5,000 Kcal which fuel is biomass or organic waste. Externally it has a protective mesh that may or may not have thermal mass; in addition, it vents combustion gases to the outside, making it extremely safe.   To empower people and teach them how to build their own eco-stoves from metal waste, manufacturing workshops are held in low-income neighborhoods.   The purpose of the eco-stove is not only to heat but also to cook and heat sanitary water. For manufacturing it, only machines and tools used for hobbies are needed, so they are easily accessible.

The eco-stove consumes the organic waste that accumulates in street corners, such as pruning twigs, cardboard, dry leaves, etc. It is extremely safe, it does not generate fumes or particulates, and it vents the monoxide to the outside which prevents poisoning. Therefore, this device provides heat:  SAFELY: Because combustion gases are vented to the outside, which prevents poisoning and death from carbon monoxide inhalation.  EFFICIENTLY: Because it has a measured coefficient of performance of 80%, one of the highest available for homes and industries; that is, it makes much better use of fuel.  ECONOMICALLY: Because it feeds on small pruning branches, wood waste from crates or scraps, pallets, chipping, leaves and dry compressed grass, etc. Also, because its construction is made with standard materials, most of which can be recovered.  SUSTAINABLY: Because it works by burning dry organic waste in a very controlled way, that is, biomass that is renewable energy and very easily accessible.
