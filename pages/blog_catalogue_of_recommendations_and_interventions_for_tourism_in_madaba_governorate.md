UNDP works in about 170 countries and territories, helping to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and exclusion, and build resilience so countries can sustain progress. As the UN’s development agency, UNDP plays a critical role in helping countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
In order to achieve its mandate, UNDP relies entirely on voluntary contributions from UN Member States, multilateral organizations, private sector and other sources, in the form of unrestricted regular resources (core), and contributions earmarked for a specific theme, programme or project.
Find out who we are and who leads UNDP’s work in Jordan.
Partnership is at the heart of everything UNDP does. We offer a nearly universal presence. Our substantial expertise—both intellectual acumen and practical experience—cuts across diverse development issues and settings. These valuable assets combined with our long legacy of trust have made us a global partner of choice.
Accountability is the obligation to demonstrate that work has been conducted in accordance with agreed rules and standards and report fairly and accurately on performance results vis-à-vis mandated roles and/or plans.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), otherwise known as the Global Goals, are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
UNDP’s activities in Jordan build on main thematic priorities: sustainable development, democratic governance and peacebuilding, climate Change and disaster resilience, women’s empowerment, energy and environment, youth and innovation
Our 2023-2024 Annual Report captures how, through a holistic and dynamic approach, we have delivered sustainable results that are helping shape a more inclusive and resilient future for Jordan.
UNDP's sustainable development blogs are written by our team sharing approaches, lessons learned, and much more.
Our News centre is a one-stop shop for multimedia press coverage and in-depth information on development-related issues. We provide news announcements, press releases and statements for UNDP Jordan.
Our stories are visual and current snapshots of our work from the ground showing how communities and individuals are tackling development issues and moving the SDGs from paper to practice.
UNDP publications showcase the organization’s thought leadership and expertise and play a key role in fulfilling our mandate to support the realisation of the SDGs and encourage global development.
We help countries develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience in order to sustain development results.

In October 2022, the UNDP Jordan Accelerator Lab launched a co-creation process to develop this Catalogue of Recommendations and Interventions for Tourism in Madaba Governorate as part of its exploratory work on improving tourism. Two full-day workshops were organised to capture recommendations and interventions developed by the governorate stakeholders and local communities, which led to the creation of this Catalogue. This Catalogue will be part of a comprehensive knowledge product about the work of the Accelerator Lab on tourism in Madaba, which we aim to share with donors, governments, investors, and others who would be interested in the insights and contributing to the improvement of tourism in the governorate.
