N/A

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

The consumption of fossil fuel equals zero. The range is 160 kilometers on a full charge, this is the standard range for a mid-class electric car, but in Mexico there re only high-class electric car produced by major brands.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

The unit cost for this solution is not accessible for the majority of the population. Also, the car market in Mexico is highly competitive.
