Toven Electronics

> Brief description of the innovation

Toven will sell electronics gadgets at low prices. Gadgets such as smartphones and laptops are a necessity in this ever-evolving world. They are used to bring people around the world closer by allowing them to connect to the internet. However, the cost of gadgets is high and continues to rise due to factors such as inflation which is why Toven will allow users to purchase gadgets at low prices including on hire purchase will allow users to pay for gadgets over a period of time. Toven will sell electronic gadgets at prices slightly lower than market value in order to cater for the rising demand for gadgets. Due to the high cost of gadgets, we will have a hire purchase option so that users can pay for gadgets over a period of 2 – 6 months. This will enable increased access to gadgets by everyone, not just wealthy people. This business will not just offer brand new goods but second hand as well as certified refurbished gadgets which will be sold for much lower than the brand new ones but will be just as effective. This will allow people to have increased access to smartphones and other electronic gadgets.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The price will be the cost price of the gadget plus 35% of the cost price. Our net profit margin will be 25% of the revenue from every sale. We expect to sell to a minimum of 500 users in a year. Our innovation will create employment for sales people, a lawyer, web developers and repair technicians. Our target customers are people from ages 10 up to 65. For the hire purchase option, we will target students through partnering with schools allowing students access to laptops and other devices and people in employment because there is an assured source of income. The challenge prize will give us more exposure thereby attracting more customers as well as allowing us to purchase gadgets for re-sale. Our innovation will reduce the use of paper as people will be able to have meetings online via smartphones, tablets and laptops. We will also have gadgets such as drones which can be used for transportation thereby reducing carbon emission from other forms of transportation. Drones can also be used to reach hard to reach places thus can be used to track wildlife without putting any lives at risk.

> Technical Feasibility

The gadgets will be ordered from China where gadgets are very cheap. We have already established good relationships with our suppliers and identified websites where we can order supporting accessories for the gadgets. We will use a shipping company to bring the items into Zambia. They will reach within 7-14 days. We will offer cash sales as well as hire purchase. Hire purchase will require that the customer pays an initial deposit then pay the balance within 2-6 months. We hope to partner with various firms and organizations including banks to provide their employees with gadgets such as smartphones and laptops through hire purchase. We will use the Direct Debit service from banks for assured collection of funds. We will partner with schools and offer discounts and payment plans for students. We will use social media as a tool to advertise our products. We will have online influencers and brand ambassadors to increase visibility and reach a wider market.  We will also develop an app and website for easier visibility, transactions and sales. We will offer after sale services and warranty for all electronic gadgets. Other services will include gadget repairs even for items that were not purchased from us.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Electronics bring people from around the world closer through internet calls, video calls, e.t.c. In these times of the pandemic, people are advised to go digital. Our innovation will allow increased access to electronics by everyone. In this ever-evolving world, technology is a necessity. Smartphones for example allow users to do financial transactions from wherever they are. Money can be sent and received just via phone from across the world. Our innovation will foster this. Our business will also create employment and opportunities for many people. We will be able to sell gadgets at wholesale prices for people who would like to start the same business. Apart from smartphones and laptops, we will also have cameras among other things. Cameras will allow people to enhance their photography skills and possibly earn an income through photography. We will work with schools to allow students to purchase gadgets at fair prices. We will have payment plans so that even students from low income backgrounds can be able to access electronic gadgets that they may need to further their education.
