> Description of the solution

This platfrom is developed by the CGIAR Digital Innovation Initiative, offers micro - courses to farmers via WhatsApp. It capitalizes on the growing smartphone penetration, especially in regions like sub - Saharan Africa. Unlike conventional e - learning platforms, it addresses the challenges of self - regulated learning for farmers. Through a meticulous process involving learner profiling, goal setting, and iterative design, it crafts bite - sized micro - courses. These are bundled into learning routes; currently, "Field Digital Skills, Level 1" is available, comprising four courses on smartphone learning essentials.
Farmers can enroll by registering their mobile numbers on the CO - LAB Learning Network. All instructional videos are conveniently hosted on a YouTube playlist, ensuring easy access for learners seeking to enhance their digital skills and improve farming practices through this innovative, mobile - first learning solution.
