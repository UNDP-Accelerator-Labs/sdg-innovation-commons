Civic Networks and Innovation in the delivery of public services during Covid-19
JANUARY 17, 2022
The case of COVID-19 response in Thailand has demonstrated the criticality of whole-of-society and whole-of-government approaches in developing social innovation for effective crisis response and recovery. Public services delivery in a business-as-usual manner is no longer sufficient; innovative methods are required to provide assistance in this time of crisis. While the Thai government has launched a series of public health and socio-economic measures to support its citizens, the private sector, academia, and civic networks also play an important role in combatting the pandemic and assisting vulnerable groups throughout the crisis. It truly takes all of us, individuals from all walks of life as well as large institutions from all sectors, to overcome the crisis and move forward stronger.
