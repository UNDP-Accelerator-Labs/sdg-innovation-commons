Exploring Tackling Food Waste in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The challenge is that food waste ranks the highest (40-51 %) in Saudi Arabia out of all the waste. How do we tackle this?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

"A third of all the food produced for human consumption is wasted every year around the world. That is roughly 1.3 billion tonnes of food according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)". Among the the biggest food wasters in the world is in the GCC, where Saudi Arabia one of the highest (The startups tackling food waste in Mena - Wamda).  Approximately 33 percent of food is wasted according to a study by the Saudi Grains Organization conducted in 2019.  (https://www.arabnews.com/node/1774936/middle-east).   Some of the causes of food waste includes low level of awareness, cultural aspect of over hosting with huge amounts of food as a sign of hospitality. In addition, restaurants, hotel and catering services' poor organization in terms of reducing food waste, supermarkets dealing with expired goods.  Undesired effects : "The majority of organic waste goes straight to landfill sites where it becomes a pollutant, adding to greenhouse gases and leaching harmful chemicals into the soil and groundwater."  (https://www.edamasolutions.com/). In addition to high consumption of water and energy.

Attended a workshop in February 2021 regarding a SDG challenge for Saudi youth entrepreneurs where one of the initiatives focused on food waste management. In addition, there are a number of innovative food waste start-ups in the region that have been emerging as well as reports and campaigns around reducing food waste.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Saudi Accelerator Lab has initiated these discussions around food waste shedding light on its importance. In line with our role as an Accelerator Lab to constantly bring innovative ideas and approaches as well as identifying what's on the radar, this is an opportunity for UNDP to go outside of the usual partners they have and include more CSOs, Start-ups and Academia collaborations, which is what the organization aims to do more of. In addition, we are amplifying our role of UNDP as integrator by partnering with different relevant UN agencies such as UNEP as well as creating a link between our usual partners who are government entities and unusual partners who are CSOs, start-ups, incubators, and Academia and private sector. This is an opportunity to bring in new projects to UNDP.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Food waste is the highest percentage of waste in Saudi Arabia, where 33% of the food is wasted. In line with the country's vison and efforts to reduce food waste, the Saudi Accelerator Lab is exploring innovative ways to tackle food waste.

We are still at the preliminary phase of better understanding the scope and ecosystem of food waste in Saudi. Initial meeting are being arranged to see areas of collaboration.  An initiative stemmed from KAUST with seed funding from their Innovation Fund. This start-up focuses on turning organic waste into soil compost. They offer closed-loop solutions, the products are often distributed in the same community where the waste was collected. Would like to ask them if they have or would be interested to explore other ways of utilizing the food waste (energy, other products). They are very aware of the climatic context of Saudi and their composting processes reduces water use and cycle times that perform best in hot, arid climate conditions with ultra-high temperatures. They tackle two challenges: 1- waste pollution : the majority of organic waste goes straight to landfill sites where it becomes a pollutant, adding to greenhouse gases and leaching harmful chemicals into the soil and groundwater. 2- food and water security: “Because of the low fertility and water holding capacity of local sandy soils, desert agriculture is extremely inefficient. Saudi, for example, uses over 80% of its precious freshwater resources in agriculture but produces only 25% of its food. Food demand is also on the rise in the region, with pressure from a large and fast-growing population expected to see food demand double in the MENA region by 2050.”  (https://www.edamasolutions.com/)

We are still at the preliminary phase of better understanding the scope and ecosystem of food waste in Saudi. Initial meetings are being arranged to see areas of collaboration.  Considered the first Saudi food bank, it offers a service at 48-hour notice to individuals and organizations by either collecting leftovers in meal boxes in a hygienic manner or recycling food. Their visits to hotels, food courts, weddings, and other occasions have saved around 6 million meals so far. In 2015, they started an initiative to share meals in malls (most social space in Saudi) We could further develop the food they collect to use in alternative innovative ways.

We are still at the preliminary phase of better understanding the scope and ecosystem of food waste in Saudi. Initial meetings are being arranged to see areas of collaboration. We have an existing partnership with MEWA but not directly the Environmental Department. As the issue if tackling food waste is on their agenda and they have been doing activities and campaigns on this topic, it is very beneficial to have their support.

We are still at the preliminary phase of better understanding the scope and ecosystem of food waste in Saudi. Initial meetings are being arranged to see areas of collaboration. KSU is one of the strongest institutions in Saudi, Under the College of Food & Agriculture Sciences, they have done research on food waste in the Kingdom. It would be great to see what insights they have and find ways to utilize the knowledge and capacity they have as well as the engagement of youth in this activity.

UNEP have a partnership with MEWA, in the environmental department. Food waste is in their area of expertise.  They've recently produced a report on food waste where Saudi had great data (thanks to the Saudi Grains Organization). This activity would have a much stronger impact with this joint collaboration.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How to find innovative ways to tackle food waste in the Kingdom on Saudi Arabia? What we need to know: Understand the current state from different stakeholders and perspectives; understand the reason and drivers of food waste; identify key stakeholders and their roles; find innovative solutions; brainstorm with a variety of stakeholders on innovative ways to tackle food waste and how to create a multi-stakeholder approach of uniting efforts.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Community Mapping: Determines key stakeholders and supports in collection of data. Behavioral Insights: Supports in understanding the drivers and causes of food waste. Co-creation and participatory design: finding innovative solutions and brainstorming with a variety of stakeholders on innovative ways to tackle food waste and how to create a multi-stakeholder approach of uniting efforts. Prototyping: Testing these solutions and seeing how the dynamics work between the stakeholders.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The existing data on food waste is based on samples, it does not reflect the severity of the problem, nor tell spatiotemporal aspects. Thereby, we are one of the ideas is to try to tap into the collective intelligence of waste collectors themselves, on daily basis they go in two rounds to collect waste in predefined pathways, they know where's the trends, dumped food and the assumption that they have a repetitive patterns that occurs to them with the passage of time. Thereby, finding an easy way to tap into their collective intelligence will enable us & decision makers to have greater view of the problem in Saudi Arabia and will enable targeting solutions effectively. Easy ways could be given to waste collectors such as; tick box on paper, simple button on their smartphone (if they collectively have) or interviewing their superiors. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are already considering involving big entities such as the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs (to facilitate testing in chosen district), Saudi Food and Drug Authority (existing partners who have done campaigns on reducing food waste), Saudi Investment Recycling Company, AlMaraii Company (private sector supporting campaigns to tackle food waste) and other private companies who could support to help this experiment to grow.
