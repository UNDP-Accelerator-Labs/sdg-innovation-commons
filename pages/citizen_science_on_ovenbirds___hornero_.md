Overall goal: Collect and analyze observations of ovenbird nests (Furnarius rufus) from southern South America with a mobile application to learn more about this typical bird. Specific goals:  Explain the asymmetries in the nests of southern South American ovenbirds. Explain nest building behaviors and nest structures among southern South American ovenbirds.

Description of citizen participation  Using a mobile application, citizens are asked to report the observed nests, their location and some of their characteristics; in addition, they are asked to share photos. Data collection is simple and dynamic. Data can be uploaded in urban, rural, or natural areas.
