## Overall goal

Co-produce knowledge and systematize lessons learned from the agroecological transition of the Cuyo region, with special emphasis on soil management and changes in agricultural practices, based on discussions among different stakeholders. 
## Specific goals

Co-design an open technological infrastructure to systematize, share, and visualize relevant information for different agroecology stakeholders in the Cuyo region. 

Monitor soil health indicators with open laboratory tools and instruments. 

Gather information in a participatory manner about productive spaces and agricultural practices to assess their impact on soil health. 

Develop public communication strategies that make open data available, make information visible, and tell local stories about the agroecological transition. 
## Description of citizen participation

During in-person workshops, free and low-cost technologies are used to address different aspects related to soil health, as a way to channel discussions and promote a knowledge exchange among farmers. The goal is to “reanimate” soils through community, scientific, and artistic practices that trigger new ideas for the renewed soil. The tools developed are focused on visible dimensions of the soil, such as its inherent complexity, microbiological diversity and activity, and its relationship with organic matter. In each workshop, some aspect of soil health is addressed and a basic guide is produced for citizens to analyze their samples, share their soil stories, and share some insights and conclusions about their practices. Data collection and analysis uses baseline protocols that are then fed with local knowledge shared by producers. Moreover, freer research processes are developed where producers participate in all stages of the research, from design, production, analysis of the results, and elaboration of new work hypotheses.
