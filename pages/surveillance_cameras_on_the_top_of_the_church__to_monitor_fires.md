NGO "Gostynets" in Novoyavorivsk came up with a creative solution to monitor fires in the town that is surrounded by dried and highly inflammable peatlands. Since the local church is the highest building in the town with the best observation, they convinced the priest to allow them to install 3 HD cameras with a 360-degree view on the very top of it. They hired professional climbers, who installed the cameras and connected them to the free broadcasting service - so everyone from the local authorities, emergency services, and common residents could monitor the situation. It greatly improved the response rate and efficiency of the fire department to extinguish the fire on peat lands. Priest supported the effort by promoting non-burning practices among parishioners, saying that God sees even more clearly than these cameras. 

Journalists called this project "God's Eye"
