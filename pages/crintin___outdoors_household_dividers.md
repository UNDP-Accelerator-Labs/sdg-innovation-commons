The surrounding cities of the Region of Bafata are largely populated by the Mandinga tribe, due to lack of access to resources and materials such as cement from the capital cities, they use Crintin as house fences. The pictures show Jamba Sisse making these fences which he sells or gifts to his community for privacy as well as keeping their land safe.
