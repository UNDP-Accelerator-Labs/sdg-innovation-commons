Reimagining our relationship with plastic waste in Pakistan
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The Lab will explore what exactly entails reimagining our relationship with plastic waste in Pakistan further by testing whether plastic waste is the problem or waste management? whether we can turn waste into a resource? Most critically --- the heart of our experiment –we want to understand how we change the way we think about waste and the system around it by understanding the people’s behaviours and incentives in the system.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The issue of plastic pollution is a symptom of a larger system which is the linear take-make-waste model[1] in which products are designed to be used once and then discarded. The Lab has deduced that the issue of plastic waste needs to be treated as a symptom of the larger linear take-make-waste system which is what really needs to shift towards a circular economy model. The system shift will ultimately be the sustainable solution. Therefore, Lab’s learning question that we aim to answer is, can we reimagine our relationship with plastic waste in Pakistan? A core assumption for this work is that to meaningfully address the plastic waste challenge and create a systems shift will not be achieved through a traditional linear problem-solving project approach that features one (or a series of) single-point technical solutions.  We need a holistic approach that uses systems thinking and tests a combination of solutions that creates the conditions towards a systemic movement into a circular economy. However, this shift is not simply possible with a set of policy solutions and development projects alone. We must also find approaches that fundamentally change the way communities, government and private sector think about the problem of waste. In sum, the Lab’s learning portfolio of plastic waste and circular economy holds the following assumptions from its initial field exploration: ·       Not all plastic is bad: it is a product that still holds merit and can potentially even be turned into a resource.  As such outright bans is an intervention that ignores the intrinsic value of the material and could do more harm by leading to the production and use of more unsustainable materials. ·       Quality waste management is key: Quality and dependable waste management features a series of interdependent steps.  If one step is missing or compromised, the whole system is compromised (e.g. inadequate waste sorting procedures, unbridled consumption, antiquated recycling capacity, etc.) ·       Change how we think about waste: Human behavior is not rational/predictable and cannot be stewarded through traditional communications approaches; There is potential to deploy interventions that experiment with atypical areas for change. Understanding the motivations and behaviors that fundamentally drive how individuals, communities, private companies, and others interact with plastic waste management so that we can better manage the challenge is an example. Traditional approaches for this issue are ignoring this untapped potential. [1] https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/explore/plastics-and-the-circular-economy

We conducted systemic analysis and solutions mapping through community of practice that helped us to understand the context, policies and relevant systems (formal and informal) in place and how different categories of people experience it. We use a suite of techniques ranging from: ·       Exploration and  contextual Inquiry; identifying emerging trends and entry points in plastics management system ·       Solution Mapping; identifying innovative solutions and experiment leads through System Design and strategic foresight To understand the extent of the problem, UNDP Pakistan, along with Unilever Pakistan explored the journey of plastics in Pakistan particularly in Rahim Yar Khan with the citizens, industry players, government, and academia. After the contextual inquiry stage, we deep dived into Systemic Design —an approach developed by Alberta CoLab that combines Systems thinking with Design thinking – and strategic foresight work sessions which support heavily in informing the project at a strategic level by; ·       Having an in-depth understanding of the current system using the intelligence of the collective, ·       Being able to identify the stakeholders and hone out personas to know their motivations, influences and problems, ·       Identify shortcomings in the current systems, ·       Identify the roles of formal and informal influencers  ·       Being able to collectively brainstorm, ideate and envision the future of the system and multiple projected scenarios (desirable and undesirable), ·       Identify gaps between the current system and the desirable futures ·       Planning for the agents of change, with the right persons and develop a solid strategy with ready to experiment initiatives  ·       Identify experimental leads   Additionally, we used other techniques to explore and unpack the system; ·       Digital exploration: In August 2019, the Federal Government banned single use plastic. During our conversation with a group of citizens in a digital exploration session, one of the major insights was that plastics is not going anywhere from our surroundings as no end-of-life solutions for plastics management are identified yet or brought to fruition. ·       Research drives: Through our ethnographic research work with retailers, shopkeepers in Rawalpindi, one major insight was that the blanket ban on single use plastic will not alone solve the problem. We also found out that plastics are cheaper, durable, and accessible in the country, and with a struggling economy, a blanket ban will put many people out of jobs or reduce their customer footfall if no alternatives are provided. ·       Solutions Fest: We curated a community problem solving engagement to address the issue of plastics waste. We brought community of designers, start-ups, architects, environmentalists, social scientists, and ‘juggaris’. The idea was to bring together a community that can bring together multiple perspectives, and upcycle plastic waste into functions prototypes. Many prototypes emerged; from solar thermal mechanics that turns plastic waste into green-gas, to a conveyer belt system with refused plastic. Read more here.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Sustainable Waste Cycle: Economic Model Experiment with Unilever Pakistan Creating an economic model where the cost of non-recyclable plastics is being taken care of by money earned from recyclables? We aim to create a collection and recycling system in partnership with Unilever Pakistan to maximize the segregation of useful and recyclable plastics and place in mechanisms (privately or local government managed) to sell the reusable plastics in the market. The revenue will be directed towards managing the waste flows of non-recyclable plastics cost and effort tracking to find a sink point for such plastics i.e., heat recovery, cement kiln, LPG conversion, etc. The following visual elaborates on the ‘2 is equal to 4’model where double the amount of plastics (both recyclables and non-recyclables) will be managed at the cost of managing just recyclable plastics in the Rahim Yar Khan city. The Lab will be the connective tissue for private sector, government and stakeholders to advocate learnings on rethinking plastic waste and using systems thinking to get the ground ready for a move towards circular economy. After the completion of our first learning cycle, our next steps is below; ·       To create the shift in the system to the circular economy, we will build a movement engaging communities, leveraging partnerships, exploring sustainable financing to help push for plastics waste management agenda in Pakistan and beyond ·       UNDP will be the connective tissue for private sector, government and stakeholders to rethinking how they react to plastics in the country ·       Provide insights on a circular economic model that can be expanded nationally for government and private sector ·       Tested learnings to develop programmes on the issue of plastic waste for donors, development practitioners, private sectors and innovators ·       Demonstrate business opportunity for SMEs and investors on the opportunity of working greentech solutions ·       Develop scaling strategy for programmes ·       Exploring financing models for rethinking this work ·       Explore new financing mechanisms for donors to be fund portfolio over solo projects ·       Building new partnerships to funding further experimentation in the portfolio

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Our key learning goal of the portfolio is to create a circular system of plastics management in Pakistan by testing the new economic models, industrial and consumer behavior, policy shift and, engaging private sector and other non-traditional partners. We are exploring and testing solutions to rethink supply chains, behavior and future policy all together to effectively minimize plastic waste. It should not go out of mind even if it goes out of sight.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

This is a highly participatory approach bringing together stakeholders from the very beginning of the design process. Our experiment is bringing people and the way we think at the core from the initial exploration using ethnography to co-designing interventions with key stakeholders using design methods. No policy, project or innovative solution can work without people at the supply and demand side truly believing in it. Our first step is to understand the actors in the system and employ agile design processes that include human-centered design, collective intelligence and behavioural insights in combination of traditional baseline study and horizon scanning.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

there was no baseline available on plastics waste for our geographic intervention areas
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

UNDP is also finding partners and collaborative synergies across sectors to create a movement that enables the larger community to join us in responding to the ongoing systemic collapse and leakages in the system’s loop. A by-product of that is a circular economy for plastics— in which they never become waste, or have minimal leakage into the environment.  IFC. World Bank, ADB, ISDB and other development banks have a circular economy as a core development outcome- how can we leverage this? In the process to write a blog with the global Acclab team on leveraging private sector support for plastics waste management in Pakistan. A case study on the circular city- plastic waste management will be published in March/ It will aid our efforts for scale-up of the proposed economic model for RYK in other cities. Work with partners like WWF Pakistan/ other academic partners to promote the movement of rethinking relationship with plastic.
