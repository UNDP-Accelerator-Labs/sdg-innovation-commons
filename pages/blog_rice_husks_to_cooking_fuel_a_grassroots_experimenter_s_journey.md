RICE HUSKS TO COOKING FUEL – A
GRASSROOTS EXPERIMENTER’S JOURNEY

DECEMBER 2021

The potential of rice husks
as cooking fuel
Some years ago, Cletus Baalongbuoro noticed
smoke billowing from rice husks being burnt on
farms not too far from his home in Tamale in
Ghana’s Northern Region. The thick smoke was
polluting the atmosphere, making it difficult to
breathe.

Ghana’s annual rice production is estimated to be
over 900,000 tons, equivalent to over 650,000 tons
of milled rice. There is extensive cultivation in the
Northern Region, which along with the Upper East
and Upper West regions accounts for 50% of
paddy rice production. After harvesting and milling
rice, farmers often leave the husks as waste to rot.

value (energy per kg exuded during combustion) of
about 15.0 MJ/kg, less than corn at about 17 MJ/kg.
However, corn is a seasonal crop in Northern
Ghana, while increasingly rice is being cultivated in
different months of the year under irrigation. The
team chose to experiment with rice briquettes.

The Process

On a busy day, Cletus and his team (5 men and 15
in briquette production) visit
women
neighbouring farms to collect rice husks. Husks are
placed in a perforated metal drum with an inverted
chimney, along with a charring agent. Charring
maximizes calorific value. After charring, a binding
agent (cassava starch) is added and combined in a
mixer. Clay was tried as a binding agent, but while it
burns well, it generates more smoke and carbon
residue. The mixture goes
into a compacting
machine where briquettes are formed under high
pressure. Charring, mixing, and
compacting
machines are made by local artisans and the Gratis
Foundation. The funding through UNDP was used to
buy a mechanized compacting machine.

generating little, or no smoke. Some felt
that a product of this quality would be
more expensive than wood charcoal.

Further experiments then took place,
with 10 local women as product testers.
The testers placed equal weights of
charcoal and briquettes on two local
cooking stoves (“coal pots”) and ignited
them, to prepare equal quantities of
cassava starch in similar saucepans. The

Similarly, the testers boiled equal quantities of
white rice in similar saucepans on similar coal
pots, to test cooking time. Most said the rice
cooked quicker on the briquettes compared to
charcoal, by an average of 10 minutes. In both
experiments, the women noted there was less
dust/residue on their hands from the briquettes.

Challenges with compaction
Currently, the main challenge in producing rice
briquettes is the compaction process. Compaction
at high pressure is critical to avoid producing
briquettes that easily shatter, and heat poorly.

The
innovators have tried both manual and
mechanized compaction. In manual compaction,
human pressure is applied to moulds, to produce
12 briquettes at a time. Mechanized compaction
creates greater pressure and produces more
briquettes. During the experiments, the testers
noticed differences in texture and performance
between the manual and mechanized compaction
briquettes and expressed a clear preference for
the mechanized compaction briquettes.

Estimated cost
At full capacity, the briquette factory operated by
Cletus can produce about 2 tonnes per day.
Currently, the cost of setting up a similar factory
is around $12,000, which includes the costs of
premises, machinery and training of local people
to produce the briquettes. Operating costs are
estimated to be $1500 a month including staff
costs, as well as energy and transportation.

Involving local women as grassroots
experimenters to test briquettes in real-
life settings points to high levels of
satisfaction among these potential
consumers.
Given the abundance of rice husks in the
Northern Region and the Government’s
Planting for Food and Jobs policy to
encourage investment in farming, there
are opportunities to develop rice
briquettes as a grassroots-led energy
solution. In addition to reducing
deforestation, this may be a source of
income for the youth and women.
There are opportunities to leverage the
African Continental Free Trade Area
agreement (AfCFTA) to position the
Northern Region to export
environmentally friendly briquettes.
Ponna Briquettes forecasts a selling price
of Ghc1 per kg, compared to Ghc 1.50
per kg for charcoal. However, increased
demand for rice husks could mean they
are no longer free at the farm-gate.
There are also costs associated with
using charring, mixing, and compacting
machinery at scale which must be
factored in, but this must be seen in the
context of potential fuel savings for
consumers.
The experiments suggest that briquettes
can last up to twice as long as charcoal
i.e., for every 2kg of charcoal used, only
1kg briquette is required, reducing
monthly expenditure on cooking fuel by
at least 50%.

Lab is working with Ponna
Briquettes to optimize production
and explore avenues for scaling
up.
7. With more partnerships, rice
briquettes could be adopted on
large scale, as eco-friendly fuel to
help save many trees from being
cut for charcoal. Saving more
trees means we could deliver
more than 40 per cent of total
emissions reductions offered
globally by low-cost solutions.
