> Brief description of the innovation

RedeEm 1 is a compact and reliable invention with multiple innovative functions whose purpose is to solve most challenging household problems with regards to Energy,Health and Replacing some household electronic appliances such as Security Monitoring System, Current Old Touchable light bulb switches, Amplifiers, Inverters, Phone Chargers, Generators, MP3 Players, Car Battery Chargers, Decoders etc into one device.We believe that RedeEm 1 will in the future be the worlds most admired and outstanding household invention.It is developed for individual home use only.
RedeEm 1 is powered by either national grid or using a 12v car battery by use of Remote control/Toggle buttom for turning ON and OFF.
Currently *RedeEm 1* is BUILT in with the following: 
1.A 12V car battery can easily be converted by RedeEm 1 to 230V,1300W of power by recycling 20% of this electricity to power almost all household electrical appliances at once, such as computers, light bulbs, TV sets, phone chargers, decoders, Radios etc. no need to worry about Load Shading.
2. Long range Security monitoring system to be used during the day and night to alert the user.
3. Unique external Touchless Light build Switch that controls light bulbs by waving a hand away from it with an adjustable sensitivity.
4. Unbeatable Powerful Home Amplifier.
5. FM Radio receiver. 
6. USB flash MP3 Player 
7. Bluetooth system.
8. Fire/Heat Detection System.
9. Practical USB PORTs that makes it possible to connect a USB flash and an external controller for controlling *RedeEm 1*,with control keys  for Radio, USB playing, Next, Pause, Play, Volume, Turning Bluetooth system ON/OFF, plugging the USB flash, and charging phones and tablets.
10. Fast Car battery charging system.
11. The integrated LEDs on *RedeEM 1* indicates the operating status.
More improvements shall be made on our brand new invention just like cell phones companies keep making improvements on their phones.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

To start with, when we manufacture RedeEm 1  we shall supply them to 3 identified retail shops that are locally based in our town kabwe that we are already in the process making  agreements with  on the percentage that will go to us and to them after selling our products and do online marketing, therefore generating income for us and to them.However, we shall also improve the operations of their businesses as the people who will be coming to buy our products from their shops they will also be interested to purchase other products from them. Our Target market are individual household owners aged between 27 to 50. Right now we are capable of making 4 products while the demand is high,when the challenge prize is awarded to us we shall carefully manage it and be capable enough to meet the demand of our product to the people hence making our business(start up) grow because a lot of people are looking forward to having RedeEm 1 in their households,after giving a demonstration and the problem we have come to solve.
Our innovation is environmental friendly,it does not cause pollution or danger to humanity etc. as we take note safety to the environment and Humanity.

> Technical Feasibility

To start with, RedeEm 1 is designed by making our own Hardware,Casings and Programming of Microcontrollers  from scratch by linking up several electronic components and our own portable Step up and step down Transformers to come up with one usable brand new product for home use only.Businesses in Zambia must begin to embrace making our own TECHNOLOGY products from scratch for present and futuristic use.
RedeEm 1 is powered by either national grid power or using a 12v car battery by use of  remote control for turning ON and OFF.
RedeEm 1 converts 12v to 230V,1200W to be used to power almost all household electrical appliances at once.While it is producing this power, on the hardware it is being recycled back to the battery at the fast rate in order to extend usage time. *RedeEm 1* comes with our uniquely made external Touchless light bulb switch for turning house lights ON/OFF by waving a hand away from it at with adjustable sensitivity. Security monitoring to be used for house Yard, poetry and garden monitoring from theft. Further more reliable components are well linked up to accomplish FM Radio,USB flash mp3 player and a  Bluetooth system. The control board is also designed with unbeatable Powerful Home Amplifier for music playing.Car battery charging system is designed in such a way that the user is capable of plugging RedeEm 1 to household 230v adapter and our invention coverts this down  to 13v to charge any 12v car battery and power RedeEm 1 hardware. Along side with this our invention has practical USB Ports that enable the user to charge phones, tablets, play songs and plugging an external controller for *RedeEm 1* control keys for Next, Pause/Play, volume, Bluetooth control. Our invention is also capable of detecting the presence of room high temperatures and give an alert audible sound.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation will improve the lives of people in many different ways and meet the needs of people, for it is designed with vast problem solving functions.When it comes to clean alternative energy to power household electrical appliances for example when there is load Shedding or the house is not connected to the  national grid. RedeEm 1 will do great job to power households appliances to make work be done effectively at anytime hence making house work be done any time and make life easier. Furthermore we believe an  external Touchless light bulb switch will start to replace old touchable light bulb switches.Our invention will make the way of living more smart by preventing contraction of transferrable diseases. A lot of people are saying this is a great type of switch they have to shift to and other great functions that come with RedeEm 1 fill humanity with what it needs from technology products.  Our invention is important to the current market because it is one unique reliable compact product for the household that will be purchased at an affordable price that will  make people shift from using different unreliable technology products to using RedeEm 1.
