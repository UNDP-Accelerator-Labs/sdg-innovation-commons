## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Exploration of data loss and possible recovery mechanisms through digitization in the Amhara region 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is how we can devise resilient long-term data management solutions at the lower government structures that have been affected by the war in northern Ethiopia through assessing and identifying the data loss extents and aspects in one of the Amhara recovery project’s target geographical locations.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Amhara region and particularly its northern section was left off several livelihoods and institutional damages due to the war in northern Ethiopia on top of COVID-19, negative social and economic repercussions.   This has been causing disruption the public services that have to rely on data sources such as the justice system, financial and economic sectors, health services, etc. Therefore, having a data recovery mechanism could ease the work process and improve data driven decisions and interventions in the socioeconomic sector, serving justice to the public, and setting other government services.  

The UNDP through the consultation of regional, zonal and Woreda level government stakeholders, has made an in-depth exploration of the war induced social and economic problems, designed an Amhara recovery project. The project has multiple output components such as ensuring continuity of critical government functions; strengthening capacity of the regional government to plan, implement and monitor rehabilitation, restoration, and recovery initiatives; enabling restart of economic activities; and supporting mental health and psychosocial support to those affected. The core focus will be on restoring state capacity and ability to deliver services. Particular attention will be given to most vulnerable women, whose income and assets have been depleted due to the ongoing conflict as well as those who have been the victims of GBV, their households (especially children) and youth (notably, young men who are currently without work or any income) (The project Prodoc).   

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Data recovery and support of repository IT devices are among the priority items to be supplied to the affected parts of the region, where mechanisms of data recovery could add value on the functionality of their system. Therefore, this could be further area of exploration to the accelerator lab in order to learn the dimension of data loses and device implementable solutions that could support the business continuity in one of the affected parts of the region preferably at the lower government structure.

The northern Ethiopia war has opened the vulnerability of Lalibela city administration and Lasta Woreda for considerable data loss for internally caused data destructions and external damages and robbery of data along with data storage systems and computers. The former damage cause refers to data losses caused by individuals or groups of residents to fulfill their financial, material, and justice needs, while the latter is caused by the war aggressors act to intentionally destroy data that were stored in computers as well as hard copies archived with in warehouses constructed by rudimentary materials. As a result, the government offices functions are slightly, or partly disrupted. This has brought frustrations by the government officers and experts as their routine way of doings have become cumbersome due to lost data or messed archived evidences, which made traceability of documentations an extreme challenge. On the other hand the service recipient community is dissatisfied as they have received whether an incomplete service or return without getting the right service. Among many problems, loss of prosecution related documents, land agreements and land titles, enterprises sales and financial documents, human resource personal files have critically affected government business. This will ultimately impact on lack of access to justice and poor area-based security analysis, improper revenue collection and loss of some businesses, unfulfilled rights of employees for promotions based on performances on personal files, etc.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Cognizant of the fact that introducing complete infrastructural support to revive government business might not be successful if essential data are recovered to run government services and decisions. Therefore, the accelerator lab has singled out the data element for further exploration to understand the extent of the data loss, and possible recovery mechanisms, and devise a resilient data handling system, despite future potential shocks. The data recovery mission output finally is sought to be integrated with the Amhara recovery interventions and contributes to the overall goal of the project.  

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

How might we regenerate and recover the data we lose because of war and destruction? 

 

How can we use digitization as an enabler to minimize data loss and introduce possible data regeneration methods?

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

UNDP Ethiopia had proceeded consecutive missions towards to the Amhara and Afar regions to explore the socioeconomic and governance aspects of the war repercussions at different tires ranging the senior leadership and expert's levels. The country in collaboration with the lab missions had resulted in the Amhara recovery plan, which addresses socioeconomic and psychosocial aspects of losses. Moreover, to support the government’s business continuity the recovery plan has offered logistical support such as vehicles, computers, servers, other office equipment along with human capacity buildings. The Amhara recovery project has already identified the most affected parts of the region of Wag-Hemera and North Wollo Zones (comprising of areas such as Lalibella, Gashena and Woldia), as well as parts of South Wollo Zone (including Dessie and Kombolcha) were prioritized. The project plans to support each Woreda and the public institutions/sector offices in these areas need to get in-kind support such as computers and other IT equipment, which are essential in the data generation and handling system. Following that the lab has planned to collaborate in singled out the data element for further exploration to understand the extent of the data loss, possible recovery mechanisms, and devise resilient data handling system, despite future potential shocks.
