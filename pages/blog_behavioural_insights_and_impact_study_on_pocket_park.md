ACKnOwlEdgmEnT

Amid the unplanned settlement, growing urbanization, and increasing pollution, the need

for pocket parks, especially in the cities of Nepal, is more than ever. Keeping in mind, VRIKSHA

foundation developed a pocket park at Jawalakhel, with the support of Lalitpur Metropolitan

City, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Wide Fund for Nature

(WWF) in early 2020. In this context, a study— BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS AND IMPACT STUDY ON

POCKET PARK—has been carried out to measure the effect of the pocket park and the associated

behavioral change in nearby households, entrepreneurs, and park visitors after its construction.

This study, commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), was

conducted by Bikash Udhyami which includes the group of experts Mr. Tulasi Nepal, Assistant

Professor Mr. Naveen Adhikari, Mr. Santosh Gartauala, and Mr. Bipin Sinjali. The research was

conducted in close supervision and technical guidance from Ms. Purnima Shakya Bajracharya,

Head of Exploration, Mr. Bisam Gyawali, Head of Experimentation, Ms. Aliska Bajracharya, Head

of Solution Mapping of UNDP Accelerator Lab Nepal, and Mr. Elvis Lundberg, Disability Inclusive

Development UNV Program Officer of UNDP.

Apart from the study design team from UNDP Accelerator Lab and Bikash Udyami, this study

would not have been possible without the joint effort from the enumerators, representatives from

the local governments, local people, and entrepreneurs. We greatly appreciate their effort and

cooperation during the study.

background

VRIKSHA foundation developed a pocket park at Jawalakhel, with the support of Lalitpur

Metropolitan City, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Wide Fund

for Nature (WWF) in early 2020. Before constructing the pocket park, the space area was filled

with construction materials, unmanaged huts, and garbage. Despite being just opposite to a big

hospital (Alka Hospital Pvt. Ltd), and surrounded by several commercial buildings, the place was

misused for a long time. The construction of the pocket park started in that location in December

2019 and was completed in January 2020. With an area of around 600 square feet, the pocket park

is featured with greenery, lighting, seating arrangement, a wheelchair-friendly aisle, and many

more.

The study was carried out to measure the effect of the pocket park and the associated behavioral

change in nearby households, businesses, and park visitors. For this study, a total of 202 responses

were collected using a retrospective pre-post survey, out of which 104 were from park visitors,

57 from entrepreneurs, and 41 responses from household people. Similarly, to garner insights

on whether the pocket park has generated any impact on the local policymakers or not, the

Key Informant Interview was administered with the policymakers and the leaders within the

municipality. Descriptive statistics such as average, the percentage change have been used to

analyze data.

major findings

The survey with households suggested that physical attributes of the space area are improved by

about 2.5 times to pre-construct scenarios. Similarly, from a psychological perspective, the park

has contributed to changing people’s experiences such as pleasantness and relaxation while being

in the park. These experiences were changed by more than 2 times to the surveyed households.

When it came to performing the physical activities in the park, households and visitors have

increased activities like exercising, resting, waiting, walking, and so on by more than 2.3 times,

benefiting social cohesion, health and well-being. However, the study found that people appeared

to be somehow reluctant to contribute and collaborate with other community members, local

policymakers, and entrepreneurs in the issues of open spaces, such as initiating other pocket parks

and managing them.

The visitors also found the park transfigured in almost all the aspects that the survey questions

asked. They reported that overall space area’s attributes such as physical condition, space

arrangement, greenery, and so on have increased by about more than 1.5 times on average. From

the perspective of persons with disabilities, especially wheelchair users, space areas have been

made suitable and comfortable for them, however, they see a lot to be improved in the park in

1

regard to the easy accessibility from the entrance as well as the exit point of the park. People with

psychosocial disabilities found the park pleasant and accessible, but they want more improvement

in the lighting system and more space in the pocket park area.

The survey also captured the impact of the park on local businesses. And, it has been found that

park has a no larger contribution to increasing the business activities like’s sales volumes, increase

in asset value and so on. Similarly, the park also did not contribute to fostering a relationship

between entrepreneurs with community people and local policymakers. However, it has

contributed to increasing the safety and security in the business area by decreasing the incidents

of brawling, illegal parking, and so on.

The study also found that the metropolitan city has initiated dedicated projects to convert open

public spaces into parks. Local policymakers seem sensible towards the issues of open space in

their surroundings. However, they pointed out the acquisition of encroached public land is one of

the major challenges to convert public spaces to parks.

Recommendations

Based on the findings and suggestions gathered during the study, it was observed that there

required concrete steps for better improvements while constructing similar parks.

• Physical Attributes: To improve the physical attribute of the park, almost all the respondents

recommended the need for a public toilet, drinking water facility, and more greenery in

the park. They also suggested adding shedding to the existing park to make it more useful.

Branding of the park with an appropriate name was also recommended to give it a more

specific identity.

• Collaborations: The finding suggested that there was a tenuous collaboration among the

park’s stakeholders such as households, local businesses, and policymakers to discuss and take

joint action on the issues of the pocket park, such as maintenance and sustainability, therefore,

the role and responsibility of joint users committee with the people from households,

local entrepreneurs, and local policymakers need to be expanded to make the pocket park

sustainable and properly maintained.

Though there appears some level of collaboration between the community, local institutions,

enterprises, and local government while constructing the park, it is essential to continue and

strengthen such collaboration for future maintenance and sustainability of the park. Besides,

strong collaboration among the local community, entrepreneurs, and local policymakers is

needed to develop similar other parks. Since the importance of public space is still beyond the

public discussion, initiating campaigns and fostering strong collaboration among local people

with local policymakers and entrepreneurs will further encourage to have more voices in this

issue.

BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS AND IMPACT STUDY ON POCKET PARK

ExECUTIVE SUMMARY

•

Inclusive designs: To make the parks more inclusive and user-friendly, the design of the park

should be prepared and tested from the perspective of child-friendliness and persons with

disabilities from the very beginning. To make the existing park accessible to wheelchair users,

the entrance and exit of the parking area are to be improved so they can enter the park and

exit without difficulty. The internal track designed to ride a wheelchair should also be improved

by smoothing the track. To make the park suitable for visually impaired people a hand railing

should also be placed.

• Respecting tradition and customs: While constructing pocket parks/open spaces, special
attention should be given to preserving the traditional architecture and customs. Therefore,

the people of local communities should be included from the very beginning of—park design

to making the park sustainable.

• sustainability: To maintain and protect the park, more responsibility should be given to the

local community along with the local governments.

background of the study

VRIKSHA foundation developed a pocket park at Jawalakhel, with the support of Lalitpur

Metropolitan City, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the World Wide

Fund for Nature (WWF) in early 2020. The pocket park was designed to create breathing space

and tackle urban issues in Lalitpur City by transforming unused public spaces into pocket parks

for everyone, regardless of their age, ethnicity, and disability. At the same time, it was expected to

increase positive messages, promote mental well-being and promote the city's aesthetic beauty.

Before constructing the pocket park, the space area was filled with construction materials,

unmanaged huts, and garbage. Despite being just opposite to a big hospital (Alka Hospital Pvt.

Ltd), and surrounded by several commercial buildings, the place was misused for a long time. The

construction of the pocket park started in that location in December 2019 and was completed in

January 2020. With an area of around 600 square feet, the pocket park is featured with greenery,

lighting, seating arrangement, a wheelchair-friendly aisle, and many more.

In this context, the study has assessed the park's impact on the targeted people in line with the

objective of park development. The park has expected to benefit people of surrounding areas,

businesses, and park visitors, including wheelchair users and hospital visitors. The study also

explored how this initiation could help the local government officials improvise their plans and

designs for constructing similar parks.

The benefit of the Public Park

Parks provide environmental, health, recreational, and economic benefits to the public. The better

managed green infrastructure such as the park offers a clean environment adding aesthetic

value to the surrounding. The public may benefit from recreational activities such as relaxation,

exercise, tourism, and cultural programs. Parks promote more social interactions and community

engagement which contribute to social cohesion. They also provide space during emergencies

such as fire, damage of personal building, and in the event of a natural disaster such as an

earthquake.

Children and the elderly groups derive more benefits from the park by better utilizing their leisure

time. Such activities are directly linked with the mental well-being of an individual. The parks also

offer economic benefits. They appreciate the property values, increase business income due to

increased visitors' flow, and contribute to municipal revenue.

Several studies were conducted to examine the impact of green space on human health, self-

reported well-being, and quality of life in the green area's neighborhood community (Benton

et al., 2018) worldwide. These studies reported that green spaces positively impacted the

community well-being measured in terms of health, life satisfaction, and many more. When green

infrastructures are developed in a community, it is assumed to bring community people closer

to each other and increase social cohesion and community interactions, resulting in a sense of

security (Dipeolu et al., 2020). Miam et al. (2012) conducted a study using the Key Informant

Interview (KII) and actual observation method to assess the impacts of Madhupur National Park

on Local Peoples' Livelihood in Bangladesh. They found that people living in the park's proximity

could earn income from business activities due to a flow of visitors.

i Introduction

Similarly, by using descriptive and inferential statistics, Iorpenda et al. (2020) found that parks can

positively impact the quality of recreation, depending on park access, aesthetics, cost efficiency,

park security, biodiversity, and park layout. They collected data using purposive sampling from the

park beneficiaries. Numerous other studies have been carried out to explore the potential benefits

and impacts of urban parks on socio-economic well-being and environmental protection with
positive correlation2.

Keeping in view the benefits of Public Parks, the Government of Nepal has prioritized the
construction of public parks3. Amid the unplanned settlement, growing urbanization, and
increasing pollution, the need for such parks, especially in the cities of Nepal, is more than ever.

The Urban Development Strategy (2017) aims to have at least 5 % of the total area as an open

space in each ward. The same strategy seeks to mitigate urban problems such as air and waste

pollution while promoting public health, aesthetic beauty, greenery, and the city's culture and

arts through availing open spaces and parks. The Urban Environment Management Guideline

(2011) delineates the norms, codes, and requirements of Public Park and open spaces. Likewise,

the metropolitan cities have also internalized the need for public parks and have reflected them

in their periodic plan. In such context, this paper aims to understand the recreational, health, and

economic benefits of a park taking a newly constructed part in Lalitpur as a case.

BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS AND IMPACT STUDY ON POCKET PARK
II mEThOdOlOgy

This study uses a mix-method to identify the benefits from the park, combining both quantitative

and qualitative information. Quantitative information was collected through a well-structured

questionnaire administered with visitors, residential households, and the business community

in the park surrounding. The qualitative insights were derived from the officials of Lalitpur

Metropolitan city through semi-structured Key Informant Interviews (KIIs).

1.

sampling design

The samples were collected from the individuals and entrepreneurs living within the 0.5 KM radius

from the park and regular park visitors, including persons with disabilities. The study targeted the

residential areas and local people to collect data on local people's perspectives on the pocket park

and their perceived changes in behavior.

A random sampling technique was followed to select the respondent among the park visitors.

Every third visitor was chosen randomly among the park visitors entering the park between 9

AM-5 PM during a particular day. This was carried out for ten consecutive days. Through the social

innovation experiment, 104 responses from park visitors were collected, including six persons with

disabilities.

For a household survey, a systematic random sample was followed. A tentative number of

households within a radius of 500 meters from the park was obtained through a discussion with

the ward office of the Lalitpur Metropolitan City office. In absence of a complete frame, every

second household was selected for an interview among the local residential households. A

similar strategy was followed for selecting the business entities. Here, every second entrepreneur

was selected for the interview. The research team conducted door-to-door visits of households

and business enterprises to participate in the survey using structured questionnaires. Forty-one

individuals living in households and 56 people working in small to medium enterprises within a 0.5

KM radius were interviewed.

Respondent groups and sample

2.1 Respondent groups

Parks may create an impact in several ways based on their usability. Therefore, park users have

been categorized into nearby households, local entrepreneurs, and park visitors. Questionnaires

for each group were prepared to capture group-specific characteristics. Further, in order to derive

insights about the park from a local policy maker's perspective, the Key Informant Interview (KII)

was also administered with officials of Lalitpur Metropolitan City and community leaders.

3.

data Collection approach

Ideally, baseline information would be required to compare the outcomes between baseline

(pre-construct) and end-line (post-construct) scenarios. As there was no data available to reflect

the pre-construct scenarios of the pocket park, a retrospective survey was carried out to generate

pre-and-post data. Pre-construct data were generated by asking about visitors' perception and

visualization of the space before constructing the park. To minimize the recall bias, respondents

who can well recall experiences/perceptions were interviewed.

8

BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS AND IMPACT STUDY ON POCKET PARK

3.1 Retrospective Pre-post survey

The method of the retrospective pre-post survey has been used to measure the changes

in practice and behavior of households/communities and entrepreneurs. In this method,

respondents were asked to rate their pre-and post-experiences after constructing the park. This

provided two sets of responses for two different periods. The pre-construct responses would

be based on recalling actual experiences they had gone through. They have to recall their

experiences/perceptions going back to the pre-construct scenario of the park. This became the

baseline data of the study. Similarly, to collect data that reflect post-construction experiences,

respondents were asked to rate their real-time experiences/perceptions. To measure actual

changes, the recalled experiences/perceptions of respondents of pre-construct scenarios were

compared with the real-time experiences with post-construct scenarios.

3.2 Prototyping

To identify attributes, trends, and patterns of the park visitors, including persons with disabilities,

the method of social innovation experiment has been developed and administered. Due to the

absence of pre-construct information, prototypes like sketches and pictures were used as toolkits

to generate the pre-construct information. The visualization tools are attached in Annex 9.

The respondents were asked to provide a score on a number of park-related attributes, quality

attributes of the park, and changes in personal and social activities. The perceived behavioral

change of park visitors has been explored and measured by exposing the research participants to

the park's pre and post construct scenarios. The visualized perceptions of visitors concerning the

pre-construct scenario have been measured and compared with the actual perceptions.

3.3 Key Informant Interview (KII)

With the impetus gained from the experiences of this project, local government is better

positioned to initiate similar other projects, including different facets that are likely to affect the

decision-makers at the local government regarding construction, management, and utilization of

open spaces. For this, the KIIs have been carried out with the Mayor, and two ward chairpersons

of the Lalitpur Metropolitan City, including the president of Tamrakar Sewa Samaj, Lalitpur. At the

same time, we explored the sustainability aspects of utilizing open spaces through KIIs. A semi-

structured questionnaire was developed and administered to the relevant officials.

4.

data Collection Tools

4.1 Questionnaire & Checklist

A set of questionnaires for each respondent group was prepared. In addition to the background

information of the respondent such as age, gender, educational level, and occupation, the

questionnaire contained series of questions to collect the information on perception about

park attributes, benefits, and impacts. The respondents were asked about the pocket park's

contribution to change in the quality of life, social interaction, and physical activities using a

score-based question. For the score, the respondents were asked to provide a score between

1 to 5 based on their perception about and experience with the park. For the KII, a semi-

9

II Methodology
structured questionnaire was prepared. Detail of surveyed questionnaire and semi-structured KII

questionnaire has been given in Annex 8 and 9 respectively.

Kobo-toolbox application was used to digitize the questionnaire and record the responses via

electronic devices (tablets/ mobiles). This was to ensure that errors in response recording are

minimized and efficiency in data collection time is optimized.

5.

data Analysis

Descriptive statistics such as mean, percentage, standard deviation have been used to analyze

data. First, the average score was obtained for each parameter for both pre-and post-construct

scenarios. The difference in average score between pre and post construct scenarios was then

calculated to gauge the level of change in the selected parameters. A two-tail paired t-test was

performed to see the statistical significance of the changes. While the change in average scores

was used to quantify the changes between pre and post construct situations, the findings were

further supported with qualitative information derived from KII. The data collected during KII was

later transcribed on a thematic basis and that information was used in the relevant section. In

order to clean and analyze survey data, Excel has been used.

6.

limitations of the study

Collecting primary data amid the COVID-19 was a challenge. In addition, the study has a few

methodological limitations that the reader should consider. First, the study has no baseline

information. Accordingly, a pre-construct scenario was created with a visualization tool. We believe

the use of such a tool has helped in minimizing the recall biases. Second, the study measures

the changes in intermediate outcome variables such as a change in environment, lifestyle of

the public, business activities, and so on between pre and post construct scenarios. The use of

the word 'impact', therefore, should be understood in its rudimentary form as no counterfactual

analysis is done in the study. Third, this report aims to identify the dimensions where the construct

of the park could offer benefits to the public. Accordingly, scores generated here are based on

personal opinions and feelings of the respondents and interviewees and their perceptions about

the park. Fourth, since a few people with disabilities (PwDs) participated in the survey, their

responses should not be generalized to the overall population of PwDs.

7.

Characteristic of respondents

The survey was conducted with 202 people altogether. Among them, 104 were park visitors, 57

were entrepreneurs and 41 were local household individuals. In every cohort of the respondent,

the proportion of females was less than 30%. Out of 104 park visitors, six were the person with

disabilities (PwDs). Among them, three PwDs were wheelchair users, and two were with psycho-

social disability and the remaining one was visually impaired.

1.

Impact of the Pocket Park on survey Participants

In the vicinity of the pocket park, at least within a radius of 500 meters, no other parks were

available. In this context, the construction of such green space could benefit people in several

ways through the increase in physical activities, help them understand the importance of open

spaces among others.

The effect of the park on the household's psychological, sociological, and decision-making

behaviors was assessed and analyzed. Change in psychological perception was measured through

households’ feelings on the attributes of pocket parks. Similarly, the sociological dimension was

assessed through the behavioral change of the households in physical activities. How these

perceived psychological and behavioral changes have driven them to change their understanding

of the open space was then measured and explained.

The pocket park is located in the business area of Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. Assuming pocket park

construction could generate more business and lured more customers/clients, the study also tried

to capture the magnitude of change if they realized any.

Similarly, with being a busy area crisscrossing thousands of people every day, the park could

benefit visitors in a number of ways. In this context, this study explored the magnitude of changes

observed by the visitors in terms of the attributes and benefits of the park.

2.

Perception towards Physical Attributes of the Pocket Park

The findings suggested that the construction of the pocket park has greatly changed people’s

perception of the indicators measured under the physical attributes of the park. As the space area

was encroached and not properly utilized before, the survey also reflected how people observed

changes in the area against the physical attributes. Prior construction, across all the categories

of survey participants, the average rating to physical attributes are found to be somewhere

between 1 to 2.5, one being ‘the poorest quality’ and five beings ‘extremely good’ quality of park

attributes. The survey found that households have rated the space area as the poorest amongst

other attributes before the park construction, whereas the park visitors seem to be rating more

generously compared to the households and entrepreneurs to the same. Variation in the ratings

was due to the difference in survey techniques while collecting the data. Households were sharing

their perception based on their own actual observation/experience, while visitors had to give their

rating on the basis of the pre-construction scenario of the space area.

After the construction of the park, all survey participants—households, entrepreneurs, and park

visitors—have provided ratings with more than 4 scorings for these attributes. Compared to pre-

construct scenarios, the result clearly indicates that the place has been transfigured in a number

of ways, making it physically attractive and user-friendly. However, the magnitude of such change

was found to be different depending upon the group of respondents. For instance, compared

to household and park visitors, the entrepreneurs provided marginally higher ratings to these

attributes.

The mean difference scores which explain the magnitude of change in the physical attribute of

the park show significant changes that have been observed after the construction of the park.

Such score is 3.43 points, an improvement of 291% for the physical condition of the space area in

the household group, followed by 3.14 (202%) and 2.63 (169%) points for entrepreneurs and park

visitors respectively. The trend of having almost more than 2 points mean difference across all the

attributes on a scale of 5-point rating exhibits above 200% improvement on positive changes to

the appearance of the space area after constructing the park.

It is important to note that the space area was in a dilapidated condition prior to the construction

of the park. Now, it has been transfigured into a space with lighting, greenery, proper seating

arrangements, attractive concrete foundation, and so on. In this context, it was no surprise to have

a generous rating. The only concern was the measurement of the magnitude of such change in the

space area that people have realized. The survey showed a notable change that was statistically

significant at less than 1 percent significance level (see annexes 1, 2, and 3).

Psychological Perception of the households towards the
Attributes of Park

The study tried to explore the psychology of individuals living in the nearby households while

being in the space area before and after the construction of the park. Pleasantness, cleanliness of

surrounding, relaxation, sense of security, and many other aspects that could reflect households’

psychology around the park has been measured and analyzed. The implicit assumption of

measuring psychological aspects was to investigate whether these aspects have created any

impacts on the behaviors, particularly, of household people around the park-related activities.

The survey revealed households’ positive outlook towards the psychological aspects measured

after the construction of the park. It can be seen from figure 5 that people had an unfavorable

feeling towards the space area before the construction of the park, with most of the responses

clustered around rating 1. Since the space area of being filthy, unsuitable to do activities like

resting, exercising, waiting, it can be easily understood that space would not provide any benefit

to the people who visited that place. However, after the construction, the ratings were more

towards average to higher, depending upon how each individual perceived the change post-

construction of the park.

III Results and Discussion

It has been found from the mean difference that feeling about cleanliness has changed 3.28 points

with about 300% positive changes, followed by attractiveness (237%) and pleasantness (227%).

Similarly, the feeling about relaxation has also increased by almost 218% and the sense of safety

by 151%. With these positive changes in all dimensions of the psychological aspects, it can be

assumed that the park has been capable to change survey participants’ park-related activities,

behaviors, and decision-making. The statistical significance of the perceived changes supported

the robustness of such changes. All changes are significant at less than one percent p-value.

As discussed in the previous section, the positive changes in the households are expected

to change their involvement in park-related activities. Hence the individuals residing in the

nearby households were asked whether they have experienced a change in their daily activities

particularly on exercising, recreation, socializing, and so on after the construction of the park.

Before constructing a pocket park, the neighborhood reported almost no personal and social

activities there while park visitors imagined the chances of few social activities. Since the

household respondents were rating these activities based on their real experiences while park

visitors responded on the basis of pictorial visualization, there has been visible variation between

actual and imaginary experiences.

The study found that there has been a significant increase in park-related activities after its

construction. At the same time, park visitors also reported that the area was suitable and safer for

waiting, resting, exercising, and socializing. It is interesting to note that the average rating across

these activities among household people and park visitors was found to be almost similar in the

post-construct scenarios.

In the case of household, the mean difference of 3.08 point, with 268% changes, for using the park

for resting purposes shows that people have started utilizing the space by more than 2.5 times

compared to the pre-construct scenario followed by waiting, socializing such as gathering and

talking with friends and other community people.

Similarly, there has been a significant decrease in the practice of illegal parking of vehicles (51%),

followed by a decrease in the practice of dumping waste/construction materials in the space area

(55%). All the changes are statistically significant with less than 1 percent significance level.

In terms of the usefulness of the park for resting, waiting, exercising, socializing, and so on,

the average rating points reflected stronger preferences towards lighter tasks such as walking,

waiting and resting. This choice was particularly due to the smaller size of the park. The visitors

also expressed that the construction of the park has also contributed to increasing the safety and

security of the surrounding by 47% after the park construction. All the results reported significant

at less than 5% P-value.

Impact of the park on household’s understanding and decision
making

Prior to the construction of the park, people from the local community actively participated

in discussions related to the managing of the pocket park. They mainly contributed water and

electricity required for the construction of the park. The President of the Tamrakar Samaj (an

institution of the Tamrakar ethnic group) said that the community was impressed by the concept

of such a park. Mr. Chiribabu Maharjan, Mayor of Lalitpur Metropolitan City, recalled that the local

community people wholeheartedly supported the construction of the park. In this context, the

construction of the park is expected to change households' participation and decision-making

when it comes to dealing with the issues of open space areas.

It has been found that people’s realization about the necessity of well-managed open space

and greenery in their surroundings has increased by more than twice over time. Similarly,

people's interest in making a financial and physical contribution towards the construction and

management of the pocket parks/parks/open spaces in their surroundings has also been found

to increase by 18%. However, as reported earlier, few local people already contributed during the

construction of the pocket park but the change in outcome does not reflect the people’s interest

in financial and physical contribution at the current scenario. Additionally, despite noticing

positive changes, the participation of people in planning and designing, and contributing to

visualizing the park with arts and design is not found to be statistically significant at less than

5 percent. With being not significant, we cannot assert that these changes have taken place in

peoples’ behavior after the park construction.

BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS AND IMPACT STUDY ON POCKET PARK

The analysis of Key Informant Interviews (KII) with the Mayor, ward chairpersons of ward no. 4 and

13, including the President of the Tamrakar Samaj, showed that few people in the local community

contributed in making the pocket park which is also reflected from the response of households.

However, there are not enough people contributing to such efforts though there are visible

positive changes. There could be two explanations for this behavior. One is that local people might

not have received the opportunity to contribute to other similar projects, and the second reason

could be a tenuous collaboration among the local people and locally elected representatives.

The practice of collaboration among stakeholders

When it comes to strengthening collaboration among community people, local enterprises, and

local authorities such as mayors, ward chairpersons to develop and manage pocket parks/open

spaces, the study did find a tenuous collaboration of community people with the local authority

and no such collaboration of business community with local people and authorities.

From KII, it appeared that there was some collaboration at the initial stage of park construction

among community people and local authorities. However, such collaboration has not been seen in

the post-construction scenario.

Impact of Pocket Park on local businesses

The pocket park is located in the business area of Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. Assuming pocket park

construction could generate more businesses and lure more customers/clients, the study tried to

capture the magnitude of change if they realized any.

The study found that the construction of the park appeared to be impactful only to make the

business place more attractive with about 27% increment, compared to the pre-construct

scenario, followed by an increase in sense of safety and security in their business surrounding by 9

%. Besides, the park has contributed to a decrease in the practice of throwing waste in the space

area by about 50%.

However, the study shows that the park has not created any impact on other business activities

such as the increase in the number of customers/clients, the monetary value of the business, and

the volume of business transactions. Since the park occupies a small area and is suitable for only

a small number of visitors; it might not contribute to increasing the business activities at a larger

scale.

suitability of the Park to the Persons with disability

While converting the space area into a park, it has been made as much accessible as possible

to persons with disabilities (PWDs), especially to wheelchair users. During the survey, six PWDs

participated in the survey, among whom 3 were wheelchair users, one visually impaired, and 2

with psychosocial disabilities.

The wheelchair users shared pleasant experiences, to some extent, while being in the park. They

expressed that there have been efforts made to make the park wheelchair accessible, but they

suggested better modifications in the smoothness of the ramp at both the entry and exit points.

Similarly, the visually impaired person visiting the park found it to be not suitable for them,

especially referring to the noise from the vehicles and the lack of hand railings inside the park to

support them while walking on the ramp.

BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS AND IMPACT STUDY ON POCKET PARK

9.

Park experience of persons with psychosocial disability

During the survey, qualitative information around the accessibility and usefulness of the
park has been collected interviewing two people with psychosocial disability-one female and
one male. They both found the park’s attributes pleasant, and the place is equally friendly to
people with psychosocial disabilities.

The female visitor found the amazing and nice and architecture is well set up. She says “the
environment of the park is quite peaceful, and the landscape was mesmerizing. However, the
area might not be suitable for women in the evening" She attributed insecurity as the main
reason for such feelings.

Meanwhile, she also talked to the people around the parks and had a warm conversation
with them. She compared her experience being in the park with an experience she had of
visiting a park in the Australian Embassy. According to her being in the park at the noon is
nice to her.

She suggested improving the lighting system of the park so that the place would be more
secure to the visitors. In her opinion, such lighting would also ecstasies the mood of people,
like them.

There was not much diffidence in the experiences of male visitors compared to the female
visitor. He also found the park nice and fine. “The experience being in the park is good and
satisfiable” he stated. In his opinion, he is comfortable with the people surrounding the park.

He was satisfied with the structure and landscape of the park too. However, he found the
parking area is a little precarious and said that tall buildings around the park may challenge
the safety and security of the visitors and the park. He further said, “tall building around the
park would harm the park if there is an earthquake”. Like a female visitor, he also suggested
that a good lighting system should be there which would help to turn the visitor’s mood up.

10.

Impact of park’s construction on local government and
community people

During the study, in order to explore how a small initiation of constructing pocket parks has

encouraged local governments and community people to think about and plan for other pockets,

Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) have been conducted with the relevant people. From these

conversations, it has been found that the construction of pocket parks has worked as a catalyst

to start a healthy discussion among the local community people and local government. Similarly,

the local government has also endorsed policy and programs to initiate and support parks’

construction in Lalitpur Metropolitan. Particularly, the construction of this pocket park seems

to have provided an impetus to design a park not only suitable to the able people but also the

people with disabilities.

Their views on the pocket park and the possible challenges they had to face have been discussed

in detail in the box below.

III Results and Discussion
Mr. Chiri Babu Maharjan
Mayor, Lalitpur Metropolitan City, Lalitpur

Views:

The idea of the pocket park has been enshrined in policies and programs of the Municipality’s
annual budget. Two of the relevant programs are the Green Project and BLUE Project with
the objective to expand greenery and renovate the traditional ponds respectively. The
municipality has envisioned transforming the abandoned public properties into a public park
in a few years. Substantially, the replication of the park has been under construction in the
cities like Jawalakhel, Lagankhel, Kumaripati, Shankhalmul, Dhobighat, etc.

As per the policy provision, the Users Committee-which is mandatory for public projects.
Such committees are being financed mainly by the municipality in addition to the supportive
aids from United Nations Development Programme and various volunteer organizations like
Vriksha Foundation thus far.

The municipality has been harmoniously coordinating with organizations like Vriksha
Foundation for its technical and architectural support to develop parks/pocket parks/open
spaces. The maintenance of the park is currently being handled and managed by the Lalitpur
Metropolitan City Office. For future sustainability, the plan is to delegate maintenance
services to local organizations or community groups.

In these projects, there is overwhelming support from the residents across the city. Further,
international organizations like Asian Development Bank, World Bank, UNDP, private
innovative organizations, and volunteer organizations are keen to participate, support, and
learn from this project idea.

Major Challenges:

There are several challenges before and during the construction of parks. The foremost
is the acquisition of land for the park. Numbers of people are residing in public property
unauthentically. They try to resist such projects. Further, the city area is a vital place for
business. Big multiplex poses a serious challenge and tries to influence stakeholders.

Mr. narayan KC
Chairperson, Ward No.4, Lalitpur Metropolitan City

Views:

The wards had facilitated the team involved in the construction of the pocket park. There
were discussions between the residents, local community leaders, ward chairperson, mayor
of the municipality, UNDP, and the team that led the initiative. There was a harmonious
consensus among all to execute the plan. The residents had encouraging and supportive
cooperation during the process.

Major Challenges:

The major challenge before construction was the acquisition of land. Several voices were
raised inside and outside the site by the vested interest groups who were using the public
property illegally. Besides, proper maintenance of the park has also been a challenge.

26

BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS AND IMPACT STUDY ON POCKET PARK
Mr. ganesh KC
Chairperson, Ward No. 13, Lalitpur Metropolitan City

Views:

Chairpersons of Ward No. 4, 5 and 13, were involved in the formation of the User’s Committee
Groups. Collective efforts were given to involving the Committee in the planning, preparatory,
implementation, and coordination phases. Financial support was managed through a joint
contribution of the municipality, wards, and other stakeholders of the park.

Major Challenges:

The foremost challenge in the execution of the idea was land acquisition. There was a conflict
of interest due to the involvement of the big business multiplexes. Another challenge was
the differences of opinion between the architects of the team and the local community. The
local community was willing to preserve the traditional architecture and customs. So, they
were reluctant to modernize the design of the park according to the needs of different people,
including PwDs.

Mr. ravindra Tamrakar,
President of Tamrakar Samaj, Lalitpur Metropolitan City

Views:

The local communities were encouraged by the construction of parks. The idea of the park was
first introduced in a program organized by the team of Vriksha Foundation, UNDP including
various volunteer organizations. Residents fully supported the idea and contributed during the
construction of the park, especially the provision of water supply and electricity. The President
of the Tamrakar Samaj (an institution of the Tamrakar ethnic group) said that the community
was impressed by the concept of the park. He added that the community wanted to have
similar parks in the area as it is getting more congested with the rising numbers of concrete
buildings for businesses. He specifically added the importance of green spaces and spaces for
recreation together with family and friends.

Major Challenges:

The community has concerned that big business tycoons can impede such projects. Further,
the continuous maintenance of the parks is another challenge since the community has not
been assigned any direct role in this aspect apart from the verbal agreement on protecting and
managing the park.

III Results and Discussion
IV summARy And COnClusIOn

The study was carried out to measure the effect of the pocket park and the associated behavioral

change in nearby households, businesses, and park visitors. For this study, a total of 202 responses

were collected using a retrospective pre-post survey, out of which 104 were from park visitors,

57 from entrepreneurs, and 41 responses from household people. Similarly, to garner insights

on whether the pocket park has generated any impact on the local policymakers or not, the

Key Informant Interview was administered with the policymakers and the leaders within the

municipality. Descriptive statistics such as average, the percentage change have been used to

analyze data.

The survey with households suggested that physical attributes of the space area are improved by

about 2.5 times to pre-construct scenarios. Similarly, from a psychological perspective, the park

has contributed to changing people’s experiences such as pleasantness and relaxation while being

in the park. These experiences were changed by more than 2 times to the surveyed households.

When it came to performing the physical activities in the park, households and visitors have

increased activities like exercising, resting, waiting, walking, and so on by more than 2.3 times,

benefiting social cohesion, health and well-being. However, the study found that people appeared

to be somehow reluctant to contribute and collaborate with other community members, local

policymakers, and entrepreneurs in the issues of open spaces, such as initiating other pocket parks

and managing them.

The visitors also found the park transfigured in almost all the aspects that the survey questions

asked. They reported that overall space area’s attributes such as physical condition, space

arrangement, greenery, and so on have increased by about more than 1.5 times on average. From

the perspective of persons with disabilities, especially wheelchair users, space areas have been

made suitable and comfortable for them, however, they see a lot to be improved in the park in

regard to the easy accessibility from the entrance as well as the exit point of the park. People with

psychosocial disabilities found the park pleasant and accessible, but they want more improvement

in the lighting system and more space in the pocket park area.

The survey also captured the impact of the park on local businesses. And, it has been found that

park has a no larger contribution to increasing the business activities like’s sales volumes, increase

in asset value and so on. Similarly, the park also did not contribute to fostering a relationship

between entrepreneurs with community people and local policymakers. However, it has

contributed to increasing the safety and security in the business area by decreasing the incidents

of brawling, illegal parking, and so on.

The study also found that the metropolitan city has initiated dedicated projects to convert open

public spaces into parks. Local policymakers seem sensible towards the issues of open space in

their surroundings. However, they pointed out the acquisition of encroached public land is one of

the major challenges to convert public spaces to parks.

28

BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS AND IMPACT STUDY ON POCKET PARK
V RECOmmEndATIOn

Based on the findings and suggestions gathered during the study, it was observed that there

required concrete steps for better improvements while constructing similar parks.

• Physical Attributes: To improve the physical attribute of the park, almost all the respondents

recommended the need for a public toilet, drinking water facility, and more greenery in

the park. They also suggested adding shedding to the existing park to make it more useful.

Branding of the park with an appropriate name was also recommended to give it a more

specific identity.

• Collaborations: The finding suggested that there was a tenuous collaboration among the

park’s stakeholders such as households, local businesses, and policymakers to discuss and take

joint action on the issues of the pocket park, such as maintenance and sustainability, therefore,

the role and responsibility of joint users committee with the people from households,

local entrepreneurs, and local policymakers need to be expanded to make the pocket park

sustainable and properly maintained.

Though there appears some level of collaboration between the community, local institutions,

enterprises, and local government while constructing the park, it is essential to continue and

strengthen such collaboration for future maintenance and sustainability of the park. Besides,

strong collaboration among the local community, entrepreneurs, and local policymakers is

needed to develop similar other parks. Since the importance of public space is still beyond the

public discussion, initiating campaigns and fostering strong collaboration among local people

with local policymakers and entrepreneurs will further encourage to have more voices in this

issue.

•

Inclusive designs: To make the parks more inclusive and user-friendly, the design of the park

should be prepared and tested from the perspective of child-friendliness and persons with

disabilities from the very beginning. To make the existing park accessible to wheelchair users,

the entrance and exit of the parking area are to be improved so they can enter the park and

exit without difficulty. The internal track designed to ride a wheelchair should also be improved

by smoothing the track. To make the park suitable for visually impaired people a hand railing

should also be placed.

• Respecting tradition and customs: While constructing pocket parks/open spaces, special
attention should be given to preserving the traditional architecture and customs. Therefore,

the people of local communities should be included from the very beginning of—park design

to making the park sustainable.

• sustainability: To maintain and protect the park, more responsibility should be given to the

local community along with the local governments.
