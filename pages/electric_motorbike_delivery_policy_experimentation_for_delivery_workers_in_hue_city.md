> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The experimental activity was designed to test the hypothesis that using electric motorbikes for delivery services can increase economic benefits for delivery workers and add value for both delivery workers and customers by promoting a green lifestyle. The experiment involved providing electric motorbikes to delivery workers in Hue City, Vietnam, and observing changes in delivery efficiency, income, operating costs, and perceptions of green transportation over a 30-day period. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

The hypothesis was: IF delivery workers switch to electric motorbikes, THEN they will experience increased economic benefits and the adoption of a green lifestyle will add value for both delivery workers and customers. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

To test the hypothesis, the following actions were taken: 

Analyze current situation of delivery workers to answer 2 research questions related to their livelihoods and green lifestyle prior to experiment interventions through baseline survey of 63 deliver workers in Hue 

Learn lessons from previous experiment implemented internally by a Delivery company in Da Nang to test if they can provide delivery services by e-motorbike 

Collaborate with local govt partners to establish a working group of relevant public servants from relevant departments to co-design and co-implement the experiment. 

Training on ethnographic research and how to do experiment was conducted prior to the implementation  

Coordinate with EV producer to support providing Electric motorbikes to a selected group of delivery workers. The EV is specifically designed for delivery workers 

Data on delivery efficiency, income, operating costs, and perceptions of green transportation were collected before and after the intervention. Two groups were tested, one using gasoline motorbike and other using EV. Ethnographic research was also used to answer 2 research questions. 

A workshop was held to share experimental results and gather policy recommendations

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

The experiment’s success was rooted in the close cooperation of various stakeholders, each playing a distinct role. While UNDP provided technical guidance on and co-implemented with local government partners the evidence-based experimentation, local organizations like Hue Institute of Development Studies (IDS) and Selex Motor, an emerging e-mobility company, and Aha fast provided critical expertise and resources. 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The original hypothesis was that the use of electric motorbikes in delivery would bring significant benefits for the environment and that delivery workers are skeptical about the efficiency of electric vehicles and are not ready to invest. The experiment conducted over five months proved this hypothesis to be correct. The use of electric motorbikes improved the livelihoods of delivery workers and created a green image of Hue. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The baseline survey to understand the current situation of delivery workers prior to the experimentation's design is effective. It helps to validate some assumptions and re-design the experiment. The non-random selection of treatment group and control group is simple but sufficient for this experiment.  

Although we adopted ethnographic research to this experiment, it is helpful only for answering the 2nd question on green lifestyle of delivery workers.  

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

The activity took five months from design to results. 

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The experiment results could be used to adjust and improve current policies to promote green transportation in Hue City and Thua Thien Hue Province. The project's findings lay the foundation for future research phases, which will progressively transform traffic in a more friendly, smart, and sustainable direction. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The growth of electric transportation is expected to help build a green city in Hue, making it a livable and productive place to live. Hue City's interconnected urban environment, cultural heritage, and industry make it well-positioned to become a model for the development of a green city based on green transportation in the Central Region. This would be a modern city with transportation primarily based on green and zero-emission energy for multiple purposes, diverse and flexible spatial planning, and meeting the future needs of traffic. 
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We set 2 research questions and the learning question related to green lifestyle has unlocked our assumption that shippers may not be interested in green lifestyle. Although they have felt that environmental protection is a big issue and unlikely to be their own responsibility, they are excited to see positive feedback from clients when they see shippers on an e-motorbike. Especially when shippers have questions or actions to reduce single use plastic products, clients appreciate.  

The experiment demonstrated the benefits and efficiency of switching from gasoline motorbike to electric motorbike in the delivery industry. It also provided insights into the current situation of delivery workers and the barriers they face in switching from gasoline motorbikes to electric motorbikes. 

Although the experiment justified the efficiency of electric motorbikes in delivery work including the optimal design and the battery swapping stations, many shippers have hesitated to invest such a big amount for e-motorbikes. Evolving fund (from e-mobility project/CCE) has been designed to give preferential loan to anyone who wants to switch to electric vehicles. This fund was in right time after the completion of the experiment, which strongly encourage shippers to acquire for E-motorbikes 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

A key challenge that needs to be resolved before electric mobility can be realized is the development of the necessary infrastructure. This encompasses urban design, supporting equipment such as charging stations, repair and maintenance services, and shaded parking spaces. Moreover, specific policies are required to facilitate the transition. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The UNDP Accelerator Lab in Vietnam, which contributed to the research, would benefit from the results as it provides evidence to support policy changes towards green transportation. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The local government, policy makers, and delivery workers in Thua Thien Hue Province would benefit from the results as it provides evidence to support the transition to electric vehicles, which could improve the livelihoods of delivery workers and contribute to environmental sustainability. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

General advice for replicating this activity would include conducting a thorough baseline survey to understand the current situation, engaging with all stakeholders (including delivery workers, customers, and policymakers), ensuring adequate infrastructure for electric vehicles, and being prepared to address concerns and challenges that arise during the experiment. It is also important to monitor and evaluate the experiment closely to gather robust data that can inform policy decisions. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

The experiment could potentially be replicated in other areas related to environmental sustainability and economic development. Considerations would include the local context, such as the current use of transportation and attitudes towards green living. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The sense and explore phases influenced the experiment by helping to define the problem, the target audience, the objectives, and the expected outcomes. They also helped to identify the challenges and barriers faced by the delivery workers and the potential benefits of switching to electric motorbikes. 

In hindsight, the Solution Mapper and the Explorer could have done more to engage with the stakeholders, such as the delivery companies, the electric motorbike providers, the local authorities, and the customers. They could have also used more diverse and innovative methods to collect and analyze data, such as digital platforms, gamification, or behavioral insights. 

> What surprised you?

One surprising finding was that the delivery workers who used electric motorbikes had higher delivery efficiency and income than those who used gasoline motorbikes. Another surprising finding was that the delivery workers and the customers had positive attitudes and perceptions towards green transportation and green lifestyle.
