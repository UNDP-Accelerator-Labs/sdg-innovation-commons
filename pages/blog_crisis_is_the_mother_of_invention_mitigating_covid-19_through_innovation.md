Ghana, like many countries across the globe, is wrestling with COVID-19. Predictions(link is external) are that in addition to the health crisis, social and economic implications for Africa will be severe without effective measures to stop the spread. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has set up a Rapid Response Facility for vulnerable countries including those in Africa(link is external). In Ghana, the UN’s response to the health crisis is led by the World Health Organisation (WHO) while UNDP leads on the socio-economic response. UNDP is supporting the health care system to manage hazardous medical waste effectively. Together with the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), UNDP is assessing the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 to identify recovery pathways. Other areas of focus include inclusive risk communication, safe-guarding human rights and protection of vulnerable groups.
Resilience and creativity are critical to fighting COVID-19 and UNDP’s global network of Accelerator Labs(link is external) (AccLabs) are uniquely placed to support innovation at this time. In this blog, the AccLab (Ghana) outlines emerging local innovations and a forthcoming AccLab Innovation Challenge to support the innovation ecosystem.
Communication is key
All Government communication relating to COVID-19 is coordinated by the Ministry of Information, through digital and traditional channels. Given Ghana’s high mobile usage, (subscription penetration(link is external) was 136.7% in 2018), digital channels feature heavily.Ghana Ministry of Information Chatbot for COVID-19
Government has rolled out digital solutions to disseminate information and tackle the “infodemic” of false claims, including a 24/7 Corona virus 311 Information Service helpline and WhatsApp chatbot(link is external). The Ministry of Health provides updates through Ghana Health Service’s(link is external) website. According to Amazon's web insights tool Alexa(link is external), internet traffic on the website has risen exponentially (by about 500%) since COVID-19 index cases were announced on 12 March 2020.

The public receives daily SMS tips about precautionary measures including hygiene, mental and physical well-being and preventing stigmatisation.
Other digital platforms include twitter handles for the Ministry of Health(link is external) and Disease Surveillance Department (DSD)(link is external). To support Government’s efforts, UNDP is also running a social media campaign on COVID-19 facts, preventive measures, actions to take when symptoms develop and to prevent stigmatization and discrimination.

Observing precautionary measures, assessing symptoms and getting help
There is public education about precautionary measures, including frequent hand washing with soap under running water, but 6 million Ghanaians(link is external) (1 in 5 of the population) do not have easy access to clean water, so compliance can be difficult. A solution is the ubiquitous “Veronica Bucket(link is external)”, which was designed years ago by a Ghanaian inventor. This comprises a bucket with a tap, above a receptacle, to enable proper handwashing. Other solutions are an automated solar powered hand washing machine(link is external); 3D printed(link is external) reusable face mask, face shield, mask strap ventilator splitter; and a smart home system(link is external) which is able to control lights, switches, sockets, elevators and appliances with an app on the phone without touching surfaces.
Ghana’s President, His Excellency Nana Akufo-Addo has noted: “The front-line to the corona virus is your front door …. stay at home”. Social distancing measures are in place to reduce COVID-19 transmission. At the macro-level, an analytical tool developed by the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) and Vodafone Ghana uses anonymised, aggregated mobile data to estimate population movements. This could help in monitoring compliance with mobility restrictions if required.

Some entrepreneurs are producing and distributing free masks to local communities. Ghana’s Food and Drugs Authority has approved selected local (link is external)companies to manufacture (link is external)nose masks of the right quality. StopCovid19Ghana.org(link is external), a citizen-led initiative, is also using social media platforms to support communities through the pandemic.

Government has launched a COVID-19 Tracker(link is external) App, which allows users to enter their contact information and coronavirus symptoms they may have so that health officials can contact them. There is also a home-grown Corona Virus(link is external) Assessment Tool(link is external) to help in assessing symptoms and in determining when medical help is required.

In collaboration with a private diagnostics company, the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), has developed a Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)(link is external) for COVID-19. If approved by regulatory bodies, this could significantly augment Ghana’s current testing regime. Drones(link is external) are also being used as a faster method of transporting COVID-19 test samples from health facilities in remote areas to testing laboratories. Scientists at the University of Ghana (link is external)have also successfully obtained critical data about SARS-Cov-2’s genetic composition. This genome sequencing can strengthen the tracking of virus mutations and help with the tracing of community infections.

Since the pandemic began there have been concerns globally about the supply of ventilators used to manage COVID 19 cases. Ghana, like many other countries, is building its stocks of ventilators and local innovators have designed low cost ventilator prototypes made from repurposed pipes and motors.
While some countries across the globe are gradually emerging from strict lockdown procedures, there remains an urgent need for everyone to adhere to health protocols. A young Ghanaian innovator has developed a disinfection chamber which detects when a person enters the chamber and sprays a disinfectant over the entire body. This can be installed in public locations such as schools, markets or hospitals to complement other precautionary measures.
Exploring, testing and scaling up COVID-19 innovations in Ghana
Many innovations have emerged in Ghana to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 and these require further exploration, testing and scaling up as appropriate. In this regard, the AccLab in Ghana is planning an Innovation Challenge to support grassroots solutions and Ghana’s innovation ecosystem.
