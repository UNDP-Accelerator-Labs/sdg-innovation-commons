[[ai_summary:Francis Capistrano, head of experimentation at the Accelerator lab in the Philippines, discussed a participatory R&D activity aimed at expanding local multi-stakeholder convergences to address extreme poverty and other development issues. The activity focused on building local convergences that would engage local governments and other actors in designing and prioritizing anti-poverty actions. Tactics included leveraging institutional positions, focusing on the strengths of local partners, and using data to inform advocacy efforts. The process showed promise in improving the quality and legitimacy of participatory processes. However, lessons learned emphasized the importance of tailoring data products to local needs and avoiding overloading local partners with tools. For future work, Capistrano noted that building upon existing institutional mechanisms could be more effective than creating separate ad hoc initiatives.]]

# "Scaling Local Convergences in the Philippines: A Pro-Totyping Approach to Eradicating Extreme Poverty"

### [[0:00]] Good\. OK\. Tell me your name, your title\. And so it say I consent to this recording\.

OK\. I'm Francis Capistrano, otherwise known as Kapi\. I'm head of experimentation of the Accelerator lab in the Philippines\. And I approve of this mess\. Oops\. Wrong\. I consent to this recording\. Do I repeat that?

### [[0:21]] No, that's fine\. Over to you for the first time\. Thank you\.

### [[0:27]] Thanks\. I would like you to tell me about when are in the activity that you would like to share and how did it come about, when did you start? What was it about?

[[tactics:Finding new alternatives]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Allies and champions]]
Sure, I would like to tell you about or what we would call actually we don't have a formal name for it, but essentially we were trying to do the expansion of local multi stakeholder convergences\. It is rooted in an early prototyping initiative that we did with the 0 Extreme Poverty Coalition\. This is a coalition of more than 140 development actors from civil society, non government organizations and the their pledges, the name suggests, is to help eradicate extreme poverty by 2015\. But they wanted to find a faster way of doing that and through AI mean to make the Long story short, they landed on let's focus on building local convergences who will engage their local government units in designing and prioritizing anti poverty actions\. We started with a pilot of around 5:00 if I'm not mistaken\. But this particular R&D activity I wanted to tell you about\. We wanted to scale and expand it those prototypes into five more localities, whether they're cities or provinces\. The expansion entailed the following\. The 1st is really of course trying to map out and see where the coalition would want to go into and expand those local coalitions or local convergences\. The second would be from the pilots\. We've had different disparate practices, different ways for them, different cases of engaging local governments or converging their actions together for around specific poverty actions\. So we tried to codify it, so to speak, in a toolkit\. We called it the Zeptelier toolkit, which is a, which is basically a group of tools that these local convergences and particularly the lead convenors at the local level can use to for different purposes, whether it's getting there, yeah, whether it's getting a better sense of the poverty situation in their locality or in how do you facilitate Co creation processes\. So that's the, I guess that's the second component of the prototyping\. The third level of this expansion is do, can we bring in alternative data sources to inform their planning processes? So we did kind of a download to them of all the data tools that we have, whether it's machine learning generated poverty estimates or just simple visualizations of social economic situations in their localities\. So, so that's, I think I told a lot, but that's essentially the that are in the activity that I wanted to talk about\.

### [[3:41]] So it's very you mentioned that prototyping Co creation and these local convergences\. So why was where this method can we choose for this? What was the factor influencing you to say we need to kind of use prototyping with the local convergences in order to what was kind of the motivation to use that kind of method?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
I guess the method was selected mainly because we wanted to model a different way of engaging\. There have been in, I mean, in the Philippine context, there's already an institutional mechanism for civil society participation\. Each local government should have a local development council and each local development council should have a specific proportion of them from civil society representatives\. But we've seen that it's a very patchy kind of practice\. Some are there are some good exemplars where at the same time there's also a lot of them which are just token participants in the process\. So we wanted to model a process, a certain process where sorry, we wanted to model a, a way for these local convergences to 1st come together and agree on, agree on an agenda for change rather than their disparate little agendas, whether it's health or nutrition or whatnot\. But to come together towards a comprehensive agenda \#2 is for them to have a common strategy for engaging their local government and also engaging other actors in the, in their locality, whether it's business or, or professional groups\. The third way that we wanted to model is for them to be able to use data to inform their inform their advocacies because I mean, the, the common perception is that CS OS are single, single issue advocates who will not look at others issues\. So that's why we wanted to use that\.

### [[5:46]] Interesting\. And so I guess the development issue here in a way is, is transversal\. I mean, you were trying to improve the local planning processes to engage all different development issues\. Is there, what would be the development issue in this case?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
That's the, I guess the transversal issues are of course, the SDGS, the poverty\. This is in the context of the 0 extreme poverty Coalition who wanted to make a dent on that SDG\. The second is of course, making local governments work and making, making those participatory processes work\. And that's, that's quite very relevant in our case because of a recent Supreme Court decision which remands or sorry downloads more resources to local governments\. The immediate development context here actually is the pandemic\. We started this exercise of participatory of expanding local convergences and participatory planning sometime in 20 in the, in the tail end of 2021 going into the middle of 2022\. The idea was for these 15 local convergences to come up with their participatory recovery plans, which will then feed into the government's local development plans for, for social economic recovery from the pandemic\.

### [[7:07]] And can you maybe tell me a little bit about the tactics and the principles surrounding these R&D activity, right? So what tactics do you use to, to approach these local governments and, and local convergences? And what principles were behind that kind of work, right?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Building bridges]]
For tactics we saw, we, I, I'd speak from what we saw from the different local government, from the different local convergences, the lessons, some of them actually leverage their institutional positions\. Remember I told you about the local development councils and, and how, how there are civil society representatives there\. So some of them leverage that position to be able to inject their respective agendas into, into the formal planning phases\. The others, the other tactics that we saw is to focus on their strengths\. So for example, in one province they focused on converging all the private sector, because the coalition was driven by private sector foundations\. Their convergence focused on trying to build on their strengths and converging the actions of the private sector because I think at that time their engagement with the local government was not too strong\. So there were different tactics for them to get a foot in the door\. So, so there's the institutional route\. There's also the kind of a groundswell trying to build more momentum for, for the local government to take it to pay more attention to them and, and the, the interesting result here, Christiane is the one context that I forgot to mention is that the end of the, the end of the initiative was also coinciding with the transition of local government leaders\. There was an election happening in between\. So some of our civil society partners, our local convenience were afraid\. Why, why are we doing this now? The government might change and we'll be going to we're going to be doing this convincing again\. But surprisingly enough, even for some of the some of the localities where the local chief executive, the mayor, the governor changed as a result of the election, the because these local convergences were able to kind of develop their own track record and, and, and legitimacy\. Actually the new leaders listen to them rather than spread them out because you know, they were working with the previous government\.

### [[9:42]] So that's already tapping into what was the outcome, right and the impact, right\. So in a way you were able to improve the quality of that participatory process and also improve their maybe legitimacy or influence\.

Yes\.

### [[9:56]] Is there another thing that you maybe would like to point out that as a result or an impact of this whole R&D process?

[[principles:Data sharing]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
I guess another result of this R&D process would be a learning from our side because we were a little, I, I would admit that the lab was a little optimistic and aggressive about pushing down so to speak, you know, innovation tools and data, data tools\. So we had a few learnings along the way\. So the first is data is powerful, but we have to be really more propulsive and we have to attune the data products that representing to the local stakeholders to their needs and capabilities\. So, for example, they appreciated poverty maps because there is a, they are a nice visual tool to help them pin down where the poor localities are\. They, they love that\. And sometimes they also did their own kind of counter checking\. Are we in those localities where the, the clusters of poverty are? But our mistake was to present them sophisticated COVID\-19 projections and that kind of intimidated their civil society groups\. So that's one lesson\. The second lesson was we, we did try to kind of cascade train, train the local convert conveners into some tools for, for social innovation\. So for example, we introduced issue mapping, we introduced foresight, some form of foresight\. We also introduced systems thinking\. I think we overloaded them too much\. But what we appreciated is at least the home, the, the at least the systemic view, the simplified systemic view that you have to look at on the issue in a, in a comprehensive way and not just a single, a single touch point way\. So that's at least what we appreciated in the process\.

### [[11:58]] Great, excellent\. And going into, you know, things that you're talking about learnings now, right\. And you already said a little bit about what things you would do different like the data part\.

Yeah, make it simple\.

### [[12:10]] Is there another thing that you would say I would do this differently now that I already know a few years into it, Right?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
So when we after we did this kind of experiment in a span of it was a quick span of 7\-8 months, we, we learning from, if we wanted to build kind of a local governance strengthening portfolio out of it\. And we hired, we hired an expert in the field\. And although she appreciated the, the results in the, in the depth of insights and, you know, the practices, the, I guess the one of the things that we have could have done differently, as she pointed out, was to make sure that we really latch this exercise in the institutional mechanisms rather than building it out a sense as a separate ad hoc mechanism\. Because there are indeed kind of, there are indeed already a especially in the more progressive provinces or cities, there are a multitude of coalitions and associations like that\. What's the benefit of a new multi stakeholder coalition, right as opposed to making sure that it is built out so that you're empowering not just the local civil society organizations, but also the local government side as well\. So that's one lesson that I had\. We could have more purposively built the tested ways to engage local government planners, which as a result, as a finding of the exercise were really crucial in getting those participatory plans into the mainstream local development plans\.

### [[13:58]] Excellent\. So then now going into the last few questions talking about diffusion and capitalization, what, what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate the diffusion of or adoption of the outcome of these are in the activity? And how did you engage with policy makers, but private sector communities or other key actors about this work?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:Innovation challenge]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
Right\. Let me let me cite 3 things\. I suppose the 1st is this, is this this kind of experiment? It was really meant to provide input or lessons to the 0 extreme Poverty coalition to, to this day, they, they continued the work of expanding local convergences, although not this one big kind of Sprint of 15 at the same time, but doing it little by little, learning from the experiences that we have and using the tools that we built out from this, from this exercise\. So for example, the poverty maps that we built, the social innovation methods toolkit that we built for them, simplified, of course, they continue to use it\. So that's the first\. The second is, as I mentioned, we're trying to use this as a kind of input into the, into a local governance program that we're trying to develop for the country office\. We, it's a program that we're trying to build out of anticipatory adaptive and agile principles\. So we're still not quite there yet because there's still a lot of information, especially from the local government side that we're trying to, to build in\. Like for example, we're using some newly sourced data to kind of categorize local governments according to capacity and result and performance\. So that's, that's one of the things that we're trying to do\. The third is of course a deeper engagement with our Department of Interior and local government, which admittedly we've engaged only intermittently in the experiment phase\. But moving forward, there's a there's also a handful of initiatives that we're trying to design together with them, a massive kind of a scoping of all participatory processes and how they're working out at the local government level\. Looking at some other good examples of capacitating both civil society and local governments and how do you facilitate meaningful participation, which I guess I lead to the 4th\. I forgot there was a fourth element for scale out\. This all builds into the open government partnership\. The Philippines is one of the pioneering countries who are actually one of the co\-founders of the OGP and one of the strong directions of OGP now is to localize it\. So that's actually an element of the Philippine government's national OGP action Plan\. So we're looking at a handful of these from this set of 15 and more localities whom we've experimented with\. We're looking at potentially a handful of them to commit to, to kind of engage and, and make part of the OGP local process\.

### [[17:21]] Right\. Great\. So since we have still a little bit of time because we lost Amy and maybe we can cover one of the questions that that that I skip over to accelerate\. But I think it's quite relevant to maybe tell me a little bit about what were the skills that you kind of needed in the whole, in this whole process, right? How those skills were coming from the lab, which skills were maybe needed to, to, to or were seek outside or with other actors right throughout this journey, right\.

[[tools:Collective intelligence for the analysis of emerging signals]]
[[principles:Time management and adaptability]]
[[skills:Leveraging technologies]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
So that's a, that's a good question because it's a complementation of skills that happened here\. So the lab, what the lab really provided was more of the social innovation and data skills\. So more the technical side, if you might put it that way\. But what we tried to learn with the civil society groups, which they were already kind of an expert in is how is organizing and coordination that's, that's been a kind of a tricky, tricky kind of a skill set that you learn over time\. And there's really no training for that\. And this is, this is something that's we're also developing ourselves as we get more embroiled into various portfolio approaches in the country office, because those require what we call backbone organizing skill sets That that's I believe it's an integral part of our in the, in the Accelerator Labs down the line\.

### [[18:51]] OK, Kapi, thank you very much for your time and for your insights\. I learned a lot and I think the neighbor will learn a lot\.

Thanks so much, Christian\.
