## Overall goal

Collaboratively characterize the participation experiences of groups and organizations of people with disabilities, including the perspectives of institutionalized and noninstitutionalized users of mental health services and their families in Chubut, in instances of promotion and defense of rights from the Social Model of Disability and the Community Mental Health Model, with a gender perspective.
## Specific goals

Collaboratively survey, describe, and systematize the experiences of groups and organizations in both institutionalized and noninstitutionalized participatory instances of promotion and defense of rights throughout the province; identify the conditions for the emergence and sustainability of these rights, and consider the existing barriers and facilitators.

Analyze, from a gender perspective, the characteristics adopted by groups and organizations together with their participation approaches.

Study the representations of participation and identify their link with the conditions of participation in groups and organizations and the subjective participation experiences.
