> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The use of windmills is one of the oldest methods of harnessing energy from wind to pump water. However, the majority of the windmills available in the market are Aerodynamic windmills. These types of windmills require a high cut-in speed (the minimum wind speed requires for starting is about 5 to 7 km/hr) and this is a major limitation for the majority of the Indian geographical area except the coastal area. They also require high maintenance and are very expensive. This windmill has a unique design. It is working on aerodynamic principles but it is a Drag Type of low-height windmill for lifting groundwater. It starts at a very low wind speed (i.e. about 8 to 10 km/ hr), is very easy to use and maintain, and is cheap compared to the conventional windmill.
