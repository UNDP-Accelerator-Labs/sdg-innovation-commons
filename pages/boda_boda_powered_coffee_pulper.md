It is every farmer's dream to earn money from their produce promptly, but for Mr. Githuki Mwangi, this dream never materialized for the many years that he farmed coffee. Eventually, he decided to uproot his coffee trees and try his hand at something else. Mwangi has introduced a system that will pulp coffee at farm level, meaning that farmers will not have to transport their produce to a factory or a cooperative. The system which is powered by motorcycles has a capacity of processing over 400 kilos of cherry per hour compared to just 50 kilos which farmers achieve through manual pulping. The system is likely to cut the long coffee value chain that makes farmers wait for six months to get paid.
