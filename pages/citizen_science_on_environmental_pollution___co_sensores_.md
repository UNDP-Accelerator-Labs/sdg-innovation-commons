Objective:  Develop technologies that allow organized community groups to perform social and environmental assessments in a simple and affordable way, and therefore contribute to the implementation of restoration procedures or actions leading to material improvements in their quality of life      

Description of citizen participation: CoSensores is an interdisciplinary group which works horizontally with community groups organized around social and environmental issues, by jointly posing and answering questions that will contribute to their resolution. Collaboration results from the specific knowledge and possibilities of academia and territory, by making consensual decisions and undertaking tasks and responsibilities collectively. The intervention strategy chosen is based on the concept of Participatory Action Research for knowledge co-production.    The work methodology used consists in holding two workshops. In the first workshop, the issue is collectively identified, and the relevant trials are conducted.  In the second one, the results, advantages and limitations of the methods used are shared, as well as any potential strategies for solving the specific issues detected.
