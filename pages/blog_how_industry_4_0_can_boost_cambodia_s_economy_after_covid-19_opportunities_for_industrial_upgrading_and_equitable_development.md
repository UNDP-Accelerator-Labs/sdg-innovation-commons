Executive summary

Cambodia faces a dual challenge: swiftly navigating the disruptions caused by COVID-19,
while enabling a resilient, sustainable and inclusive industrialization. In both cases,
technology, and in particular Industry 4.0 technologies, can play an important role.

The COVID-19 pandemic has acted as a driver of industrial digitalization around the world, and
Cambodia is no exception. Estimates based on firm surveys indicate that globally, in response to
the challenges imposed by the pandemic, firms have accelerated the use of digital technologies in
customer interactions by three years and sped up the rate at which they develop digital products
and services by seven years.1

to the erosion of national competitiveness.

This is the second of a three-report series
aimed at informing strategies and policies to
support the adaptation and adoption of
Industry 4.0 technologies in Cambodia. The
focus of this report is on providing sectoral
evidence on the opportunities and challenges of
Industry 4.0 adaptation and adoption. It covers
established manufacturing sectors, such as
garment, textile, footwear and agro-processing;
and more sophisticated industries emerging in
the country, such as bicycles, electronics and
automotive.

The study draws mainly upon primary data
sources, including: key informant interviews,
firm interviews and a firm survey conducted
among 66 garment and footwear firms.

Impacts of COVID-19 on Cambodia’s manufacturing sector

Cambodia’s economy is estimated to have contracted by 3.1 percent in 2020, with garment and
tourism being the hardest-hit sectors.2 In comparison, more capital-intensive emerging industries,
such as bicycles and electronics, have shown a faster recovery and stronger performance during
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Impacts of COVID-19 in Cambodia’s manufacturing sector

Four main impacts have been identified among the sectors examined:

▪ Supply disruptions. In the garment sector these involved shortages of inputs and
materials, such as fabric coming from China. In the agro-processing sector supply
disruptions reported included food product inputs and packaging, particularly from
neighbouring countries. Firms also reported difficulties accessing technical support.
▪ Demand shocks. Falls in the global demand for garments with negative impacts also
seen in prices and payment terms. Mixed impacts on the agro-processing sector, with
snack producers experiencing positive impacts on both sales and employment.

▪ Delays in investment plans. Firms across all of the industries examined reported delays

in plans involving factory expansions and new project investments.

▪ Loss of workers’ livelihoods. As a result of the affectations faced by firms, workers have
been laid off, and some of those who managed to sustain their jobs have suffered
reductions in their income and the number of working hours. Firms also reported issues
related to restrictions in the movement of workers located abroad.

Industry 4.0 readiness and awareness

Industry 4.0

Firms operating in Cambodia are already
adopting
technologies.
However, this is particularly true for larger
firms. Insights from this study indicate
that less than 10 percent of the firms
operating
in Cambodia are advanced
adopters of digital technologies.

Higher levels of technology are reported in
production and assembly activities, supply
chain management, business management,
and the design and development of products
and processes. Specific garment production
processes, where a degree of automation has
been achieved, include: metal scanning,
fabric spreading, heat embroidery print, fabric
relaxation and fabric cutting.

Note: Level 1 – processes executed mainly manually; Level
2 – processes conducted with the assistance of digital tools;
Level 3 – a degree of automation; Level 4 – processes fully
automated.

Key sector-specific challenges

Key sector-specific challenges identified in this study include:

▪ Garment. Shortages of skilled labour for management, supervisory and technical positions;
increasing regional competition; and increasingly stringent quality and sustainability
requirements from global buyers.

▪ Agro-processing. High turnover rate of workers; high maintenance costs of digital
technologies; dependence on imported inputs; limited availability of food safety, sanitary and
phytosanitary support services; underused production capacity; and limited market information
services.

▪ Emerging industries. Dependence on foreign expertise; limited backwards and forwards

linkages; and the need to improve capabilities for remote supply chain management.

The opportunities for Cambodia

Digital technologies that are commonly grouped under the umbrella of Industry 4.0 are
becoming cheaper, more widely available and easier to use. This means that even
companies with limited resources and technological expertise have the potential to benefit
from them.

GARMENT
SECTOR

AGRO-
PROCESSING
SECTOR

Cambodia has positioned itself as one of the main exporters of garment, textile
and footwear (GTF) goods in the world. However, increasing quality, social and
sustainability compliance demands from global buyers highlight the need to
explore new drivers of competitiveness beyond low labour costs.

Stakeholder consultations suggest that specific opportunities for Cambodia
exist to develop the accessories’ supply chain and improve the sustainability of
production processes. Addressing these opportunities will require better
decision-making systems, improved supply chain management and better-
trained workers. Technologies such as radio-frequency identification (RFID)
and other advanced sensors, cloud-based supply chain management tools and
data analytics, and augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) can contribute to
developing these capabilities.

The inter-sectoral interactions involved in the agro-processing value chain, and
the immediate opportunities to include local actors in the development of the
sector, make it a priority for supporting the post-COVID-19 industrial recovery
of Cambodia and for improving people’s livelihoods.

Opportunities where Industry 4.0 adoption can contribute to the industrial
upgrading and diversification of the agro-processing sector include: the
application of RFID and blockchain technologies to improve food traceability;
artificial intelligence (AI), sensors and drones and facilitating organic
production; and AR/VR applications for training workers. Opportunities also
exist to use combinations of these technologies in precision agriculture
applications in order to improve overall farming productivity.

EMERGING
INDUSTRIES

The future growth of emerging and new industries is important in the pursuit of
more resilient industrial development in Cambodia. Emerging industries, such
as bicycles and automotive components, have shown a faster recovery and
stronger performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Diversifying the
manufacturing sector towards higher value-added activities would also help the
country to benefit more from its participation in global value chains.

In emerging industries, opportunities exist to enhance the participation of firms
based in Cambodia in regional value chains. This process can be supported
through the adoption of supply chain management applications. Moreover,
stakeholders highlighted opportunities for these industries to improve the
environmental sustainability of production processes through digitally enabled
energy and water management systems.

Half of the firms surveyed expressed having
a plan to retrain their staff in the next five
years, while insights from the interviews
indicate that some firms are already retraining
their workers as a result of the adoption of
technologies. However, not all
new
companies seem to be responding at the
same pace to these changes. Smaller and
local companies are lagging behind.

Industry 4.0 and jobs: new skills needed

Earlier studies3 have highlighted the
potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to
create a massive displacement of jobs in
the garment sector; however, evidence
collected in this project suggests that it is
unlikely to happen, at least in the near
future.

composition of employment. Increases in
productivity, as well as the production and
trade of new products and services, will
create new job opportunities for those who
have, or acquire, the relevant skills. In
Cambodia 64 percent of the firms surveyed
perceive that the adoption of Industry 4.0
technologies will involve the elimination of
some roles but also lead to the creation of
new ones.

Changes in roles and tasks will require
fast and flexible responses from industry
actors, but also from government and
development partners, in order to avoid
deepening
the existing social and
economic inequalities.

Policy options for an inclusive and sustainable digital transformation

The creation of the Ministry of Industry, Science, Technology and Innovation (MISTI) and the launch
of Cambodia’s Digital Economy and Society Policy Framework 2021-2035 evidence the increased
interest in technology and innovation in Cambodia, and provide an opportunity to give cohesion to
the country’s innovation policy landscape.

Although improvements in digital and broader infrastructure have been made in recent years,
further and more focalized efforts are needed to ensure that Cambodian firms can participate in the
benefits of Industry 4.0 technologies and facilitate the upskilling and reskilling of employees with
low and high levels of skills.

Industry 4.0 adoption may also involve risks, and government and development partners can play
a key role in implementing mitigation strategies to reduce the potentially negative effects of Industry
4.0 adoption and in ensuring that no one will be left behind in the industrial transformation journey.

This report identifies four key areas of policy action to support the adaptation and adoption
of Industry 4.0 technologies in Cambodia in the short, medium and long terms:

i. Make Industry 4.0 technologies accessible to SMEs
ii. Develop the offer of business advisory services
iii. Upskill and reskill employees
iv.

Further develop the National Innovation System

The role of the private sector. International experience has demonstrated the importance of the
active participation of the private sector in the design, delivery and funding of innovation support
programmes. Business consulting firms, private training providers, foreign companies and industry
associations are key actors in advancing local firms’ managerial, production and innovation
capabilities. The growing local base of software developers can also play an essential role in
adapting and developing tailor-made low-cost Industry 4.0 solutions. In addition, through
crowdfunding, venture, and equity capital, the private sector can contribute to funding the
development of a local base of entrepreneurs to adapt and develop technology solutions that
respond to the specific needs of Cambodian firms.

The next phases of this project will involve the review of international effective practices and the
design of implementation roadmaps in collaboration with industry, government, academia and other
development actors.

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated
industrial digitalization

Across the world the COVID-19 pandemic
has led to profound supply and demand
disruptions that are threatening the very
survival of many firms and entire industry
segments. As of 31 December 2020, the
pandemic had cost at least 3 million lives and
caused a global economic contraction
estimated at 3.3 percent.6 Although the global
economy is projected to recover and grow by
6 percent in 2021, it is also expected that, by
the end of the same year, around 100 million
people will have fallen into extreme poverty.7

Cambodia’s economy is estimated to have
contracted by 3.1 percent in 2020, with
garment and tourism being the hardest-hit
industries. However, the recovery of main
trade partners is helping Cambodia to bounce
back. According to projections of Cambodia’s

Firms around the world are increasingly
experimenting with new digital solutions to
better understand their supply chains, identify
risks and take mitigating actions. They are
also using digital tools to redesign factory
layouts in order to make facilities COVID-19
secure. In addition, digital tools are enabling
remote access to technical assistance and
training, allowing industries to respond to
travel and social distancing restrictions.10

Throughout the pandemic, the adoption of
digital
technologies such as AI, cloud
computing and data analytics has helped
companies not only to survive but also to
thrive. A study conducted across 20 countries
and 22 industries found that high-technology
adopters outperformed their peers’ revenue
by 6 percent, on average.11

Section 2. Industry 4.0 in Cambodia: awareness and readiness

Key messages of this section

▪ Over half of the firms surveyed are already using at least one Industry 4.0 technology;
however, there is scope to increase awareness of these technologies and their
potential benefits, particularly among smaller and local firms.

▪ A lack of information on how digital technologies can benefit companies, shortages of
a skilled workforce, dependency on foreign providers of technical services, and limited
physical and digital infrastructure are among the key barriers that firms face when
adopting Industry 4.0 technologies.

▪ The key benefits perceived from the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies include:
labour cost reductions; quality and sustainability improvements; and better supply
chain integration and optimization.

▪ Although Industry 4.0 is perceived to be a labour-saving technology, firms also expect

the adoption of these technologies to lead to the creation of new jobs.

▪ Skills and knowledge that are expected to be in high demand in the next five years
include: specialized knowledge about manufacturing activities and processes; cyber-
security; basic ICT knowledge; processing and analysing data obtained from
machines; and programming and coding.

2.1 Awareness and readiness in Cambodia

From the firm survey that was conducted it
was found that, although over half of the firms
are already using at least one Industry 4.0
technology, most (83%) perceive themselves
to have either a limited understanding of, or
unfamiliarity with, the term ‘Industry 4.0’. This
may mean that although firms are becoming
familiar with some Industry 4.0 technologies,
in very specific

processes or business functions. As Figure
2.1 shows, Cambodian and smaller firms
perceive themselves to have lower Industry
4.0 awareness than foreign and larger firms.
Smaller firms also show lower rates of
technology adoption, while Cambodian and
foreign firms show similar rates of adoption
(Box 2.2).

These findings on the rate and type of
adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies are
similar to those from a study conducted by the
Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO)
among 66 Japanese
in
Cambodia. The JETRO report found that, in
2019, 55.6 percent of the firms were using
digital technologies, in comparison with 46.7
percent in 2018. Cloud computing was also
the technology most frequently used among
the firms studied.24

2.3 Benefits of the use of Industry 4.0 technologies

As discussed in the Scoping Report, Industry
4.0 technologies have the potential to boost
productivity, improve labour safety, increase
firms’ efficiency and improve the variety and
quality of the goods and services available for
consumers.31 The firms surveyed for this
study mentioned productivity improvements
and requirements from headquarters and

buyers as being among the main reasons to
adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. However,
several other potential benefits are perceived
following the adoption of these technologies,
including: labour cost reductions, quality and
sustainability
improvements, and better
supply chain integration and optimization
(Figure 2.3).

2.4 Implications for jobs and skills

While some studies35 have highlighted the
potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to
create a massive displacement of jobs in the
garment sector, evidence collected in this
project suggests that it is unlikely to happen,
at least in the near future. The availability of a
young workforce, as well as the existence of
barriers to technology adoption, suggest that
the economic case for embarking on more

extensive automation processes in Cambodia
is still weak.

As Box 2.3 shows, there is increasing
evidence that, globally, garment production
processes will continue to be labour-intensive
for at least the next decade. A quote by a
industry
stakeholder
consulted for this study captures this well:

Box 2.3 Garment industry: expected to continue to be labour-intensive in the
next decade

A recent study published by the German Development Institute addressed the question of whether,
considering digital automation trends, Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries would be able to attract
garment investments in the future, or whether firms would stay in China or relocate closer to
consumers. Drawing upon the insights of interviews undertaken in Germany, China, Ethiopia and
Madagascar, the study found that, while digital automation is likely to shape the future of the garment
value chain, “about 10–15 years remain to exploit labour cost advantages in the clothing industry
before automation kicks in decisively”.

Different case studies used in the study illustrate the persistence of a gap between what is
technologically feasible and what is economically viable at scale. An example of these is the Adidas
‘smart factory’, established in Germany in 2016. The rationale for opening the ‘smart factory’ was:
cutting down the time from design to delivery; allowing fully flexible mass customization; reducing
inventories; and achieving cost savings in production. However, it ceased operations in 2019, and
the technology used there was transferred to two main suppliers in Asia, where it can be applied
more economically.

productivity, as well as the production and
trade of new products and services, will
create new job opportunities for those who
have, or acquire, the relevant skills. In
Cambodia, 64 percent of the firms surveyed
perceive that the adoption of Industry 4.0

technologies will involve the elimination of
some roles but also lead to the creation of
new ones (Box 2.4). These changes in the
roles and tasks will require fast and flexible
responses from industry actors, but also from
government and development partners, in
order to avoid deepening the existing social
and economic inequalities.

Half of the firms surveyed expressed having
a plan to retrain their staff in the next five
years, while insights from the interviews
indicate that some firms are already retraining
their workers as a result of the adoption of
technologies. However, not all

companies seem to be responding to these

Box 2.5 Case study: automation and reskilling in an agro-processing company

A large foreign beverage company operating in Cambodia shared its experience of the automation of
a production line. After three-year efforts and support from technology vendors from abroad, the
company managed to successfully automate production lines in the manufacturing unit, relocating
the excess headcounts to other areas where additional labour was required, for example, front-line
sales representatives.

The company director interviewed explained that since new machines are usually imported from
developed countries, these tend to be labour-saving. They explained that, as a result of the adoption
of new digital technologies, future hiring is inclined towards more tech-savvy employees who can
operate multiple machines at any one time. While less labour is required in the production area, the
company is increasing the number of employees within sales and distribution functions.

For those employees in production that were no longer required, the company offered three options:

▪ Retrain and move to other departments where more people are needed;
▪ Scholarship covering education fees, with the possibility of being hired back when they

graduate;

▪ Leave the company with the respective redundancy payment.

Industry 4.0 adaptation and adoption requires a combination of specialized hard and soft skills. As
described in Table 2.1, these include: managerial skills, production skills, digital skills, innovation
skills and other soft skills.

Section 3. Opportunities in the garment, textile and footwear sector

Key messages of this section

▪ Cambodia has positioned itself as one of the main exporters of garment, textile and
footwear (GTF) goods in the world. However, increasing quality and social and
sustainability compliance demands from global buyers highlight the need to explore
new drivers of competitiveness beyond low labour costs.

▪ The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed new challenges, including disruptions in the
supply of raw materials and drops in demand and prices. These negative impacts have
been intensified by the partial withdrawal of Cambodia's duty-free, quota-free access
to the European Union market.

▪ Despite this challenging landscape, the stakeholders consulted identify industrial
upgrading opportunities for Cambodia’s GTF sector, including: increasing the
production of more capital-intensive goods, such as travel goods and footwear;
development of the accessories supply chain; and improving the sustainability of
production processes.

▪ Specific Industry 4.0 technologies that could contribute to addressing these challenges
and opportunities include: data analytics for improving decision-making; predictive
maintenance for increasing efficiency; augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)
applications for upskilling workers to perform new and more complex tasks; and radio-
frequency identification (RFID) tags to improve supply chain management.

The garment, textile and footwear (GTF)
sector is the most important manufacturing
activity in Cambodia and the main source of
exports. Despite being an established sector
in the country, firms are mostly engaged in
low-value-added segments of

3.1 Sector overview

In 2018 the GTF sector contributed to 65.5
percent of Cambodia’s manufacturing output,
39.6 percent of manufacturing employment
and 66 percent of
total merchandise
exports.37 The sector is dominated by foreign-
owned firms, which represent 90 percent of
the total, mainly from Southeast and East
Asian countries, such as China (mainland);
Taiwan, China; Hong Kong, China;
Singapore; Malaysia; and the Republic of
Korea.38

sector,

Different comparative advantages have
attracted foreign direct investment (FDI) into
Cambodia’s GTF
including:
preferential access to markets such as the
United States (US), the European Union (EU)
and Japan; competitive labour cost; and
investment incentives.39 These investments
have allowed the country to emerge as a
significant player in world exports of GTF
goods. In 2016 it was the 8th leading exporter
of apparel, with a global market share of 2.6
percent, the 22nd largest exporter of textiles
(market share of 0.9%) and the 15th largest
exporter of leather and footwear (market
share of 1.2%).40 The three main destination
markets for Cambodia’s GTF exports are the
EU (43%), the US (26%) and Japan (9%),
with a combined share of 78 percent of the
total.41

The GTF sector has experienced significant
growth in the last decade. Between 2000 and
2019, Cambodia’s GTF exports increased
from US$1.4 billion to US$14.8 billion.42
Despite this remarkable process, Cambodia’s
participation in the GTF value chain is mainly
limited to assembly functions. Approximately
60 percent of the firms operate on a ‘cut,
make and trim’ (CMT) basis, whereby the
producing firm takes orders from buyers, who
provide the design and either specify or
inputs.43 As Cambodia gains
source
experience in the GTF value chain, it can
move from low-cost commodities to higher-
value-added
that warrant
fashion goods
higher returns.

The firms interviewed for the study suggest
that there is scope for upgrading the product
mix within the GTF value chains. For the
leather and footwear value chains, the more
complex products with potentially higher
returns include travelling goods. For the
textile value chain,
the more complex
products are printed and dyed fabric, as well
as fabric parts such as embroidery and labels
and badges. For the garment value chain,
opportunities lie not only in higher-value
finished products, such as specialized
sportswear, but also accessories and parts,
such as zippers or slide fasteners.

3.1.1 Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the GTF sector

Based on consultations with key stakeholders
in Cambodia, complemented by the review of
previous studies and industry statistics, the
key challenges identified for the industrial
upgrading of Cambodia’s GTF sector include:

a costly and unstable electricity supply;
shortages of skilled labour, particularly in
technical
management, supervisory and
positions; increasing regional competition;

the 2000s,
especially in the US market.47 Garment
products for the US market are mostly
produced for segments in the lower price
range, where competition over prices is
higher and profit margins are smaller. A
common strategy pursued by manufacturers
to survive in this challenging landscape is to
minimize costs through the use of simple
designs and specifications, albeit locking
themselves in the production of low-value-
added products.48

Although this negative trend in purchase
prices reverted in 2015, the economic crisis
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the
resultant lower household purchasing power,
are likely to create additional downwards
price pressures.49 Signs of this negative trend
were already experienced in the first months
of the virus outbreak, as discussed in Section
3.2.

3.2 COVID-19 impacts on the GTF sector

The GTF industry has been among those hit
hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. In
Cambodia, as in other contexts, the garment
industry has experienced a ‘double hit’. The
first was the ‘supply hit’, felt even before the
disease arrived in the country. Since over 60
percent of Cambodia’s textile imports come
from China,54 as early as February garment

and the US dried up.

to

Interviewees also reported drops in prices,
where buyers were taking advantage of the
reduction in orders. According to data from a
survey conducted by the GMAC in June
2020, 45 percent of the factories reported that
buyers were offering lower prices. Based on
this data, buyers’ payment terms for new
orders also seemed to harden, since 35
percent of the factories reported longer
payment terms than those agreed before the
pandemic.55

While imports from both the EU and the US
have plummeted, falls have been larger in the
EU, as Figure 3.1 shows. During the first half
of 2020, the fall of EU imports from Cambodia
showed rates similar to those observed by
from other ASEAN countries.

However, during the second half of the year,
the EU’s decision
to partially withdraw
Cambodia's duty-free, quota-free access of
GTF goods became effective (12 August

2020), which has further reduced the EU’s
imports from Cambodia.

Box 3.1 How is Industry 4.0 changing the garment sector?

In the last decade Industry 4.0 applications have become more accessible and opened up
opportunities for different sectors, including garment manufacturing. These include improvements in
business areas such as: production control; supply chain visibility and traceability; workers’ safety; and
environmental sustainability.

Dakota Garment Group is a garment company with factories in Cambodia, Dongguan and Myanmar,
and headquarters in Hong Kong, China. In 2013 Dakota started using an RFID application for real-
time production monitoring (Figure 3.2). Thanks to the adoption of this RFID application, they were
able to monitor real-time production status and stopped recording hand-written production data, saving
both time and money.

Cambodia, has also adopted other Industry 4.0
applications, including: production planning systems,
computer hanger systems and auto-cutting machines.
As a result of this technology adoption, Dakota reports

Section 4. Opportunities in the agro-processing sector

Key messages of this section

▪

Increasing the value added of the agro-processing sector is key to supporting the post-
COVID-19 industrial recovery of Cambodia because of its linkages to other sectors and
the importance of agriculture as a livelihood.

▪ The impacts of COVID-19 on Cambodia’s agro-processing sector provide a mixed
picture, with some firms coping better than others. Three key types of disruption were
identified in the interviews that were conducted: disruptions in the supply of inputs,
impacts on sales and delays of investment plans.

▪ Opportunities identified by the stakeholders consulted include: improving supply chain
management; delivering agricultural services; making efficiency and productivity
improvements; increasing domestic production of inputs; deepening integration into
regional value chains; increasing participation in domestic and international markets;
and improving the environmental sustainability of production.
Industry 4.0 applications that could contribute to industrial upgrading and diversification
include: data analytics to obtain a better understanding and forecast customer needs;
radio-frequency identification (RFID) and blockchain technologies to improve food
safety traceability; artificial intelligence (AI), sensors and drones to monitor organic
production; augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications to train workers; and
automated quality control systems to increase the domestic production of inputs.

4.1 Sector overview

The agro-processing sector contributed to
14.7 percent of Cambodia’s manufacturing
value added in 2018 and approximately 5
percent of Cambodia’s goods exports in
2019, taking into account both agricultural
products and food and beverages (the more
processed form).60 Rice is the single most
important crop in Cambodia. Other relevant
agricultural products include: cassava, maize,
fish and seafood, rubber, sugar cane and
vegetables.61 The main destinations of food
exports include China, France, Viet Nam, the
US and the EU.62

products

agricultural

According to the most recent official data,
there are more than 32,000 establishments
processing
in
Cambodia, employing over 80,000 people.63
The sector is dominated by micro, small and
medium enterprises, many of which are
informal businesses. However, large firms
make the largest contribution to value added
and employment. Medium and large firms
include rice millers, soft drinks and beer
manufacturers, in addition to speciality food
exporters.64

The agro-processing industry has had a
limited role in the growth of the manufacturing
sector in Cambodia, since most crops (rice,
cassava, maize, cashews, cattle, rubber and
soy beans) are exported unprocessed to
neighbouring countries.65 Rice-processing
firms are an exception. These firms have
been established in recent years as a result
of the ‘Promotion of Paddy Production and
Rice Export’ policy implemented by the Royal
Government of Cambodia in 2010.66

for

Agriculture is the main livelihood for a third of
Cambodia’s population.67 Considering inter-
sectoral dependence, agriculture can also
industrial
provide a useful base
development if production linkages between
agriculture and industry are successfully
created. Within Southeast Asia, this has been
observed in Thailand and Malaysia, which
established strong positions in specific agro-
processing value chains and created large
home-based multinationals in the process.

4.1.2 Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the agro-processing

sector

Based on consultations with key stakeholders
in Cambodia, complemented by the review of
previous studies and industry statistics, the
main challenges identified in relation to the
industrial upgrading of Cambodia’s agro-
processing sector include: limited physical
infrastructure; constrained access to finance
to SMEs;
limited awareness of new
technologies and their benefits; dependency
on imported inputs; inadequate regulatory

frameworks; limited food safety, sanitary and
phytosanitary
and
shortages of skilled workers.

mentioned by the firms interviewed is organic
farm produce, a growing global market. The
value of the global organic food market was
estimated at €97 billion in 2018 (~US$115
billion), with a 55 percent increase in the
number of organic producers since 2009; yet
only 0.2 percent of the cultivated land in
Cambodia practises organic farming.68

There is also scope for expanding and
diversifying
the production of processed
foods, including: rice-flour products (rice flour,
rice noodles, egg-roll wrappers and edible
rice paper, rice-flour cakes and dumplings);
liquid rice-based products (rice bran oil, rice-
based alcoholic beverages, rice vinegar, rice
milk, rice syrup); rice-based convenience
foods (puffed rice, rice crackers, canned rice
products, quick-cooking packaged rice); rice
starch; wild
rubber-based
rice stems;
industrial products (conveyor belts, rubber
rollers, adhesives, etc.); automotive products
(fan belts, radiator hoses, etc.); medical
products (surgical gloves); dried chips and
pelletized cassava for animal feed; and fruit-
based products.

The National Cassava Policy 2020–2025 may
create additional opportunities to increase the
value added of cassava exports and to
improve
livelihoods of smallholder
farmers. The aim of this policy is to promote
innovation across all the segments of the
cassava value chain, including: supporting
climate-smart agriculture, promoting cassava
processing and facilitating trade.69

The stakeholders consulted, in addition to
previous studies, have identified scope to
diversify export destinations towards new
markets, including: Australia, Indonesia, the
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Japan and
Taiwan, China. The China-Cambodia Free
Trade Agreement signed on 12 October 2020
is also expected to facilitate exports to this
country.

One of the key challenges mentioned by local
firms is to compete with imported products
that are perceived to be of higher quality than
local products. This situation highlights the
need for business advisory services. This
type of support would help local firms to better
understand and address buyers’ demands,
both in Cambodia and abroad.

4.2 COVID-19 impacts on the agro-processing sector

firms have

The impacts of COVID-19 on Cambodia’s
agro-processing sector provide a mixed
picture. Some
faced sales
decreases, while others have experienced
positive
impacts on both sales and
employment. Three key types of disruption
were identified in the interviews that were
conducted: disruptions in the supply of inputs,
impacts on sales, and delays in investment
plans.

the

firms

Most of
interviewed reported
disruptions in the supply of imported inputs,
mainly food products and packaging. Since
borders were
closed with Thailand,
Singapore and Viet Nam, some of the firms
opted to ship the necessary inputs. Some
firms also mentioned issues sourcing spare
parts and maintenance services.

A survey conducted among 144 firms from
different sectors, between 18 April and 15
May 2020, found that around half of food-
processing firms were expecting revenue
reductions.70 Most of

family-owned.

From the interviews conducted, we found
that, while some firms faced decreases in
their sales (up to 40%), others, mainly snack
producers, reported sales increases (up to
20%). Sales increases were reported to have
levels.
impacts on employment
positive
Delivery services of food products also
reported positive impacts. In addition, despite
the challenges faced by rice mills (the
pandemic, the EU safeguard measures on
Cambodia’s milled rice exports and floods),71
rice-milled exports increased 11.4 percent in
2020 in comparison with the previous year.72

Delays in investments were also reported,
such as the case of the Cambodia National
Agricultural Industrial Park. The aim of the
Agricultural
Industrial Park, a project
promoted by private, public and international
actors, is to improve food safety in Cambodia
through the adoption of new technologies.73

Box 4.1 COVID-19 as a driver of industrial digitalization

Across the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is driving profound changes in the way we
communicate, work and live. On the industrial front, COVID-19 is accelerating a number of
digitalization trends. According to the interviews conducted with key industry stakeholders,
increasing use of digital technologies was observed in response to the challenges posed by
COVID-19. Examples include: online sales channels; supply chain management systems; e-
learning; and access to remote technical assistance.

An agro-processing company interviewed for the study is exploring the use of augmented
reality (AR) for training and accessing remote expertise. COVID-19 has accelerated the
adoption of this technology. They explained how the technology has been on the market for
several years and is affordable. However, before COVID-19 there was less of an incentive
for the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). OEMs tend to prefer travelling and visiting
the customer onsite, which was no longer an option during the pandemic. The company
expected to start using this technology solution by the end of 2020.

International experience has shown that technology transfer is a complex process that requires a
combination of policy instruments. Box 6.1 presents the case of Qiaotou’s button cluster, describing
how the coordination of efforts between government, entrepreneurs and technology organizations
helped firms to improve their production capabilities and strengthened the regional innovation
ecosystem.

Box 6.1 Technology transfer and the development of Qiaotou’s button cluster

Qiaotou’s button cluster, located in the province of Zhejiang in Eastern China, is a remarkable case
illustrating how the coordination of efforts between government, entrepreneurs and technology
organizations helped firms to evolve from importing to producing and designing buttons.

In the 1980s garment producers in China used to purchase buttons from abroad, mainly from Italy,
which is world-famous for its designs. As production costs were increasing, Italian button firms
responded by outsourcing their production activities to Qiaotou, targeting the growing Chinese
demand. Italian firms supplied novel Qiaotou manufacturers with designs, machinery and linkages
to raw material suppliers.

Staff from China were trained in Italy to produce buttons and on inventory and quality-control
methods. However, at this stage, raw materials, machinery and equipment continued to be imported
and Qiaotou’s manufacturers focused on the lower-value-added segments of the value chain.

It was in the 1990s that the government of Yongjia decided to deploy efforts to govern and upgrade
button production. These efforts involved developing an information channel that included industrial
conferences to connect the button firms, special industrial zones in the county and incubation
facilities for new firms. They also mapped and identified the missing components of the button value
chain.

An industrial park was built in Qiaotou to provide firms with adequate physical and digital
infrastructure. The local government also collaborated with technical universities to support training
delivery, standards compliance, design and R&D activities. An industrial science and technology
innovation centre was established in collaboration with Lanzhou Technical University, located in
Gansu province in north-western China, to provide technology information and skills development
support for button manufacturing firms in Qiaotou.

While markets played a key role in driving Qiaotou’s manufacturing activities, the Yongjia local
government, in collaboration with the firms and technology organizations, played a critical role in the
development of Qiaotou’s button cluster.

Risks

Mitigation strategies

Income inequality – Emerging evidence links
automation with reductions in the share of
labour income and increases in income
inequality, particularly between high- and low-
skilled employees.

Job safety and security – Increased physical
hazards from new forms of human–machine
interaction and exposure to new materials.

Non-standard work arrangements, such as on-
call work, zero-hours contracts, telework and
self-employment increase insecurity for
workers and affect their work–life balance.

Drivers of competitiveness – Labour-saving
technologies may reduce the relative
importance of wage competitiveness, opening
up opportunities for high-income economies to
backshore production.

▪ Adopting lifelong learning approaches in

vocational training and education.
▪ Delivering safety-net schemes for those

losing their jobs.

▪ Ensuring compliance with labour

regulations.

▪ Adapting regulations and ensuring

compliance with international standards to
address new safety and health hazards.
▪ Promoting the use of technologies that help
to better monitor and understand safety and
health hazards.

▪ Promoting the use of technologies that
reduce the need for humans to do
physically hard, repetitive or dangerous

6.5 Policy options for the adaptation and adoption of Industry 4.0

technologies

Firms operating in Cambodia are already
adopting Industry 4.0 technologies; however,
this is particularly true for larger and foreign
firms. Although improvements to physical and
digital infrastructure have been made in
recent years, further and more focalized
efforts are needed to ensure that SMEs can
participate in the benefits of Industry 4.0
technologies and facilitate the upskilling and
reskilling of low- and high-skilled employees.

Figure 6.2 summarizes four key areas of
policy action identified in this report to support
the adaptation and adoption of Industry 4.0
technologies:

As
discussed above, business consulting firms,
private training providers, foreign companies
and industry associations are key actors in
advancing local firms’ managerial, production
and innovation capabilities. The growing local
base of software developers can also play an
essential role in adapting and developing
tailor-made low-cost Industry 4.0 solutions. In
addition, through crowdfunding, venture and
equity capital,
the private sector can
contribute to funding the development of a
local base of entrepreneurs to adapt and

develop technology solutions that respond to
the specific needs of Cambodian firms.

The next phases of this project will involve the
review of international effective practices and
the design of mechanisms for the Industry 4.0

In addition to the private sector, a number of
key government stakeholders
identified
during the consultations include: Ministry of
Economy and Finance; Ministry of Industry,
Science, Technology and Innovation; and
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
Other public-sector organizations such as
universities and particular divisions and
agencies within the ministries listed above
are likely to have an important role to play in
Cambodia’s roll-out of Industry 4.0 in order for
it to be effective.
