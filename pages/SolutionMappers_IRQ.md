# # Solutions Mapping in Iraq: Uncovering Local Youth Employment Challenges

[[0:00]] Hassan, please tell us your name and position\.

Yeah, perfect\. So hello, Jorge, I am Hassan Al\-Rubaiey\. I am the head of solutions mapping at the UNDB Accelerator Lab Iraq\.

### [[0:12]] And what is head of solutions mapping for you? Why is it important?

Like it's very important because I will live with the local community, being with the local community, because the local communities are the people who are really not the problem and they have the right solutions for it\. So it's important for me to get the right solutions for the right, for the right problem from the right people from the local community\.

### [[0:39]] So when you talk about community, what, what do you think about?

[[skills:Creativity]]
[[skills:Common grounding]]
[[principles:Empathy]]
[[skills:Volunteering and taking initiatives]]
Like how can you help other people? Imagine what is community like the community, It depends on the challenge that we are tackling\. Like if I am working with the Youth Employment Challenge, then the local community will be mainly about the students who are working, who are in the like last year from the university\. Or if I'm working on the climate change, then I will have a different category of people\. So it depends on the challenge\. But mainly for me, I'm working with the students and with the youth between 18 to 30 years old\.

### [[1:18]] Thinking about these different communities that you just mentioned, can you maybe share an R&D story where you engage with them and you came up with new insights?

[[tools:Futures and Foresight]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
[[skills:Imagination]]
[[tools:Visual thinking]]
Yeah, perfect\. Like my story started before a couple of years when I was sitting in my office and there were different business office items on my desk like sticky notes, paper clips, some colorful papers\. And I was at that time working on categorizing the local solutions that I found relative to employment at that time\. But nationally, I was rationally, I was building a spaceship from these items that I found on my desk\. So I made a very beautiful spaceship without like off my mind\. Yeah\. So at that time I was thinking, OK, so I remind myself when we were Childs and we were very creative and we have the whole imagination in the world when we can do anything from the clouds, we can make shapes or we can do like from cartoon boxes, anything that we want\. So I took a moment\. I said, yeah, I'm still, I have imagination, I still creative, but I forget how to be that much creative because of the surrounding environment that I am in\. Because we are as a human being, we are a highly acquisitive people, our creatures, where we be affected by the surrounding norms, by the surrounding rules, culture and the other things\. So we shape ourselves in the community that we are living in\. So at that time I said, yes, I need to look more into the intangible solutions for this youth to see why they are not really getting employed while the same person in the same situation will be employed\. So at that time I thought, OK, then I need to see for the intangible solutions and I need to find a way to map these intangible solutions\. So from that time I started using the artificial intelligence to map or to simulate the minds of the young people\. So I started to simulate 710 minds of young people from different backgrounds, from different locations, from different universities to see how they are dealing with their surrounding community and how the local solutions that we are mapping or we are finding in, in their community can affect their minds\. And try to play with that simulation and put different inputs and to see how the mental models can affect them and can affect their professional careers\. So for that time, I started to collect data, these data about from 710 people about their current situation\. They are employed or not\. They are like have exposed to any of local solutions, any workshop, any other people\. And I start to categorize these data and I have at the end two type of people\. The first type of people were the people who were exposed to local solutions and they have a better life and career life\. And other people were not exposed to anything\. And they are just exposed to the normal transition by their families, by their teacher that you will not be hired that you have, you don't have any skills, you will just graduate and do nothing\. So these people who are saturated minds have saturated minds with the negative ideas about the employment\. So at that time I, I started to use the artificial intelligence, mainly the artificial and neural networks mechanism to simulate these brains and try to put inputs on it and see what's the result that I have\. If I have the person who is participated in nothing\. If I bring a local solution and put it around him, how his brain will act and how it will affect his career life\. So I start to do that simulation and I start to work here and there in order to understand the these people and how the mental models can affect them and how the surrounding environment can affect them\. If the same person, if I change his teacher with a positive teacher that's saying he will be hired on something like that, then what will be changed? So I start to use that simulation with the artificial intelligence to understand that\.

### [[6:02]] So what are like some of the methods and tools you were talking about artificial intelligence, but like or collecting data\. Can you share a little bit more insight, like concrete methodologies or tools for engaging with these communities, for capturing their mindsets or even beyond this particular story? Like, what do you think are some methods and tools that have been relevant for you?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:ArcGIS]]
[[skills:Communication skills]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
Yeah, like in terms of the tool that was amid of COVID\-19\. So I was in deliberately of moving around or of going directly to the local community and doing direct interview\. So at that time I used the online, mainly the Google Forms like as a main tool to collect the data and then analyze it by the Excel sheets and using the Power Pi in order to analyze this data and make meanings from this data\. So mainly it was using my network, the local network that we created as accelerated lab era going mainly into universities groups on social media, maybe on Facebook and try to post, visualized post with the link of the Google form to collect data from them\. And we got more than 2000 applicant at that time, but we selected only 710 to simulate\. So mainly that was the tools that we use the available tools online at that time\. And then we started to use the power of words and start to directly connect them onto WhatsApp calls with them to understand more and to get more insight about their situation in order to have enough data of each brain that we want to simulate for the method\. As I told you, we use the design thinking mainly the empathy\. The empathy stage is to understand the surroundings of people and putting ourselves instead of these brains and simulated with the artificial intelligence\. So it was a combination between design thinking and the artificial intelligence, mainly the artificial neural networks and, and tell me a little bit more about the stakeholders that participated all along the process, but also kind of ensuring that the outcomes of this experiment could become transformative\.

### [[8:33]] And in sharing about stakeholders, if you could also share like some of the barriers or hurdles that you had to overcome?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
Yeah, like to be honest with you, the main idea of this R&D practice is to support us as the accelerator lab to map what type of local solutions that we need to map\. Because if we are working on youth employment, I don't have a specific device to solve the youth employment\. I don't have a specific device because it's not a magic\. So the main idea of this R&D is to support us to map the kind of the solution that we need to map because the there is no available tangible solutions to solve the unemployment\. So we went to that practice to do this\. So for the stakeholders mainly were two types of stakeholders\. The first one was the academic teachers inside the universities because we reached them in order to reach their students\. And the second one was the, the, the startup hubs or the maker spaces or the innovation houses that we have in order to reach the entrepreneurs and the other people who are succeeding in their lives\. The outcome of this during this whole process was, is we came up that as type of solutions for youth employment, we need to have intangible solutions and they are not in a short term solutions, they are in a midterm and a long term solutions like we need kind of a certain of workshops or a certain of curriculum to be embedded within the curriculum\. So this will take time\. So the type of the solutions, yeah\. So this type of the solutions that we are looking for is intangible solutions and they take long term or midterm to effect to be effective on the youth in Iraq\. At the end, that was this whole R&D practice supported us to identify the type of the solutions\. And then for the next cycle of the Accelerator Lab, we started to really look for the intangible solutions and taking considerations the mindsets and the surrounding of this youth\. And to look something that we never looked about, which is the surrounding environment of the youth and find solutions for the surrounding environment because it's highly affect this youth and the youth employment\. After knowing that we need intangible solutions, it is not really easy to find intelligible solutions\. So that time this affected us to think about the portfolio approach\. So we started to look to the youth employment from a system perspective and to try to find solutions that can affect the system of youth employment in Iraq and how the youth can play a role in diversifying the economy\. So the outcome or the final result of this R&D practice, we started on a bigger picture to design the first of its kind of portfolio of solutions for the youth employment from a system perspective\. And that time where we engage multiple of stakeholders engaging the local community, engaging maybe all the UN staff in I mean the pillars representatives from the pillars to design that youth portfolio\.

### [[12:04]] So I have two questions, but we need to be kind of so since the 1st is like being the Accelerator Lab, an unusual space within the development world and how like what skills did you do you think that you're bringing in and what skills you developed? And that would be one question and answer it and we'll jump to the next\.

[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Time management and adaptability]]
[[tools:Desk review analysis]]
[[tools:Literature review and desk research]]
Yeah\. Like I think the skills that we already have is to think differently and have that analytical analysis because we were hired to do such different things within the accelerator lab\. But the things that I developed was having the artificial intelligence and being know how to use it and how to analyze the data, how to visualize the data\. So these things are mainly the things that I developed during this R&D practice\. And the main thing that I developed is the portfolio approach and how to design a portfolio of interventions rather than a normal project\.

### [[13:13]] Thinking about towards the future, like how would you, how do you think that this story that you shared could transform not only youth employment, but how we can think about development?

[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[tools:Futures and Foresight]]
Well, like life is evolving, UNDP is evolving as well\. And now you're moving more towards artificial intelligence, towards the technology, towards that world\. So starting that small practice to use the artificial intelligence to support our programming work is a seed for the future of the UNDP and the development sector in general\. So now if we need to analyze any type of data, then we will have the artificial intelligence as support to, to, to us\. So I think it will be a seed for the next generation of the UNDB to start utilizing the artificial intelligence to support its programming activities\.
