## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Our frontier challenge was Digital Transformation. While exploring this topic, we realized that this is extremely wide and all encompassing topic and we need to narrow down. For us, digital literacy was seen a valuable entry point, given the development happening in digitalization area, as well as COVID pandemic lockdowns dictating more digital activity and requirements. While we knew from everyday interactions and observations that digital literacy is a problem and potentially vulnerable groups are the ones most lagging behind, there was no data to actually prove or disprove it. Secondly, in discussing with CITA on the issue, we learned no such data was ever collected, as there is no trustworthy methodology to collect such data. Therefore, the intend of the activity was to learn what is real digital literacy situation among the vulnerable groups, and what kind of methodology could be used to collect such kind of information.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If one is either poor or have disbility, or migrant, or elderly, or live in rural areas, then their digital skills and knowledge is not very high. If their digital skills and knowledge is low, then they are likely to left out in the digitalization process

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1. Identify the methodology to assess digital skills and knowledge 2. Adapt to the methodology to Mongolian context 3. Develop qualitative survey methodology 4. Pre-test the methodology 5. Revise the survey methodology as per findings of the pre-test 6. Conduct the survey 7. Report writing

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Specific vulnerable group, such as elderly, people with disabilities, migrants, low income people, people living in remote/rural areas

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Individual interview, observation, and focus group discussion, some administrative data

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time of staff to advice and guide on the methodology, data collection, analysis, and report writing Input and review from Working group, operating under CITA Feedback and review from CSOs and disability associations
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

We found that digital literacy skills are quite low among the vulnerable groups, particularly among elderly and people with disabilities. Because of this, these groups are most lagging behind in terms using digital services and getting advantages that internet has to offer.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We tried the EU's DigComp assessment method. For adapting it into Mongolian, we translated it into Mongolian, then made several revisions after pre-test, as well as simplified the questions and answer choices as traget groups were not understanding them. In addition to intervew, we asked the participants to do simple tasks on their devices and observed how they can perform in reality. Finally, we conducted focus group discussions to test out some outreach ideas moving forward with actual delivery of skills and to listen to their ideas on how best digital knowledge and skills can be delivered to them.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

it took us 5 months to complete the experiment. First, we had significant set off because of administrative processes, then we had some significant review from CSOs and associations of disabled people, as well as government. Then report development took some time as we did not want just usual report, we wanted a story of a profile of each vulnerable group.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

USD 10,000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Ideally, it could done at national level; however, government already took up similar study at national level, so there is no need.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

No.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We had some assumptions at the beginning, but through this experiment we learned that  - The digital divide is real: The availability of digital devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, and smartphones, and connection to secure and fast internet has become an important entry point for gaining digital skills. The study found that only 20% of the respondents have personal computers at home and, therefore, are likely to purchase a home internet connection. Nonetheless, 70% of the respondents are not connected to secure and fast internet. - Capacity building in digital skills is needed: In terms of actual digital skills, out of 5 areas of digital skills of the DigComp framework, all respondents demonstrated basic competency on 3 areas: communication and collaboration, digital content creation, and problem solving. Specifically, they could create basic content such as pictures and videos, sharing them with others, but they cannot edit, modify, improve them, and mix different media contents to create a new content. The weakest area for all respondents was protection of their devices and personal data, with many of them not able to change passwords, no knowledge of security and safety procedures, such as protection from cyber bullying and threats. Additionally, respondents are not familiar with strategies to identify reliable information sources online and the protection of intellectual property.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Finding our respondents was challenging. We needed to find people with disabilities, for whom we needed to have additional support such as sign language interpreter, guide to bring visually impaired people to focus group discussions, etc. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

A-Lab did benefit from the study as it served as a guiding direction for our further experiments and actions. Then UNDP CO gained a lot of respect and credibility in the relatively new field of digitalization. UNDP demonstrated to other agencies that we have capacity and knowledge to work in this area.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Government did benefit from the study as it got in-depth information of the most left behind groups. It serves as a basis for national survey, where DigComp methodology was used again.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

The pre-test revealed that interview questions and tasks need to be revised and we did at least 3 rounds of revisions of the interview guide, tasks and focus groups discussion guides. We learned to use plain language and provide substitute definitions to ensure that we are not intimidating and confusing our participants.  

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

The situation is different for each groups and locations. The more the person does not know about subject matter the more explaining needs to take place and more simple terms needs to be used.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Studies can be replicated in any form for SDGs. This specific study could be replicated in education sector and needs to consider the outcomes and topic at hand.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The explore part leading to the experiment was extremely lengthy as we learned the entire sector, main players, and key challenges. Thanks to this process, we were able to narrow down to digital literacy. Then we mapped different solutions to assessing the digital skills and chose DigComp as the most straight forward. We were a little undecisive at times, which led us to spending too much time on thinking and planning and delaying our action and implementation aspect.

> What surprised you?

Digital literacy turned into big topic for us after the study. It really served a gaining ground for all our interventions and experiments afterwards.
