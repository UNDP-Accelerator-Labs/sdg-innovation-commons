> Title of the innovation

The Dream Team

> Brief description of the innovation

I, OSWARD M. CHOLA, have been an artist and music engineering (or Producer) since 2017. From that time I have been neglected by many as an artist. T.D.T.(The Dream Team) is here to improve and focus on the youth with talents that are unemployed and being neglected

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This will give the unemployed youths an occupation according to their talents. That will help them financially as they enjoy their talents.

> Technical Feasibility

I have no prototype availability, though the aim is to empower the talented, but neglected youth. We will work to improve our talents. We can have fundraising shows every now and then, and every one will get a profitable share of their own, according to their position and efforts

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will reduce the number of unemployed youths, whether educated or not, and give them an income of their own.
