"Art-Benches" in the park (Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan)
Young artists (Daniel Abdyldaev & Nelli Erkin) devoted their creativity to making Bishkek City more inclusive. This is the winning project in #NewBishkek competition organized by the Bishkek City Development Agency together with its sponsor. This was installed a couple years ago, with the initial concept "bringing strangers together to communicate" (inclusive community). At present during the pandemic crisis, it contributes to observe social distancing while communicating;)


I personally talked to Daniel about this work. He shared me that they got inspired by the benches in Kiev. But together with other creative designs of benches, they proposed to Bishkek City hall to launch a map of art-benches in different parks. Citizens can order their preferred design online and donate money for installing benches for their beloved Bishkek City. Nevertheless, the project was not proceeded further. As for now, let us acknowledge the innovative initiative and their concept of "inclusive community" by this work.
