Exploring AccLab's Value Proposition for Country Offices – Through the Lens of Colleagues

Exploring AccLab's Value Proposition for Country Offices – Through the Lens of Colleagues

Greetings, everyone! I recently became a part of the vibrant Accelerator Lab Network team (AccLab) at UNDP Angola, although I am not entirely new to the UN System, there are some themes that are still new to me. My entry coincided with participation in a captivating workshop on portfolio design in Nairobi—an unfamiliar topic for me but already established as a success story in the corridors of UNDP Angola.However, the purpose of this blog is not to dig into the complexities of the portfolio, but rather to reflect on the role of AccLab in our national office. Engaging in conversations with colleagues from diverse areas and countries during the workshop revealed a spectrum of sentiments towards AccLab. As I introduced myself and my role, I heard comments ranging from an intrigued "AccLab, okay..." to a hesitant "Ah, you guys from AccLab... it's good, but... innovations, we don't have time for that..." or even a sincere "In my country, we have AccLab, but I don't know what they're doing." These comments, sometimes bittersweet, were commonplace. Yet, amid the skepticism, there were commendations, highlighting AccLab's significance in offices and how its innovative approaches contributed to everyday work.The Actions!Upon returning to the office from the workshop, I not only shared my insights but also the comments from colleagues with the AccLab team. It became apparent that there are uncertainties about the functions of AccLab and the extent to which the team should be involved in day-to-day activities, considering the local demands and global Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), given the AccLab team's direct reporting to the country office's Senior Management.In response to this scenario, we decided to launch an online and anonymous questionnaire to gather colleagues' perspectives on AccLab. The questionnaire, consisting of five key questions, aimed to elucidate the impact of AccLab in their respective areas and explore avenues for more effective support.What projects has the AccLab team supported or is currently supporting in your area?What role did AccLab play in each project/initiative mentioned above?Do you consider that AccLab's support added value to the project/initiative? If yes, can you explain why?In your opinion, could AccLab provide greater support to your area? If yes, how?In one word or phrase, how would you describe AccLab's work?The Surprises!The questionnaire yielded insights that underscored the significant recognition of AccLab Angola's work over the past four years. From supporting the development of digital platforms, such as the Crowdfunding Platform, to contributing to the creation of the first think tank of the Ministry of Territorial Administration, AccLab has played a crucial role. Its work extends to systemic proposals and inclusive growth projects, such as Fostering an inclusive transition from informal to formal economy in Angola; Enabling Environment and Policy Support for Rural Industrial Parks Development in Angola, and initiatives to address post-COVID-19 challenges. In Angola, the AccLab team has been instrumental in designing and implementing the Portfolio on the Future of Work.

Colleagues painted a vivid picture of AccLab as innovative, creative, open, and fast-paced—a testament to its unique approach to project design and implementation. The team's ability to introduce cutting-edge methodologies, facilitate workshops, and provide innovative tools has transformed collaboration with partners into a dynamic and modern affair.
