Career counselling chatbot for youth in Jordan
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



The unemployment rate in Jordan is high and youth are often confused about their career choices and mostly choose market-saturated degrees because of the society's perception of these professions.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Jordan relies upon its limited natural resource base and a pool of highly skilled individuals, mostly youth, whose exceptional talents are crucial in generating substantial revenue for the country. Despite this and based on the International Labor Organization (ILO), 42.2% of youth aged 20-24 years are unemployed. 

​​Jordan faces persistent economic challenges, including high levels of unemployment, low wages, and high poverty rates. Jordan's location in a volatile region has resulted in significant regional political instability, conflicts in neighbouring countries, and many refugees and displaced persons. The Country has significant social inequalities, including gender, disability, and socio-economic status. These inequalities can limit access to education, healthcare, and other basic services, exacerbating vulnerabilities for already marginalised groups. Jordan also faces significant political challenges, including issues related to corruption, democratic governance, and human rights. 

In 2022, UNDP Jordan worked on an e-learning platform called Digi-Maharat which was meant to offer online digital skills courses. However, the platform did not launch officially, and only four courses were developed. The CO approached the Lab to support which through previous exploration activities had found that youth find it challenging to decide what to do for a living and that's where we started exploring the idea of including an online chatbot that provides career counseling for youth in Arabic.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab methodology of testing solutions before launching will contribute to building a chatbot that meaningfully addresses the youth's needs. Through testing, we can confirm that the online chatting service is usable in Jordan and will provide insights on how to curate the content and logic frame of the chatbot. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How does online career counselling help youth make more informed career decisions?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We are running an experiment to compare the experiences of youth engaging in traditional face-to-face career counseling with those using online counseling via the chatbot. The experiment aims to ensure the efficacy of the AI-powered online career counseling chatbot, gather feedback that will aid in refining the chatbot's logic framework, and collect insights into youth's prevalent concerns and questions related to career exploration and planning, thus enabling a targeted and personalised approach.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We do not have information on youth experience with the Ministry of Labour's counselling services. We do not have information on the youth's capacity of interacting with chatbots and their impressions of dealing with a bot.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Currently, we are focused on three industries. To scale the chatbot, we want to include more industries, run an RCT, and use the data collected through the chatbot to inform decisions made about educational systems in Jordan.
