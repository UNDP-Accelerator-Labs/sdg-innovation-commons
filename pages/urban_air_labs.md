> Description of innovation

Urban Air Labs aims to improve upon Air Problems associated with Urbanisation by combining three critical elements - Technology | Design | Nature

Their patent pending 'Breathing Roots' technology leverages goodness of nature to amplify air purification through specific plants to provide a green & sustainable solution for urban indoor spaces.

Combining design and nature, Urban Air Labs has created an innovative sustainable solution to reduce air pollution, both indoors and outdoors.

With their use-case based products, such as the ‘Ubreathe’ home air purifiers, the purification capacity of plants is amplified by almost 50 times.
