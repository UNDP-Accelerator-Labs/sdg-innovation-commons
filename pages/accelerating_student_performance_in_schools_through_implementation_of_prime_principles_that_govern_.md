ACCELERATING STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOLS THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIME PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN STUDENT BEHAVIOUR AND THINKING.

> Brief description of the innovation

The "ACCELERATING STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN SCHOOLS THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF PRIME PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN STUDENT BEHAVIOUR AND THINKING" is a practical student program that is aimed at helping students in schools overcome the difficulties in learning. One of the prominent factors that has contributed to student poor performance in schools is the lack of awareness of self-imposed principles that help attain school goals. This initiative, therefore, will help address the said factor.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Ignorance is the greatest enemy of man, while knowledge is his best friend.  The more students learn, the more the nation grows. Learner performance is key to sustainable development in society as it eventually affects the social and economic development of a given environment.

> Technical Feasibility

The initiative is designed to be addressed in schools where the target, who are students, are. Seminars are intended to be held at particular schools.
