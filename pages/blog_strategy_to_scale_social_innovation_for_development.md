Executive Summary

To accelerate the progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) decided to establish the world’s largest and
fastest learning network focused on development challenges – the UNDP Accelerator Labs.
Currently, 60 Accelerator Labs are working around the world to support 78 countries. The
Accelerator Labs Network emphasizes a bottom-up approach in its work, facilitating grassroots
innovation to tackle development challenges in different country contexts. The UNDP Accelerator
Labs do this through an innovation and learning cycle. This cycle includes sensing (Sense stage),
solutions mapping and collective intelligence (Explore stage), and experimentation (Design stage
and Test stage). Following this, Accelerator Labs enter the Grow stage during which the solutions
identified in the previous parts of the cycle are to be scaled.

This report aims at providing a hands-on strategy to help Accelerator Labs scale social innovation
in the Grow stage. As social innovation is complex and may generate long-term and sustainable
impact, scaling social innovation is also intricate, layered, and nonlinear. The research for this
report was based on a collaborative approach that provided opportunities for all 60 Labs to
contribute insights from their unique perspectives. This was done to ensure that the report is
anchored in the realities that Accelerator Labs are facing and that the strategy is applicable in
different contexts. Data and insights were collected from Accelerator Labs through a survey,
phone interviews, and deep-dive research interviews with specific Accelerator Labs as well as
their local partners and stakeholders. Then, the assumptions and recommendations of the scaling
strategy were tested through virtual focus groups to verify if the research process was able to
capture the Labs’ views. In total, 46 out of the 60 Labs were engaged through at least one of
these research tools. Together with secondary research made up of literature reviews, the
findings have been aligned with the UNDP Accelerator Labs Team at headquarters in New York
and Accelerator Labs out in the 60 countries.

The scaling strategy has two main parts: A scaling framework and a toolkit. The scaling framework
outlines three types of social innovations and three types of scaling. For the purpose of this paper,
a social innovation could be either a product innovation, a process innovation, a service line
innovation. For scaling a portfolio with multiple types of the aforementioned or other innovations,
the report identifies three types of scaling: Scaling out, which includes achieving greater numbers
through adoption of the innovation; Scaling up, which involves institutional and policy changes
to further the innovation; Scaling deep, which is impacting culture through innovation that alters
behaviors and norms, or a combination of all or some of the types of scaling. Together the types
of social innovations and the ways in which social innovation can be scaled make up the portfolio
approach of the framework. The report proposes that in order to address complex development
issues and achieve large scale impact, these challenges need to be tackled from multiple angles.

The toolkit provides guidance and recommendations to Accelerator Labs on scaling social
innovation under four different sections: Envisioning Scale, Supportive Ecosystem for
Scaling, Resources for Scaling, and Learning from Scaling. The components under the
Envisioning Scale theme provide guidance on how to create a structured vision that will help
provide a better chance of scaling. The Ecosystem for Scaling section addresses relevant factors

5

in creating a more cohesive political and socio-cultural context for scaling, and how to leverage
key actors in the innovation ecosystem. The Resources for Scaling section stresses the facilitation
of access to necessary resources for scaling, with recommendations for capacity building,
financial sustainability, knowledge sharing, legal aspects, and policy frameworks. Finally, the
Learning from Scaling section specifies how Accelerator Labs and the communities can extract
and share knowledge from their scaling efforts both individually and collectively.

Throughout the paper, examples are provided to contextualize both the scaling framework and
the toolkit. These stories come from all the actors engaged in this research process – ranging
from UNDP Resident Representatives to grassroots social entrepreneurs. Together these
statements demonstrate the power of Accelerator Labs and the value of accelerating the scaling
of social innovation to achieve the SDGs.

1. Introduction
Social innovation is the process of creating and implementing effective solutions to systemic and
complex social issues through renewed and novel perspectives and innovative approaches.1 2 It
may include “products, services, markets, or processes,” which address a social issue more
efficiently and can also nurture capabilities to improve the use of existing resources, therefore,
social innovation serves the purpose of developing societies, while improving social capabilities
to engage in development.3 Social innovation is a complex process and may sometimes impact
“the basic routines, resources and authority flows, or beliefs of the social system in which the
innovation occurs,” and thus making it more probable that it occurs in the long-term and becomes
sustainable.4 In this report, social innovation is identified to be mainly in the form of a product,
process, or service-line, depending on the context of the solution, while recognizing that
innovation can come in unexpected forms.

Therefore, as social innovation, by its nature, is layered, the process of scaling social innovation
- around which this report focuses - is layered, complex, and nonlinear. Recognizing the
interlinkages and the integrated nature of the SDGs, addressing this intricate process at the heart
of development has the potential to stimulate the large-scale systems change needed to achieve
the goals. Depending on its context, scaling social innovation to achieve development may require
advancing large systems change to achieve transformative and sustainable impact.5 Thus,
scaling social innovation aims at shifting the focus from the output of innovation onto the impact
of innovation. While output refers to more immediate effects, impact involves long-term and lasting
effects on people’s lives.6 Put succinctly, scaling of social innovation is achieved when the impact
of their scale matches the level of social need.7 The report identifies that scaling of social
innovation can progress by the way of Scaling out, which includes achieving greater numbers
through adoption of the innovation; Scaling up, which involves institutional and policy changes to
further the innovation; or Scaling deep, which is impacting culture through innovation that alters
behaviors and norms, or a combination of all or some of the types of scaling.8

The path adopted to scale social innovation depends on different intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
which impact the start, the pace, and the expected outcomes of scaling. Irrespective of the nature
of innovation or the end goal of the scaling, several enabling factors such as issue-importance,
nature of the solution, financial sustainability, capacity of the innovators, policy conduciveness,
among others, may become relevant considerations at different points in the scaling journey, both,
in varying frequencies and order. As the process of scaling social innovation challenges basic
and well-established tenets, social routines, conventional structures, and belief systems,
navigating the processes is rarely linear exercise. Further, traditionally defined market models
may not be applicable to understanding the dynamics of social innovation scaling.9 The complex
characteristics of social innovation contrasts with the more formulaic and standard models by
introducing aspects of constant change, uncertainty, non-uniformity, and self-organization.10

Scaling social innovation requires engagement with multiple stakeholders and partners across
sectors to achieve broad impact. These may include the public sector, private entities, nonprofits,
the civil society, and even some unusual recurring stakeholders11 and partners specific to the
Labs working context.12 Additionally, the multiple roles in social innovation, such as those of
creators, enablers, gatekeepers, collaborators, adopters, and owners, requires conceiving
strategic collaborations and partnerships during different stages.

A bottom-up approach is key for an effective scaling strategy. This consideration places the local
communities and individuals at the center of the strategy, as drivers, participants, and
beneficiaries in the process. Therefore, frameworks to identify and advance diverse and effective
local solutions to big concerns are crucial in scaling social innovation for development. 13 Lastly,
the principle of communities being at the heart of scaling context is pertinent in conceiving and
achieving scale.14 Therefore, acknowledging the many complex, collaborative, contextual, and
community-centric considerations, this report deploys a portfolio approach, which is dynamic,
adaptive to the complex needs of Accelerator Labs.15

The report, further, discourages straightjacketed propositions, and instead deploys a narrative
that subtly guides Accelerator Labs to identify aspects that pertain to their requirements. It is
hands-on, in that, most of the concepts and recommendations have been developed on the basis
of insights offered directly from the field, keeping the practical requirements of Accelerator Labs
in focus.

Structure of the Report

The report has four sections. Each section is contextualized by the previous section and
complemented by the next.

1) Background provides a brief introduction to the project.

2) Methodology details the primary and secondary research methods used in the research.

3) Scaling Framework defines the types of innovative solutions and scaling pathways along with

case studies to contextualize scaling of social innovation.

4) Toolkit maps cross-cutting aspects that enable scaling of social innovation and provides

relevant guiding questions, recommendations, and stories.

Image 1: The structure of the report

Through its various sections, the report integrates social innovation principles16, identifies that
community-driven change is lasting, provides recommendations that encourage leveraging from
existing resources and networks, acknowledges that the process of innovation and scaling are
not mutually exclusive, and seeks to contribute towards fostering a culture of innovation.
Everything included in this report can be considered as suggestions for Accelerator Labs'
consideration. The framework provides a foundation, and the toolkit builds on the foundation to
provide actionable suggestions for Accelerator Labs and their ecosystem. Accelerator Labs are
encouraged to develop their own approaches based on what parts are most useful and applicable.

2. Background

The UNDP Accelerator Labs Network17 was created based on UNDP's 2018-202118 Strategic
Plan, which was designed to be responsive to three broad development contexts: (1) Eradicate
poverty in all its forms and dimensions; (2) Accelerate structural transformations; and (3) Build
resilience to shocks and crises. UNDP’s current approach to development also incorporates a
comprehensive Innovation and Digital Strategy19 that seeks to better harness technology and
innovation to deliver effective results.

The Accelerator Labs are a part of this overarching innovation strategy, building on earlier work
by the Innovation Facility.20 The Accelerator Labs emphasize a bottom-up approach in contrast
to earlier reliance on national governments, international agencies, or ‘experts' for driving
innovation. This is reflected in the independence of each Lab to identify the issues, solutions, and
process of innovation-led development.

To date, UNDP has created 60 Accelerator Labs serving 78 countries to work together with
national and global partners to find radically new approaches that fit the complexity of current
development challenges.21 The Accelerator Labs have a solution cycle based on four offerings:
Sense-Making, Collective Intelligence, Solutions Mapping and Experimentation. Those are
supported by the three local experts hired in each country. The Head of Exploration is
responsible for horizon scanning, mapping the ecosystem to find new partners, and providing new
resources to data. Additionally, the Head of Solutions Mapping tracks the grass-root innovations
in the country, internally termed as collective intelligence. Finally, the Head of Experimentation
leads the actual onboarding of specific ideas that are being tested.

Image 2: The phases in the UNDP Accelerator Labs

The objective of the Accelerator Labs is to find alternative community solutions to development
challenges and scale them. The solution cycle of the Accelerator Labs allows them to test potential
grassroots solutions and adapt before taking the solution to scale. After completion of the first
solution cycle, the Labs enter the Grow stage of their work, where it is envisioned that the solutions
will be scaled. While this journey can vary across Accelerator Labs, it is helpful to early on envision
how the Grow stage may look and integrate practices that enable scaling of social innovation for
development.

An international seven-member team from Columbia University’s School of International and
Public Affairs (SIPA) has worked in close collaboration with Accelerator Labs on developing a
hands-on strategy around scaling social innovation for development that works across different
regional and SDG contexts. This endeavor was part of a Development Workshop Project at SIPA.
Over the course of six months, from November 2019 through May 2020, the report was developed
putting together research using a comprehensive methodology.

3. Methodology

The methodology for the research was based on a collaborative approach that provided the
opportunity to involve the perspectives of all 60 Accelerator Labs, while complementing the
insights with secondary research. The objective of this approach was to learn from the experience
of the Accelerator Labs on aspects that are most relevant to them and develop a strategy that
would be practical and applicable in various contexts.

First, (A1) a survey was designed to gather preliminary data on the progress of the Accelerator
Labs’ work and their initial thoughts around scaling. This survey was shared with all 60 Labs
and 43 responses were received. Following this, (A2) phone interviews were conducted with 14
Labs to get more detailed data around the Labs’ work, their interactions with stakeholders, and
thoughts around scaling. (A3) Deep-dive interviews were then conducted with Labs from three
countries, including their stakeholders to involve the perspective of actors within the respective
Labs’ ecosystems. Finally, assumptions and recommendations around scaling that were
developed towards the end of the project timeline were tested with the help of (B) three virtual
focus groups. This was to ensure that the Labs’ perspectives were captured accurately and that
the recommendations in this report will be useful for the Labs.

The primary research was complemented with (C) secondary research that included literature
reviews on the topic of scaling social innovation throughout the project timeframe to maintain
academic rigor and include perspectives on scaling beyond the Accelerator Labs and their
ecosystem. Further, the findings from the research components were periodically presented to
the UNDP HQ team and the relevant Accelerator Labs to take them along in the research process,
clarify pending questions, and keep them aligned on the progress. The research deployed a
thorough design, including standard approaches to triangulate the data sources by using various
data collection methods and working with various combinations of Accelerator Labs. Throughout
the research design, 46 Accelerator Labs were engaged in various combinations of the methods
used, as well as over 20 non-Accelerator Labs actors, ranging from two Resident Representatives
and one Deputy Resident Representative to social entrepreneurs leading their own social
enterprises in communities.

This created an iterative and inclusive approach, which focused on building and testing
assumptions in different phases of the work cycle to readjust the direction of the research. Based
on limitations imposed by the COVID-19-crisis, which led to the cancellation of all field visits, the
methodology relied on a strong digital component, making use of digital tools such as Zoom,
Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Forms for interactions
with Labs and the project team.

3.1. Primary and Secondary Research

A1) Survey: The survey included three main overarching research questions:

1) What is the current progress of the Accelerator Labs during the current work cycle and what

are the main challenges the Accelerator Labs have faced?

2) How do the Accelerator Labs address the most common challenges of the Grow stage?
3) What are the current thoughts of the Accelerator Labs regarding scaling?

The survey was administered virtually through a Google form. It was sent out to all Accelerator
Labs with around a week to provide answers. By a sub team of three, this data was analyzed
through a qualitative content analysis. This was a suitable analysis method, as most survey
questions were open or semi-open questions to ensure flexibility in the Labs’ answers instead of
anticipating possible answers.

Based on the survey analysis plan, the sub team met to align on the analysis process in order to
facilitate intercoder-reliability. The analysis of individual survey questions was divided among the
members of the sub team on the basis of the overarching research questions. A codebook was
developed for the analysis of the survey data using emergent codes, which are categories arising
directly from the data instead of being deduced through literature. The advantage of this approach
was to ensure that the Accelerator Labs’ perspectives are accurately captured. In a final meeting,
the sub team aligned on codes used to further improve intercoder-reliability. The survey findings
were then processed in the form of a presentation, which showed the most important insights
from this descriptive analysis. Some of the data presented were disaggregated by countries or
SDGs.

A2) Phone interviews: The phone interviews were conducted using a detailed phone interview
guide. Building on the work initiated through the survey and desk research, the phone interviews

12

provided the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the Accelerator Labs’ work. These
interviews also prepared the team for their research on, and with, the deep-dive countries.
Through the interviews, the Accelerator Labs got an opportunity to further contribute their views
on scaling. The phone interview guide provided team members with a foundational structure for
these phone interviews. It introduced the team to the necessary tools and requirements for
conducting the phone interview. These interviews had two main objectives: (1) To understand the
experience of the Accelerator Labs team during the first solutions cycle and their initial thoughts
on scaling; and (2) Follow up on the answers to the survey.

To ensure that the team gained a representative perspective, the Accelerator Labs for the
phone interviews were selected using the following criteria:

● Regional diversity
● Progress in the 100-day-cycle
● SDG(s) being addressed
● Relation to the three streams of the SIPA teams’ scaling framework

The countries selected were: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Tanzania, Ghana 22,
Zimbabwe, Kenya, Mexico, Palestine, Paraguay, Philippines, The Gambia, Ukraine, India, Viet
Nam, and Chad. The interview guide began with a section on consent and information
management. This section explained the purpose of the interview, how the information would be
used, and asked the interviewee for their consent for participating in the interview, the way in
which the response would be used by the team, and on the interview being recorded as well as
captured through notes.

The interview format was semi-structured to leave enough space for explanations and unexpected
answers, while also providing us with the necessary inputs to fill the gaps in our information needs.
Some of the issues anticipated for the phone interviews included: (a) language barriers, and (b)
bridging the high-level objective of a macro-strategy with the micro-context of local innovations.
The team addressed these by (a) making use of the team’s diverse language skills when needed,
and by (b) conducting in-depth research on bridging to scale based on relevant course readings
and beyond. The team avoided using jargon and referring to concepts that may be interpreted
differently by the various Accelerator Labs. This helped to ensure that the participants had the
same understanding of the questions being asked and to avoid bias in answers provided. The
interviews were administered by splitting the whole team into sub-teams of two with an interviewer
and a notetaker in each team. When consent was given from the interviewees, notes were taken,
and the conversations were recorded to enable clarification in the future. In a later stage, the
findings were synthesized in an excel sheet with a matrix that included all country Labs and
question areas. These findings were presented in the form of a key insight’s presentation to the
UNDP headquarters team.

A3) Deep-dive countries: The team prepared phone interview guides for the Accelerator Labs
and stakeholders in preparation of the actors from the deep dive countries. When the fieldwork
was moved online, the deep dive phone interview guides were developed using a similar format

22 Due to the COVID-19-crisis, the team was not able to engage with the Ghana Lab through a phone interview.

13

to that of the phone interview guides but were further contextualized by the sub-teams’
preparatory research on each country. These calls included the perspectives of three Accelerator
Labs and 17 stakeholders from the three different countries. The countries selected were Serbia,
South Africa and Uganda.23 The selection of these countries was made in close collaboration with
the UNDP headquarters team, following these key criteria:

● Regional diversity
● Progress in the work cycle
● SDG being addressed
● Availability for participation in the research
● Travel restrictions based on Columbia regulations24

In the team, country-managers were assigned in order to have a clear point of contact in the
communication with the actors in each deep dive country. Stakeholders were identified by the
team based on the objective to cover different stakeholder types ranging from the public to the
private sector, civil society, academia, grassroots actors and unusual partners. Furthermore,
stakeholders for the interviews were then finally selected in close collaboration with the country
Accelerator Lab’s team to involve their perspectives, advice, and local expertise. Collectively,
across the three countries, 17 different stakeholders were interviewed.

B) Virtual focus groups: Finally, in order to test the preliminary assumptions developed through
the research until April 2020, three virtual focus groups were conducted with a selection of Labs.
These include the countries selected for the phone interviews and other additional countries to
improve diversity in the Accelerator Labs involved in the research. The Accelerator Lab’s teams
participating in the focus groups were randomly assigned to break-out rooms in Zoom. The focus
groups were moderated by a two-member team. To ensure that the Accelerator Labs were briefed
on the research framework and toolkit, a short presentation was made, which was followed by the
break-out and a semi-moderate discussion.
The additional country Accelerator Labs selected to participate in the focus groups were invited
based on the following criteria:

● Regional diversity
● Progress in the Solution Cycle
●

Insights gathered from previous interactions

The guiding questions for each of the focus groups were standardized to ensure unbiased
initiation of the discussions:

1) What are your thoughts on the scaling framework?
2) What are your thoughts on the toolkit?
3) What additional aspects do you see as relevant for the scaling strategy?
4) How would you use a scaling strategy?

23 The three countries to which field visits had originally been planned.
24 Originally, it was planned to conduct field research in these three countries, due to the COVID-19-crisis, field research had to be cancelled.

14

C) Secondary research: Complementing the primary research, the team conducted secondary
research based on a literature review. This included grey literature such as reports on innovation
and scaling from United Nations organizations (e.g. UNDP or UNICEF) along with academic
literature and reports from consulting firms and private sector organizations. The purpose of the
secondary research was to involve perspectives on scaling social innovation beyond the UNDP
Accelerator Labs. The research was conducted throughout the project timeframe and was
synthesized into different components of the scaling framework, which is outlined in the report
section 3.3. The secondary research informed the initial structure of the scaling framework, and
also helped in gathering literature on scaling concepts, definitions, and taxonomies as part of the
strategy.

3.2. Limitations and Methodological Challenges

The project faced a number of routine issues common to most research projects, such as time
constraints, and the need to keep within scope limitations. Two challenges stood out, which are
explained in detail below. First, the unexpected challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to
the unprecedented circumstances, the original planned field travel and research in the three
selected countries became impossible. While the team was able to find a flexible and agile
solution by switching to virtual interviews, the opportunity to observe in-person the work of the
Labs and their interactions with partners and stakeholders in-person would have greatly enriched
the research.

Second, there was a challenge finding a balance between a structured and specific strategy,
which is also flexible and takes into account feedback-loops in the context of the complex
Accelerator Labs environment. This is a balancing act and we note that this strategy may not fit
with the reality or expectations of all who read it. Still, we hope that it can inspire all who take the
time to study it to think more strategically about scaling in their specific context and with the
resources available to them.

4. Conceptual Scaling Framework

4.1. Introduction to the Scaling Framework

This framework section outlines what could be scaled in the sense of the three main types of
innovative solutions in the context of the UNDP Accelerator Labs. It also elaborates on how these
could be scaled in the form of three types of scaling. Additionally, the section explains how the
framework can be used practically through a portfolio approach. The framework as shown in
Image 4 has been developed based on the findings from primary and secondary research. It
shows what could be scaled: Product innovation, process innovation or service line innovation. A
portfolio of these innovative solutions could be scaled in three different ways: Up, out or deep.

15

Image 4: The Scaling Framework

The three types of scaling shown in Image 4 build on the publication “Advancing Systemic Social
Innovation and the Learning Processes to Support it” which was prepared for the J.W. McConnell
Family Foundation and Tamarack Institute by Darcy Riddell and Michele-Lee Moore (2015). It
emphasizes that scaling could be in the way of scaling up, which means “impacting laws and
policy”. It could happen through scaling out, which means “impacting greater numbers.” This
includes replication and dissemination, increasing the number of people or communities
impacted. The third type of scaling is scaling deep. Scaling deep can be seen as “impacting
cultural roots”, in the sense of changing relationships, cultural values and beliefs, hearts and
minds.

It is important to acknowledge that scaling innovation could always come in “other” forms that
are not covered by this framework. Scaling innovation does not always follow these clearly defined
categories. The report does not delve into aspects of the “other.” However, cross-cutting themes
from the toolkit should also apply to other forms of scaling.

The next three sections are dedicated to providing detailed definitions of the innovative solutions
that could be scaled: Process, product, and service line. The sections use case studies to illustrate
these concepts while referencing the different types of scaling that could be pursued.

16

4.2. Process Innovation

For the purpose of this research, Process Innovation will be defined as new ways of working or
solving problems more effectively, to create or deliver service lines and/or products. That is:

1) The implementation of a new or significantly improved process,25 or a significant change in
methods, techniques and or practices to increase reach, performance, quality or impact.
2) Deliver a new or significantly improved “Way of working”26 in the form of principles, values or
guidelines to deliver programs, policies, services, products, or any other development activities
using resources in a more efficient and sustainable way.

From the perspective of social innovation, process innovation is often attributed to creating long-
lasting, radical, and ground-breaking shifts. That is because it requires a longer allocation of time
to strategize and execute, with support from various participants and stakeholders. It also requires
a “higher level of cultural and structural change,” affecting larger portions of the population.27
Similar to the concept of systems change, process change seeks to address more deeply, the
root cause of a social issue. It is a deliberative process that is designed to shift the mechanisms
and structures, which contribute towards a system behaving in a particular way.

In the context of scaling social innovation, process innovation will be an integral part in addressing
the inefficiencies of how social innovation is being delivered, by changing and improving the
method in which its core activities and stakeholder relationship are designed. The specific
examples and recommendations to address process innovation will be addressed below and in
the toolkit part of this report.

● Defining Keywords: Ways of working, Methods, Protocols

● Guiding questions to understand Process Innovation:

● What needs to be done differently in the way the work is done?
● What steps, activities, methods, and/or protocols need to be put in place to create

or deliver products and/or service lines?

For the purpose of this research, key case studies and stories were selected in order to support
the suggested good practices in process innovation. The first case is from an Accelerator Lab and
the other one from a social innovation actor.

Case Studies:

VIETNAM ACCELERATOR LAB: CASE STUDY

WHY?

The Vietnam Accelerator Lab is working with Danang's Department of Natural Resource and
Environment (DONRE) to introduce the Accelerator Lab experimental approach to Danang's existing
pilot on waste sorting. The Danang city had little to no infrastructure for waste sorting, and it was
looking to recycle more valuable waste like metal, paper, and high-grade plastics.

WHAT?

The Vietnam Accelerator Lab is addressing the issue of waste management in a collaborative way,
engaging with citizens to understand their recycling needs, and how waste sorting could be a
more integral part of their routine to help their community become cleaner.

HOW?

●

Identified stakeholder engagement as the most important factor to address the systemic
challenges around waste management.

● Prioritized two cities and in each city the Lab is creating a coalition of stakeholders to partner

together to address the respective city’s waste management challenges.

● Each coalition of stakeholders would ultimately act like a city accelerator lab similar to the UNDP
Accelerator Labs where the actor/coalition will sense, explore, test and grow a portfolio of solutions
to address the challenges of the waste management system faced in the cities.

● Mapped the waste management process to understand the community recycling needs and

how waste sorting could be a more integral part of their routine.

● The Accelerator Lab shared that early stakeholder engagement is key to ensure stakeholder

ownership of the solutions.

● The Accelerator Lab has also engaged with a diversified array of stakeholders to reduce the

risk of any one stakeholder negatively affecting systemic change.

● The Accelerator Lab led an experiment tracking results of different waste management

approaches, to validate its primary and secondary process improvement research.

SO WHAT?

● Scale out: By improving the waste management process city wide, the stakeholder’s coalition

could be able to expand their reach to much more waste collectors.

● Scale up: The Labs experiments and trials data can be used as a proof of concept and engage

the Government on policy change

● Scale deep: By engaging with a diverse stakeholder’s coalition (including private sector and the
community), behavioral change becomes integral to the new process, by changing the way the
community understands waste management.

KABADIWALLA CONNECT: CASE STUDY

WHY?

● The startup Kabadiwalla Connect works to support and improve the informal waste
management system found in most of the developing world. The company began
mapping the informal waste management system in Chennai, India.

● What the company found was a hyperlocal, decentralized system that was far more

efficient and less expensive than its centralized, formal counterpart.

WHAT?

● Kabadiwalla Connect is working toward understanding this system more thoroughly
and finding ways to increase the volume of waste it processes while preserving its
efficiency and improving working conditions for those involved.

● “By supporting this organically built circular system, we are not only keeping together a
system that provides a living for many people but one that is potentially more effective
and cost-efficient.” Kabadiwalla Connect

HOW?

● Mapping the stakeholders involved in the process and process stages.
● On-boarding new potential stakeholders.
● Training existing waste pickers and collectors as well as creating local awareness.

SO WHAT?

● Scale out: By working toward understanding this system more thoroughly and finding
ways to increase the volume of waste it processes while preserving its efficiency and
improving working conditions for those involved.

● Scale up: The NGO data can be used as a proof concept and engage the Government
on policy change to invest in programs that improve the working conditions and offer
technology and infrastructure support on an activity that provides jobs and directly the
community sanitation.

● Scale deep: By supporting the organically built circular system, provides a living for many

people in those communities.

4.3. Product Innovation

For the purpose of this research, Product Innovation has three different forms:

1) The development of a new product.
2) An improvement of the performance of the existing product.
3) A new feature or application to an existing product.

A more technical definition includes goods that add “new or significantly improved characteristics
or intended uses.” 28

Product innovation does not always signify a significant technological breakthrough creating a
one-of-a-kind invention. Rather, it can also include small scale incremental improvements and
improvisations of products.29

● Defining Keywords: Physical products, Digital products, Platforms

● Guiding questions to understand Product Innovation:

● What new products are required to achieve the desired social impact?
● What modifications to products are required to achieve the desired social impact?
● What products will be needed to support and/or enable systemic change?

In addition to these defining key words and key questions to be considered, more concrete
examples of product innovation are demonstrated in the case studies and stories below.

Case Studies:

UGANDA ACCELERATOR LAB: CASE STUDY

WHY?

Uganda has one of the highest rates of deforestation and forest degradation in the world. Forest
cover has decreased from 24% in 1990, to 12% in 2015, to 9% in 2019.

WHAT?

HOW?

The Uganda Accelerator Lab is approaching the deforestation challenge as a development challenge
rather than just an environmental challenge, developing a portfolio of product innovations to reduce
the reliance on wood as an energy source (e.g. cooking stoves, renewable energy alternatives).
Moreover, the Accelerator Lab is engaging with community members whose livelihoods are
dependent on deforestation to find sustainable solutions.

The Accelerator Lab has engaged multiple stakeholders, including the community, to not only
develop, test, and fund the portfolio of product innovations, but to also develop a comprehensive
scaling strategy that increases access to new products, increases adoption of products by users,
and identifies enabling policy changes.

Scale Out: Supporting product innovation development, funding, and scaling.

Scale Deep:

● Engaged unusual stakeholders like illegal loggers and created a safe environment for

●

them to engage with the government to find sustainable solutions.
Identified and engaged the largest consumers of wood (e.g. schools, hospitals, prisons) to
raise awareness of deforestation and identify sustainable solutions.

● Mapping out key influencers (e.g. religious and community leaders) to raise awareness on

deforestation and change the community’s behavior.

SO WHAT?

Scale Up:

● Supporting the creation of a satellite data platform to enable accurate and accessible data

for policy makers.

● Conducting an energy audit to map the demand and supply of electricity. Once the energy
audit is complete, advocating with the Energy Regulator Agency to change laws and
policies.

● Engaging the community through the development of digital solutions to encourage law

enforcement (e.g. taking pictures of illegally cut wood sellers and sending them to the
government).

U-REPORT (UNICEF) STORY / CASE STUDY

WHY?

With the expansion of smartphone adoption and internet services, young people have become
more connected than ever, however, their voices do not always reach decision makers.

Thus, UNICEF developed an open source mobile messaging platform called U-Report, used by
UN agencies, governments, and NGOs. U-Report has four main functions:

WHAT?

1. Collect information directly from young people via polls.
2.
3.
4.

Live chat support to young people for one-on-one advice.
Self-skilling: Allowing youth to self-navigate.
Community Action: Mobilizing young people to take action on the ground.

U-Report was launched in 2011 in Uganda, and today it has scaled to 55 countries and 6.5
million “U-Reporters.” U-Report engaged with local and national partners to scale in each
country. U-Report was also launched on multiple platforms over the years (Twitter, Facebook,
Viber, WhatsApp, etc.) and developed a U-Report app to further increase their reach.

HOW?

U-Reports also followed the scaling process developed by UNICEF:

Scale Out: UNICEF has identified a six step process for the set-up, deployment and
implementation of U-Report for each country office.

SO WHAT?

Scale Deep: Multiple methods to influence the adoption of U-Report, such as:

● Partnerships with youth organizations and local NGOs.
● Traditional and digital media advertising
● Celebrity endorsements.
● Outreach (e.g. word of mouth, videos, influencers, etc.).

4.4. Service Line Innovation

For the purpose of this research, development Service Line Innovation will be defined as the
line of development work with the aim of providing service to a community in order to facilitate the
achievement of the SDGs in the context of expressed community needs.30

While recognizing the distinct aspects of separate development service lines, this report is also
identifying the interdependence between them. Thus, an innovation intervention, in regard to a
service line, does not necessarily have to contribute only to one specific line but can provide
positive (and negative) ripple effects on additional service lines. What differentiates a service from
a product are three main characteristics: “intangibility, simultaneous production and consumption,
and co-production.”

● Defining Keywords: Offerings / Value proposition / Development assistance delivery
● Guiding questions to understand Service Line Innovation:

● What is the benefit/value a specific actor (e.g. UNDP/Accelerator Labs) is adding?
● What does the community gain from working with the actor providing the service line?

More concrete examples of service line innovation will be demonstrated in the case studies below.
The UNDP Accelerator Labs can be seen as a service line innovation by UNDP. Thus, the service
line case studies and stories will reflect both examples from the Labs workings and others.

Case Studies:

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO ACCELERATOR LAB: CASE STUDY

WHY?

Providing a service line that enables development practitioners to on a regular basis
tap into the local networks of solutions to various development issues.

WHAT?

HOW?

Through scouting and testing of local innovations, the Lab provides a service line. This
is done by developing an atlas of innovations that contains solutions sourced from the
community that will be readily available.

By offering solution safaris, hackathons/challenges, mentorship and a database with
solutions, the DRC is offering a service line that can keep servicing communities with
solutions to development issues.

This is a leading way of thinking about the portfolio approach. The approach by the
DRC team clearly offers new ways of delivering the services of both UNDP and the
Accelerator Labs. It also sets up a service line that has the potential to involve all
three types of scaling, but especially these two:

SO
WHAT?

Scale Out: The approach has the chance of impacting a great amount of people as it
will serve to connect people to the solutions already existing.

Scale Deep: Providing this service line is creating a chance for deep scaling at the
community, UNDP, and government level. With this range of services being part of
the service line, the view of grassroots innovations in the DRC could be radically
changed and promoted.

PROGRESA/OPORTUNIDADES/PROSPERA STORY / CASE STUDY

WHY?

Following the "Tequila crisis" that significantly affected the Mexican economy in 1994, the government
was faced with the challenge to make policies that would address poverty that came in the tracks of
the crisis.

WHAT?

In 1996, what was going to become the federal conditional cash transfer service line Progresa (later
renamed twice to first Oportunidades and then Prospera) was launched as a pilot in Mexico. The
service line has shown significant impact when it comes to "reducing poverty and inequalities,
increasing enrolment and school attendance, as well as vaccination rates, and access and usage of
family planning methods."

HOW?

Three key factors have been identified as allowing for the successful scaling of the service line.
1) The solid political support behind the program ensured that it could survive election cycles.
2) Strong linkages between national level policymakers and the actors working on the ground.
3) The use of reliable systems for monitoring and fiscal management.

It is clear that the service line of Progresa/Oportunidades/Prospera was both innovative and
effectively scaled.
Scale Out: The initiative was replicated in various parts of the countries, and the number of people
reached was significant just based on the individuals directly connected to it. It has also served as a
template and inspiration for similar service lines in over 50 countries.
Scale Up: The service line also came to influence the overall policy making around poverty
eradication in Mexico. Based on its success, policymakers used the service line as an inspiration
when addressing poverty eradication.

SO WHAT?

Scale Deep: This is where the service line has received most of its criticism. After its initial success,
some evaluations have shown that the service line was not able to address the root causes of the
issue at hand. An example of this is that UNDP was part of the attempt to develop Estrategia 100 x
100 to address areas in which Progresa/Oportunidades/Prospera had not been effective enough. The
initiative was trying to help design and develop strategies on “education, health, income generation
and social infrastructure.” Thus, the level of deep scaling of the service line is not clear even today.

4.5. The Portfolio Approach

Building on the three solution types outlined above, this section explains how the scaling
framework can be used practically through a portfolio approach. It provides insights on how to
navigate the three types of scaling and the cross-cutting portfolio approach of a combination of
product, process and service line scaling. A visualization can help achieve a clearer image of the
envisioning scaling for the Accelerator Lab and the key stakeholders that are involved in the
scaling.

Visualizing What is Scaled and How:

To help Accelerator Labs visualize which portfolio of innovative solutions each Accelerator Lab
intends to scale, a simple matrix like the one presented below can be used. Accelerator Labs
can add a tick in the boxes that relate to their vision for scale in terms of what is scaled and
how. It is recommended that Labs collaboratively with key stakeholders define what a vision for
scale would look like as the matrix is filled out. The Mexico Accelerator Lab story below serves
as an illustrative example.

STORY: THE MEXICO ACCELERATOR LAB

The Mexico Accelerator Lab is working together with a Mexican Ministry, testing an invitation letter
containing behavioral insights to a) increase the number of public servants that attend training on
performance-based-management, and b) increase the percentage of attendees who are relevant
decision makers. From conversations with the Accelerator Lab, we learned that the Accelerator Lab sees
this innovative solution as a combination of both:
● A product: The letter
● A process: Introducing new methods to the government to improve the internal management.

26

As a result, the suggestion for this portfolio is to explore the potential of scaling up, out and deep:

● Scaling up: Impact Mexico’s laws and policies through new performance management policies.
● Scaling out: Increase the number of communities impacted through other ministries and

municipalities which could follow in using the letter.

● Scaling deep: Along with training provided through the Lab on the technical aspects, the Lab also
puts a focus on getting the government to value the specific process that is introduced in the form of
a learning component. Changing the mindset in the government can also be pursued with the help
of the anchor point of the Mexican Ministry of Culture.

Theory of Change for the Accelerator Lab’s Portfolio of Solutions:

A theory of change31 considers the early and medium-term interventions to a development issue
that are needed in order to achieve change in the long-term.32 For the Labs, a theory of change
that builds on a portfolio approach is necessary to achieve large scale systematic change.
Developing a theory of change that starts with the portfolio of solutions, which comes out of the
experimentation phase of the Labs and has scale as a goal, can help identify a clear scaling
pathway. Considering the portfolio approach early on in their work will set the Labs up for success
in the long-term. The portfolio of innovative solutions could be a combination of product, process,
and service line innovation and the scaling could be pursued up, out and deep. This report
advocates for scaling in all three ways in order to achieve systematic change. The combinations
available are many and will have to be identified in the specific context the Labs are working in.

_________________________________________________________

“A theory-of-change process allows Accelerator Lab to assess the preconditions and
activities needed to reach Accelerator Labs intended outcomes and goals. It can also be
very helpful for identifying assumptions, such as pre-existing infrastructure. If scale is a
goal, the Accelerator Lab’s theory of change should outline a path to it.”

Agency within the Accelerator Lab's Portfolio of Solutions

The Accelerator Labs will be in charge of initiating the scaling process of a portfolio of solutions.
Other actors will take over when it comes to carrying the responsibility of agency for scaling. The
Labs have an important role to play by identifying “Who” can be the agents when scaling by
fostering ownership by these actors to the degree that they are taking responsibility for that
portfolio's or innovation's success.

This can counter any impression of top-down imposition in the early stages of a scaling effort and
help incentivize collaborative design. In the later stages of the scaling process, when an initiative
is handed over to another actor for further scaling, Labs will provide guidance in facilitating this
transition which will be context-specific and dependent on what is being scaled. Thus, the Labs
have the responsibility of ensuring that the “Who" is always identified to initiate scaling, but the
other agents identified will have to be the owners of the actual scaling. Further information on this
can be found under "Who is scaling" and "Ecosystem for scaling".

Questions for Portfolio Approach Development:

1 What types of scaling does the portfolio lend itself to?

2

3

What would be the risks and benefits of different types of scaling (e.g. reach and pace of scaling
versus quality and fidelity to the original idea)?

How much involvement is desired, or felt is needed, over how the portfolio is taken up and
implemented (complete handover vs. remaining deeply involved as Lab)?

4 What would be the implications of more or less involvement by the Lab?

5

6

What type of scaling fits the portfolio and the capabilities of the Accelerator Lab team and
stakeholders?

Where are new competences and additional information needed? Would the Accelerator Lab be
better off developing these itself or linking up with others who already have these competences or
information? Who would the Accelerator Lab link up with?

28

5. The Scaling Toolkit

The scaling toolkit is offered in the context of the SDGs, taking into consideration resource
limitations and ecosystem challenges of Accelerator Labs.

Image 5: Working model of the Scaling Strategy, including the framework and the toolkit

5.1. Introduction and Instructions

The aim of this section is to provide Accelerator Labs with guidance on the key themes of scaling
a portfolio of innovations. The toolkit provides recommendations, which are brought to life through
stories. Recommendations build on the comprehensive methodology outlined above, such as
conversations with Labs and secondary research. In addition, tools such as the guiding questions
are intended to help Accelerator Labs think through and design a successful scaling strategy
applicable to respective contexts. The insights outlined here build on the various conversations
with Accelerator Labs and stakeholders at all levels, the survey, and secondary research, and are
intended to lay out cross-cutting aspects around scaling.

The toolkit has been designed with applicability to product, process, or service line innovation in
mind, but may also be applied when exploring any other type of innovation. Also, the toolkit
demonstrates how the cross-cutting benefits of a portfolio approach can go beyond the benefits
pertinent to the different types of “innovations” if scaled in silos. The toolkit pertains to various
aspects relevant to enabling the innovation ecosystem to scale social innovation, no matter its
nature or the end goal. As we recognize that there is always room for improvement and that we
cannot internalize all the extraordinary experience and knowledge of Accelerator Labs, none of
the themes or recommendations below are meant to be imposed but are suggestions. Similarly,
this toolkit will not cover every aspect of scaling or potential challenges that may arise, rather it

29

aims to address common themes and questions that Accelerator Labs have indicated over the
course of this research. Context and need will always be the main pillars of bottom-up innovation,
and thus this report will rely on Accelerator Labs to take this toolkit and adapt and improve it based
on these essential aspects.

How to use the toolkit? Horizontal instead of sequential reading - The toolkit is divided into four
sections, each composed of different components. It is recommended to direct the reader’s
attention specifically to the most relevant components (horizontal reading) Instead of using the
toolkit vertically and reading sequentially through the whole document.

These are common themes that are critical in scaling a social innovation that were identified in
our primary and secondary research. The four sections help Accelerator Labs think openly and
broadly on where support is needed. Within each section there are 4 to 7 components. These
components, which contain 1) recommendations, 2) guiding questions, and 3) stories, help
Accelerator Labs think critically and focus on the specific questions to find context-specific
answers. Not all the components and corresponding tools will be used by each Accelerator Lab,
rather each Accelerator Lab should identify what support and guidance is needed to go directly
to the relevant component(s).

The reader can expect the following content from the toolkit:

5.2. Envisioning Scale

Envisioning scale means creating a shared vision early in the innovation process that will help
provide a better chance of scaling. If the whole portfolio of solutions, or some part of the portfolio
does ultimately scale, starting off with a structured vision will result in more efficient use of
resources in the long run. The key components of this vision for scale include defining the
challenge in the light of scaling, application and enhancement of the portfolio approach, assessing
the scalability, setting goals for scaling, and defining who is scaling.

5.2.1. Joint Challenge Definition

The nature of the problem that an Accelerator Lab chooses to address can also have an impact
on its scalability depending on the respective country context. Therefore, in the process of
choosing a relevant challenge to solve through scaling innovation, analyzing different aspects,
including political realities, innovation trends, government priorities, support from the UNDP
Country Office and stakeholders on the issue, and work currently being conducted by other UN
Agencies will provide more information on the relevance of the issue in the context of the
ecosystem, which would impact its scale. Therefore, it will be important to conduct an analysis at
the beginning of the work cycle to identify a pertinent challenge that is relevant in the country
context and would garner the necessary support from ecosystem actions.

Objective: To enable Accelerator Labs to analyze and identify pertinent and relevant challenges in their
country context

Recommendations:

1 Analyze the existing policy priorities of the government in the country.

2 Align with the UNDP Country Office on its long-term development vision for the country.

3 Analyze the existing work of other UN Agencies on similar or related issues to identify gaps and

understand limitations.

4 Conduct a pre-identification “market-testing” with the community to understand the relevance of

addressing the issue. Identify who and how supportive potential stakeholders might be.

5 Develop a preliminary projection on the potential impact of addressing the challenge in the country

context.

6 Analyze the social innovation ecosystem to identify and map trends on the issues being addressed.

32

Guiding Questions:

1

Is the problem that has been identified pertinent to the context of the country?

2

Is the government of the country invested in the problem through policy/initiative?

3

Is the UNDP Country Office currently engaged in the issue or any aspect of it?

4

Is the challenge a part of the UNDP Country Office long-term development vision for the country?

5

Is any other UN Agency engaged in the issue or in an aspect of it?

6 Has there been increased traction on innovations to address the issue in the region/country?

7 Does the community affected by the issue identify the challenge as a priority for its well-being?

8

Has the Accelerator Lab conducted early ecosystem mapping to position the importance and
relevance of the issue-identified across various aspects, including social, economic,
environmental, political, and technological (e.g. PEST), among others, to position its priority?

Stories:

The Serbia Accelerator Lab is working on the issue of depopulation in the country. The
issue was identified after an analysis of the socio-economic realities and government
policy priorities. As there is a consensus on the need to address this challenge, the
Accelerator Lab has seen increased ecosystem support to tackle the issue.

The Palestine Accelerator Lab is working with the Prime Minister’s Office along with
twelve working groups on SDGs. This provides a platform to identify and address cross-
ministerial challenges to achieving SDGs. Through this exercise, the Palestine
Accelerator Lab is also able to identify targeted solutions to the identified problems.

5.2.2. Scalable Innovation

This component addresses practical aspects in scalability of social innovation. Scalability refers
to the social innovations’ ability to scale in any of the three ways this paper has outlined. It guides
Accelerator Labs through different areas that are relevant to look at when assessing if a solution
is scalable34. The Accelerator Labs Network is a learning network and the toolkit is designed in a
way that learning happens from component one to wherever an Accelerator Lab shifts. Even if
scalability is not reached, lessons learned can be applied up to the point of realization, decision
to not proceed, and when the Accelerator Lab embarks on its next cycle of work. The learning
section provides further insights in terms of how to learn from “failure.”

34 The “issue map” worksheet from NESTA that is available here, p. 76, can be helpful for Labs to think about scalability.

33

Objective: To help Accelerator Labs and their network think through the scalability question

Recommendations:

1

Pursue scalability in the SDG context. The following tools can help visualize the SDGs addressed
and their interlinkages: SDG interlinkages and SDG Dashboard

2 Assess scalability in relation to other solutions in the portfolio.

3 Assess scalability together with impacted communities before pursuing scaling.

4 Recognize that when something is not scalable, it is still a learning opportunity.

Guiding questions

1

2

3

Is it possible to identify a strong case for action, such as an urgent need?

• Which (combination of) SDG(s) are the Accelerator Lab working towards?
• What is the current level of need in the community?
• The opportunity size: To what extent can the innovative solution decrease the need level?
• What hypothesis are these assumptions based on in order to meet such a need?
• Through which experiments can these hypotheses be tested?
• What evidence do Accelerator Labs have that the portfolio of solutions works?

Is it possible to identify the right leaders: people with the necessary vision and resources?

● Who knows most about the potential for growth of the innovative solution?
● What (un)common data sources and inputs can be tapped into?
● What are connections with the efforts/investments made by the government and key stakeholders?
● Has there been increased traction on innovations to address the issue in the region/country?
● Is a handover to the UNDP Country Office, private sector ventures or policy change/government possible?
● Can Accelerator Labs seek guidance from others who are already working at scale?
● Can Accelerator Labs consult communities of practice, companies, governments and organizations

working in the Accelerator Labs’ region or sector, and learn from their experiences?

Is it possible to discover the right solution/an effective and viable portfolio of solutions?

● Does the innovation meet the scaling goals criteria? (see below)
● What potential adverse effects could scale the social innovation have?
● Does the innovation factor in innovation-related rights?

Early testing:

● At what stage is the innovation currently at?
● What is the timeline since the conception of the solution?
● What are the early challenges faced to launch the solution?
● Is there documentation of proof of concept?
● Is there a lean and agile method to test the solution to assess the viability of scaling? (e.g.: prototype,

localized implementation)?

● Is there a community of local adopters who have been identified and engaged?

34

Early traction:
● Is there market or community demand for the innovation?
● What are the tools used to assess the target market/community demand for the innovation?
● Has there been early output/outcome mapping for the innovation?
● Is there evidence on achieving the early outputs for the innovation?

Is it possible to take the “right” approach and assess capacity (further details on this
question can be found in the resources section)?

● What supportive policy, regulation, and standards exist or need to be put in place?
● What existing human capacity is available for the scaling phase?
● Can Accelerator Labs build on existing technologies, systems or platforms?
● What are the financial expectations? If applicable, does the solution have a viable business model,

with a clear overview of cost structures and potential revenues?

● Are the implementing actor’s systems and processes capable of operating at a higher volume, or

capable of expanding?

Is it possible to recognize that when something is not scalable, it is still a learning
opportunity?

Even if the scaling is not concluded or does not reach the envisioned endpoint, lessons learned can
5
be applied up to the point of realization, decision to not proceed, and when the Lab embarks on its
next cycle of work.

Story: Social Innovation Academy (SINA) in Uganda

Uganics35 is a mosquito repellent soap company which was incubated in the Social Innovation Academy (SINA)
in Uganda. SINA helped the innovator of Uganics, “dream big” at the beginning of the project and pushed for selling
the products across multiple stores. However, as the scaling goals were reviewed, Uganics realized that certain
constraints, such as transportation infrastructure and the vast rural population of Uganda, would make it more
effective to scale up the idea and encourage local production, then establish a supply-chain for their product. In other
words, Uganics wanted to support innovators across Uganda by disseminating how to make and sell the mosquito
repellent soap, rather than Uganics selling all across Uganda. Uganics believed ideas and knowledge would be able
to overcome the physical obstacles that products faced.

35 Uganics and the Social Innovation Academy are two stakeholders of the Uganda Accelerator Lab.

35

5.2.3. Scaling Goals

Setting goals for scaling from the beginning is key to envisioning scale. While this report cannot
provide Accelerator Labs with all-encompassing goals for scaling that will be applicable to every
regional and SDG-context, it can, however, help Accelerator Labs ask the right questions in order
to set up lists of goals for scaling. This is specifically addressing the question: Is it worth scaling?
If it is likely to fulfill certain goals, it is also likely to be worth scaling. It is recommended to set
goals for scaling in the initial stages of problem and solution identification. Additionally, make sure
that the goals for portfolios that are worth scaling (determined in the scalability component),
otherwise move on to the learning section (e.g. learning from failure). Also, it is suggested to align
on suitable goals with key stakeholders, and while doing so, clearly define the Accelerator Labs
role in scaling, as well as to clarify expectations of the UNDP Country Office regarding goals for
scaling.

Objective: To help Accelerator Labs in developing their own sets of goals for scaling

Recommendations:

1 Go through a process for setting goals.

2 Make sure there is alignment with partners and stakeholders on the goals.

Guiding questions36:

1

Is the portfolio of solutions relevant beyond their initial context? Is it possible to build on existing
technologies, systems or platforms (unless there is a very clear reason why something new is
needed)?

2

Is the portfolio of solutions relatively simple?

3

Is the portfolio of solutions clearly better than the alternatives?

4 Does the portfolio of solutions not rely solely on the talents of specific individuals?

5 Does the portfolio of solutions have the ownership of key stakeholders?

6

Is the portfolio of solutions designed with the user?

7 Does the portfolio of solutions have the potential to match the level of need of the community?

Stories:

\

Raising Gabdho Foundation, an innovation lab in Uganda, highlighted the challenge their
innovators face when balancing between social impact and profitability. Donors typically prioritize
social impact. However, innovators require constant sources of funding to continue scaling, and
thus, these entrepreneurs begin seeking profit generating activities. Some donors do not expect
this and at times the funders accuse the innovators of corruption. On the other hand, innovators
may lose interest or motivation without seeking profits and financial independence. Thus, Raising
Gabdho Foundation highlighted the importance of early alignment between donors and innovators
on the long-term scaling goals. Specifically, the balance between social impact and long-term
financial funding.

Goals are a more concrete and detailed version of a long-term vision. Many Accelerator
Labs already have a long-term vision for their work. The following is a compilation of
different long-term visions that Labs have shared in this research project:

●

●

●

South Africa: Ideally Accelerator Labs want to “work themselves out of a job” -
that would necessarily serve their vision of enabling an ecosystem that is self-
sufficient and sustainable to scale social innovation.

Zimbabwe: “I hope the UNDP Country Office will function as an Accelerator
Lab” - UNDP Country Office shifting from project management approach to
problem solving approach.

Ecuador: “Planting a seed in different actors” - to enable learning in the
ecosystem.

● Kenya: “Serving beyond UNDP to other UN Agencies.”

● Chad: “Make innovation more visible in the region, ensuring intellectual

property for innovators.”

●

●

●

India: “Hard to know when funding is only to 2021” - Not clear mandate for
mobilizing funding beyond 2021.

Viet Nam: “Build similar Labs within government and other organizations.”

The Gambia: “The way the Accelerator Labs work should also be a natural
way for the UN agencies to think.”

5.2.4. Who Is Scaling?

Previous components of the envisioning scale section have been referring to the importance of
stakeholders and partners, i.e. in order to scale there needs to be an understanding of who will
do what in the scaling process. The “Who” question also is key to building a vision for scale. For
Accelerator Labs, scaling is defined in the context of an innovation ecosystem. Thus, this report
suggests an ecosystem approach, in which the Accelerator Lab functions as an “enabler” that
supports the innovation ecosystem within a specific country in scaling a social innovation for
development. This is different from the ecosystem section, because while this is “Who,” the
ecosystem is the “How” to engage with stakeholders for scaling, focusing on the specifics of each
stakeholder. The goal of this section is to get Accelerator Labs to think of the potential actors, the
different “Who,” that may exist and need to be engaged in the scaling process. Through the earlier
parts of the working cycle, Accelerator Labs will have an understanding of what actors are relevant
to the space the Accelerator Labs are working in. This part of the toolkit will help them identify
who is specifically relevant when scaling.

Objective: To clarify “who” is scaling to be able to look in detailed at specific ecosystem actors in the
following section on the “ecosystem”

Recommendations:

1 Map37 the Accelerator Labs in-country innovation ecosystem.

2

Identify key innovation champions.

3 Position the Accelerator Lab as an “enabler” of the innovation ecosystem.

Guiding Questions:

In mapping the Accelerator Labs’ innovation ecosystem, a few key questions can help clarify the
roles of key stakeholders in the ecosystem:

1 Who would be paying for the scaling of the portfolio of social innovation solutions?

2 Who would be delivering the scaling of the portfolio of social innovation solutions?

3 Who would be using the social innovation solutions of the portfolio?

4 Who would be benefiting from scaling of the portfolio of social innovation solutions?

5 Who can influence the impact of the scaled portfolio of social innovation solutions?

37 The “stakeholder map” worksheet by Nesta that is available here, p. 78, can be helpful for Labs to map the in-country innovation ecosystem.

38

Story:

In its efforts to address deforestation, the Uganda Accelerator Lab has identified an
unusual partner that may be able to have a large impact on the success of the work –
Her Royal Highness the Nnabagereka/Queen of the Kingdom of Buganda, Sylvia
Nagginda. The Queen has the potential of amplifying the overall work of the portfolio in
regard to the issue of deforestation. In addition, the monarchy has the authority to inspire
people to change their lives in multiple ways and may serve as an influencer across
multiple issue areas over time.

5.3. Supportive Ecosystem for Scaling

The ecosystem for scaling looks beyond social innovation itself and at the different actors within
the innovation ecosystem involved or impacted in the innovation process, and how their
interactions with one another and the scaling environment impact this process. The ecosystem is
“characterized by an array of interacting organizations, individuals (collectively referred to as
“actors”), elements, relationships, and conditions that either enable or impede innovation.”38 The
scalability and sustainability of a social innovation is connected to the ecosystem – how engaged
and aligned the different elements of the ecosystem are on the innovation.

Innovation does not happen in a vacuum but instead exists amongst moving parts that are
continually evolving and changing. Rather than being a fixed and stagnant environment, the
ecosystem may evolve, adjusting to fit the needs of the innovation through the various stages of
scaling. Mapping out and thinking about the ecosystem allows innovators to reflect upon the
current enablers and barriers as well as what conditions are needed to support the scaling
process. These components outlined in the supportive ecosystem section of the toolkit will help
guide Accelerator Labs in identifying if and how ready the ecosystem is for scaling. The
stakeholders highlighted as components in this section reflect stakeholders with whom many of
Accelerator Labs referenced engaging throughout our research; it is important to highlight that
there are numerous other actors (i.e. academia, media, sector-specific actors) who may engage
in the scaling ecosystem and the ones highlighted here are not the end-all be-all.

5.3.1. Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder engagement is a process of organizing and interacting with relevant actors who may
have an impact or be impacted by the innovation, its scalability, or the overall portfolio.
Stakeholder engagement looks at information and resource sharing, vision alignment, capacity
development among other components. Stakeholder engagement goes beyond looking at “who”
as part of the scaling environment to “how” to coordinate and engage these actors. Accelerator
Labs are playing a unique role to ‘bridge’ stakeholders together and organize interactions to
create greater synergies. Their position within UNDP along with working in a small team allows

38 Hoffecker 2018.

39

an Accelerator Lab to be agile and engage both large and small stakeholders. It is important to
acknowledge that scaling innovation will not benefit all stakeholders equally, and some may even
experience negative impact from the innovation. Similarly, not all stakeholders hold the same
weight of influence and importance. It is critical to assess how each stakeholder fits in the
ecosystem, to what level the stakeholder could/should be engaged, and then approach the
stakeholder accordingly to leverage the partnership to reach the scalability of the solutions.

Objective: To coordinate collaborations and resources of stakeholders to create a more cohesive
ecosystem for scaling

Recommendations:

1

2

Map out all stakeholders engaged and the respective resources and expertise each stakeholder
brings. (Nesta has created useful stakeholder mapping worksheets here)39

Assess the stakeholder map to see where there is duplicated efforts, room for better coordinate
efforts, and more suitable roles for stakeholders that can contribute to a more systematic approach.

3 Facilitate a process where stakeholders should clearly define and align roles.

4 Define and align the Accelerator Lab’s role with the different stakeholders.

5

Initiate early engagement with stakeholders to build collective ownership of the scaling process.

6

Map resources (e.g. finance, specialized equipment, knowledge repository, training, mentorship)
with stakeholders to identify what each stakeholder can provide and coordinate logistically the use
of outlined available resources. See section 3 on Resources for Scaling for further guidance.

7 Build trust and create safe and neutral space for engagement of all stakeholders.

8

Identify the skills and insight each stakeholder brings and coordinate a systematic way of information
sharing through platforms (e.g. via Google Drive or Dropbox) and communication channels (e.g.
WhatsApp chats, regular meetings, emails) among stakeholders.

Guiding Questions:

1

Has the Accelerator Lab identified ‘unusual partners’ who could provide alternative insights to scale
innovation?

2 How can stakeholders be engaged early on to ensure ownership?

3 Are there barriers preventing stakeholders from engaging with one another?

4 Are there potential stakeholders who are not being engaged within the ecosystem?

5 Are all stakeholders aligned on the vision for scaling?

39 DIY Development Impact & You. n.d. https://diytoolkit.org/tools/people-connections-map/

40

6

Are there 'champions' of the innovation in hard to reach sectors or organizations that advocate for
the innovation?

7 How are local communities engaged?

8

Is there a clear pathway for communication between stakeholders?

9

By engaging with certain stakeholders, does that threaten potential engagement with other
stakeholders?

Stories:

The South Africa Accelerator Lab did an environmental scan and built an internal matrix to
assess the innovation ecosystem in the country. Through identifying partners and stakeholders for
accelerating implementation towards the SDGs, the Accelerator Lab found coordination,
interaction, and collaboration among the actors as one of the key areas to improve the ecosystem.

Grassroots Innovation: Missing Link In The Innovation Ecosystem In South Africa

The Kenya Accelerator Lab partnered with the Aga Khan University to create a pilot program that
trains out of school journalists as an effort to tackle the larger challenge of youth unemployment.
The Accelerator Lab saw this as an opportunity to leverage the local journalists as solutions
mappers on the ground as well as bridge the information access divide. Through this pilot program,
the Aga Khan University provided technical journalism skills and the Accelerator Lab brought in
the solutions mapping linking it to the SDGs and the Decade of Action and seeing how we could
use the Labs tools like issue mapping to unpack some of the challenges the journalists were facing.
The young journalists shared their insights and ideas on how to address some of the challenges
around youth unemployment and understanding what is happening on the local level.

5.3.2. Building Partnerships

Building partnerships looks at how to engage and build partnerships with actors within the country
in which scaling is taking place. When thinking about new partnerships, the Lab should search for
ones that will have added value, whether it is opening the Accelerator Lab to a new network of
stakeholders, resources, or knowledge. A partnership is a one-on-one individualized relationship
that looks at achieving a joint goal together, unlike stakeholder engagement which looks at
interactions and coordinated efforts among a group of actors. A potential partnership should look
at how to get supportive resources for scaling. When building partnerships, it is important to
remember that not all partnerships will have the same timeline; some partnerships will be
essential only for the initial stages of scaling while others may be critical for the entire process.
Identify sustainable partnerships early on, who have the capacity and interest in the innovation to
engage it throughout the scaling process. In addition, assess when and where in the scaling
process each partnership fits and structure the partnership accordingly. Unlike the stakeholder
engagement component, this component focuses on building new partnerships, which helps the
scaling process acquire the supportive resources needed for scaling.

41

Objective: To identify and establish partnerships with actors who can support and bring added resources
to the ecosystem for scaling

Recommendations:

1

2

3

4

5

Agree on the components of the relationship and what each side brings in the beginning. This will
help reduce the risk of power imbalance. (NESTA has additional worksheets and checklists relevant
to establishing partnerships and respective roles.)40

Identify resources, knowledge, or capacity that is absent and target partnerships that can strengthen
these points.

Differentiate the short-term and long-term partnerships and adjust engagement and expectations
accordingly. Different stages of scaling may require different resources or knowledge, and structure
partnerships according to the various needs of the scaling process to maximize the added value
from the partnership.

Create long-lasting partnerships with stakeholders who have common interests/goals, aligning the
partnership along the shared vision.

Develop partnerships with leading academic institutions (e.g. universities, research institutes, think
tanks etc.) who bring in expertise/knowledge and are able to test potential solutions.

Guiding Questions:

1

2

Are there certain skills/training/knowledge the Accelerator Lab is missing that could enable scaling
of social innovation, which could be strengthened through a partnership?

Can sustainable partners be identified to invest resources (e.g.: time, money, infrastructure, etc.)
for the longevity of the innovation?

3

Is there a partnership and engagement strategy to continuously bring in new partnerships?

4 How can the Accelerator Lab’s partners help mobilize resources?

5

Have the Accelerator Lab’s partners/stakeholders been categorized and documented for future
access?

6 How does this partnership support the scaling environment and further the scaling process?

7 Are there legal documents/contracts outlining the partnership and terms of engagement?

8 What can the Accelerator Lab/partner offer that makes for a flourishing partnership?

42

Stories:

The Gambia Accelerator Lab believes how one enters and engages in a partnership is
critical. The Accelerator Lab emphasizes to potential partners that it is not about picking
winners but rather, partners who are first movers and will solve the problems the
Accelerator Lab is focused on.

The Ukraine Accelerator Lab is creating a toolkit for communities to identify
environmental problems and support these communities to solve the problems with
nature-based solutions. Some partners only see the Accelerator Lab and UNDP as a
top-down approach and the Accelerator Lab is looking for potential partners who share
the vision of a community driven bottom-up approach. Through a new partnership with
Biodiversity Foundation, a Ukrainian foundation, the Accelerator Lab is working to have
the toolkit available directly for communities, putting greater decision power in the hands
of local communities.

5.3.3. Conducive Innovation Policies

Another aspect of the ecosystem are the policies, cultural norms, regulations, and political
frameworks where scaling occurs. Policies and norms can help shape incentives to scale social
innovations through regulating the sector, funding opportunities, and intellectual property laws.
However, just as policies can encourage and foster an environment of innovation, policymaking
can stifle scaling whether that is accessibility to capital or the market. Accelerator Labs should
analyze the current policies and see how to best align scaling goals with current policies or engage
with the government to collaborate on developing policies that better support an environment for
scaling of innovations.

Objective: To identify and align with policies that support innovations and the scaling ecosystem

Recommendations:

1 Advocate for innovation-friendly policies (i.e. policies that support intellectual property laws).

2

Involve local government in the design phase and address key community concerns.

3

4

Engage the government, especially those who are champions of innovation, for entrepreneurial
friendly policies.

Think of the long-term impact the innovation may have on policies for future innovations and their
scalability.

5 Evaluate if there are current policies that could better leverage the scaling goals.

43

Guiding Questions:

1 Are there policies that may pose advantages/barriers for scaling?

2 Are there certain policies that need to be in place to support the scaling process?

3 How can scaling this innovation impact policies to support future innovations?

4

If policies do not align with the scaling goals, are there measures that can be set in place to protect
the scaling process from these potential barriers?

5 Are there ordinances or cultural norms that will shape the scaling approach?

Stories:

Serbia has been part of a growing tech economy, and many digital nomads have been moving to
Belgrade to be part of this growing sector. The Serbia Accelerator Lab is working with Digital
Serbia Initiative, a Serbian NGO, on a project to advertise Belgrade as a digitally friendly city and
making it an attractive destination for digital nomads. Recognizing how this project can help
counteract the depopulation trend Serbia is facing, the government of Serbia has aligned its efforts
with Digital Serbia Initiative and the larger tech industry to support growth of this sector. The
Serbian government has put in place regulations around the digital economy to strengthen the tech
industry as well as attract digital nomads and other migrants to Serbia. Since one of Digital Serbia
Initiative’s outcomes aligned with the national agenda on depopulation, both of their efforts helped
to further one another’s goal.

5.3.4. UNDP Country Offices

Accelerator Labs are uniquely positioned to connect UNDP with local actors. The SIPA Team’s
research suggested this is among the key aspirations of both Accelerator Labs and the UNDP
Country Offices. Both recognize the symbiosis in this relationship, and as an agile and flexible
entity, Accelerator Labs are able to employ different methodologies. Accelerator Labs and the
UNDP Country Office should work together to mainstream and collaborate on innovative
methodologies that challenge traditional approaches. When thinking about innovations to scale,
the Lab should identify which solutions fit into the portfolio of projects and the larger agenda of
the UNDP Country Office. Advocates and supporters within the UNDP Country Office must be
identified based on who can support the scaling efforts.

_________________________________________________________

“It's not a Lab of the three of us but rather 20, 30, 50 people from the office who are
early adopters of innovative methodologies who want to change the usual way of doing
business of UNDP.”

Serbia Accelerator Lab
_______________________________________________________

44

Objective: To integrate and collaborate with the UNDP Country Office to mainstream efforts to create
an integrated ecosystem for scaling

Recommendations:

1

Integrate the Accelerator Lab’s process/service line and understanding within the UNDP Country
Office. Share relevant learnings and methodology processes in a timely manner. Be open to
feedback and adjustments and incorporate them where applicable.

2

Identify early adopters within the UNDP Country Office who can support the scaling process.

3

4

Align with the UNDP Country Office on the goals of portfolios/projects and how these goals align
with the long-term vision.

Assess the general relationship between the Accelerator Lab and the UNDP Country Office. Ease
any concerns and build a cooperative and trusting working relationship whether that is through
monthly meeting updates or joint brainstorming and working sessions.

Guiding Questions:

1

2

Are there system barriers that could hinder the scalability of an innovation that the Accelerator Lab
and UNDP Country Office can work together to overcome?

Can the UNDP Country Office provide introductions to potential partners, especially those beyond
the country network?

3

Is there a pathway to integrate the Lab’s methodology and learnings in the UNDP Country Office?

4 How does the innovation align with the portfolio of solutions of the UNDP Country Office?

5 Are there other roles the Accelerator Lab can play to support the UNDP Country Office?

6

7

Are there ways to improve the working dynamics between the Accelerator Lab and UNDP Country
Office?

Is there open communication or does the work of the Accelerator Lab and UNDP Country Office feel
out-of-sync?

Stories:

The Paraguay Accelerator Lab noticed early on that there was distrust from the UNDP Country
Office. The Accelerator Lab worked to change that by creating a learning and sharing session with
the UNDP Country Office on a monthly basis. This was a workshop to teach different methods and
tools to the UNDP Country Office (e.g. Theory of Change). The Accelerator Lab highlighted how
there is still a need to clarify the activities conducted and to what extent the Lab is able to go
beyond the existing UNDP Country Office portfolio. However, the relationship between the
Accelerator Lab and UNDP Country Office is a growing and working relationship that will evolve
throughout the course of engagement.

45

The Democratic Republic of Congo Accelerator Lab has received a role in the UNDP Country
Office’s Strategic Policy Unit. The implication is that the Lab has greater influence on the strategic
and policy decisions at the highest management level of the UNDP Country Office and can benefit
from the strategic and policy advice/expertise of this unit. It can potentially give the Accelerator
Lab more "power" in making sure these methods are used within the UNDP Country Office. This
exemplifies how the Accelerator Lab can be integrated and mainstream its methodologies and
understandings into the larger UNDP Country Office framework.

5.3.5. Government

Based on the survey conducted with Accelerator Labs, many indicated how the government is
seen as a key actor for scaling. The government is usually one of the largest actors in any scaling
ecosystem with a large capacity for support of innovations, whether that is through passing
innovation supporting policies, interagency supporting coordination throughout the country (in
either or both public and private sectors), or directly partnering in scaling. Getting government
support and engagement can be crucial in ensuring the sustainability of an innovation.

Objective: To find ways to incorporate government support and engagement to enable scaling

Recommendations:

1 Align innovations with government priorities and strategies.

2

3

4

5

6

Get buy-in from members of government to support the sustainability of social innovation through
directly engaging in the scaling process or by vocally supporting the innovation’s goals.

Be mindful of the political climate and how it can reshuffle government priorities and involvement in
the scaling process. Assess if an innovation is tied to a political priority of a political party/official or
is it a larger more universally accepted innovation across political party lines.

Engage the government, especially those members and officials who are champions of innovation,
for entrepreneurship-friendly policies.

Focus on aligning the innovation and its scaling strategy with the mission of a ministry (i.e the
Ministry of Health or Ministry of Education).

Engage with a senior government agency (e.g. Office of the Prime Minister) to provide senior
government guidance and ensure line ministries are actively engaged in the innovation ecosystem.

Guiding Questions:

1 Does the innovation align with the government’s priorities and strategies?

2

Is there governmental support for the innovation?

46

3 How may engaging the government alter engagement with other stakeholders?

4 Will engagement with government persist if there is a change in political climate?

5 Do elections and change in administration present barriers for the scaling process?

6

Are there specific ministries and government offices that the innovation aligns with its goals and
agenda?

Stories:

The Uganda Accelerator Lab is looking at different solutions to address climate change, and one
area of focus has been the rapid levels of deforestation in the country. In order to address this
challenge, the Accelerator Lab has been working on projects to understand the drivers of
deforestation and create efforts to combat it. To understand the deforestation issue and work on
sustainable solutions, the Accelerator Lab organized a workshop between illegal loggers,
government, universities, incubators, FAO, and Global Pulse to collaborate on solutions to
deforestation. It was the first time the government sat with the illegal loggers and worked together
on sustainable solutions. The Accelerator Lab provided a politically neutral space where illegal
loggers felt comfortable to engage in dialogue with government officials about deforestation. In
situations like this, the Lab can facilitate a neutral space and encourage unlikely stakeholders to
work together.

5.3.6. UN Network & Agencies

The breadth of the UN Network presents a valuable asset to Accelerator Labs from knowledge
and experience resources to new stakeholder and partnerships to capacity support. Many of the
UN agencies have in-house innovation incubators and portfolios of projects that are being worked
on. Rather than create new projects or approaches, coordination must be enhanced with the
respective UN system partners to enhance the reach and impact of the innovation. Similarly, many
of these agencies have specialized knowledge on certain subjects and have projects and goals
to address them. Building on this knowledge and specialization can help Accelerator Labs have
width and depth in the scaling strategy.

Objective: To engage the relevant UN agencies and network within the country to foster a cohesive and
integrated ecosystem for scaling

Recommendations:

1

Integrate the Accelerator Lab’s process/service lines and understanding within the UN system.

2

Identify synergies across different UN agencies. Some mandates overlap with some of the
experiments the Accelerator Lab is running - focus on aligning and enhancing each other’s work
rather than duplicate.

47

3

Align on efforts (e.g. service lines, events) so that one another's work complements and supports
each other when possible.

4 Build off of one another’s contacts and networks.

5

Coordinate with agencies that have specialized knowledge on the topic the innovation addresses
to share their insights and experiences.

Guiding Questions:

1

Is there an opportunity to collaborate/partner with other UN agencies working on the same issue?

2 How can the Lab’s findings and process/service line be shared across agencies?

3

Is there a repository of knowledge and training from other UN agencies easily available?

4 How can the larger UN network be engaged in the innovation?

Stories:

The Gambia Accelerator Lab is focusing on youth unemployment. One of its projects
is a jobs alert/job matching platform. With a high mobile phone penetration rate in the
Gambia, the Lab is looking at how to make this platform mobile friendly (i.e. sending SMS
notifications). The UNDP Country Office has been posting jobs on this platform and the
Lab is working with UNCT to have them use this platform as well.

The India Accelerator Lab is working on air pollution in the National Capital Region.
While the issue of air pollution has several pieces, the India Accelerator Lab was able to
leverage the work and resources of UNEP through successful collaboration and
knowledge sharing.

5.3.7. Community Engagement

Engagement with the community is among the most crucial factors necessary to scale social
innovations. While all components under the toolkit should ensure that this is achieved, integrating
methods to engage with the community will support the Accelerator Labs achieving the required
number of people, impacting the necessary institutional frameworks, and in bringing about a
cultural change. Engaging with communities through a targeted, collaborative and culturally
sensitive process is also key to achieve the large-scale impact that social innovation envisions.

Objective: To develop a strategy to engage the community to scale social innovation

48

Recommendations:

1

Identify clearly the conceived outputs, outcomes, and impact for the community.

2

3

4

Create a communication strategy for awareness on the positive outputs, outcomes, and impact on
the community that has been achieved or is expected to be achieved.

Collaborate with media, community leaders, and other partners to communicate to the community
effectively.

Engage with the UN Communications Office to align the collective narrative to enable community
engagement.

5

Identify local organizations to position strategic affiliations to build community trust.

6

7

8

9

Reduce information and cultural barriers by using accessible platforms and language to connect to
the community.

Engage community representatives for feedback to assess expectations and the envisioned impact
of the innovation.

Deploy the 5 R framework - Readiness, Receptivity, Resources, Risks, and Returns41 from the
perspective of the community to enable uptake.

Leverage digitals tools such as UNICEF’s RapidPro42 and U-Report43 platforms to engage with a
broader base of the community.

Guiding Questions:

What is the Accelerator Lab’s current strategy to encourage community engagement to enable
scaling of social innovation?

Is the Accelerator Lab mapping the community ecosystem and their priorities using tools such as
empathy maps, or the 5 R framework, or other methods to analyze and improve community
engagement?

Is the Accelerator Lab conducting community engagement activities, such as awareness
campaigns, information dissemination activities, and participatory programs, to increase community
engagement?

Is the Accelerator Lab engaging with relevant stakeholders, such as the UN Communications Office,
media, community leader, to develop strategic narratives to increase community engagement?

Is the Accelerator Lab taking measures to develop relevant and effective content that overcomes
cultural and language barriers to increase community participation?

Is the Accelerator Lab partnering with any local communities for trust-building with the community
to enable greater engagement for scaling innovation?

Has the Accelerator Lab identified potential digital tools/platforms to improve community
engagement?

Is the Accelerator Lab using tools that are easily accessible and practical for the communities to
engage?

Stories:

The South Africa Accelerator Lab is working with the national radio and local celebrities
to disseminate information on the impact achieved by the UNDP. This is an important
preliminary step to ensure that the information opacity among communities on the work
being conducted by the UNDP, including the work Accelerator Labs, is reduced and there
is greater community engagement. In addition, the South Africa Accelerator Lab is
working with communities through innovation hubs to better understand the realities of
people in communities.

The Ecuador Accelerator Lab was inspired by the “human library” movement in
Denmark and created its own citizen engagement platform, where people engage
through stories connected to SDGs using a simple Google form. Following the
preliminary sharing of stories over the online platform, the Ecuador Accelerator Lab
conducted in-person storytelling workshops for the community to increase engagement
and use storytelling as a tool for social change. This became a platform for networking
and an enabler of scaling.

5.4. Resources for Scaling

Along with a supportive ecosystem, tapping into the necessary resources to scale innovation is
essential. As Accelerator Labs lead this process, it is imperative to create access to these
resources either in-house or through collaborations with the government and other players in the
ecosystem. Here, access is key. Identifying, synthesizing, and streamlining the relevant resources
would facilitate and enhance access. Accelerator Labs can also leverage the available resources
in the UN system to bridge the gap.

50

5.4.1 Capacity-Building Measures

Resources for capacity building for social innovators and entrepreneurs is necessary to enable
scaling. Limitations in skills (particularly technical and management), leadership abilities, and
socio-cultural barriers must be identified on a continual basis, and resources provided to rectify
and overcome these.44 For this, various innovative models of capacity building can be deployed.
While the conventional models directed towards individual capacities are required, Accelerator
Labs can also explore developing collective networks of “social entrepreneurial capital”.45 This
component delves into resources that Accelerator Labs can provide to enable capacity building
for scaling.

Objective: To provide resources to enable capacity building of innovators for scaling innovation

Recommendations:

1

7

Encourage innovators to conduct skill mapping exercises on a regular basis to identify gaps in
human capacity to identify, and manage resources to scale innovation.46 Additionally, keep the
process dynamic to integrate changing needs.

Provide pre- and in-service training on overarching and transferable skills (e.g. networking, financial
management, industry standards, marketing, and team management).

Onboard a formal network of stakeholders/partners to support capacity building measures for social
innovators/entrepreneurs.

Create a portfolio of capacity-building resources through strategic partnerships to enable easy
access to innovators.

Develop a mentorship program. Identify thought leaders in relevant sectors and match them to the
innovators for personal training.

Establish a centralized repository of knowledge resources, including articles, podcasts, and video
training, to enable access for innovators.

On-board capacity building partners such as educational and training institutions to achieve
quality-compliant skill training.

Guiding Questions:

(e.g. subsidized workshops, mentoring, and access to knowledge resources)?

Is the Accelerator Lab collaborating with other stakeholders/partners (e.g. private sector, civil
society, and incubators) to bridge the gaps (e.g. subsidized workshops, mentoring, and access to
knowledge resources)?

Is the Accelerator Lab collaborating specifically with training and educational institutions to provide
subsidized and quality-compliant training capacity-building opportunities for innovators?

Is there an available repository of knowledge resources to provide to the innovators to enable
capacity building for scaling?

Are there mechanisms to incentivize communities to conduct localized training to enable collective
social networks?

Stories:

In Uganda, the innovators were provided training opportunities supported by Social
Innovation Academy, a civil society organization that provides capacity building and
training opportunities to disadvantaged innovators. A collaboration with the organization
enabled the innovators in the Uganda Accelerator Lab to envision greater scale

In South Africa, a conversation with a stakeholder, mLabs, a non-profit organization
supporting entrepreneurship, revealed a scalable mentorship model. For instance, a
CEO can temporarily join the team from a network of empaneled mentors to bridge gaps
and simultaneously train the team.

5.4.2. Access to Financial Resources

Several times during the research with Accelerator Labs was the issue raised of access to
financial resources. While this might be expected as a more or less routine requirement for
innovative activity, this is a crucial component that falls across various stages of innovation,
starting from resources for early testing to financial resources for scaling and ultimately
sustainability of successful interventions. Access to funding is thus a key challenge and a barrier
to experiment and scale. Successful social innovation and entrepreneurship reveals that creating
financial sustainability through innovative business or funding models are necessary conditions
in the process of scaling.47

9

Provide a standardized, yet customizable financial model to support the innovators in developing
their financial requirements to scale, as a part of the early training.

Provide access to mentorship to encourage innovators to identify unique business models to enable
financial sustainability.

Provide workshops in collaboration with experts to train innovators in pitching innovations to
potential investors, or funds, or grants, to enable access to financial resources.

Onboard a formal network of stakeholders/partners to support funding requirements of innovators,
including early funding opportunities to pitches for larger investments.

Leverage government resources to support funding requirements of innovators, including early
funding opportunities to partnership opportunities for long term collaboration.

Create a portfolio of funding resources through strategic partnerships to enable easy access to
innovators.

Tag innovations under clusters or sectors. Tag funding opportunities under clusters or sectors.
Match the needs with opportunities.

Explore long-term and flexible funding opportunities such as collaborative finance. This includes
options of crowdsourcing funding for social innovation.

Guiding Questions:

1

Is there a fixed financial mapping model that can be used/adapted by innovators to understand their
financial needs to achieve the expected scale?

2

What are the financial requirements to scale a given social innovation?

3

4

5

Are there available workshops and resources that can enable innovators to think about innovative
and unique business models for financial sustainability?

Is the Accelerator Lab collaborating with the government, both local and national, to leverage
funding opportunities for innovators?

Is the Accelerator Lab collaborating with other stakeholders/partners (eg: private sector, civil society,
and incubators) to leverage funding opportunities for innovators?

53

6

7

8

Has the Accelerator Lab explored different models of financing for the innovations to scale (eg: debt,
equity, quasi-equity, convertible debt, hybrid)?

Is there an available repository of funding resources, including early grants, loan options,
partnerships, that innovators can have access to?

Does the Accelerator Lab have a portfolio of funding opportunities to facilitate scaling? Can the
innovation be clustered into a portfolio of innovations to match them to the categorized funding
opportunities?

Stories:

The Tanzania Accelerator Lab identifies that financial requirements are important to
scale innovation. Some measures that can help this include:
a) Setting up a platform to connect investors and innovators,
b) Analyzing if the requirements align with the SDGs,
c) Conducting a product-market analysis before investing resources to scale,
d) Mapping the innovations for easier connection with investors,
e) Analyzing if an innovation can be adopted into the UN portfolio.

The Zimbabwe Accelerator Lab suggested micro-financing options from the network,
including from stakeholders and partners to help small scale social innovators who have
limited access to funding opportunities.

5.4.3. Knowledge Repositories and Leveraging Data

Access to knowledge resources, reliable data analysis and its use in decision making, can inform
the scaling and support the direction of scale. Creating a knowledge repository and management
platform to collate, synthesize, and classify relevant reports, articles, videos, and podcasts for the
easy access of innovators can be useful in bringing knowledge gaps. This aspect is different from
the knowledge sharing in the Accelerator Labs Network and pertains mainly to external sources
of information. Providing access to trends to innovators through analysis of big data in
collaboration with strategic partners will ensure the innovators have access to macro trends that
can inform and improve decision making. These data sources are expensive and require training
to be able to synthesize but are fast transforming both the data universe and public policy
frameworks. Therefore, easy access through a dynamic and expanding knowledge repository
would benefit innovators.

54

Objective: To provide easy access to knowledge resources to innovators

Recommendations:

1

2

3

4

Collaborate with strategic partners, including academia, think tanks, and private sector, to develop
and catalogue knowledge resources.

Collate and catalogue resources relevant to scaling, including articles, videos, podcasts, reports,
and practical tools and worksheets.

Engage with strategic partners (e.g. mobile phone companies and social media actors) to identify
and leverage big data and macro-trends to develop ideas on issues to enable informed decision
making in the ecosystem.

Provide early training on use of the resources to innovators in the ecosystem to help them navigate
through the knowledge resources.

Guiding Questions:

1

2

3

Does the Accelerator Lab have any in-house knowledge resources to provide to innovators who join
the ecosystem?

Is the Accelerator Lab working with members in the supportive ecosystem to collate and catalogue
necessary knowledge resources that will be useful to scale social innovation?

Are the knowledge resources collated and catalogued for the easy access of innovators in the
network?

4 Are the knowledge resources in a form that can be easily shared with the innovators in the network?

5

Is the Accelerator Lab leveraging big data to capture trends and inform decision making to enable
scaling?

Stories:

The Serbia Accelerator Lab is looking at possible ways of acquiring and exploring new
data around migration. One of the new alternative data sources the Accelerator Lab is
using is data from LinkedIn. This data can provide more synthesized understanding as
to what job markets are hiring Serbians and contributing to the trend of outmigration.

5.4.4. Legal Aspects

Securing legal aspects to protect the innovation and the rights of social innovators is important to
incentivize and successfully scale social innovation. Innovation in local communities is rich and
an intangible asset. Therefore, securing them through legal aspects and policy frameworks would

55

propel the innovations to become assets that are sustainable and scalable.48 This Legal Aspects
component complements the Policy component in the Supportive Ecosystem section of the toolkit,
adding more practical details on preserving the rights of the innovators.

Objective: To secure the legal aspects and rights of innovators for scaling of innovation.

Recommendations:

1

Collaborate with strategic stakeholders/partners to identify the required legal aspects pertaining to
the innovation.

2 Conduct a workshop to help the innovators identify the legal aspects relevant to their innovation.

3 Develop an ownership model to incentivize innovators, while achieving ease of scale.

4

5

Collaborate with the government to develop institutional frameworks and policies to seamlessly
secure relevant legal aspects.

Identify the relevant legal aspects that have to be secured before a handover to a
stakeholder/partner.

Guiding Questions:

1

2

3

Has the Accelerator Lab identified legal requirements (e.g. registration of the enterprise, procuring
a certificate for operations) for scaling the innovation?

Does the Accelerators Lab have access to partners (e.g. legal experts, firms) to help innovators
identify and secure legal?

What are the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) applicable to the solution (e.g. patents, copyrights,
trademark, and Geographic Indicators (GI))?

4

Is the IPR of innovation secured?

5

Who owns the IPR of the innovation? Are there innovative ownership models to enable scaling of
innovation, while incentivizing innovators to share their innovations?

7 What are the legal aspects that should be secured for a handover to stakeholders/partners?

Stories:

On securing the legal aspects during a partnership, the Ecuador Accelerator Lab
suggested that signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) or an Agreement with
the partner/stakeholder as a good practice. This would help in clearly defining the
expectations, obligations, and rights of each partner in scaling social innovations.

48 IAEA, ITU, UNESCO, UNOOSA, and WIPO 2012.

5.5. Learning from Scaling

This section specifies how Accelerator Labs, and the communities the Labs are working with, can
learn from the scaling effort individually and collectively. Whenever a new portfolio of solutions is
scaled, Accelerator Labs should be able to draw from the lessons of the last scaling phase. The
key elements to achieve this are:

● Resilience building to enable a culture of risk-taking and innovation (learning from failure).
● Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), as it helps understand what worked and what did not.
● Collective intelligence, as it expands Accelerator Labs learnings beyond the national context

and helps cross-fertilization across Labs.

● Scaling evidence, as it makes learning concrete, documented and potentially sharable.

5.5.1. Resilience Building and Learning from Failure

Failure is a part of the process of learning. Risk-taking and building resilience to failure is important
in enabling a culture of innovation.49 Particularly, in the process of social innovation, resilience
building becomes more important as the process of scaling is complex and requires the support
of many ecosystem players, increasing the aspect of risk. Accelerator Labs can encounter
challenging circumstances where an identified portfolio of solutions, despite early scaling
evidence, a supportive ecosystem, and sufficient resources, cannot be scaled out, up, or deep.
Therefore, to sustain a culture of innovation, while optimizing the use of resources, requires
practices that are lean, agile, and resilient to failure.

Objective: To learn from failure and build resilience into the culture of innovation

Recommendations:

1

2

3

Embrace failures as learning opportunities and as a natural part of the innovation process, while
taking necessary actions to increase probabilities of success.

Document the scaling journey across portfolios to identify reasons for why something went in an
unexpected direction during the scaling.

Create a culture of resilience through professional quality, confidence supported by activities such
as workshops and mentor conversations.

49 Farson and Keyes 2002.

57

Guiding Questions:

1

Does the Accelerator Lab have a process to document learning from the scaling of social
innovations?

2 Does the Accelerator Lab have an implementation map to identify the reasons/areas for failure?

3

4

Is the Accelerator Lab identifying, categorizing, and documenting reasons for failure/iteration (e.g.
negative impact on a vulnerable community, large infrastructural requirements, limited impact, lack
of a sustainable business model etc.)?

Does the Accelerator Lab have a process to identify if the reason for failure can be fixed rapidly
through iteration/stakeholder or partner support?

5

Is the Accelerator Lab engaging in activities to foster a culture of learning and resilience?

Stories:

As resilience to failure helps innovators navigate uncertainties of scaling social
innovation, Raizcorp, a business incubator that engages with the South Africa
Accelerator Lab, deploys a robust selection process, where “psychological assessment”
tools and comprehensive evaluation methods are used to identify an innovator’s ability
to be resilient to failure.

5.5.2. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)

M&E plays a crucial role in the process of learning from scaling. Through monitoring, Accelerator
Labs can gather data and keep track of scaling. With regular evaluation on scaling, Accelerator
Labs are able to ensure solutions are scaled to reach their goal. Mechanisms of collecting and
documenting formal and informal evidence for monitoring and evaluation is crucial. Periodic
snapshots of scaling progress and discussion of evaluation results can keep Accelerator Labs
and stakeholders focused and engaged while facilitating corrections to the scaling process.50 M&E
tools help Accelerator Labs examine the innovation fidelity while accounting for adaptation in
various contexts within the local, national, regional, or global level. In addition, with proper
documentation and knowledge sharing, M&E results of each Accelerator Lab is able to provide
the whole Accelerator Labs Network and even the development field with successful experiences
and lessons learned.

50 Institute for Reproductive Health, Georgetown University. 2013.

58

Objective: To ensure the scaling is on the right way towards SDGs and addressing the needs of people

1

2

3

Plan for M&E of the portfolio at an early stage of the cycle. Integrate key resource requirements,
including human and financial resources and key stakeholder engagements, into the scaling plan.

Conduct monitoring and evaluation through both qualitative and quantitative analysis using existing
frameworks (e.g. Nesta’s Open Book of Social Innovation, which lists over twenty M&E methods).51

Develop effective support and implementation mechanisms to ensure the long-term success of
scaling any innovation. (e.g. engaging senior government bodies to support and instruct line
ministries, developing a diversified coalition of stakeholders with an aligned vision, and a clear value
proposition to ensure collective success).

Guiding Questions:

1 What are the indicators that the Accelerator Lab is using to measure the scaling?

● To what extent does the scaling contribute to address the need identified in the context of the SDGs?
● To what extent are the scaling goals achieved?
● Scaling out: How many individuals are benefited by the new solutions? What is the proportion of people

using the innovations and what is the feedback?

● Scaling deep: To what extent is it changing cultural norms?
● Scaling up: To what extent are policies and laws changed or impacted?
● To what extent have partners and stakeholders adopted the Accelerator Lab’s processes or service lines?
● To what extent has the UNDP Country Office adopted the Accelerator Lab’s processes or service lines?

2 What is the source of data for each indicator (e.g. a survey, a review, or administrative data)?

3 With what frequency will data be collected? What is the timeline for M&E?

4 Who is responsible for collecting the data, analysis and reporting?

5 What resources are needed to produce the data?

7

What are the risks and assumptions in carrying out the planned M&E activities? How will these risks
and assumptions affect the timing and quality of the data and of the indicators?

Stories:

With the authority to lead and accelerate government changes when needed, the Office
of Prime Minister in Uganda is the “custodian” of the SDGs and will monitor the line
ministries in their implementation. Having a senior government agency to ensure
implementation is key for long term sustainability.

51 Murray and others 2010. https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/the_open_book_of_social_innovation.pdf pages 101-105

59

5.5.3. Scaling Evidence

Many social innovators like BRAC or Teach First use formal and informal sources of evidence to
draw out and define their scaling models, which also helps to learn about the effectiveness of their
scaling model. Evidence can help make a case for the Lab’s scaling approach, for instance, as
part of stakeholder communication. Further, data-driven decision-making, a culture of sharing,
openness to learning, and the ability to look at context-specific as well as unusual indicators are
key success factors contributing to successful scaling. This component goes beyond M&E and
encourages the usage of formal and informal evidence as a base for scaling. The evidence
gathered is also important for the following component on building collective intelligence around
good practices among Accelerator Labs.

Objective: To facilitate evidence-based scaling

Recommendations:

1 Use formal evidence for the development of the scaling model and communication about it.

2 Use informal evidence as a complement or supplement.52

Guiding questions53:

1 Level 1: Can the Accelerator Lab describe what the vision for scaling is and why it matters?

2

Level 2: Can the Accelerator Lab capture data that shows positive change and can it be confirmed
that the Accelerator Lab contributed to this change?

3 Level 3: Can the Accelerator Lab demonstrate causality using a control and comparison group?

4

5

Level 4: Can the Accelerator Lab contribute to/facilitate/conduct evaluations that confirm the above
conclusions?

Level 5: Can the Accelerator Lab have manuals, systems, and procedures in place to ensure
consistent replication and positive impact?

5.5.4. Collective Intelligence of the Labs Network

This component contains different means to foster collective intelligence. As per Nesta, collective
intelligence “is created when people work together, often with the help of technology, to mobilise
a wider range of information, ideas and insights to address a social challenge” and “is a multiplier
that brings new insights and ideas.”54

52 It is important to note that formal evidence is not always fundamental to scaling social innovation. Stories and word-of-mouth recommendations can also be key. Stories can
be transmitted through different stakeholders and can be shared in-person or virtually
53 Adapted from Nesta’s five levels of the Standards of Evidence: https://media.nesta.org.uk/documents/making_it_big-web.pdf
54 Peach and others 2019.

60

When conducting the survey with Accelerator Labs, most Labs indicated that for scaling,
knowledge sharing with the other Labs is key and support will be needed to facilitate proper
knowledge sharing. This component provides insights on how to build collective intelligence
around scaling within the Accelerator Labs Network. The component builds on the Nesta
collective intelligence design playbook and brings the key insights into Accelerator Labs’ context.
The appendix of this report includes a more detailed table with collective intelligence tools.

Objective: To leverage the intelligence created through Accelerator Labs Network and transform it into
collective learning

Recommendations:

1 Conduct a workshop with Accelerator Labs on collective intelligence.

2

Create spaces for exchange across Accelerator Labs, organized by the different service lines or
SDGs.

3 Mobilise data, knowledge and lessons learned from the Labs and share these continuously.

4

5

Encourage data collaboration practices with other Accelerator Labs (see Resources section for
more recommendations on Knowledge Repositories).

Take into consideration incentives for different stakeholders to be involved in building collective
intelligence.

6 Take into consideration data ethics55.

7

Reach out to Accelerator Labs in the network with similar challenges or contexts directly to gain
more in-depth knowledge beyond documented information.

Guiding questions:

1

2

3

Has the Accelerator Lab considered if other Accelerator Labs have done work on the same issues
that the Accelerator Lab is addressing?

How is the Accelerator Lab planning on making data/information produced available to other
Accelerator Labs?

Has the Accelerator Lab taken into consideration all relevant aspects of data ethics that apply to the
Accelerator Labs’ scaling process?

55 The data ethics worksheet from Nesta that is available here may help Accelerator Lab think about data ethics aspects of Accelerator Labs work.

61

Stories:

Many Accelerator Labs mentioned in the phone interviews that a targeted space for the
Accelerator Labs’ team members to exchange information with their colleagues is
needed to better gather and understand experiences and lessons learnt. Accelerator
Labs mentioned that this could come in the form of a simple, yet specialized, WhatsApp
group or a regular sub-group call session.

6. How to use this Report

This section includes some suggestions on how Labs and their network can practically use the
report. It is intended to propose next steps for Labs to help guide them through the actual
implementation of recommendations. The table below is not exhaustive, and Labs are
encouraged to find context-specific ways of applying the report material. This table outlines some
ways this report can be utilized by Accelerator Labs.

Accelerator Labs can use this report for:

1 Defining information needs around scaling social innovation and specifically looking up toolkit

components relevant to addressing those needs.

2 Building on the experimentation with innovative solutions and developing a country-specific scaling
strategy for a scalable portfolio of solutions drawing from the scaling framework and toolkit. This
could be facilitated through internal workshops or bootcamps.

3

Identifying relevant guiding questions and worksheets, and filling in answers as a team, potentially
involving stakeholders where applicable. A workshop could be conducted to clarify this practically.

4 Driving discussions around scaling with other Labs.

5 Conducting in-country stakeholder meetings, using relevant parts of the report as a tool to guide

discussions from envisioning scale to enhancing ownership.

62

7. Conclusion

This hands-on report for the UNDP Accelerator Labs provides key insights, gleaned from
Accelerator Labs themselves and secondary research, to enable context-specific scaling of social
innovation to achieve the SDGs. Social innovation is the process of creating and implementing
effective solutions to systemic and complex social issues through renewed or novel perspectives
and innovative approaches. The process of scaling a social innovation is layered, complex, and
nonlinear and, therefore, this report advocates for a portfolio approach. The report also identifies
that scaling of social innovation is considered achieved when the impact of its scale matches the
level of social need.

To operationalize this concept, the report started with a conceptual scaling framework. The
framework helps answer the question of WHAT could be scaled and HOW scaling could look. The
WHAT could come in the form of a process, product, or service line. The HOW could come in the
form of Scaling out, up, or deep. Next, Accelerator Labs will need to harness ideas about how to
practically implement the scaling in collaboration with their ecosystem and drawing from different
resources. Thus, the toolkit was created to help Accelerator Labs think through this process in
detail. The toolkit starts with helping Accelerator Labs build a vision for scale, then it helps with
understanding how to leverage different stakeholders within the in-country innovation ecosystem.
Additionally, it provides a hands-on understanding of how to make use of the necessary resources
for scaling. Finally, learning from scale will be key, particularly in the context of Accelerator Labs’
iterative cycle. Thus, the final section of the toolkit helps Accelerator Labs think through building
collective intelligence and learning from failure.

Along with the insights included throughout the report, the research helped the SIPA Team identify
that many of the Accelerator Labs made significant progress in planning and executing their
respective work cycles. Given that Accelerator Labs were recently established, the growth is
commendable and can be attributed to Accelerator Labs teams’ drive and passion to contribute
to development in the country context. Their work strives to maintain the delicate balance between
the intentions and priorities of the community as well as the experience of development and

63

innovation experts. This is remarkable, given that both inclusion and leveraging from existing
knowledge are key for successful scaling.

The report’s structured approach to help bring Accelerator Labs to the next level in their cycle,
was built on a comprehensive methodology. The methodology included an online survey, virtual
phone interviews, and focus groups, complemented by secondary research. Key to this
methodology was a collaborative and inclusive approach with the aim to involve as many
Accelerator Labs as possible. Overall, the SIPA Team was able to actively interact with over 76
percent of them. The contributions from Accelerator Labs staff have been invaluable in creating
this report. The SIPA Team also learned from Accelerator Labs that simply generating
conversations on scaling through the different parts of the methodology has already been
impactful. Additionally, UNDP staff told the SIPA Team that they appreciated the opportunity to
exchange ideas on scaling with other Accelerator Labs and their stakeholders in the process of
participating in this research project and expressed that this alone had already exhibited important
progress for them. Despite shifting the entire research methodology online, the SIPA Team made
an effort to deploy methods that ensured that the quality of information gathered was unbiased,
while preserving the richness of stories in the process. The data collected and assumptions made
were triangulated and cross-questioned by team members, and strengthened through multiple
tools of engagement, including the survey, interviews and focus groups.

Through the process of research and primary data collection for the report, the SIPA Team
determined that Accelerator Labs generally integrate adaptiveness into their approach and
working. This was reflected in Accelerator Labs’ flexibility in accommodating requests to engage
virtually and enabling the SIPA team to gather rich insights from the conversations. Further, in
tandem with the spirit of innovation and enterprise, Accelerator Labs displayed great openness
and responsiveness to the suggestions and ideas that were shared in the process of engagement
and discovery for the report. During the interviews and focus groups, staff were candid and
forthcoming in sharing their experiences, which added significant value to the findings in the
research. It seems clear that Accelerator Labs operate at the cross-section of the rapidly
advancing world of innovation and the “wobbling” history of development. The SIPA Team hopes
that the findings of this report will further stimulate thinking and doing around scaling social
innovation for development. The SIPA Team believes that the recommendations and guiding
questions will be helpful in enabling the ecosystem to spur portfolios of solutions that reach their
full potential and grow. Successfully being able to scale social innovation has the potential to
make the Accelerator Labs a cornerstone in the UN’s overall effort to stimulate action for people,
planet, and prosperity.56

Tools for Collective Intelligence57

Tool

Implementation

Crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches that source data, information, opinions or
ideas from large crowds of people, often by issuing open calls for contribution. It can help bring new ideas
or ideas from large crowds of people, often by issuing to light that hadn’t previously been considered, or
to gather expertise from people who have specialized knowledge or understanding of an issue.

Crowd mapping

Crowd mapping is a type of crowdsourcing which media, text messages or geographic data, to provide
gathers data from different sources, including social real-time, interactive information about issues on the
ground. Crowd mapping can create detailed almost real-time data in a way that a top-down, centrally
curated, map may struggle to replicate.

Open data
repositories

A data repository would help the Labs and the HQ maintain an overview of the information that is
continuously produced on various channels such as the Medium blog and social media. This repository
should compile the different information channels and provide search options. Further an additional
dashboard such as available in Tableau could display the key new information or disaggregate data by
regions and SDGs.

Micro Survey

Micro Surveys are a short, abbreviated form of a few minutes to complete. Benefits include a much faster
turnaround, delivered by mobile phone, text message or a digital and higher frequency of results,
compared to traditional surveys. Micro Surveys can be conducted through Google forms which provides
the answers in the form of an excel sheet. Survey data can be assessed through a codebook, similar to
the one used for this research, as shown in the appendix.

Wiki Survey

Wiki Surveys are a type of survey where participants can add statements that others respond to.
Participants’ statements are added to a pool and are then randomly presented back for individual
participants to respond to or rank. Over time, participants generate new ideas and build a picture of where
consensus or disagreement lies.

Wiki

An Accelerator Labs wiki would provide a collaborative web page with restricted access for the Labs’
network. The wiki can be structured to enable multiple Labs to collaborate, share knowledge and keep
one another updated about key lessons learnt around scaling social innovation.

Wiki data
warehouse

A wiki data warehouse is a central database which is optimized to analyze information coming from a
range of different sources, in this case the different Labs. The advantage is that incoming data is cleaned,
organized and structured in advance. It can be used for querying and decision-making.

57 This is building on the Nesta Collective Intelligence Design Playbook, available here.

Phone Interview Guide

Rationale Around Phone Interviews
In order to build on the work initiated through the desk research and the survey, as well as allow
for the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the Accelerator Labs’ work, we are planning
to conduct phone interviews. These interviews will be done in order to both prepare us for the
upcoming field travels as well as a means to offer the labs an opportunity to further contribute
their views on scaling. This interview guide will provide a foundational structure for these phone
interviews. It will introduce the team to the necessary tools and requirements for conducting the
phone interview. These interviews will have two main objectives: (1) To understand the
experience of the Accelerator Labs team during the first 100-day period and their initial thoughts
on scaling; (2) Follow up on the answers to the survey.
To ensure that we are gaining a representative perspective, the Accelerator Labs for the phone
interviews have been selected using these criteria:

● Regional diversity
● Have reached the later phases of the 100-days cycle
● SDGs addressed
● Relation to the three streams of the SIPA teams’ scalability framework

Additionally, this interview guide explicitly contains sections on consent and information
management. These sections explain the purpose of the interview, how the information will be
used and ask the interviewee for their consent.

Interview-Format
The interview format is semi-structured to leave enough space for explanations and unexpected
answers while also providing us with the necessary inputs to fill the gaps in our information
needs. The questions are there to guide the interview, but it is up to the lead interviewer to
determine the flow of the interview. The assigned time for each section should be seen as
guiding regarding how much time of the interview each section should take.

Potential Issues and How to Address These
Potential issues around the interviews were identified at an early stage of our project. They do,
however, appear to remain relevant as we are approaching the phone interviews. These issues
are (a) language barriers, and (b) bridging the high-level objective of a macro-strategy with the
micro-context of local innovations. We will address these by (a) making use of the team’s
diverse language skills when needed, and by (b) conducting in-depth research on bridging to
scale based on relevant course readings and beyond. Also, when possible, avoid using jargon
and referring to concepts that may be interpreted differently by the various Accelerator Labs.
This is to ensure that everyone has the same understanding of the questions being asked and
to avoid bias in answers provided.

Introduction (Time Allocation: 3 minutes)

Hi, INSERT NAME OF INTERVIEWEE and thank you for taking the time for this call today. It
is our pleasure to be speaking to you today.

As you already know, my name is INSERT NAME OF LEAD INTERVIEWER and my colleague
is INSERT NAME OF NOTETAKER. We are student researchers from Columbia University's
School of International and Public Affairs in New York who are working on a Workshop project
with the UNDP Accelerator Labs Team.

78

The purpose of our research is to assist the Accelerator Labs Team in developing a scaling
strategy for your work. We’re hoping to gain further insight on the structure of the Accelerator
Labs in general as well as specifically in INSERT NAME OF COUNTRY.

The information you share with us today will be used only for this research. Your answers may
be included in our final report, but your name will not be included in any reports unless you give
us express permission to do so. Our final report will be distributed to UNDP Accelerator Labs
and Columbia University. Before we start our interview, we’d like to confirm that you agree to
speak with us today. [Pause for agreement from interviewee].

We’d also like to take notes as we go along. If you would not like us to take notes during our
conversation this is completely acceptable. The key insights from this interview will be shared
with you afterwards and we will ask you to confirm that they accurately reflect our conversation.
Would it be acceptable to you that we take notes during this interview? [Pause for Response;
If yes, inform about who will be the notetaker and who will be the lead interviewer].

Additionally, we’d like to record this conversation, this will solely be for our own internal use. If
you would not like us to record our conversation this is completely acceptable. Would it be
acceptable to you that we record this interview? [Pause for Response; If yes, begin recording].

Let us know if you at any point during this conversation would like to take a break and/or stop
the interview. As we are aware that your time is valuable, we do not expect this interview taking
any more than one hour of your time today.

Before we begin, do you have any questions about the interview process, the research, or
anything else? [Pause for questions].

Once again thank you for speaking with us today and let's get started.

Part 1: Opening Questions (5 minutes)

● To start with, we would be really curious to know more about you. In a couple of
sentences could you tell us about your background/experience in innovation and
specifically work with the UN or governments.

● Transition: Thanks a lot for sharing this with us! You have done some really interesting

things and the Accelerator Labs are lucky to have you.
With your experience in mind, we would like to ask you some questions about your time
working with the Accelerator Lab and particularly around scaling innovation.

Part 2: Accelerator Labs and Scaling (25 minutes)

● Can you explain WHAT you are envisioning to scale in your country?
● How do you think the Accelerator Labs can best help scale innovation?

79

Follow-up:

○ Considering the challenges during the first 100-day period you mentioned in your

response to the survey, do you think that you will change your approach going forward?
[LOOK AT ANSWERS IN SURVEY QUESTION 4 & 5]

How do you vet the solutions you are mapping to assess potential for large scale impact?

Follow-up:

● Can you give an example of one or two that you think meets the standard?
● What would be the path that you see moving forward for these? What role does the
Accelerator Lab have, what role does the Country Office have, what role would you
see for partners in this development?

● A lot of Lab mentioned in the survey that knowledge sharing is key for scaling: how do
you envision building a network for knowledge sharing with other Accelerator Labs
and in your country/region? What additional tools do you envision as helpful for
knowledge sharing across borders?

●

In your answer to the survey you indicated that you are engaged in [INSERT
SCALING DEEP, IN, UP BASED ON THE LAB’S ANSWERS TO SURVEY
QUESTIONS 15, 16 & 17], how familiar are you with these concepts and could you
give some examples of how you believe that you will engage in this/these types of
scaling?

● To whom will the Accelerator Lab handover the insights, products and intelligence of

the Lab after this current cycle?

Follow-up:

● How are you envisioning this handover? Do you plan to provide any additional support

after handover? When is the accelerator lab completely not involved anymore?
● How will you transition during the handover to partners? What tools are you using to

undertake handover after the exploration phase?

● How do you see the role/receptivity of the country office in taking over some of your

insights, products, intelligence as part of the scaling?

Transition: These are some very interesting answers that you have provided so far. To better
understand the work of your Accelerator Lab we would like to know a bit more about the
environment in which you work.

80

Part 3: The Innovation Environment and Supportive Ecosystem (25 minutes)

You mentioned that actors such as [MAKE REFERENCE TO ANSWERS IN SURVEY TO
QUESTION 6] have been most helpful to you in identifying and carrying out experiments
during the past 100-day period? Why do you believe they were so successful at supporting
you?

Follow-up:

● What has been the feedback you have received from the stakeholders and partners that

you have been working with over the first 100-day period?

● Do you have any recommendations for best practices/tools in building

●

partnerships/engaging different stakeholders?
In your survey response you indicated that [LOOK AT SURVEY QUESTION 23 & 24]
was a specific partner in government (a ministry, municipality etc.) that has been more
helpful?

Follow-up: Do you envision this actor to continue being helpful as you try to scale your work?

What kind of new unusual partners (beyond government) have you engaged with during your
work? [LOOK AT ANSWER TO QUESTION 8 OF SURVEY BEFORE ASKING]

Follow-up:

● What has been the purpose of the collaboration with this partner?
● Do you envision that this partner will have a role in the scaling? If so, in what way?
● To what extent is the interaction of the Accelerator Labs with UNDP and the Country

Office already innovative?

Follow-up:

● Do you have any innovative/ unusual ideas to enhance the collaboration?
● How is the work of UNDP in your country aligned with other UN agencies? How could

this be improved?

What additional tools/resources/methodology would you need for the scaling phase to be
successful?

Follow-up: Have you identified any other useful “early stage” practices that we should keep in
mind that can help foster an innovation environment?

As the labs are only able to find so many solutions within the current 100-day phase, how will
you ensure in the future there is constant innovation found, tested and scaled to address the
SDG?

81

Transition: Thanks a lot for your thoughtful answers. Now, I just have some closing questions.

Part 4: Future of your Accelerator Lab and Closing (5 minutes)

● Where do you see your Accelerator Lab in five years?
● Do you have any suggestions or recommendations for our team as we continue with

our research?

Follow-up: Is there anybody that you think we should talk to that would help us in our research?

Conclusion (2 minutes)
Thanks a lot for taking the time to speak with us today, INSERT NAME OF INTERVIEWEE.
Your answers have been very helpful. It is our hope that this interview will help the UNDP
Accelerator Labs succeed not only in INSERT NAME OF COUNTRY but all over the world.
Within one week we will share our key insights from this interview with you.

[If the interviewee agreed to share contacts/resources with the team, make sure to provide a
gentle reminder that we will expect this information.]

Before we finish, would you be open to us reaching out to you if we have additional questions
regarding the answers you have provided during the interview, or if we have any general
questions we may have in the future that relates to our conversation today? Our final product
will be presented to you at the end of April or at the beginning of May. Additionally, in the spirit
of working out loud, we will keep posting blog posts about our work on the Accelerator Labs’
Medium page. Finally, we want you to know that you can always feel free to contact our team
regarding anything. Once again thank you for your time today and good luck on your upcoming
work.

Focus Group Guide

Rationale Around Focus Groups:

In order to build on the work initiated through the desk research and the survey, as well as allow
for the opportunity to test assumptions and recommendations, we are planning to conduct focus
groups. These focus groups will be done in order to both finalize our work on the toolkit and
framework as well as a means to offer the labs an opportunity to further contribute their views.
This guide will provide a foundational structure for these focus groups. It will introduce the team
to the necessary tools and requirements for conducting the focus groups. These will have two
main objectives: (1) To understand the feedback of the Lab regarding the suggested framework
and toolkit; (2) Incorporate additional suggestions from Labs. To ensure that we are gaining a
representative perspective, the Accelerator Labs for the focus groups have been selected using
these criteria:

- Regional diversity
- Have reached the later phases of the 100-days cycle
- SDGs addressed
- Relation to the three streams of the SIPA teams’ scalability framework

Additionally, this guide explicitly contains sections on consent and information management.
These sections explain the purpose of the interview, how the information will be used and ask
the participant for their consent.

Focus Group Structure:
The Labs that are invited to participate of the meeting are the 14 labs that already had calls with
SIPA so far: DRC, Chad, Tanzania, Ecuador, Kenya, Mexico, Palestine, Paraguay, Philippines, The
Gambia, Ukraine, India, Viet Nam, Zimbabwe, and six additional countries to increase regional
coverage and cluster diversity: Colombia, Fiji, Malaysia, Iraq, Lebanon and Togo.

● Focus Group 1: Process
● Focus Group 2: Product
● Focus Group 3: Program/Policy

Potential Issues and How to Address These:
Potential issues around the focus groups were identified at an early stage of our project. They do,
however, appear to remain relevant as we are approaching the phone interviews. These issues are
(a) language barriers, and (b) bridging the high-level objective of a macro-strategy with the micro-
context of local innovations. We will address these by (a) making use of the team’s diverse language
skills when needed, and by (b) conducting in-depth research on bridging to scale based on relevant
course readings and beyond. Also, when possible, avoid using jargon and referring to concepts that
may be interpreted differently by the various Accelerator Labs. This is to ensure that everyone has
the same understanding of the questions being asked and to avoid bias in answers provided.
