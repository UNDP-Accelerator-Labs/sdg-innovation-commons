## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The activity aims to introduce various data sources that will provide accurate and reliable information on air quality in Almaty. These data sources are local sensors providing real-time data and analysis of historical data including specific data from power plants, satellite data, and traffic data. Special software has been developed to convert traffic-related data into CO2 emissions. All data will be visualized at the Airvision.kz platforn.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If data is complete and accurate, then the city municipality can use the platform as a decision-making tool

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

All results will be submitted to the Green Economy Department of the Almaty City Administration for review and validation. The city administration can take various measures and implement green projects to reduce air pollution in the city and monitor the impact with the help of the platform. Such initiatives may include the use of renewable energy for household heating, rezoning the city to reduce traffic, etc.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

n/a

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

There are over 200 local air quality sensors installed in the city. The Airvision platform has access to all sensors and receives real-time data in the form of AQI, PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO levels. CO2 data, extracted from traffic data using special software, provides information on the contribution of traffic to total air pollution. Atmospheric satellite data are received via the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service and included in the modeling.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
