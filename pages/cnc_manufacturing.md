> Brief description of the innovation

The aim of this innovation is to manufacture mining components, electrical components, construction and agricultural equipment. All these equipment and components should be manufactured right here in Zambia rather than been imported from south Africa.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This state of art machineries will be able to machine shaft, conveyors and many components for the mining industry by cutting cost of importation. The cnc machines will be able to manufacture pumps for all the mining companies in Zambia, to enabling better services for there operations. Mining companies cannot operate without pumps and we will generate more income by providing the solution of manufacturing pumps for them.

> Technical Feasibility

The proposed implementation is to purchase the cnc machines for the machine shop to start manufacturing pumps and other components. Currently many mining companies in Zambia are buying pumps from south Africa. I do designing of pumps, for a south African company.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The cnc machines are capable of reducing unemployment amongst the youth and graduates. This will help expose the Zambian youths to the 4th industrial revolution and being able to compete with the developed countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom.
