In a small community named Bunban village in Makeni, Northern Sierra Leone, Francis John Sesay, an agricultural engineering graduate from Njala University, witnessed the struggles his mom faced in selling her harvests as cassava farmers. Determined to find a solution, Sesay co-founded Sierra Leone Cassavity Limited, a company embarking to convert cassava into various useful products like flour for breads. Cassavity’s flour is very unique and it’s 100 percent organic, cultivated locally without the use of fertilizers, and produced without any harmful chemicals.
