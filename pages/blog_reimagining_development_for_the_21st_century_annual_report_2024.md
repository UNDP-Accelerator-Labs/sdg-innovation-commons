UNDP Accelerator Labs Annual Report 2024

Introduction

2024 was a milestone year for the Accelerator Labs, UNDP’s
open, globally distributed R&D capability. In 2024, the
Network built on five years of global experimentation with
innovation and development stakeholders to define, codify
and share the how and the what of distributed bottom-up
research and development (R&D) for sustainable
development. UNDP’s largest investment in innovation and
digital transformation to date, the Labs fortify a
contribution to the UN 2.0 Quintet of Change – a renewed
playbook for the United Nations to address 21 century
st
problems with 21 century skillsets.

st

The Network’s big bet in 2024 was to transform the
learning from its five years of cutting-edge experience
in more than 100 countries into assets for the global
community of development changemakers – from UNDP
globally to governments to board members to local
activists. In a six-month process, thousands of experiments,
grassroots innovations and data explorations were distilled
into tools representing the Accelerator Labs approach –
applying radical human-centricity, data-driven solutions and
partnerships for systemic change. The approach was
documented to support others as they navigate the
uncertainty of today’s complex web of polycrises.

First, the Labs worked on codifying more than five years of
work with communities and partners in an effort to
standardize a global R&D offer that can help government
and civil society actors – as well as the broader UN
development system – use R&D principles and practices to
accelerate progress toward the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) (See Chapter 1).

Second, driven by the Labs, UNDP prototyped a new kind of
R&D process, one that learns from the signals of
experimentation with partners across the world to see
patterns that create global development intelligence that
can unlock where sustainable development is stuck. In
2024, the UNDP Accelerator Labs modeled what distributed
R&D looks like through three coalitions: digital financial
inclusion, food systems and circular economies,
producing next-gen future-smart global R&D agendas with
scalable investment opportunities. (See Chapter 2).

Third, the Labs focused on enabling open sharing of the
data, knowledge, solutions, practices and tools available
in a single, central, “SDG Commons” hub of over 12,000
documents that is searchable and powered by AI
capabilities to accelerate collective learning and innovation
diffusion (See Chapter 3).

Over the past five years, with special thanks to founding
investors, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation
and Development of Germany (BMZ), Qatar Fund for
Development (QFFD), and support from Partners at Core
for UNDP, including the Italian Ministry of Environment
and Energy Security and the Japan Cabinet Office as
action partners, the Accelerator Labs have demonstrably
reimagined development for the 21 century. The Labs are
embedded into UNDP, changing its global practice by
empowering collectives to build momentum for change in
more than 100 countries. Fully demand driven, the Labs are
making tangible impact on multiple fronts, from advancing
climate resilience to transforming food systems and
reimagining public services.

Chapter 1: Codifying a mature
global R&D offer

After five years of “building the plane as it flies,” the Labs
undertook a global process in 2024 to capture the richness of
practices that have emerged in hundreds of countries to:

embed the approach within UNDP and other development
organizations,
share UNDP R&D practice with a broader community of
changemakers
and connect with other initiatives to enable collaboration on
complex development issues.

Over the course of six months, this codification process entailed
the documentation of hundreds of field stories and the
organization of over 12,000 documents coming from five years
of practice. In order to create a common language for diverse
methods and approaches, the Labs developed a data standard
whereby Labs from 113 countries shared their tools, methods,
principles, tactics and stories of scale. This structured approach
captured diversity while also setting the foundation for a common
set of practices based on evidence from application over five years
and throughout 100+ countries.

As part of the codification process, with support from the Japan
Cabinet Office, the governments of Cote D’Ivoire, Bhutan and
Guatemala, and with Germany and Qatar as Founding Investors,
the UNDP Accelerator Labs organized intensive in-person sessions
to make sense of five months of data creation and remote
collaboration to define the state of the art.

The “Codification Fests,” were organized in Guatemala (May 2024),
Cote D’Ivoire (June 2024) and Bhutan (July 2024) and focused on
each of the Accelerator Labs’ roles as core drivers of practice:

Solutions Mapping: Identifies grassroots innovations by
engaging directly with communities, connecting local
knowledge to global development efforts.

UNDP Accelerator Labs Annual Report 2024

Exploration: Detects emerging trends using non-traditional
data, foresight and new forms of partnership to catch up to the
speed of change and position development at the cutting
edge.

Experimentation: Taps into exploratory and ethnographic
evidence to design and test prototypes and builds portfolios
for systems transformation.

Together, solutions mapping, exploration and experimentation
drive collective learning, enabling communities and ecosystems to
co-create smarter, more effective solutions to complex
development challenges.

Driving social innovation and development
impact from the bottom up

A key result of this codification process was the creation of a
framework of the Labs’ R&D approach. This approach is intended
to enhance the effectiveness of “middle ground” changemakers -
those working within formal structures who create a bridge
between institutional and grassroots communities to drive social
innovation in sustainable development.

This framework has distilled Accelerator Labs actions into twelve
R&D practices that encapsulate the crucial “job to be done” to
move innovation forward to accelerate sustainable development
impact. Working with collectives - forming, strengthening, and
making them smarter to address complex systemic issues - sits at
the heart of this work. It is done by:

directly engaging with communities to understand their
everyday experiences and culture (e.g. mapping waste picker
journeys in Viet Nam);

empowering them to learn, decide and act together (e.g.
experimenting alongside traditional herbalists in Ecuador);

collecting and analyzing real-time data and feeding insights
back to communities (e.g. collecting environmental data in
Argentina), or harnessing AI for tourism insights in Tanzania);

integrating modern technology with local knowledge and
traditions (e.g. digitizing the traditional “Sanduk” savings
scheme in South Sudan);

UNDP Accelerator Labs Annual Report 2024

7

seeking existing solutions and grassroots innovations to tap
into the ingenuity of those most affected (e.g exploring the
genetic make-up of mushrooms to boost food security in
Argentina);

exploring new options and alternatives together to create
more inclusive futures (e.g. the Dream Labs in North
Macedonia, an engagement mechanism for citizens to
participate in designing the country’s future).

An additional outcome of these Codification Fests has been
articulating the R&D service lines that leverage the Labs’ unique
expertise, tools and relationships, and that empower UNDP and
its partners to co-create new pathways to create impact with
communities from the bottom up. These service lines will be used
to drive learning in how to diversify revenue as part of
sustainability planning.

This unprecedented effort to standardize a global R&D service
offers positions the Accelerator Labs as UNDP’s open R&D
capability to cultivate relationships with key stakeholders on
wicked development challenges.

In Focus: A catalyst for
future-smart UNDP

The Accelerator Labs are redefining the way UNDP works, acting
as the “boots on the ground” of a future-smart organization,
integrating systems thinking, experimentation, digital
transformation, AI and foresight into the heart of UNDP’s
operations. As a cornerstone of the Pact for the Future and UN 2.0
strategy, the Labs leverage all five pillars of the “Quintet of
Change,” with a unique focus on leading in behavioral science to
tackle complex global issues. As part of this integration, capacities
for innovation, experimentation, exploration and solutions
mapping which are delivered by the Accelerator Labs are now
integrated in the UNDP competency framework.

UNDP is equipping the UN and government partners in more than
100 countries with new ways of understanding and engaging with
complex challenges like climate resilience and social cohesion.

Advancing Digital Transformation Across 72
Countries

The Accelerator Labs are powering UNDP’s capacity to drive digital
transformation and develop project portfolios on the ground.
Approximately half of UNDP’s digital advocates come from the
Accelerator Labs, amplifying the capabilities of country offices to
land digital transformation initiatives under the UNDP Digital
Strategy, supporting over 150 digital transformation initiatives
across 72 countries. In the Latin America and Caribbean region,
two-thirds of digital projects are initiated by the Labs,
demonstrating their significant influence even in countries
without a direct Lab presence. 80% of UNDP’s AI Landscape
Assessments and 60% of its Digital Readiness Assessments are
conducted by Accelerator Labs to support governments in
navigating digital tools for SDG advancement. The Labs also play a
pivotal role in foresight, contributing nearly 50% of mapped
signals of change in the UNDP Signal Spotlight 2024 Report.

Portfolio-based approaches for systems
transformation

The Accelerator Labs are at the forefront of UNDP’s shift towards
portfolio-based approaches: 8 out of 10 portfolios are supported
by Accelerator Labs, and where this capability exists in country
offices, portfolios are stronger. UNDP Bosnia and Herzegovina
has become the first UNDP office in the world to sign a portfolio
document with a donor: the Swedish International Development
Cooperation Agency (Sida). The Accelerator Lab provided key
support to the program team throughout the entire process, from
design to implementation, marking a significant achievement for
UNDP in its efforts to overcome project silos.

Embedding and evolving Behavioral Science as
part of UN 2.0
Through its Accelerator Labs Network, UNDP has invested heavily in
behavioral science, with more than 250 full-time personnel, many of
whom use behavioral science when appropriate as part of their
experiments. Complementing the use of “nudges” which help shape
better choices, the Labs are also deploying bottom-up methods like
deep listening, collective intelligence and ethnography. One key
example is solutions mapping, a method the Labs use to
systematically identify grassroots innovations that contribute to
sustainable development. By the end of 2024, the Labs have
uncovered 6,500 grassroots innovations globally, with the potential
to unlock new momentum on sustainable development. In South
Africa, this approach uncovered one million household innovators
through joint research with Utrecht University and University of
Johannesburg. In Kenya, UNDP is using collective intelligence to
map water scarcity and UNDP Jordan leverages ethnography to
explore shifting gender norms.

Chapter 2: From local experiments
to new global value for people and
planet

In 2024, the UNDP Accelerator Labs prototyped a new kind of
research and development (R&D): learning from signals of change
to see patterns that create global development intelligence.
Distributed R&D is not centralized, and so it learns faster by
drawing on patterns of experimentation across Africa, Latin
America, Asia and beyond. This type of bottom-up R&D also drives
learning together by defining cutting edge experimentation
questions from which UNDP and partners can draw new strategies
and new interventions.

Three emerging opportunities to drive SDG
acceleration

These prototypes were playfully termed “R&D Raves,” to highlight
their coalition-convening objectives. They were organized in
Nairobi, Kenya (June 2024), Harare, Zimbabwe (September 2024)
and Manila, the Philippines (October 2024). The R&D Raves focused
on three high potential niches to show new ways to accelerate
job creation, entrepreneurship and sustainability:

The growth of digital finance in the wake of the pandemic with
an unclear impact on poverty;

Combining grassroots knowledge and AI to build sustainable
food systems;

Business and governments working together to create value
from food and plastic waste.

Digital Financial Inclusion. The recent wave of fintech innovation,
accelerated by the pandemic, has obvious potential but the impact
is unclear. This R&D Rave set out to find out how, and in which
conditions, digital finance can put more money in the pockets of
vulnerable women and men in Global Majority countries. Its
coalition includes UNDP’s Sustainable Finance Hub and UN Capital
Development Fund (UNCDF), the Mastercard Foundation and
others.

Food Systems. As part of a broader agenda set out
in UNDP’s 2024 White Paper on Food Systems
Transformation Towards Sustainability and
Resilience, this Rave focused on learning from
experiments to create market niches where
smallholder farmers, particularly women and
young people, can thrive, helped by a mix of
traditional knowledge and modern technologies. Its
coalition includes the UNDP Food and Agriculture
Commodities System team, the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), Qatar Fund for
Development and others.

Circular Economies. Global experimentation on waste
management has pointed to the potential of, and created an
appetite for, more circularity in Global Majority economies. This
Rave focused on closing materials loops and rewiring waste
(especially plastic) as an input of some other production process.
Special attention is paid to informal waste pickers as potential
protagonists of a transition to a more circular economy. Its
coalition includes UNDP’s Chemicals and Waste Hub, its Regional
Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, the Strategic Innovation Unit,
Ikea, Ashoka and others.

Building R&D agendas that can move the needle
on sustainable development

Key outcomes of the three Raves’ R&D agendas are opportunities
for investments in concrete R&D activities such as prototypes,
experiments and participatory exercises. These can be completed
in six months or less, and if successful, would unlock new moves
to advance the Sustainable Development Goals. For example, in
the food systems space, working with chefs to bring local culinary
traditions to restaurants has the potential to connect smallholder
farmers – the only ones that grow local ingredients – to premium
markets, and can be prototyped in the context of cultural events
like food festivals. Every successful prototype in this direction
demonstrates momentum, while informing other similar
prototypes. Successive iteration will result in a reliable playbook
for operating in liminal spaces between the SDGs, but also with
the potential to unlock latent value to drive acceleration.

Armed with these practice-informed R&D agendas, the coalitions
that emerged from the three Raves are now driving learning and
actively looking for partners.

In focus: Small is
beautiful... but can it scale?

Designed for grassroots SDG acceleration, UNDP’s Accelerator
Labs are also driving development impact at scale in over 100
countries. A mature R&D capability, the UNDP Accelerator Labs
now have scaling rate data, which compares favorably to R&D in
the private sector. While in the pharmaceutical industry, it is
common for less than 10% of R&D to result in new medicines,
the success rate in the UNDP Accelerator Labs is much higher.

In 2024, almost two-thirds of UNDP Accelerator Lab
experiments went to scale. This means that the majority of Lab
experiments have been picked up by UNDP programming,
created new partnerships or influenced public policy. The
number marks a significant increase from the scaling rate of
50% in 2023, which was already high, demonstrating that time is
needed before innovations go to scale.

Approximately 68% of Lab experiments go to scale, by
influencing policy, growing in numbers or often catalyzing first-
time partnerships for UNDP offices.

How do small experiments create impact at scale?

The learning from experiments is picked up by UNDP or
partners: where the tested solutions were replicated or
expanded—either by UNDP, governments, or other partners.
Scaling might have been geographic, numeric or
institutional.

The learning from experiments has influenced public policy
at a national or local level: where the results of experiments
provide concrete evidence or insights that help shape policy
decisions or regulations.

Experiments that lead to partnerships are when the results
trigger a long-term collaboration with new actors—
government agencies, private sector, civil society, or academia.

Resource mobilization points to results of experiments that
helped unlock funding or in-kind resources for sustainable
development

New ways of working refers to cases where external partners
integrated the methods, tools, or approaches tested into their
own routines or systems.

Stories of Scale

Eswatini models plastic bag ban leading to
change in national public policy

The UNDP Eswatini Accelerator Lab co-created alternative
solutions to combat single-use plastic bags with the design and
rollout of the “Phatsa Sakho Nawe” campaign, executed in
collaboration with the Eswatini Environment Authority, the Ministry
of Tourism and Environmental Affairs and local retailers. The
campaign promoted alternative solutions for single-use plastic
bags. The results of the campaign galvanized a country-wide single-
use plastic bag ban that the government enacted in May of 2024.
The experimental campaign led by the Accelerator Lab created
space for small businesses, particularly those owned by women, to
begin producing and selling handmade shopping bags made from
textile waste. Now, there is growing interest from companies to
produce alternative shopping bags, for example, the company
Green Eco Bags is currently recruiting for up to 150 new jobs in
2025.

Unlocking Pathways to Navigate Polarization in
Guatemala

The 2023 Guatemalan general elections heightened polarization
and created immense pressure on the incoming government. At the
request of the General Secretariat of the Presidency, the UNDP
Guatemala Accelerator Lab took on the challenge of creating ways
to drive collaboration within polarized environments.

The Lab first tested intensive workshops with public officials to
explore polarization drivers and institutional responses. Instead of
fact-checking, the focus was on enhancing cooperation in uncertain
information environments. Encouraged by positive responses to the
prototype—including from the Secretary General of the Presidency
—the model was rapidly scaled up to 60 institutions, covering
most of the executive branch.

This initiative culminated in the resource guide, Promoting Dialogue
and Collaboration in Polarized Scenarios, offering practical tools for
governments. Now, private sector leaders are also adopting this
approach, extending its impact beyond the Executive Branch of
government and reinforcing dialogue and collaboration in
Guatemala.

Policy adoption: unearthing grassroots
solutions in the Philippines

In 2019, the late Rex Lor, Head of Solutions Mapping for the UNDP
Accelerator Labs took a team of colleagues for a walk. Not just any
walk, but a “solutions walk” through Quiapo, one of Manila's
oldest commercial districts, where they set out to discover
grassroots innovation in the heart of the city.

The practice they developed, called "SalikLakbay" (combining the
Filipino words for research and journey), structures the process of
identifying local solutions. This practice has matured and been
applied to other contexts such as in mountainous areas among
Indigenous Peoples and in wet markets. In 2023, SalikLakbay was
institutionalized by the national government through the
Department of Science and Technology under its Grassroots
Innovation for Inclusive Development (GRIND) Programme, where
this approach helps identify around 30 innovations per mapping
event. This is an increase from previous innovation scouting
approaches which yielded one innovation per province annually.

In 2024, the Department of Science and Technology’s regional
offices continued to apply the SalikLakbay approach, even adding
their own style to it in a Grassroots Innovation Workbook,
creating a compendium of grassroots solutions. For the past two
years, they have held an Expo, a platform dedicated to
recognizing outstanding achievements in grassroots innovation
and circular economy. The SalikLakbay practice, now officially
adopted by the Department of Science and Technology, has
already identified and documented 606 grassroots innovations
across the country.

Stories of Scale

From Memory to Reform: Scaling Gender-
Sensitive Justice in Ecuador

The UNDP Ecuador Accelerator Lab has supported gender-
sensitive judicial reforms by creating new ways to understand
violence against women and femicide. The moving and personal
“Flores en el Aire” initiative in 2022 engaged 15 families of femicide
victims to create digital memory maps, stories and memories as
qualitative data on women and their experiences with violence.
Building on this foundation, the initiative scaled in 2024 by
integrating these narratives into in-person judicial training focused
on transforming biases in decision-making.

The first training reached judges and prosecutors from 80% of
provinces. 77 out of 472 judges nationwide have been trained in
this new method, and it has been disseminated to more than two
thousand justice officials through the Attorney General's Office's
communication channels nationwide. Responding to growing
demand, Ecuador’s Judicial Council requested the expansion of
the training to 100 additional judges in early 2025—a significant
step toward national coverage whereby the justice system in
Ecuador has deepened its understanding of the complex problem
of femicide due in part to new forms of data tested by the UNDP
Accelerator Lab.

Seeding Big Change: The Belarus Lab’s Journey from
Local Action to National Strategy

What began as small experiments by the UNDP Accelerator Lab in
Belarus has sparked a national green transformation. The Lab’s
early efforts mapped out green and circular practices and, through
a pioneering foresight analysis, revealed that green sectors already
contribute 7% to Belarus' GDP, support over 10% of jobs, and save
10% of CO₂ emissions. These findings gave policymakers the
evidence they needed to act. The Lab helped draft the National
Action Plan on Green Economy, leading to the National Strategy for
Circular Economy until 2035. Progress is already visible: national
waste recycling reached 39.6% in 2024, surpassing government
targets. By making green development measurable, the
Accelerator Lab also helped Belarus join the Global Green Economy
Index. UNDP continues to work closely with the government to
deepen this momentum—developing a green finance framework, a
national taxonomy for green investments, and youth-led
hackathons to drive innovation in energy efficiency.

the inception of the Network. The SDG Commons makes the Labs’
work openly accessible and adaptable to enable others to analyze,
reinterpret, recombine and build upon it, sparking new possibilities.
It grows each day and is AI-powered to help UNDP colleagues
quickly know who in the Lab Network is working on what topic, and
to search, leverage and curate cutting-edge and bottom-up insights
to drive cross-country learning on frontier development challenges
across 113 countries.

The SDG Commons makes five types of data open and accessible:

1.What We See: gives access to more than 6,000 grassroots

innovations and other solutions.

2.What We Test: is the place to discover experiments where
UNDP and partners learn what works and what doesn't in
sustainable development.

3.What We Learn: centralizes a curated collection of blogs and

publications where Labs reflect on what they learn from
action.

4.Community Curated Boards: a collection of notes on

experiments, solutions, blogs and other sorts of insights that
are thematically curated by the Accelerator Labs Network and
extended community.

5.Next Practices for the SDGs: Discover highly curated

pinboards on the three Research and Development (R&D)
priorities of the Accelerator Labs in 2024: digital financial
inclusion, circular economy and climate action, and food
systems. More will be added in 2025.

While the SDG Commons was only available to UNDP staff in 2024,
in 2025 it will be accessible to all changemakers, partners and
development actors globally so they can pick up insights, make
sense of the knowledge in their own context and accelerate
action. It is the beginning of a movement, one that radically sees
openness as a tool to shift power and drive systems
transformation from the bottom up.

Pioneering financial inclusion and social
protection for informal Tanzanian waste pickers
In Tanga City, Tanzania, the UNDP Tanzania Accelerator Lab
partnered with the Taka ni Ajira Foundation, to launch the Waste
Banks initiative which created clearinghouses for recyclable
waste. When waste pickers – almost always informal workers –
deliver recyclables, they are weighed, logged and paid for. Using
mobile apps and GIS technology, the logs are turned into digital
tokens, becoming proof of the pickers’ revenue stream and
creditworthiness. This way, pickers themselves become part of a
formal economic system, and unlock access to financial services
such as micro-loans or insurance. Taka ni Ajira entered into a
business agreement with Jubilee Insurance Tanzania to develop
an insurance product called TakaBima, tailored for waste pickers.
It provides coverage for medical emergencies, accidents and
income loss. A business model innovation, the intent is to fund
this through revenue realized by the waste banks as they sell
materials to recycling companies.

Takabima is, to date, the only microinsurance specifically
designed for waste pickers that has been officially approved by
the Tanzania Insurance Regulatory Authority. It is a cutting edge,
ready to scale initiative featured in our Circular Economy R&D
agenda, with enormous potential to scale to other countries.

Biohacking a circular economy in North
Macedonia
What can be done with your food or biowaste leftovers? UNDP
North Macedonia, powered by its Accelerator Lab, is
harnessing the untapped potential of biowaste, which makes up
45% of all municipal waste in Skopje. In collaboration with the
City of Skopje and UNICEF, UNDP has established the country’s
first-ever biohacking laboratory, a pioneering initiative to
transform biowaste into marketable products and uncover new
business opportunities. This groundbreaking exploration effort
offers a scalable model for cities across the Global Majority.

Modernizing traditional farming techniques in
Malaysia

The UNDP Malaysia Accelerator Lab explored ways to
modernize traditional hill paddy farming by investigating the use
of new technologies while preserving its organic, climate- and
disease-resilient nature. Though less productive than wet paddies,
hill paddy farming uses heirloom rice varieties, natural fertilizers
and multi-cropping to boost soil health and reduce pests—
requiring significantly less water.

To enhance yields without compromising sustainability, the Lab
experimented with the introduction of tools like drones and
sensors for targeted irrigation and fertilization. The additional
harvest is then transformed into a high-value product through
downstream innovations, including solar-powered oven dryers
and packaging machines.

These efforts aim to make hill paddy farming more viable for
small-scale farmers, increasing food security and creating new
income opportunities. The initiative will be conducted through
collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fish and Food
Industry in Sabah, Malaysia, with funding support from the
Ministry of Economy. UNDP Malaysia will continue providing
technical guidance as the project expands across hill farming
communities.

Addressing waste with data in Panama

Panama’s waste collection service reaches only 65% of the
population, and the landfill serving the capital is a major health
hazard. The lack of comprehensive data on the quantity,
composition and location of waste stands in the way of reform.

The UNDP Panama Accelerator Lab assembled an extensive
knowledge base around waste production, collection, treatment
and circularity, all of which is geo-referenced. With it, the Lab
implemented pilot projects on source separation of waste streams
and deployed citizen science experiments to assess recyclability.
This led to identifying potential entry points to generate quick
wins and broaden the political space for circularity initiatives,
starting with a network of local solutions that could create circular
initiatives for nearly all waste produced by municipal markets.

Chapter 4: Partnerships: tackling
wicked challenges as a collective

In a world increasingly interconnected, interdependent and
challenged by global crises, no single actor can tackle the wicked
problems of our time on their own. The UNDP Accelerator Labs
Network has internalized the urgent need for multisectoral
partnerships since its inception: the networking power is part of
the UNDP Accelerator Labs’ “DNA.” In 2024, UNDP, through the
Accelerator Labs, continued to serve as a strong convener for
grassroots, national, regional and international partners, many of
which are new to the UN and to global development.

2024 deepened the collaborative engagement with founding
investors, Germany and Qatar, together with UNDP Core Donors,
and with the Japan Cabinet Office. Based on the experiences from
partnership outreach and engagement in the past five years, the
Labs reviewed and updated their global partnership strategy and
value propositions. They took advantage of the windows of
opportunity for visibility and widened the scope of partners
through R&D thematic agendas, organizing networking events,
plenums and inclusive consultations. The Accelerator Labs codified
services for revenue generation and expanded their engagement
with the private sector, connecting corporate interests with
broader development goals.

Below is an overview of key moments in 2024, highlighting how
our partnerships approach has been an engine for networking,
resource mobilization and continuous renewal.

Mobilizing Business Leaders for New Partnerships
in Berlin with BMZ and GIZ

In June 2024, the UNDP Accelerator Labs, together
with the Federal Ministry for Economic
Cooperation and Development of Germany (BMZ)
and German International Cooperation (GIZ)
organized the first time event “Innovating for Impact:
Pioneering Sustainable Development Partnerships,”
in Berlin. The event engaged 30+ private sector
leaders from banking, AI, foundations, fintech and
other sectors to explore social innovation for
sustainability.

The UNDP Accelerator Labs designed the event to
explore new partnership models to address
sustainability challenges, from promoting circular
economy practices to leveraging digital technology
for financial inclusion. This initiative has since
informed the Hamburg Sustainability Conference and
driven exploration of new R&D partnerships around
joint agendas.

Earth Day Launch of UNTAPPED: Collective Intelligence for Climate
Action during UNDP 2.0 Week

The virtual launch event of UNTAPPED: Collective Intelligence for
Climate Action gathered hundreds of changemakers, and academic
and development practitioners from around the world on Earth Day
(April 22) and featured high-level speakers Achim Steiner, UNDP
Administrator, Ms. Helge Elisabeth Zeitler, Director for European Union
and Multilateral Development Policy at the German Federal Ministry
for Economic Cooperation and Development, and Ms. Fatima Al
Ahbabi, Manager of the Strategic Partnership Department at Qatar
Fund for Development.

UNTAPPED analyzes over 100 climate initiatives across 45 countries
that are powered by collective intelligence and informed by UNDP
Accelerator Labs’ cutting-edge experiments in over 100 countries of
the Global South.

”Collective intelligence for us is an essential complement to Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and to technological advancement because we can
build more on localized climate data, and in the context of the
UNTAPPED report, we can bring in people that are usually often not
sufficiently heard.”

-- Helge Elisabeth Zeitler, Director for European Union and
Multilateral Development Policy of the German Federal
Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)

“In this 21st century, the combination of human knowledge,
emerging data, and technology holds a vast, yet largely untapped
potential to transform our approaches, including developing tools
and standards to better understand and respond to climate crises
using local and global data, to improve community resilience,
especially in the Global South.”

-- Ms. Fatima Al Ahbabi, Manager of the Strategic
Partnership Department at Qatar Fund for Development.

Scaling solutions and advancing R&D with Japan

Since 2020, the Japan Cabinet Office (JCO), with support
from the Japan Unit of UNDP (JU) and Japan Innovation
Network (JIN), has collaborated with the UNDP Accelerator
Labs to connect Japanese companies and start-ups with
grassroots-driven experimentation and the R&D agenda.
Over four cohorts, the Japan SDGs Innovation Challenge
(JSIC) has fostered impactful experiments. In 2024, a follow-
up phase supported the scaling of two experiments,
remote sensing of plastic waste in the Philippines and AI
drone technology for quelea bird pest control in
Zimbabwe.

In August 2024, to embed this partnership and take
it to new heights, the Japan Cabinet Office co-funded
R&D events and work on Digital Financial Inclusion,
Food Systems, and Circular Economy, as well as a
Codification Fest to document emerging R&D
practices from the Network.

The partnership with JCO has demonstrated the
power of inclusive, bottom-up innovation, involving
the Japanese private sector as key contributors to
sustainable development. The engagement will
expand to new innovation thematic areas in 2025.

Partnering with IKEA Social Entrepreneurship and
Ashoka to examine circular economy approaches

In 2023-2024, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network
partnered with IKEA Social Entrepreneurship and Ashoka,
with analytical support from Circle Economy, to explore
joint R&D questions by connecting our respective learning
networks. In 2024, the learning circle (an original
methodology from the Accelerator Labs) examined
informality in the circular economy, bringing together IKEA
co-workers, Lab members, and social entrepreneurs. This
highlighted the often-overlooked role of informal
businesses, particularly waste workers. In September 2024,
the partnership launched a white paper offering actionable
insights to empower informal waste businesses and
advance circular economic models globally.

Scaling Grassroots Innovation for Systems Change at
the first Hamburg Sustainability Conference

In October 2024, UNDP, the German Federal Government
(BMZ), the Michael Otto Foundation and the City of
Hamburg co-hosted the first Hamburg Sustainability
Conference. The UNDP Accelerator Labs hosted a session
entitled “Scaling Grassroots Innovations for Systemic
Change,” showcasing innovators like South Sudan’s
mGurush mobile money system, Zanzibar’s Tourism
Commission, and India’s HoneyBee Network, alongside
Siemens, Visa Germany, and TUI Care Foundation. By
presenting real-world examples from Global Majority
countries, the Labs demonstrated how digital public goods
and private sector partnerships can take grassroots
innovations to scale.

In the Media:

A solutions seeking journey in Guinea documented by
German media

Deutsche Welle, a German international broadcaster, produced a
short documentary on solutions mapping in Guinea. They traveled
with the UNDP Guinea Accelerator Lab’s Moussa Camara as he
introduced communities to solutions on the SDG Commons
platform and worked with them to determine how these solutions
might be useful to improving their livelihoods. Hadja Adama
Korka Diallo from Koubia learned about a runoff basin solution
from Moussa’s presentation that could help her irrigate her land.
She showed Moussa and a team of volunteer engineering
students her property to discuss the options for implementation.
The documentary increased visibility and advocacy on local
solutions to improve livelihoods supported by the Accelerator
Labs.

In focus: Artificial Intelligence

In 2024, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network examined how 19 Labs
worldwide are leveraging AI and new data sources and
computational methods to address diverse development challenges.

Over the past five years, UNDP Accelerator Labs have integrated data
innovation into development practices, seeking new ways to
understand and solve sustainability issues. The Lab in India has
focused on the construction industry that generates air pollution; the
Labs in Guatemala, the Philippines, Serbia, and Viet Nam have
focused on the accumulation of solid waste; and in Bolivia, the
Accelerator Lab has focused on environmental liabilities related to
mining. Labs in Cabo Verde and Cameroon use drone imagery and
computer vision to detect crop pests and diseases. The Labs in
Tanzania and Malawi analyze online travel data to inform tourism
strategies, and similarly, the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Jordan has
explored the use of social media monitoring to better understand sub-
national tourism dynamics.

Additionally, Labs are experimenting with generative AI for urban
planning and public engagement as in North Macedonia and
Panama, where the Labs have designed a novel methodology using a
tool called Urbanist AI to conduct public consultations on urban
planning.

Diversifying conversations on the risks and rewards of frontier technology

To help public institutions include rarely heard voices on frontier
technology such as AI, the UNDP Accelerator Labs and Columbia
University’s School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA)
partnered to create and test out a “Framework for Conducting
National Dialogues on Frontier Technologies” in Morocco and
Paraguay.

This Framework complements UNDP’s AI Readiness Assessment,
with an intentional focus on people’s views and participation.
Meaningful conversations on our shared digital future have failed
to reach everyone who stands to be impacted. This Framework is
now available as a public good to help decision makers tap into
this wealth of distributed knowledge.

In focus: Powering UNDP Timbuktoo’s
investments in African innovators

Timbuktoo, UNDP’s bold, pan-African innovative initiative, is
sparking a start-up revolution in Africa. As part of this initiative,
University Innovation Pods (UniPods), transform universities into
centers for innovation, experimentation and accelerated learning
across Africa. In 22 countries (out of 26), Unipods were designed
and managed by the UNDP Accelerator Labs across Africa. 20
UniPods have launched, and six more are set to open in 2025,
eventually operating in all 54 African countries.

The nexus between the Labs and the Timbuktoo UniPods creates a
perfect pipeline: the Accelerator Labs excel at picking up grassroots
solutions and signals of change, then the UniPods pick up the
potential to prototype and test ideas, enabling continuity. The Labs
help establish partnerships for the UniPods, such as with Kiira
Motors Corporation in Uganda, and facilitate the day-to-day
running of the UniPods bringing back to UNDP a reliable
makerspace for out-of-the-box thinking.

Empowering Futures for Ugandan students through the
UniPod

The UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab designed and operationalized
the UniPod at Makerere University, to ensure it meets student
needs and to bring innovators from different disciplines to the
same space to encourage collaboration. The Lab spearheaded a
partnership with Gearbox Pan African Network to install over 100
different types of equipment, including, for example, technical
design computers, multimedia equipment like Virtual Reality (VR)
and Augmented Reality (AR) sets, audio production, photography
and videography equipment, sewing and embroidery machines, 3D
Printers and soldering machines. The process the Lab undertook
was hands-on, involving students, staff and engineers. The Lab also
worked with the university to develop governing policies, service
lines and an autonomous operational model. The UniPod was
designed to complement existing innovation spaces, creating room
for multidisciplinary collaboration and enhancing Makerere’s
innovation ecosystem.

One program, the Electric Mobility Skilling Programme, is a
collaboration between Makerere University, UNDP and Kiira Motors
Corporation (KMC), which equips Ugandan students with cutting-
edge skills in electric vehicle technologies. The program offers
training in EV powertrains, batteries and renewable energy
systems. Currently, the UniPod has onboarded 25 students (12
female and 13 male) who have a clear pathway to employment in
the EV factory when they graduate.

UNDP Accelerator Labs equip UniPod Benin to
sustainably benefit young people

UniPod Benin, based at the University of Abomey-
Calavi, was created with critical input from the
Accelerator Lab in Benin. The Lab identified and
defined new programs in line with the needs of
Beninese youth and devised a sustainable economic
model to guarantee its financial future in the medium
and long term. Backed by UNDP and the Ministry of
Higher Education and Scientific Research, the state-of-
the-art innovation hub equips young people with tools
to keep pace with global technology demands.

The UniPod offers coworking spaces, a Design Lab
with 3D printers, a MakerSpace for manufacturing,
and a Technology Transfer Office to connect
innovations to markets. Training programs and
resources focus on tackling real-world challenges in
renewable energy, technology and mobility.

Chapter 5: Embedding the
capability for continuous renewal
in sustainable development

The UNDP Accelerator Labs are pioneering a fresh approach to
Research and Development (R&D), tailored to the emergent nature
of global challenges. By decentralizing R&D and embedding Labs
within local contexts across more than 100 countries, UNDP taps
into the immense potential of grassroots knowledge and
experimentation. This approach prioritizes those closest to the
challenges, recognizing that the most effective solutions often
emerge from the people most directly impacted. This distributed
R&D model has demonstrated the value of bottom-up innovation.

“The Accelerator Labs’ expedition into uncharted innovation over
the past five years highlights an undeniable truth:
groundbreaking ideas often emerge from the world’s most
challenging environments. While government and policy play
crucial roles, it is often the entrepreneur, the inventors or whole
communities that create the first crack in the system—the
lightbulb moment that opens the door for innovation to flow and
lasting change to take root.”

– Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator

Traditional R&D frameworks often rely on top-down directives,
where a single unit develops solutions for wider application. The
Labs’ approach, developed in 2024, flips that script. By embedding
Labs within communities, we tap into the unique insights and
innovations emerging from the people closest to the problems. The
Labs choose the issues they tackle, the partners they engage with
and the methods they employ. This generates a new kind of
development intelligence, one that emerges locally and that is
translated for global impact in sustainable development.

“The UNDP Accelerator Labs are enabling new ways of working,
which are much needed to help solve the planetary crisis.”

-- Helge Elisabeth Zeitler, Director for European Union and
Multilateral Development Policy of the German Federal
Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

We would like to look at the successes achieved in our
partnership over the past year with the aim of moving forward
towards more positive breakthroughs, benefiting from lessons
for further improvement, and relying more on innovative
solutions with the aim of expanding the circle of communities
benefiting from the projects provided through the partnership
between the State of Qatar and the United Nations Development
Program, similar to the benefits achieved from implementing the
Accelerator Labs project."

– H.E. Ms. Alya Ahmed Al-Thani, Permanent Representative of
the State of Qatar to the United Nations

Through initiatives such as the R&D Raves, the Labs Network
uncovers new zones of experimentation which create global
opportunities for scaling solutions, building coalitions and
addressing systemic challenges. Whether it’s leveraging digital tools
to expand financial access, developing market niches for small-scale
farmers, or designing sustainable systems for waste management,
these efforts reflect the power of collaborative experimentation.

As the global Labs Network refines this new model of R&D,
efforts will focus on fine-tuning learning agendas, engaging new
partners and continuing to scale experimental activities. New R&D
priorities emerging in 2025 are sustainable tourism, cities and
mobility, and information integrity as areas of opportunity within
sustainable development.

The challenge in focus for 2025 is integrating this bottom-up
innovation into a large, mission-driven organization like UNDP. How
do we bridge the gap between local experiments and global
strategies? Having built the model in 2024, 2025 foresees continued
investment in distributed innovation: finding patterns across
context-based experimentation, developing theories of change and
building coalitions to learn together as a system to make
breakthroughs.

As its forthcoming Strategic Plan is developed, UNDP will embed the
Accelerator Labs’ distributed intelligence function into its Bureau for
Programme and Policy Support, with increased coherence across
digital transformation, AI investments and grassroots innovation. To
leverage investments, the results of experiments will continue to be
shared across the UN as part of its effort to drive 21 century impact
through UN 2.0 and the Pact for the Future.
