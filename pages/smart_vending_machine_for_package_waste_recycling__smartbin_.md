This is a joint effort with the local company Pakomak (https://www.pakomak.com.mk/) where our experts work on upgrading an off-the-shelf vending machine with control electronics to detect and classify specific package waste. This information is afterwards fed into an incentive-based system called ecoMac that can be used by markets to stimulate package waste recycling.
