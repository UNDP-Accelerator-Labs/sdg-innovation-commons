Section 1: Introduction

1.1 Report Overview

Access to energy remains a concerning challenge for many across the world and grassroots

innovation presents a valid solution to this challenge. This document aims to present a

comprehensive normative framework for analyzing bottom-up innovations, the Grassroots

Thinking Approach. Through this approach, we aim to provide criteria for assessing the

contextual factors in which grassroots solutions emerge and exist, the characteristics of the

innovation and its goodness of fit or appropriateness within the system that it exists in, and

elements for ‘success.’ Recognizing the interactions described in this publication is critical

to understanding the transformative potential of grassroots solutions to improve energy

access and other development indicators. Each systemic element informs the other.

Therefore, optimal performance of grassroots solutions requires an extensive analysis on

both the community itself, and the system in which the grassroots solution emerges and

exists.

First, we present an overview of the current state of energy poverty and its implications for

development outcomes of those affected by it, thus building an imperative for grassroots

innovation as a valid solution to improve energy access. Section 1 concludes with a

description of the UNDP Accelerator Labs and its role in recognizing and sharing knowledge

on the importance of grassroots solutions. Section 2 presents an overview of the Grassroots

Thinking Approach which is based on the systems analysis process. This approach specifically

aims to support a deepened understanding of grassroots innovations. Sections 3, 4 and 5,

respectively, highlight the three pillars of the recommended Grassroots Thinking Approach:

1. the relevant contextual factors that influence the emergence and deployment of

the solution;

2. the characteristics of the innovation itself including required resources, and how

it fits in the community context; and

3. the elements of ‘success’ that increase the transformative potential of the solution

based on the needs of the community and innovator.

Pillar 1 recognizes the relevant factors related to the context of the systems in which

grassroots innovations emerge: culture and norms; financial and non-financial resources;

technological capacity; legislative and regulatory ecosystems; and stakeholders and

partnerships. These factors do not operate in silos. As such, it is critical to observe

interactions between them. Once a grassroots innovation emerges in a specific context, it

is necessary to understand the characteristics of the innovation, the required resources,

and how well the solution fits in the location of deployment. These criteria are under Pillar

1

2 which is the primary component of Section 4 of this report. Pillar 3 in Section 5 focuses on

elements of ‘success’. ‘Success’ is dependent on the innovator’s aims and the needs of the

innovator and the community. Elements of ‘success’ include novelty/ingenuity, frugality,

simplicity, marketability, scalability, transferability, reliability/stability, sustainability and

overall capacity for achieving societal and other benefits. It is not possible to present a

general framework for measuring success due to its dependence on contextual factors in

each situation. Each innovator should prepare success indicators that are relevant to their

innovation and the problem it is trying to solve.

Section 6 demonstrates how this approach can be put into practice using case studies of

innovations in Ethiopia and Malaysia. Specifically, the document includes an assessment of

the Mirt stove in Ethiopia and the solar-powered buggy in Malaysia. Finally, in Section 7, the

publication offers recommendations to the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network and other UN

agencies on how the insights that have been provided can be used to inform scalable

programming. Valuable insights were derived from a literature review and interviews with

key stakeholders and are

included

throughout

the publication. The primary

recommendations include:

● The Accelerator Labs Network, as well as other relevant international and community

organizations, should optimize its solutions mapping process to support the

Grassroots Thinking process as presented in the report.

● Local Labs should create a directory of resources that are available for innovators in

order to increase the access to information.

● Mainstreaming Grassroots Thinking should be prioritized across UN Agencies.

We will first present an overview of the current state of energy poverty and its implications

for development outcomes of those affected by it, thus building an imperative for

grassroots innovation as a valid solution. We will then identify characteristics of conducive

environments for relevant innovation by exploring the existing systems that innovators

must navigate.

Finally, we will present selected cases of energy solutions developed by innovators in

Ethiopia and Malaysia. Through information gathered from literature research and

interviews with innovators, Accelerator Lab members and experts, we will assess the

elements of these innovations, their effectiveness, lessons learned and the roles of the

various types of agents. Doing so will serve two purposes; i) illustrate the transformative

potential of grassroots innovation, and ii) demonstrate how studying solutions can provide

valuable knowledge for the entire ecosystem of actors and support efforts to achieve

sustainable development inside and outside of UNDP.

1.2 What is energy poverty?

Access to energy is a basic need for global populations, as it is used in every aspect of

everyday life: from lighting, cooking, heating and electrifying appliances/machinery to

transportation. Energy allows communities to realize local assets effectively and supports

income generation, technology adaptation, education, health and development (Sovacool

and Drupady, 2012). However, despite energy’s importance to development, energy poverty

remains a significant problem that exists widely, particularly in low-income and post-

colonial countries in today’s world.

‘Energy poverty’ refers to an individual or household’s lack of access to sufficient electricity

or modern cooking fuels to meet their basic needs (Aklin et al., 2018). ‘Access’ here means

both the sufficiency of available energy, and access at time of need. Energy poverty is

included among the indicators of household-level poverty (IEA, 2010).

In most developing countries, the problem of energy poverty exists more in rural areas than

in urban areas (Aklin et al., 2018). In cities, high population density facilitates economies of

scale. Therefore, building a power station and distribution network to connect the most

people to energy is more economically feasible. In contrast, the cost of providing electricity

to rural communities, which are often far from each other and from existing electricity

infrastructure, is high since a more extensive distribution network is needed to transfer

energy between households.

People living in energy poverty must rely on alternatives for lighting, such as candles or

kerosene lamps, which can be costly and can pose a risk to human health (Aklin et al., 2018).

Without adequate sources of artificial lighting, people experience difficulties with

functioning and being productive once the sun goes down. With respect to cooking, those

who are energy deprived do not have access to traditional fuels (natural gas, liquid

petroleum gas and biogas) or technologies that utilize renewable energy sources. Instead,

they must rely on wood, crop residues, dung, charcoal and other unclean fuels. Although

these fuels are often cheaper, they present constant environmental and health hazards to

households as well as to surrounding communities, and even to larger regions (e.g.,

deforestation).

1.3 What are the most energy deprived countries?

Around 770 million people lack access to electricity and more than 2.5 billion people do not

have the capacity to cook using clean, pollution-free energy sources (IEA, 2021). Low-income

countries in Africa and Asia have the lowest rates. In fact, the United Nations Development

Programme (UNDP) Energy Hub has identified 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia

that have the most significant gaps in access to electricity and clean cooking (Figure 1).

3

Appendix 1 includes a contextual overview of specific indicators related to energy access,

consumption and the electricity generation mix in these countries.

Figure 1: Map of the 19 most energy deprived countries

It is important to note that while access rates are essential data points, they can often be

misleading. For instance, while Bangladesh and India have 92% and 98% access rates

respectively, the reliability of electricity services remains a considerable challenge for

citizens (Tongia and Mehta, 2015; Ula et al., 2019).

There is a link between the development level of a country and the average demand for

energy it faces. States with higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita tend to have

higher energy consumption needs as well as access rates. Two noteworthy exceptions are

Mozambique and Sudan; both have GDPs per capita that are lower than $600, while being

among the highest consumers of energy among the most energy deprived countries. Data

on electricity consumption can also suggest what solutions are most appropriate. In Chad,

Niger, South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Malawi and Madagascar, the average citizen consumes

less than 100 kWh. As a result, it is conceivable that lower capacity solutions, such as solar

home systems, could be suitable options. On the other hand, countries with a larger

demand such as India, Bangladesh and Pakistan would require higher capacity systems to

cover their needs. Further analysis of consumption patterns is required to identify fitting

solutions, particularly in terms of differences between rural and urban settings as well as

comparisons of demand between various economic sectors.

4

Another important consideration is the barriers to access. To that end, there are general

challenges that are shared by most countries facing difficulties in providing reliable, clean

and affordable energy. The most common roadblocks on the supply side include the

geographic disparity of rural populations and the associated distribution costs, inefficient

infrastructure, access to financing and poor governance structures. On the demand side,

the cost of grid connections, insufficient information regarding modern technologies and

affordability constraints are cited as the primary barriers (IEA, 2019a; Bonan et al., 2016;

Hafner et al., 2018; Sovacool et al., 2016; Njiru and Letema, 2018; Jessel et al., 2019;

Seetharaman et al., 2019).

Of note is that countries that focus solely on grid expansion to increase access face

considerable difficulties. The governments of Malawi and Mozambique, for example, have

not pursued off-grid solutions to reach rural populations and as such, have fallen short in

connecting these hard-to-reach citizens. Reasons for the countries’ lack of investment in

off-grid solutions must be determined to support deeper understanding of existing barriers

to improving energy access. Conversely, 2.17 million people gained access to energy

through solar home systems and mini grids in Myanmar from 2016 to 2020, because of

government interventions (ITA, 2021). While it is clear that there are many other factors at

play, it would be interesting to see if communal actors such as innovators and

entrepreneurs can step in to fill the gap in terms of off-grid solutions in energy deprived

countries.

Subsequent chapters of this report aim to support improved understanding, albeit

preliminary, of the contextual environment that innovators must operate in as well as

identification of conducive policies that enable improved access.

1.4 The SDGs cannot be achieved without improving energy access

One of the most important aspects of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

(SDGs) is their mutual interdependence for collective achievement. As such, achieving SDG

7 - to ensure that by the year 2030, all people can access affordable, reliable, and modern

energy sources (UN, 2015) - can accelerate progress towards fulfillment of the other 16

SDGs which each have significant linkages to increasing energy access (Figure 2). Also, the

other goals such as education and partnerships can do their part in promoting more

informed energy choices and consumption patterns.

5

Figure 2: Linkages between SDG 7 and other SDGs1

It can be inferred from the definition of energy poverty that access to sustainable energy is

closely linked to access to economic opportunities (SDG 1 and 8). Sustainable energy access

facilitates educational activities that can be translated into economic empowerment, as

education opens new doors for people living in poverty, women and other vulnerable

populations. Achieving SDG 7 can thus facilitate the achievement of SDG 4 - quality

education - and SDG 5 - gender equality. In addition, the transition to renewable energy

when expanding energy access can support job creation and contribute to inclusive

economic growth (SDG 8). It is estimated that by 2030, there would be 30 million medium-

term renewable energy jobs, with 40 million new jobs created as a result of prioritizing

energy efficiency and system flexibility (UN DESA, 2021). In contrast, without the

achievement of SDG 7, persons living in poor communities will continue to be at risk of being

trapped by limited opportunities and resources.

Energy deprived populations generally rely on solid fuels (wood, crop residues, dung and

charcoal) for cooking, which pose an environmental and health risk for households and

1 Figure 2 was developed based on research and analysis of the linkages between SDG 7 and the other SDGs (Cahill,
2021; Čukić et al., 2021; UN DESA, 2021; OECD, 2021; Energia, 2019).

society. Slow progress in achieving SDG 7 will hinder the achievement of other public health,

environmental and climate related goals (SDGs 12, 13 and 15). Meanwhile, the achievement

of other SDGs can facilitate the progress towards expanding energy access. For example,

quality energy educational activities play a central role in raising communities’ awareness

about the health and environmental benefits of using clean energy.

Given the internal linkages between SDG 7 and the other SDGs, greater investment is

needed for development agencies and governments to foster partnerships between SDG 7

and the other SDGs (SDG 17). The broader partnership blueprint requires governments and

development agencies to set partnerships for energy-related goals as a high-level priority

and incorporate collaboration criteria in their impact evaluation framework.

1.5 Grassroots innovations can support efforts to improve energy access

Often, individuals affected by social and developmental challenges create ingenious small-

scale solutions. These are people who are aware and invested in the communities’ needs

and who are innately driven to address problems using local, contextual and traditional

knowledge (Gupta, 2019). Such solutions are often cheap, and easy for the community to

adopt and trust. On-the-ground innovations can bridge the gap between demand and

supply in community markets and can have a larger impact on a country’s economy by

creating employment opportunities, ensuring self-dependence and increasing productivity

(Gupta, 2019).

Bottom-up, community-led, frugal solutions are an essential means, if not often the only

viable means, to deliver affordable, accessible and appropriate energy services to
underserved people living in energy poverty.2 Grassroots innovation can support the
eradication of disparities existing between mainstream energy products and the needs of

people in communities with insufficient energy access. These solutions can also promote

individual and community-driven opportunities to the energy crisis at the community level

and can fill observed gaps in clean energy access. Furthermore, they can also enable

communities to engage in productive activities that further drive progress on various
development outcomes.3

1.6 The UNDP Accelerator Labs represents emerging recognition of the

importance of grassroots solutions in improving energy access

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Accelerator Labs Network was

launched in 2019 to be “the world’s largest and fastest learning network on wicked

sustainable development challenges” (Berditchevskaia et al., 2021). The Network started

with 60 teams covering 78 countries and is now expanded to 270 team members supporting

91 Labs covering 115 countries to increase capability for scanning, sensemaking and

experimentation for sustainable development solutions (UNDP Accelerator Labs, 2021). A

global team oversees the network, monitors its progress, consolidates results and

aggregates learnings, helping to generate an enabling and conducive environment to

facilitate cross-pollination of ideas while supporting the dissemination of knowledge to the

broader development ecosystem.

The Accelerator Labs are included in UNDP’s global policy teams and country offices, and

work with them, national partners and other entities at the global level to map, test and

experiment on development solutions across its global network. They build on the trust

developed with national and local government agencies over many decades. They capitalize

on the power of grassroots and youth, empowering them to search and experiment with

solutions developed by those dealing with the problems firsthand (Berditchevskaia et al.,

2021, 23).

One of the key activities of the Accelerator Labs is to document existing grassroots

innovations and gather learnings on developed community solutions to support UNDP and

the wider ecosystem of actors in reaching global development goals. In this regard, the

Accelerator Labs have developed an online Solutions Mapping Platform to document and

share knowledge on home-grown innovations acquired through its global network of

national experts, grassroots innovators and social entrepreneurs. Accelerator Lab team

members have contributed 2,328 mapped solutions related to all 17 SDGs and developed in
1,361 locations to the Platform.4

Recognizing the importance of leveraging small innovations for creating big impacts related

to energy access, the Labs launched a Discover and Deploy campaign in 2022. This campaign

was designed to seek out grassroots innovations, ethnographic knowledge and signals of

change to support the UNDP moonshot goal. This goal is outlined in the new UNDP Strategic

Plan (2022-2025) and includes the aim to apply integrated approaches to help “500 million

people to gain access to clean energy” (UNDP, 2021). The Accelerator Labs Solutions

Mapping Platform has the potential to present all valuable grassroots energy solutions

sourced through this campaign along with information on the innovators and their

operating environment, and an assessment of the solution’s scalability and accessibility.

The platform can become a knowledge management tool that presents the dynamics

between different actors that help incubate a solution from infant stage to scale-up.

Section 2: The Grassroots Thinking Approach: Using Systems

Analysis to Understand Grassroots Energy Innovations

The energy ecosystem is highly complex; it involves various actors that interact with each

other, as well as with a set of contextual factors that are specific to providing energy access

to the targeted community. The actors are bound by their ability to access, provide and

regulate resources that are needed to innovate energy solutions, and the solutions

themselves are judged on how well they fit within the local context in which they operate.

Furthermore, these sets of abilities and local characteristics are fluid; that is, they are
constantly adapting to evolving demographic, socio-economic, and political conditions.5
Therefore, a useful tool to break down these complexities is a systems approach.

A system is a group of parts that interact with each other to form a complex and cohesive

entity with a specific purpose (Kim, 1999). Components of a system must be interrelated

and interdependent (Acaroglu, 2017). As such, presenting the global contribution of

grassroots innovation as part of a system, rather than an assortment of individual solutions,

would facilitate the generation of generalized inferences that can inform involved actors on

how to leverage these innovations as a cohesive entity with the purpose of improving

community-level access to energy. Specifically, when considering the emergence,

deployment and transformative potential of grassroots energy innovations, it is important

to recognize the systemic structures that shaped the solution’s

ideation and

implementation. Analyzing a grassroots solution at any point in time can provide a valuable

snapshot of the current system set-up at a localized level.

This document proposes a novel framework based on systems thinking in order to identify

these generalized inferences, or insights. We have dubbed this framework Grassroots

Thinking (Figure 3).

The Grassroots Thinking Approach is based on the following three pillars:

1. the relevant contextual factors that influence the emergence and deployment of

the solution;

2. the characteristics of the innovation itself, including required resources, and how

it fits in the community context; and

3. the elements of ‘success’ that measurably increase the transformative potential of

the solution based on the needs of the community and innovator.

5 Interview with Philip LaRocco, Energy Expert and Adjunct Professor of International and Public Affairs. April 14th,
2022.

10

The logic here is that the conditions of a community create the need and ability for a solution

to emerge. The characteristics of the developed innovation depend on the intended

purpose based on the community and/or innovator’s need, the availability of resources

required to establish it, and the appropriateness of the solution based on the overall

context. By considering these systematic components, one can establish the transformative

potential for grassroots innovations by looking at various elements of ‘success’. These three

levels of analysis are essential in order to move from the specific to the general, from the

individual solution to scalable programming.

Figure 3: Three Pillars of the Grassroots Thinking Approach

Grassroots Thinking has the potential to reinforce the decentralized and human-centered

approach to development employed by the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network which

emphasizes local communities as the primary driving force for change. This method

recognizes grassroots innovators as a key stakeholder in expanding energy access since

they are often best positioned to provide guidance on how to reach those most deprived of

energy access. To innovate is to maneuver the system, constantly and simultaneously, in

order to solve a problem (Taylor, 2017). Thus, innovating creates opportunities for the

innovator to learn and adapt. Additionally, there are many behavioral, social and cultural

factors that dictate the appropriateness of solutions in a given context (Mentis et al., 2016).

Grassroots innovators are the only stakeholder in the ecosystem of actors that have a

11

concrete grasp of these factors since they are members of the community that is facing the

problem.

The Grassroots Thinking Approach used in this document is informed by research, a

contextual overview of the most energy deprived countries, expert interviews and solutions

mapped by the Accelerator Labs Network. The Approach is used to provide generalized

insights on context and requirements that promote the emergence and deployment

of grassroots energy innovations. These insights could also help UNDP to leverage the

ecosystem of grassroots innovations to inform scalable programming to improve

energy access.

This approach varies from other frameworks developed to analyze grassroots innovations.

For example, Gupta’s conceptual framework (2019) which highlights the precursors,

categorized as innovator, environment and market factors; outcomes, namely commercial

and non-commercial value; and necessary conditions for grassroots innovation, including

financial factors, marketing support, user characteristics, organizational support and

market accessibility. We place less emphasis on the market as a general influencing factor

in the development of grassroots solutions, include the characteristics of the innovator as

part of the analysis of the innovation itself, and expand on the outcomes through

assessment of elements of success of particular innovations.

12

Section 3: Pillar 1 - Contextual Factors of Community Influence on

the Emergence and Deployment of Grassroots Energy Innovations

This section identifies and describes broad contextual factors and their linkages which are

relevant to a community’s needs and capabilities, which influence an innovator to create an

energy solution at the grassroots level, and which may support the innovation’s

sustainability or failure. The section includes the results of a systematic assessment of

relevant technical, socioeconomic, environmental and political linkages related to a

community’s energy ecosystem and presents insights on conditions that are conducive to

these types of bottom-up innovations.

Figure 4 shows the relevant factors related to community context which were assessed.

These are described below:

Figure 4: Contextual factors which influence grassroots energy innovations derived from a

review of existing literature and outcomes of stakeholder interviews

● Social norms, culture and values may play a key role in transitioning to clean and

renewable sources of energy, but they may also act as a significant barrier to low-

carbon transitions (Sovacool and Griffiths, 2020).

13

● Financial and non-financial resources must be available to cover the associated

energy production and distribution costs and to effectively provide relevant energy

services. Financing mechanisms may include traditional or non-traditional sources

such as private equity or public capital investments, loan guarantees, credit

enhancements, government issued bonds, stocks, mutual funds, direct aid, grants

or seed funding (Kuntz, 2017). Non-financial resources include raw materials for

manufacturing and production, space, renewable and non-renewable energy

sources and human resources. The availability of some non-renewable resources is

dependent on environmental and geographical factors (Mentis et al., 2016).

● Technological capacity is important for the development and use of new

innovations (Creech et al., 2013). Technological capacity refers to a community’s

ability to access and utilize technologies and technological support to improve

energy efficiency and access. It includes considerations related to energy systems

and infrastructure; availability of modern, efficient and clean appliances and

electronics; and availability of skilled persons to develop and utilize technical

resources.

● Legislative and regulatory ecosystem refers to existing public and private

institutions, policy tools and laws related to energy generation and distribution,

innovation and business development. These support an enabling environment to

support local innovators (Creech et al., 2013).

● Stakeholders and partnerships speak to the ecosystem of actors involved in the

provision of energy services and innovation development, collaborations between

these actors and other types of interactions that influence the availability of energy

at the community-level. Collaboration of diverse stakeholders and coordination

between local and international partners can drive the creation and sustainability of

an innovation (Hossain, 2018).

These contextual factors do not operate as isolated silos. In fact, systems are most

productive when their components work together, and actors coordinate to align

their directions (OECD, 2019). As such, presenting them separately would not be

instructive. The following section provides insights drawn from the interactions between

these contextual factors and how they influence the emergence and deployment of

grassroots energy solutions.

14

3.1 Insights from the analysis of contextual factors related to community

energy access

This section attempts to shed light on the interactions between contextual factors that are

conducive to the emergence and deployment of grassroots innovations. By assessing the

factors

that

frame

the ecosystem

that

innovators must navigate, and

their

interrelationships, entities will be able to identify key aspects related to the optimal set-ups

of these ecosystems, as well as some actions that stakeholders can take to develop a vibrant

environment for the incubation of innovative solutions.

3.1.1 Collaboration and information access are key factors to support the emergence of

grassroots energy solutions

Insight #1: Intra-communal collaboration can facilitate access to non-financial resources and

inform technological choices.

Consider the following solution: an innovator in Timor-Leste developed an efficient do-it-

yourself (DIY) cooking stove that replaces kerosene with used motorcycle oil obtained from
a nearby garage.6 By recognizing that the discarded material of a private business could be
transformed into a productive resource, the innovator built a partnership that allowed

for a solution with an appropriate technical design. This solution prevents the used

motorcycle oil from being discarded in the environment and provides low-cost energy.

While this is a specific example, it is easy to conceive other situations where collaboration

could be leveraged in a similar manner; for example, in a community where a local farmer

discards large amounts of organic matter on a regular basis, or a woodworking shop

produces sawdust.

Such interactions can reduce the cost of a solution and enhance its contextual suitability by

taking advantage of materials sourced from the local community. Furthermore, this type of

circular economic behavior is sustainable as it allows for the use of previously discarded

material while strengthening social capital by promoting the creation of intra-communal

linkages and networks (Heshmati, 2017; Areekul et al., 2015). Agents that have deep

technical knowledge and that are somewhat close to the ground can play an important

role by identifying opportunities and informing innovators on potential collaborations

Leste Accelerator Lab.

that they can develop. The stakeholders that are best positioned to play this role are local

non-governmental organizations

(NGOs), development agencies, and academic

institutions. This highlights a system requirement that is critical for all stakeholders and

across all systems.

Insight #2: Information is a non-financial resource that could boost technological capacity

and support policy development and positive behavioral change.

Information is a valuable and sometimes costly non-financial resource. Access to

information can support evidence-based policy development, enhance technological

capacity and promote positive behavioral change. The fact that access to information is a

precursor of well-functioning markets and systems has long been well established (Löfgren,

2002). However, it is still important to consider how that applies to the systems being

analyzed from the lens of different stakeholders.

Organizational and government stakeholders should aim to adopt a local, learning and

sharing approach to their operations, be it on a single project level or in the design of
general policy.7 Local refers to the level of analysis. Learning relates to the recognition that
communities have a better understanding of the problems they face and as such should

inform organizational behavior. Sharing means the dispersion of the information obtained,

both internally and to other actors.

Innovators must be fully aware of the resources that they have access to in order to best

leverage them. For community members, education and information access are critical to

changing behaviors and practices related to adopting new energy technologies (Farah et

al., 2019). Lack of information can create doubt within a community, reducing trust and thus

reducing the uptake of an innovation. At the same time, the communities themselves,

including the innovators, should be considered as the primary source of information.

Insight #3: Governments should engage in effective communication to make stakeholders

aware of available resources, opportunities and sectoral direction.

2022.

Governments should play a role in ensuring that all stakeholders have access to the

knowledge and learning needed to support enhancements within the overall energy

services system.

When this does not occur, informational asymmetries can disrupt markets. For instance, the

Government of Bangladesh distributed free solar home systems (SHSs) as a form of social

security (Cabraal et al., 2021). As a result, private distributors of SHSs saw their market size

decrease after having already invested in inventory. If the government had preemptively

declared their intention to pursue this policy, private operators could have allocated their

resources accordingly. One way to ensure the alignment of private actors with the

legislative framework is to engage in a consultative process in the drafting of policies with

industry leaders and civil society organizations (Oliver, 2019).

3.1.2 Governments play a key role in creating an enabling environment for grassroots

energy innovations

Much information is available on the different policy tools that can generally improve

energy access (Bazilian et al., 2012). The following insights attempt to present ways in which

governments can create an enabling environment for grassroots innovation,

specifically.

Insight #4: Governments should include provisions that promote grassroots innovation in

the context of a national energy strategy.

First and foremost, governments must develop a national strategy to improve energy

access. Unfortunately, some countries have not yet done so and that has hindered their

ability to alleviate energy poverty. Assuming that a sectoral vision document exists, the

government is well positioned to flag promising areas of intervention, thus establishing

regulatory provisions to support innovators with ideation, production and dissemination of

their grassroots-level solutions.

In Bangladesh, by adopting a bottom-up lens, the government identified solar micro-

chilling and solar ice manufacturing plants as an attractive opportunity for small-scale

entrepreneurs (SREDA, 2021). Governments can go a step further by enacting strategically

targeted programming.

Insight #5: Governments should establish public entities and national programs that focus

on capacity building for grassroots innovation.

17

The presence of a specialized resource that stakeholders can turn to provides a space for

collaborative action for problem solving. Such an approach can serve a variety of

purposes and can stem from a country specific need or opportunity. Governments often

build on partnerships with international development agencies as well as foreign

governments to enact these programs. The following are some examples of initiatives

adopted in energy deprived countries:

● Climate Innovation Center, Ethiopia
● Rural Electrification Fund, Ethiopia
● National Biodigester Program, Burkina Faso
● West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency, India
● Off-Grid Solar Access Project, Kenya

Such initiatives, as well as other policy tools, aim to build capacity for problem solving by

complementing the efforts of local and international NGOs, private businesses, and

grassroots innovators. For instance, the Government of Madagascar, in partnership with

the World Bank, has launched the Off-Grid Market Development Fund (OMDF) to provide

credit lines to providers of off-grid energy solutions as well as micro-financing institutions

(MFIs) that operate in the sector. This type of financial mechanism aims to build the financial

capacity of the general off-grid solution providers. However, governments can engage in

activities that directly support grassroots initiatives.

Insight #6: Governments should incentivize grassroots innovation by directing public funds

towards targeted programing that enhances access to financing as well as the financial literacy

of innovators.

Governments have the ability to support the incubation of grassroots innovation by

providing financing (Gupta et al., 2020). For instance, the Government of India funds the

development of prototypes for novel energy solutions by providing grants to innovators

through the Value Addition Research and Development (VARD) Fund. However, access to

financing is not the only component of financial capacity building (Sakanga et al., 2020).

Many grassroots innovators have underdeveloped financial literacy (Gupta et al., 2020).

What this implies is that they may not have a proper grasp of budgeting and account

management skills, or a clear understanding of the different financing options available to

18

them. Some governments have developed mechanisms to address this challenge. For

instance, some innovators might not be aware that securing intellectual property rights

over an innovation can significantly increase its financial value and as a result, how

investable it is (Hall, 2007). As such, the Government of India, through the National

Innovation Foundation, provides information and financing for the patent application

process.

3.1.3 The availability of funding is a critical driver of bottom-up solution development

Public funds are a vital resource to improve the financial capacities of innovators because it

is difficult for them to access financial markets (OECD, 2015). However, public resources

alone are

insufficient to fully

leverage community-level potential and therefore,

international development agencies and financial institutions have an important role to

play. Traditional financing models are not always well suited for funding grassroots

innovations due to the high levels of associated risks arising from unproven technology

development, low technical capacity of the innovator, low economies of scale and limited

resources. Furthermore, fundamental gaps exist between the needs and incentives of

innovators on one hand, and private financial institutions and donors of development

agencies on the other (UN, 2021). As such, new approaches are required to accelerate

grassroots innovation.

Insight #7: International development agencies should employ a country driven approach to

their decision-making process for small-scale project funding.

One way to bridge the needs and incentives gap described above is by allowing the local

context and community norms to inform the decisions of grant allocations within

international development agencies. This would ensure that the bottom-up, decentralized

approach to development is preserved in the financing phase.

Historically, the approach to financing international development has been based on

imposing specific, pre-designed programs on communities. Since 1972, The GEF Small

Grants Program (SGP), which promotes “thinking globally, acting locally,” breaks from that

tradition as it accepts applications from community members for project-based funding. A

steering committee, composed primarily of local civil society members, then selects

grant recipients. Furthermore, after the disbursement of the grant, UNDP country staff

19

engage in capacity building and mobilization efforts in the recipient communities to
facilitate the effective deployment of the solution.8

The difference between the historical approach and the mechanism developed by the SGP

represents a fundamental shift in the way that the beneficiaries of such programs are

perceived. As Dr. Anil Gupta (2013) writes: “Instead of treating economically poor people as

a sink of public aid, assistance, advice, and corporate goods and services, we should treat

them as a source of ideas, innovations, and institutional arrangements with which formal

public and private institutions can engage.”

While this approach promotes the strengthening of community agency by providing grants

directly to community-based organizations, the financial capacities of local communities are

still bound by the rigid practices that development donors employ.

Insight #8: Financial institutions and international donors should embrace agile spending by

engaging in long-term, small-scale investments.

Usually, international donors are attracted to large scale projects that reach a maximum
number of beneficiaries, and that have short assessment periods.9 Similarly, private
financial institutions generally look for short duration, low-risk projects (Das, 2011).

Conversely, grassroots innovators require access to low-cost working capital to finance their

solutions over long repayment periods as user uptake can be slow. Moreover, the target

customers of such solutions are often low-income individuals, or households, thus further

increasing the risk profile of the project. This does not mean, however, that financing

grassroots innovation is not feasible, only that the current mechanisms employed by donors

and financial institutions are inadequate. As such, it is critical that these stakeholders

develop new methods to deliver project financing to those most in need of it.

Shifting organizational behavior can be a long and arduous process (Staw, 1981). It can be

made easier by finding ways to bridge the needs and incentives gaps that govern the

financing of grassroots solutions. One potential way to do that is by leveraging

developments in Information and Communication Technology (ICT).

Regional Focal Point. April 14, 2022.

Regional Focal Point. April 14, 2022.

20

Insight #9: Innovation and penetration of information and communication technologies

(ICTs) can facilitate access to financing for grassroots innovators.

ICTs are an important tool to promote financial inclusion (Andrianaivo, 2011). Much of the

application of ICTs in the context of small-scale energy solutions has focused on increasing

the financial viability of projects by facilitating payment for the consumer. For instance, the

spread of mobile banking in sub-Saharan Africa has paved the way for innovative business

models for off-grid energy providers (GSMA, 2019). However, there is also room for

innovation that aims to bolster supply-side financial capacities. One such example is

kiva.org, an online microlending platform that allows individual investors to lend as little as

US$25 to local entrepreneurs in developing countries. As trends in ICTs appear to be

centered around decentralization and individual agency, emerging technologies, such as

blockchain, could pave the way for transformative innovation in the years to come.

21

Section 4: Pillar 2 - Understanding the Characteristics of

Grassroots Energy Innovations Provides Key Information on

Community Needs and Capacity

As stated above, grassroots energy innovations emerge from the needs and capacity of

community members. Understanding the characteristics of developed energy innovations

can provide key information on the community, and can inform the government,

development organizations and other stakeholders of the needs of citizens and the

potential for the solution to effectively contribute to improving energy access. For example,

strengthening knowledge on the purpose and goal of the innovation can inform

stakeholders of the gaps in energy access and services that need to be filled at the

individual, household or community level. Similarly, understanding the operational status

of the innovation can influence the programmatic and funding goals of government and

donor organizations.

Furthermore, leveraging community-level solutions to create scalable programming is
dependent on establishing the success of the innovation itself.10 This can only be done by
thoroughly assessing the innovation, its requirements and its appropriateness in the

location of deployment. Compiling information and data on these factors is critical to the

effective assessment, planning, implementation and monitoring of energy services delivery.

Figure 5 provides an overview of the type of information that should be collected as part of

this pillar. Appendix 2 lists questions that can contribute to expanding learning on these

attributes of a specific innovation.

10 Interview with Philip LaRocco, Energy Expert and Adjunct Professor of International and Public Affairs. April 14th,
2022.

22

Figure 5: Overview of information needed to understand grassroots energy innovations derived

from a review of existing literature and outcomes of stakeholder interviews

Insight #10: The goal, purpose and function of an innovation depends on the needs of the

community, the problem that the specific innovator is trying to solve, and the community

context.

Pillar 1 supports developing an understanding of the factors that influence the specific goal

and purpose of an innovation. The intended function of the innovation to generate, use,

conserve, augment, store or distribute energy depends on the stated goal. The source of

energy used to power the solution, as well as other materials needed to create it are all

dependent on the available resources in the community. Additionally, the viability of using

different energy sources and technologies to generate and distribute energy in a specific

community varies based on geophysical, social and economic contexts (Mentis et al., 2016).

For example, factors used to determine the most relevant energy technologies for a

community include the availability of local resources and infrastructure, settlement patterns

and population distribution, financial and technological capacity, and community needs.

Mentis et al. demonstrate that for Ethiopia, high population density settlements, high

energy consumption levels, high energy access targets and increased rural electricity

demand create a preference for grid-based energy options instead of off-grid, standalone

connections (Mentis et al., 2016).

23

Insight #11: The cultural relevance of the innovation is also a key factor in its ability to be

effective and to be taken up by community members.

For example, cultural barriers to the adoption of

improved cookstoves

include

incompatibility of stoves with the preparation of traditional meals, perception that food

cooked in conventional ways taste better, skepticism of the effectiveness and safety of new

technologies, and the spiritual and cultural significance of open fires and smoke generated

from traditional stoves (Sovacool and Griffiths, 2020). In Botswana, an open fire is a central

location for families and visitors to gather around and socialize. Therefore, a solution that

replaces the open fire with a closed stove may not be feasible. In Nepal, some people

hesitated to adopt solar cookers out of fear of offending the “god of the household hearth”

(Coyle, 2006). Similarly, in some rural Indian households, smoke from traditional stoves is

believed to connect the earth and heaven (Shankar et al., 2014). Therefore, there might be

challenges with mainstreaming a smoke-free solution. Attitudes towards energy

consumption and comprehension of technologies may also affect usage patterns and

adoption of technologies (Sovacool, 2009).

Insight #12: Documenting the characteristics of the developed solution is necessary to determine

the requirements of the solution and its deployment.

Specifically, understanding the innovation could provide key knowledge on the costs

needed to manufacture, deploy, use and maintain the solution, and the skills needed to

build and implement it. Knowledge of costs can in turn inform appropriate financial

mechanisms and funding sources needed. Similarly, awareness of required skills can

support identification of levels of expertise and partnerships needed to deploy the solution.

The outcomes of Pillar 1 can be used to determine existing financial and non-financial

resources that can be tapped into to fill the requirements of the specific innovation.

Insight #13: Recognizing how well the innovation fits in the location of deployment could

support efforts to scale, adapt and transfer the solution.

Pillar 1 describes the general community context, while this component of Pillar 2 refers to

how a specific innovation interacts with the community. Once ideated, it is important to

recognize how grassroots solutions fit into the wider solution landscape and the

community's energy ecosystem.

Potential interactions may occur based on the type of community, the population density,

the income status of community members, the scale of reach, the rate of deployment and

the level of community participation. Additionally, it is important to recognize how existing

24

formal and informal networks, and the community’s regulatory and legislative framework

work to support or limit development and deployment of a solution.

Insight #14: The characteristics of the innovator can also provide key information that could

support the solution’s potential for ‘success.’

The characteristics of the innovators influence the innovation itself, since their motivation

to create a solution often stems from their perceived need and challenge. Relevant

attributes include the innovators' education, technical skills, past experience in producing

innovation, attitudes and empathy, extent and level of positivity in approaching problem

solving, sensitivity to social issues, a sense of belonging to the community and a self-belief

to create and improvise in a resource-constrained environment, as well as ambition and

motivation to commit to the process of innovation (Gupta, 2019). However, research

suggests that grassroots innovators lack knowledge regarding patents or trade secrets, are

dependent on intrinsic motivations such as joy and social relations, and when extrinsic

motivators are imposed on them, their creativity is repressed (Sheikh and Bhaduri, 2021).

25

Section 5: Pillar 3 - Elements of ‘Success’ Can Support the

Transformative Potential of Grassroots Innovations

This section outlines Pillar 3 of the Grassroots Thinking Approach: key elements that

demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of community-based energy solutions. The

elements were developed using available literature on grassroots solutions and key

informant interviews. They consider the contextual factors identified under Pillar 1 and

characteristics described under Pillar 2. Measuring the elements of success through a set of

developed indicators specific to innovators’ aims and objectives can support monitoring

and evaluation efforts and a better understanding of the ecosystem of energy innovations

and how they benefit from and contribute to feedback for the local energy system. The

elements of success could be used to guide data collection methods for more detailed

assessments of trends and outcomes of developed grassroots innovations. Furthermore,

they can increase the capacity of primary actors to identify relationships between the

purpose and functions of developed innovations, types of energy sources utilized by

innovators, and community characteristics and needs. Through enhanced analysis and

capacity, the elements of success of particular

innovations could support better

understanding of costs and required resources for different types of projects, their reach

and reliability, and opportunities to scale and transfer solutions to other contexts.

Below are a few of the questions that the indicators aim to address:

● What are the technologies that are yielding results?

● What are the business models that have led to financial viability?

● What are some of the favorable local context characteristics?

● What regulatory framework is most supportive of innovation as well as scalability of

solutions?

● What are the conducive interventions that actors in the development space can take?

● What are the effective financing mechanisms and what are some aspects of the

solution that can facilitate access to financing?

● What are some causal and corollary linkages between different characteristics? For

example, regulatory

framework and availability of

financing, community

participation and transferability of the solution, financial viability and uptake cost on

community, etc.

The three categories of information under Pillar 2 can support understanding of existing

grassroots innovations and their potential for ‘success’ within and outside of their original

26

community context: the characteristics of the innovation itself, required financial and

human resources and partnerships, and the goodness of fit/appropriateness of the

innovation in the location of deployment. Specifically, ‘success’ is considered to be

measurable, and related to novelty/ingenuity, frugality, simplicity, marketability, scalability,

transferability, reliability/stability, sustainability and the overall capacity for achieving

societal and other benefits (Figure 6). The sections below explain each of these elements.

Figure 6: Elements of ‘success’ for grassroots energy innovations derived from a review of

existing literature and outcomes of stakeholder interviews

5.1 Elements of ‘success’ depend on the needs and goals of stakeholder groups

and the wider community context

Grassroots innovations emerge from people closest to the problem and who are often

marginalized by state, politics and markets. These community members may appropriate

existing solutions to suit their needs, or they may contrive their own unique solutions. As

such, grassroots innovations, at best, are contextual and place-based, meeting users at their

point of need.

The definition of ‘success’ with respect to grassroots solutions varies based on the needs

and goals of the stakeholder groups involved in the particular solution, the wider

community context and the characteristics of the innovation. For example, ‘success’ may

refer to the novelty and ingenuity of a particular design for a scientist or engineer who is

27

hoping to acquire a patent for a product. A for-profit company or business owner may

define ‘success’ as the development of a marketable, scalable and transferable product. A

non-profit social organization or a development agency may view a ‘successful’ solution as

one that is frugal, simple and affordable, thus increasing the likelihood of uptake and social

impact. Definitions and examples of ‘success’ are examined below.

Impact: Does the innovation positively affect people in the community of deployment and the

environment?

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2022) defines impact

as “positive and negative, primary and secondary long-term effects produced by a

development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended.” This definition

generally implies that impact is specific to both the intended and unintended results of a

program. Solutions developed by individuals in a community are often intended to fill a

social gap. They are also often people-centered, i.e., revolving around the needs of

community members, and considering aspects of their behavior, culture and social norms.

As such, social impact is often a key indicator of success for grassroots solutions, i.e., the

effects of the solution on social well-being. Similarly, environmental and economic impacts

are also drivers of the development of on-the-ground solutions.

Specifically, energy solutions often aim to improve access to energy services and energy

efficiency and reduce the risk to ecological systems (UNDP, 2016). These objectives can have

significant social, economic and environmental impact. For example, a young man, Destin

Bibila, from the city of Pointe Noire in the Republic of Congo aimed to convert organic

household waste into ecological charcoal to reduce deforestation caused by traditional use

of firewood and charcoal for energy (Saya, date unknown). This initiative would serve to

reduce piling up of garbage which could be detrimental to human and environmental health

in the city. Furthermore, the bio-coal displayed other elements of impact by being more

efficient, thus reducing required energy consumption, and cleaner, i.e., producing less

carbon dioxide gas.

Insight #15: Low-cost innovations can be considered a valid form of humanitarian relief in

times of crisis.

In crisis situations, resource scarcity, affordability and access are major concerns. Solutions

that are able to eliminate the need for limited resources and replace them with readily

available alternatives can offer considerable relief. For example, in the midst of the Syrian

humanitarian crisis, an innovator modified a diesel-powered heater into one that runs on

28

pistachio shells.11 The impact of such a simple and low-cost solution is often overlooked
despite its substantial value.

Insight #16: Innovations that allow for productive uses of energy can have a greater impact.

The impact of some solutions can go beyond improving access to energy, as they can also

allow users to engage in revenue generating activities and provide goods and services to

their communities. For instance, an innovator in Niger developed a solar dryer that allows
vegetables to be preserved and used throughout the year.12 As such, farmers gain the ability
to sell their goods during seasons where they previously could not. This not only benefits

the farmers, as they now have an improved revenue outlook, but the community as a whole

since access to food is facilitated. The productivity gains of improved access to energy have,

in fact, been recognized by the GEF Small Grants Programme (SGP), as it is a primary aspect
of their grant making strategy.13

29

Frugality: Is the solution cheap to produce/maintain and affordable for the consumer?

Consumers of solutions developed at the grassroots appreciate affordable options,

especially those in low-income communities and in emerging markets. Similarly, producers

value low-cost technologies which minimize costs while maintaining the quality of the

product. As such, frugality is another criterion used to determine the success of innovations.

Frugal innovations are simple but competitive innovations that are also robust and durable.

Frugality is centered around producing lower product manufacturing costs on a technical

level (Bhatti and Ventresca, 2013) and using simple technologies with little to no

maintenance costs (Rao, 2013).

The development of inexpensive innovations in clean energy solutions arises from the need

to access new technologies that are cheaper than alternatives in developing countries

(Numminen and Lund, 2016). Frugal energy solutions often utilize sources of energy that

are available locally and are therefore cheaper. Additionally, they are a critical way forward

for emerging economies for various reasons including their potential to reduce the use of

traditional, expensive non-renewable sources of energy and their environmental effects

(Kuo, 2017). The bio-coal example from Pointe Noire in the Republic of Congo demonstrates

the potential frugality of grassroots energy solutions. The developed innovation was noted

to be two times cheaper than traditional charcoal (Saya, date unknown). Furthermore, the

use of available waste products to create this innovation would significantly lower

production costs.

Insight #17: Innovators can utilize sources of energy that are available locally to minimize costs

and accomplish frugality

This insight builds on Insight #1 which claims that inter-communal partnerships can

facilitate access to resources and inform technological choices. Here we are further

developing this idea by stating that such collaboration can reduce the cost of a solution, for

both innovators and users, and thus promoting its frugality.

Simplicity and Practicality: Does the solution require extensive and complicated resources to be

implemented? How practical is its offering and performance?

Grassroots solutions are likely to be more successful if they do not require extensive and

complicated resources to be implemented. Simple and practical solutions are viewed as

beneficial because they require less technical know-how, minimize the use of raw materials

and other resources, thus increasing affordability of the product (Numminen and Lund,

2016). Furthermore, simple innovations can have greater uptake since less skill is required

30

to manufacture and use them, thus increasing accessibility to various communities. These

approaches include do-it-yourself models which could support the transfer of products.

Simple solutions can have significant reach. In Mafeteng, Lesotho, community members

came up with an easy mechanism to encourage hand washing and prevent the spread of

COVID-19 during the pandemic (UNDP Accelerator Labs, Lesotho, 2020). The innovation

utilized a 5-liter container with a small hole in the cap that released water if the user stepped

on a string attached to the vessel (Figure 7).

Figure 7: Tippy-tap hand washing solution in Lesotho (Source: UNDP Accelerator Labs,

Lesotho, 2020)

Scalability: Can the solution’s deployment or uptake be increased?

Scaling can take several forms, including impacting institutions through efforts to change

laws and policy (scale up), increasing the number of persons or entities impacted (scale out)

or promoting cultural change (scale deep) (Baru et al., 2020). Scaling out is the most

common form as it may entail replication of a particular solution and/or increased

dissemination to expand the impact. Scaling deep is the most difficult as it aims to change

norms and beliefs of community members. Bottom-up solutions can support behavioral

change through awareness raising and provision of opportunities to adopt new practices

(Moscovich, 2022). Scaling can also refer to knowledge sharing and process development in

addition to a specific innovation or solution. Persons on the ground have the most

knowledge regarding problems faced by communities. Sharing their experiences and

lessons learned can support scaling of ideas and concepts, thus creating opportunities for

greater social impact.

31

Scaling often requires additional resources which community members most likely do not

have access to on their own. Partnerships with government entities, development

organizations, the private sector or other community members can support these

initiatives. The Guatemalan initiative, Mosan, created a closed loop system to contain and

transform household sanitary waste

into organic fertilizers

in rural communities

(Constantino, 2022). Considerations for expanding the reach of this solution included

partnerships with the Global Environment Facility Small Grants Programme, obtaining

technical and business support to enhance the solution, and reaching out to other local

governments.

Insight #18: Sharing the experiences of innovators in order to inform scalable programing

should not be limited to solutions that are perceived as ‘successful’ as lessons can be learned

from any attempt to innovate.

The knowledge acquired by studying any solution, including those that were unable to

achieve the other elements of success described in this section, can promote scaling

through sharing of best practices as well as initiatives that did not work. By internalizing

this insight, multinational organizations can derive value from any grassroots innovation,

whether or not it was considered effective.

Insight #19: International development organizations are ideally positioned to assist the

scaling efforts of innovators and to disseminate the knowledge they acquire to the entire

ecosystem of actors involved in efforts to improve energy access globally.

International development organizations, such as UNDP, have the resources and

organizational structures in place to access various local communities across the world

simultaneously. This is a unique ability that positions them as a primary resource in the

acquisition of knowledge relating to global trends in grassroots innovation. Furthermore,

such entities can leverage the existing partnerships they have with governmental

stakeholders in order to disseminate this knowledge to inform policy and institutional

behavior.

Transferability and adaptability: Can the solution be deployed in another context?

Adaptability implies that a solution can easily be adjusted to fit different contexts or

purposes. Grassroots solutions are steeped in contextual challenges and the characteristics

of the local environment such as norms, beliefs, and political structures. These

characteristics contribute to the acceptance or rejection of these innovations. Attending to

local realities while seeking wider transferability may not always be feasible for grassroots

innovations because of the wide-varying nature of contextual differences. As such, the

32

drawback remains the constant appropriation of innovations to fit into the values,

characteristics, resources and capabilities of diverse communities. However, it is still

possible to have a solution that can be altered to fit the characteristics of different

communities, while maintaining the intended purpose.

For example, the hand washing mechanism designed in Lesotho and shown in Figure 3

above was remodeled and adapted for densely populated and high traffic areas (UNDP

Accelerator Labs, Lesotho, 2020). Adaptations entailed the use of more durable flat iron

instead of a string. Figure 8 shows an image of the adapted solution.

Figure 8: Hand washing solution adapted for high traffic areas in Lesotho (Source: UNDP

Accelerator Labs, Lesotho, 2020)

Insight #20: Donors should have an agile approach to transferring and adapting the most frugal

solutions that have demonstrated impact as their low costs can allow for a low-risk iterative

process.

While Insight #8 presents some of the gaps that exist between the needs and incentives of

donors on the one hand and grassroots innovators on the other, this insight presents one

form of agile spending that can reduce some of these gaps.

When solutions have demonstrated their impact, frugality, and potential for adaptability

and/or transferability, donors should be willing to spend small amounts of money to

33

attempt to recreate them in different locations. To do so, donors should forgo their

prioritization of reaching many beneficiaries at once, and

instead recognize the

compounded impact that their spending can have.

Marketability, novelty and ingenuity: Could the innovation be sold for profit? Are there similar

products that can be found on the market?

Urpelainen and Yoon (2016) highlighted that a novel business model allowing affordable

energy services for the community’s most vulnerable members is also a key driver.

Furthermore, the marketability of an innovation remains an important consideration,

especially for innovators who aim to profit off of their creation. Grassroots solutions can

lead to market stimulation through the development of missing connections across the

value chain.

Insight #21: Innovators can increase the marketability of a solution by diversifying revenue

streams through the offering of auxiliary products.

The diversification of revenue can improve the financial health of any organization (Mayer

et al., 2012). This also applies to providers of grassroots solutions. Consider the example of

MittiCool, a clay refrigerator that can store and preserve water, milk, fruits and vegetables.

The business that grew out of this innovation now offers a wide range of products, such as

clay pots, which allow it to generate supplemental income and ensure the longevity of the

business.

Sustainability, reliability and stability: Does the solution consistently fulfill its intended

purpose? Is the solution relevant in the long-term? Does it utilize a clean source of energy and

clean technologies?

Grassroots innovations are home-grown and usually go through multiple stages of iteration

to fulfill the needs or requirements of the innovator. This enhances their sustainability value

and eliminates the need to own multiple products if the innovation can effectively fulfill its

intended role. Innovators are also often more connected to their local environment, using

natural tools that are readily available, and frugal means, making them high on

environmental sustainability (Gupta, 2019). However, the consistency of grassroots

innovation provisions can be hampered by a lack of sustained availability of resources and

institutional support. Furthermore, in the face of climate change, energy innovations should

utilize clean energy sources and technologies to support efforts to mitigate harmful

environmental impacts.

34

Section 6: Demonstrating the Grassroots Thinking Approach Using

Case Studies from Ethiopia and Malaysia

This section presents two case studies of innovations from Ethiopia and Malaysia. The case

studies include an overview of the contextual analysis of each country and demonstrates

the potential of specific grassroots innovations mapped by the Accelerator Labs Network in

each nation. The studies connect the identified linkages to the system requirements

discussed in Section 3, highlighting, where possible, the conditions in which the solutions

emerged and exist. Through the analysis of the innovation’s characteristics as explained in

Section 4, elements of success are identified to support hypotheses of best practices related

to the various measures outlined in Section 5.

Ethiopia is one of the most energy deprived countries. In 2019, the World Bank reported

that only 48% of Ethiopians had access to electricity (IEA, 2022). On the other hand, in

Malaysia, 100% of the population has access to energy (World Bank, 2019). These two

countries’ situations therefore vary widely. However, it is important to note that despite

having 100% access to energy, there are still some populations in Malaysia that could be

considered energy poor due to factors including geographical constraints (Energy Watch,

2018). People in these two countries face different but similar challenges in accessing

energy. The challenges are discussed below as well as examples of solutions that have

emerged at the community level to solve them.

6.1: Improving access to clean cooking in rural Ethiopia through locally

sourced, scalable and deployable cooking stoves

6.1.1 Analysis of contextual factors related to energy access in Ethiopia

According to the Africa Energy Outlook Report (IEA, 2019a), by 2025, the continent will face

an increase in its population, leading to a rise in the need for energy. Such growth is

expected to overwhelm the amount of energy produced in Africa. Therefore, countries,

including Ethiopia, need to refocus efforts to expand the current energy supply within their

borders. Renewable energy resources such as hydro-power, wind, solar and geothermal

power exist in Ethiopia. Nevertheless, Ethiopia will remain heavily reliant on imports of fossil

fuels.

About 48% of Ethiopians have access to electricity, with 85% living in urban areas and 10%

in rural communities. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Ethiopia's

electricity capacity and generation in 2020 was about 4,817 megawatts (IRENA, 2020). Most

electricity was produced from hydropower, which accounts for 85% of the energy mix.

However, more than half of the population does not have access to electricity, especially in

35

rural and deep rural areas. Since a high percentage of rural and urban households do not

have access to electricity, and the power supply is often unreliable and erratic, electricity-

based clean cooking solutions will not be as effective as an improved locally sourced and

affordable solution. Therefore, biomass is expected to continue as Ethiopia's primary

energy source for quite some time.

Ethiopia's low rural electrification rates and its significant, untapped potential for

generating electricity from renewable sources (hydro, solar, wind), make it well placed to

develop innovative energy products (IEA, 2019b). Increasing electrification rates is of great

importance to the government of Ethiopia, which aims to achieve total electrification by

2025 by integrating grids and off-grid networks (Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Electricity

of Ethiopia, 2019). Through regulatory support, Ethiopia is enabling grassroots innovations

to flourish. In addition, several energy campaigns target Ethiopia, for example, USAID,

Power Africa and the international community, support technical transfer and capacity

building. For these reasons, multiple community energy solutions have emerged, and the
UNDP Accelerator Labs Network has already mapped some.14

UNDP Ethiopia stakeholders have highlighted that the country has essential strategies and

policies at the national level, including the Growth and Transformational Plan, the 10-Year

Perspective Development Plan, and the Climate Resilience Green Economy Strategy. The

action plans and strategy articulate the commitment to achieving universal access to clean,

reliable and affordable energy. These programs complement ambitious plans for universal

access to electricity by 2025. They set the targets to ensure 35% of new connections involve

off-grid technologies, while the rest will be on-grid.

Ethiopia's Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy and UNDP established the Rural Energy

Technologies in 2015 with the help of the Global Environment Facility (GEF). For rural

households and small businesses, the initiative emphasizes small-scale energy-efficient

technologies, such as improved cook stoves and solar home systems (UNDP Ethiopia, 2015).

Furthermore, to promote a vibrant and sustainable market for improved cookstoves, and

build institutional capacity, Ethiopia's national improved cookstove program aimed to

contribute to the government's improved cookstove distribution plan (Asfaw, 2019).

The innovation ecosystem in Ethiopia receives minimal recognition and support. Things are

worse for grassroots energy innovators, thus preventing the growth of new solutions.

Furthermore, solution mappers have identified a tendency for innovations to lean towards

specific areas such as clean cooking and cooking stoves, leaving out other opportunities to

expand electrification services. However, the Accelerator Labs have not fully explored and

14 Interview with UNDP Ethiopia Team Members. April 15th, 2022.

36

documented the reason for such heavy concentration of innovations focused on clean
cooking.15

Additionally, different community innovators invent various biomass inventions for clean

cooking due to different standards that might not fit or complement other fuel solutions in

the field. These cooking products have experienced high market penetration rates,

increasing uptake. One drawback has been that these cookstoves are easily mimicked, but

with incomplete features. Such examples of lower-quality copied inventions discourage

innovators and represent one of the causes of failure in getting these solutions to scale.

Therefore, it underscores the importance of regulatory frameworks that protect innovators’
intellectual property and ingenuity.16

6.1.2 Solving and reducing the population’s dependence on biomass-based fuel by

promoting the use of cleaner cooking technologies in Ethiopia

What is the problem?

An estimated 4 million annual deaths in Ethiopia are linked to indoor air pollution because

of traditional and inefficient biomass usage. Particulate matter from burning biomass in the

kitchen can cause premature death for children under 5. Ethiopians frequently use

traditional and inefficient “three-stone fire stoves,” where stones are arranged as a tripod

around a fire for stabilizing a pot or other cooking device. The three-stone fire stove can

pose serious health risks, increase fuel consumption and cause deforestation in the long

term. There are several options for improved biomass-efficient stoves. Additionally,

alternatives like electric clean cooking technologies are available. However, Ethiopia's low

electrification rate and the high price of the electric cooking appliances will not be accessible

for rural communities in Ethiopia (Nega et al., 2021). Ethiopians need to identify affordable

clean cooking and efficient technology that can drastically reduce fuel consumption

emissions and pollution and improve indoor air quality.

What did the innovator do?

Injera is a staple food for the majority of Ethiopia. The prevalence of this dish leads to

around 50% of the nation’s primary energy consumption, and it is therefore one of

Ethiopia's most hazardous and tiring traditional cooking practices (Adem et al., 2019). The

Mirt stove is an injera baking stove that is more fuel-efficient, affordable and cost-effective.

It was developed by Ethiopia's Ministry of Water and Energy in the mid-1990s in

collaboration with community members who supported the design and its use of local tools.

15 Ibid.

37

The stove’s features include uniform heat distribution throughout the baking pan, and

reduced heat loss through improved insulation. The innovation has an expansion chamber

and pot rest, four cylindrical enclosure sections that are 6 cm thick, and no chimney (Figure

9). It is now famous in both urban and rural areas of Ethiopia and can also be found in some

neighboring countries like Eritrea, primarily in households, commercial bakeries and

sometimes restaurants.

Figure 9: Mirt stove (Source: Dresen et al., 2014)

What are the benefits of the solution?

Compared with traditional fire stoves, the Mirt stove offers 50% wood fuel savings,

substantial reduction of smoke and minimal exposure to heat and fire. According to Beyene

et al. (2015), the Mirt stove reduces indoor air pollution, helps mitigate climate change and

improves livelihoods if they are used to replace traditional cooking methods. Additionally,

the improved efficiency of the stove reduces the time spent to collect firewood. There has

been a high acceptance rate in the communities in which the Ethiopian government has

distributed the stove. As such, it is considered one of the most marketable products, and it

is easy to assemble by users and lasts over four years.

What is next?

Due to the benefits stated above and the affordability of the innovation, the Mirt stove is

ready for deployment and sustainable scaling up in Ethiopia and in neighboring countries

which also consume injera dishes. The government of Ethiopia could increase the number

of distributions of the stoves or open the market for private public partnerships to allow

mass production and to ensure that community level markets are involved in mass

38

distribution activities. Scaling up such a stove will result in a lower national fuel consumption

rate for cooking the traditional injera dish.

6.1.3 Elements of ‘success’ of the Mirt stove in Ethiopia

● Impact: At all levels, the solution’s impact will revolve around improving energy

efficiency (including the efficient use of biomass resources at the household level),

as well as the development of renewable energy and the rational use of natural

resources. This will in turn have a positive social impact as health would improve with

reduced air pollution. Furthermore, in Ethiopia, the distribution of improved fuel

stoves will have a long-term impact on reducing poverty and enhancing the capacity

of the different development partners to implement energy development measures.

● Frugality: Mirt stoves can be manufactured with only locally available raw materials,

such as scoria (or river sand) and cement, which are widely available throughout the

country. The innovation is affordable, and it provides a cleaner energy method of

cooking. Through the distribution of Mirt stoves, the cost of cooking will be reduced

as the stoves use firewood more efficiently. In terms of design, the Mirt stove can be

used for both baking and cooking (GIZ-ECO, 2011).

● Simplicity and practicality: The Mirt stove is designed to be assembled by the user,

using clay or cement to ensure a stable cooking stove. Such materials are accessible

and affordable in the rural community of Ethiopia, and easy to put together. As

indicated above, the solution had a high acceptance rate in the community as a

practical way to bake and cook compared to traditional cooking stoves with less

cooking time (Asfaw, 2019).

● Scalability: The Mirt stove is ready for scale and distribution. With the assistance of

the GIZ Program, entrepreneurs have been encouraged to take advantage of such

solutions by establishing a quality assurance process (GIZ-ECO, 2011). In addition,

UNDP and GEF have already established the project Sustainable Rural Energy

Technologies which can also be a means for scaling up Mirt stoves in Ethiopia.

● Transferability and Adaptability: Injera as a dish and cultural food is a staple in

most of the neighboring countries, accounting for more than 50% of energy

consumption as highlighted above. Therefore, such similarities in context regarding

traditional cooking in Ethiopia and other countries can support the benefits of

transferring this solution. Furthermore, the materials used are also available in the

surrounding countries.

39

● Marketability, novelty and ingenuity: The Mirt stove is not a unique solution in

Ethiopia. After the Ministry of Water and Energy in Ethiopia started the distribution

and production of the Mirt stove, there were similar models developed. However,

the Mirt stove is ready to be introduced in the market in a sustainable manner, for

example, by ensuring raw materials are available for start-up production, setting

pilot production phases to assure quality standards are followed, and through public

stove administration in the community. The Ethiopian Rural Energy Development

and Promotion Center and German Technical Corporation (GTZ) have been

pioneering such marketing efforts with the Mirt stove in addition to distributing

leaflets and brochures on how to assemble and use it (EPA, 2004).

● Sustainability, reliability and stability: After several control cooking tests,

comparisons with open fires showed that about 50% of the fuel used was saved, and

the carbon monoxide levels in the kitchen were reduced by about 90% (GIZ-ECO,

2011). These benefits will have a direct impact on SDG 13 as they will reduce carbon

emissions that are typically released from traditional cooking methods. In addition,

this type of innovation will improve community stability and promote better health

and gender equality, since

it will decrease household air pollution which

disproportionately affects women and children, and it will allow women to spend less

time collecting firewood. Furthermore, the Mirt stoves have a lifespan of more than

5 years (GIZ-ECO, 2011).

6.2 Using grassroots solutions to solve COVID-19 movement restrictions in

Malaysia

6.2.1 Analysis of contextual factors related to energy access in Malaysia

Fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal, have historically been the main source for power

generation in Malaysia (US EIA, 2021). The country maintains a large proportion of

Southeast Asia's fossil fuel reserves. However, it is progressively reducing its reliance on

fossil fuels and developing its renewable energy market to decarbonize its energy-centric

economy and to add value across value chains, unlocking wide-ranging benefits for the

country (The Edge Malaysia, 2021). In 2018, Malaysia announced that it would include 20%

renewable energy in its generation mix by 2025, and in 2021, the government further

revised its renewable energy target to 31% by 2025 and 40% by 2035 (IHS Markit, 2021).

According to our UNDP Malaysia stakeholder interview (2022), the government is robustly

developing large-scale solar power stations to achieve these targets. There is minimal focus

on grassroots solutions within these plans, as they are not considered pivotal to energy

access in the context of Malaysia. Grassroots solutions serve as complements to existing

40

government energy policies. These off-grid grassroots energy solutions do not require

licenses for generation and distribution, making them more widespread at a community

level.

Statistics from the World Bank (2019) indicate that Malaysia has achieved close to 100%

electrification since 2015. In Peninsula Malaysia, this rating is due to well-established central
grid infrastructure and a relatively accessible population base.17 There are, however, still
pockets, particularly in highly inaccessible rural areas, that lack access to modern energy

infrastructure (Energy Watch, 2018). These areas include the states of Sabah and Sarawak,

where geography imposes significant barriers for widespread electricity distribution

infrastructure, while at the same time, offering tremendous electricity generation

possibilities. In remote regions where local utility service providers are not able to reach,

local innovators have come up with off-grid energy solutions to fit the communities’
needs.18 These solutions have proven the capacity for such initiatives to overcome
geographical barriers to energy access. Abundant solutions have already been mapped by

the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network, and several have received funding from the Global

Environment Facility Small Grants Program. The section below provides an analysis of one

of these innovative solutions.

6.2.2 Solving transportation restrictions with a solar-powered buggy innovation in

Malaysia

What is the problem?

Malaysia, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the country, began the implementation

of the movement control order (MCO) on 18 March 2020 (Yusof, 2021). The MCO measures

included restrictions on movement, assembly and international travel, as well as the closure

of businesses, industries, government agencies and educational institutions to prevent the

spread of COVID-19. It was initially scheduled for two weeks but was extended until 3 May.

Transport of goods from urban areas to villages was also disrupted during MCO, since

petrol was in short supply in rural areas. Families in need of supplies were not able to obtain
them in time.19

What did the innovator do?

In the past, Mr. Lasimbang had always envisioned a solar buggy that could transport

materials from village to village (Tan, 2020). The 43-year-old is the founder and director of

17 Interview with the UNDP Malaysia AccLab Team. April 19th, 2022.

19 Ibid.

41

CREATE Borneo, a social enterprise specializing in rural electrification. He is also a Senator

from Sabah in the Dewan Negara, the upper house of the Malaysian Parliament.

However, he and his team were usually busy with micro-hydroelectric projects in Sabah and

across the country and did not have time to implement the concept (Tan, 2020). As a result

of quarantine and the MCO, he and his team were unable to accomplish any projects, so

they decided to build a buggy entirely from scratch, utilizing leftover materials in the

workshop, from solar panels to steel tubing for the vehicle frame. Four solar batteries were

installed on the buggy. Each battery weighs nearly 80 kilograms and is connected to the

others. These batteries provide the buggy with 1,000 Ah of energy, enabling it to operate

without recharging for nearly three days.

What are the benefits of the solution?

The solar-powered buggy provides an affordable and usable transport system and power

source for rural villages that were previously heavily dependent on generators powered by

fuel. The buggy eliminates the need for villagers to travel to town to access fuel for their

generators and motorbikes, leading to savings in time and money.

The vehicle can also accommodate six passengers, including the driver (Tan, 2020).

Furthermore, in a rural agrarian setting, the buggy supports transportation of rice in larger

quantities. This is more practical for farmers, who will otherwise use motorbikes to

transport rice sacks during harvest season, incurring several trips that consume

considerable fuel.

What is next?

Moving forward, the innovator has seen the potential of a solar-powered buggy to reduce
the cost of transportation, as well as enable communities to travel short distances. 20
Likewise, it can also be used for the transportation of goods or materials, as well as to launch

an e-commerce project with the same community. A solution such as this arose out of

necessity during a time of pandemic but can also be utilized for business continuity

purposes.

6.2.3 Elements of ‘success’ of the solar-powered buggy in Malaysia

This example illustrates how local communities possess the ideas and capacities to resolve

local existential energy challenges. When government policies did not reach the

community, grassroots innovations emerged and were implemented successfully among

20 Ibid.

42

the local people, despite having constraints and lack of resources.21 Elements of success in
this initiative are outlined below.

● Impact: The solar-powered buggy solution developed by individuals in the

community is people-centered, resolving the needs of community members and

taking into account aspects of their behavior, culture and social norms. Intended or

not, the solution has created positive long-term effects and can help to fill a social

gap.

● Frugality: Grassroots innovations such as the solar-powered buggy required little

raw material and other resources. For the solar-powered buggy, the frame was built

using leftover materials and the steering system was salvaged from an old car, which

was modified later to fit the much shorter buggy frame (Tan, 2020). This element is

viewed as beneficial as the solutions can be produced at minimal cost using material

which would have otherwise been discarded.

● Simplicity and practicality: Upon performing a series of test runs around the

compound and village, the buggy reached a top speed of just 25 kilometers per hour

(Tan, 2020). Besides, no speed records are likely to be set by the buggy in the near

future. However, it can still accommodate up to six passengers, including the driver.

In a rural agrarian setting such as paddy fields, it is still useful to transport harvested

rice in larger loads. Being pragmatic emphasizes the broader practical and

performative dimension of the solution. The down-to-earth nature of the solution

acts as a key component towards success.

● Scalability and transferability: Using the framework provided by Baru et al. (2020),

discussed in section 3, the solution has the potential to “scale-out” and “scale-deep.”

That is, there is potential to increase the number of persons or entities impacted by

this solution and opportunities for replication and dissemination to other

communities, for example, to communities in the states of Sabah and Sarawak with

similar geographical constraints. There is also a potential for a more long-term effect

to change norms and social behaviors of community members. Instead of relying on

fuel-powered motorbikes or vehicles, the bottom-up solution can help the

community to adopt new practices to transport goods and materials in a cleaner and

cost-effective manner, thus promoting behavioral change.

● Reliability and stability: The buggy has batteries capable of holding a 1000 Ah

charge, which is much larger than a typical buggy (Tan, 2020). In case of rain or in

case of no sun, because the inverter is bi-directional, the user can also plug it into a

21 Ibid.

43

power source and the inverter will convert house AC to DC to store in the batteries,

so it is still possible to drive the buggy in various weather conditions.

● Sustainability: The innovator is well-connected to the local environment, and he

used material and resources that are readily available and frugal, thus contributing

to the sustainability of the solution.

44

Section 7: Conclusions and Recommendations for Channeling the

Grassroots Innovation Ecosystem Toward Achieving UNDP’s

Moonshot Energy Goal

The Grassroots Thinking Approach, a novel framework conceptualized by the SIPA Workshop

team, was used to understand the transformative potential of grassroots innovation. This

approach was derived by using information gathered from the literature review,

complemented by country energy analyses, expert interviews and assessment of the

Accelerator Labs’ solutions mapping platform.

This approach emphasizes the importance of understanding the contextual and

systemic factors (Pillar 1) that innovators must navigate to ideate and implement their

solutions. These solutions emerge due to community needs and have certain

characteristics and requirements that make them appropriate (Pillar 2) within the

contexts where they emerge and locations of deployment. By combining the contextual and

innovation characteristics (Pillar 1 and 2), we assessed the potential of grassroots

solutions in improving access in energy deprived settings (Pillar 3). We characterized

this “potential” as elements of “success” that can transform innovations into full-fledged

solutions.

7.1 The Grassroots Thinking Approach is a normative instrument that can be

used across various organizations to support achievement of the SDGs

This approach is a normative framework that could support the UN and other public, private

and international development entities. Grassroots solutions could foster learning and thus

contribute to achieving the SDGs and the UNDP moonshot goal. Specifically, this approach

supports data collection and analysis, thus resulting in knowledge building and learning

that could facilitate the direction of funds by investors and donors, and scaling or

transferability of solutions to contexts based on their appropriateness. Our analysis yielded

insights that are interlaced across the entire publication. Some noteworthy inferences

based on these insights include:

Pillar 1 - Government action, agile funding support, collaboration and information

sharing are key to developing an enabling environment that is conducive for

grassroots energy innovation.

Critical inferences derived from this pillar include:

●

the importance of cross-community collaboration and information access in

informing technology choices;

45

●

●

●

●

the role of local learning and sharing operational structures in facilitating behavior

change, technological use and policy development;

the critical role of government in establishing bottom-up development paradigms in

national energy strategies that are based on extensive consultation, effective

communication and backed with extensive funding and support;

the role of development partners in developing long-term, agile and innovative

funding mechanisms in line with grassroots innovators’ incentives and risk profile;

and

the power of technology to facilitate new entrants that can provide low-cost funding

in the grassroots innovation funding ecosystem.

Pillar 2 - Characteristics of an innovation and its location of deployment determine its

appropriateness.

Critical inferences derived from this pillar include:

● The goal, purpose and function of an innovation depends on the needs of the

community, the problem that the specific innovator is trying to solve, and the

community context.

● Recognizing how well the innovation fits in the location of deployment could support

efforts to scale, adapt and transfer the solution.

● Cultural norms and attitudes can affect the effectiveness of a solution and usage.

● Understanding and documenting the characteristics of the developed solution can

provide knowledge on the financial and human requirements needed for

deployment.

Pillar 3 - The potential for success depends on alignment between enabling contexts,

needs of stakeholders and innovation characteristics.

Specifically, ‘success’ is considered to be related to novelty/ingenuity, frugality, simplicity,

marketability, scalability, transferability, reliability/stability, sustainability and overall

capacity for achieving societal and other benefits. Identified elements of success should be

measurable to support monitoring and evaluation. Critical inferences derived from this

pillar include:

● Low-cost solutions that allow for productive uses of energy, especially in times of

crisis, score high on impact which matters for success.

46

● The use of locally available resources is essential for minimizing costs, accomplishing

frugality, simplicity and improving user experience and reach.

● By attending to unmet energy needs, grassroots innovators can increase the

marketability of their innovations, while also diversifying income with auxiliary

products.

● Development actors should leverage their extensive reach in disseminating

learnings from both successful and unsuccessful grassroots innovation attempts to

influence policy and scaling.

● Donors should embrace more agile smaller-scale spending on frugal solutions that

have proved impactful and adaptable.

7.2 Adopting the Grassroots Thinking Approach can facilitate expansion of

knowledge and increased access to information

Finally, we present three main recommendations that are hinged on knowledge

management of grassroots innovation through solutions mapping, information and

resource sharing for innovators and an overall mainstreaming of grassroots innovations

thinking within the development ecosystem.

1. The Accelerator Labs Network, as well as other relevant international and community

organizations, should optimize its solutions mapping process to support the Grassroots

Thinking Approach as presented in the report.

The Accelerator Labs Network’s solutions mapping platform can serve as a knowledge

management tool for localized, contextual knowledge about the lived experiences of

grassroots innovators, including their behavioral norms and motivations and the type of

innovations that are appropriate to their needs and location. With the right mix of data

collected and analysis, this tool can be ethically extracted to answer questions on what

solutions work, why and how to support their scaling.

Hence, an overall recommendation is to enhance the data collection process, utilizing the

outlined contextual factors and innovation characteristics that lead to ‘success’. Improving

solutions mapping requires enhanced on-the-ground operations and would facilitate more

robust learning and sharing.

The current information collected on the platform provides sparse data points offering

limited opportunities for data mining and prediction. Currently, solutions mappers are

expected to venture into the field, looking for interesting, intriguing and inspiring solutions

and asking questions about the solutions, unmet needs and the target audience. Their

findings are recorded and later uploaded onto a platform when time permits. It is not clear

47

which indicators solutions mappers are basing their questioning on. As such, the

information on the platform is limited to descriptive statistics on what the solution is, and it

is not consistent. There is limited information on what materials were used in solutions, why

the innovations exist, and the scale of reach. Indications of impact such as energy efficiency

are sparse, and information on the stability of provisions and marketability are absent. In

rare instances, we were able to glean some of this information from the description of the

solution. However, there needs to be clear and uniformed headings and markers to identify

and delineate them, to allow for comparison and analysis. The only clearly identifiable

markers within most solutions are the SDG tags.

Efforts can be made to make the process more methodical or scientific. Therefore, the

process for future mapping should account for the location characteristics and elements of

success discussed in this report. Drawing on the characteristics and elements for success,

the Labs can devise metrics to assess these criteria so that data collection points are

standardized and informed by questions to be answered for policy makers.

The process can work by having solution mapping questions that serve as proxies to the

data points on impact, frugality, simplicity, scalability and sustainability. For example, a

proxy for impact can be how the solution improves energy access or what difference it

makes to access rates in a particular community. Frugality can be assessed based on the

costs of the solution including its production costs, in comparison to other mainstream

provisions, the type of materials (new products vs. waste products) and how readily

accessible and available these products are. Simplicity can be assessed based on who can

use the solution and the extent of know-how or literacy required for deployment.

Transferability could be how strongly embedded the solution is in the local context which

will affect aspects that can be easily appropriated to other situations.

Once these proxies are established for the different contexts, it will feed into questioning

and facilitate more robust data-gathering on what materials are being used in existing

solutions, product mix, affordability, scaling mechanism and financial requirements.

It is worth noting that these proxies might differ in different contexts and not all success

criteria will apply to all solutions. This new process might also require repeated visits and/or

consistent engagement with the innovators to validate such solutions and how they are

performing with respect to the identified indicators. However, with the availability of this

information, mappers can begin to observe trends and patterns of unmet needs, novelty of

solutions, occurrence of certain types of solutions and characteristics of the deployment

locations, which can facilitate data mining and predictions on where and how stakeholders

and partners can intervene.

48

This new scientific approach could be supported through the development of a Toolkit or

Guidance Document for solutions mappers in the Accelerator Labs or other institutions to

refer to when gathering data.

A further project for the Accelerator Labs might be to better define and establish these

success indicators for different contexts to be able to standardize data collection to answer

tough policy questions on the role of grassroots innovation. This process will lend more

quantitative validity to the current analysis the team has proposed.

Another potential improvement is on how data is collected. The current process collects

data manually to be uploaded at a later period, which could create attrition between what

is mapped and uploaded due to collector fatigue. One improvement is to include a real-time

data collection feature on the current platform that could be run through a low-cost mobile

application. Ethiopia’s Accelerator Lab is already in the process of designing such a tool to
support data gathering.22 The adoption of mobile technology will reduce the time-burden
of recording information as solution mappers would be able to directly input innovation

characteristics in a consistent format while in the field. GIS features can also be included in

this real time data collection process to automatically collect information on the location of

deployment such as geography, proximity to grids, population density, etc., which can be

validated following field trips. Peer vetting and validation of solutions is also encouraged to

ascertain the extent of clarity of information conveyed through documentation.

If the Accelerator Labs adopt this evidence-based approach, it would be recognized as a

knowledge hub for information on grassroots innovation. Over time, as the data is

harnessed and analyzed, UNDP can become a “thought leader” in the space of grassroots

innovations. Enhanced data collection and documentation would lead to the creation of a

valuable resource for governments, development agencies, private and non-profit

organizational actors, and grassroots innovators in their own pursuit of the UN SDGs.

2. Local Labs should create a directory of resources that are available for innovators in

order to increase the access to information.

UNDP has a strong presence in many countries, so this extensive in-country presence

complemented by the ethnographic capacity within the Accelerator Labs can be leveraged

to scan for local information and resources that would be useful to grassroots innovators.

This information can be aggregated into a directory that can serve as a go-to information

resource for grassroots innovators in countries where the Labs are active.

22 Interview with UNDP Ethiopia Team Members. April 15th, 2022.

49

This directory of resources can be hosted either offline and/or online and include the

following information as a starting point:

● A global list of innovators that they can reach out to for co-creation, information,

expertise, experience sharing and talent,

● A list of grants, national competitions and other sources of funding they could

access. (The availability of these competitions in Ethiopia and recognition created the

impetus for the innovator of the solar powered bicycle to persist),

● A list of local NGOs, and other organizations that provide capacity building support

such as training programs, business management classes or financial literacy

resources,

● A list of materials that can be used as alternative fuels in clean cooking or heating,

and

● A list of local private sector providers of low-cost energy technology that can assist

innovators in appropriating and/or navigating technology choice.

Other categories of resources can be added incrementally as they become available. This

broad array of resources readily accessible to innovators through the Accelerator Labs can

provide innovators with the needed tools and resources to positively navigate existing

systemic barriers and de-risk failure, increasing their chances of survival, scale and

sustainability.

3. Mainstreaming ‘Grassroots Thinking’ should be prioritized across UN Agencies.

The United Nations’ strong convening power in bringing stakeholders together to dialogue

and influence development paradigms can play a critical role in raising the legitimacy of

grassroots

innovations within the global development mix. It can start through

mainstreaming the Grassroots Thinking Approach across UN agencies and other

development stakeholders. This thinking emphasizes more bottom-up programming that

takes into account the ingenuity that people close to a problem possess and the systems

they have to navigate to sustain ideation. The approach also supports the inclusion and

mainstreaming of these actors and their solutions within programming.

This can be done through:

● Education outreach programs across UN agencies to provide information on this

frontier approach to addressing development challenges. Colleagues from the GEF

Small Grants Programme can share information with other funding units on how

they are including local community members in selecting grant recipients and what

50

is working in this process in improving community project-based funding. The

Accelerator Labs can also organize knowledge sharing sessions on grassroots

innovations with other agencies. The recent spike in familiarity and skills around

virtual meeting technology can greatly enhance this capacity.

● Development of grassroots innovation education programs to augment the

existing support provided to grassroots innovators and facilitate cross-pollination of

ideas within the grassroots ecosystem. UNICEF or UNESCO can host workshops of

do it yourself (DIY) solutions within communities to learn more on uptake and

transferability of solutions.

Imagine facilitating a workshop that takes the cheapest possible solution, for

example, a type of cookstove, and teaches many people from a community how to

build it with the innovator being part of the instruction. In parallel, they are also

taught about different resources that can be used in other types of DIY solutions. At

the end of the workshop, members have improved access to energy directly. The

value of such a program goes beyond the access to the solution but also improves

community agency, equips them with the skills of ideating to solve local problems

and creates the foundation for more grassroots innovation.

● Procurement and programming processes could emphasize inclusion of

grassroots and home-grown solutions. For example, UNHCR could fund

grassroots innovations as a form of humanitarian assistance and purchase them in

the establishment of camps.

WFP could purchase clean cooking solutions from grassroots innovators to distribute

as a form of in-kind assistance and include a category for grassroots innovations

within the WFP Accelerator.

These are some of the ways to support existing solutions to scale. By finding opportunities

for grassroots innovations to be included within existing programming and creating new

programs for grassroots innovations, this bottom-up approach, as differentiated from

earlier models ‘imposing’ potential solutions, can be cemented as a fundamental tool to aid

the development efforts of communities as well as the wider ecosystem of actors in the

space. The learning and experiences from these auxiliary opportunities must be fed into the

solutions mapping platform and the opportunity should also be included in the resource

directory. This concerted mainstreaming effort will further raise the legitimacy of these

solutions leading to national and sub-national governments recognizing and appreciating

grassroots innovations where they have hitherto been unrecognized. As such, while this

document is centered around improving energy access, it is easy to see how this Grassroots

51

Thinking Approach can also be applied to any field of development that can benefit from the

empowerment of local communities.

Appendix 1: Overview of UNDP Priority Energy Deprived Countries

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Energy Hub has identified 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia that have the

most significant gaps in access to electricity and clean cooking. The country overview table below attempts to present a contextual overview

of these 19 countries. A list of key metrics and descriptive indicators are used to support this analysis. Specifically, the indicators related to

the following thematic areas have been included: access, consumption and electricity generation mix. Indicators relating to access are

based on the SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) tracking efforts. The inclusion of the rural access rate is important as it is expected that

most grassroots innovation will stem from such environments. In terms of consumption, the demands for electricity and other e nergy

sources serve as critical expositions of country specific habits. The energy generation mix allows for a better understanding of the available

resources within each state.

An assessment of national energy policies was also completed to better understand the environment in which innovators must operate. To

that end, a focus was placed on rural and clean cooking policies, and an initial list of potential resources that grassroots innovators could
take advantage of was compiled.

Appendix 2: Recommended Questions to Support Learning on
Specific Grassroots Innovations

Characteristics of the Innovation

To develop knowledge of a specific innovation in energy, the following information should

be sought, and can form a basis for survey construction:

1. What is the overarching goal of innovation? What problem is innovation trying to

solve? What are the evaluation targets that the innovator is attempting to reach?

How close (or far) are they from the goal?

2. How should the innovation’s purpose be categorized: lighting/heating, clean

cooking, power for electronics/appliances, clean water access, health/medical,

industry, services, education and awareness raising, or other purpose?

3. What is the function of energy innovation: generate/use, conserve, augment, store,

distribute, convert waste to energy, or other functions?

4. What is the source of energy used to power the solution: solar, fossil fuels, wind,

hydro, mechanical, biomass, other thermal, other chemical, or other energy source?

5. What type of connection to grid does the innovation utilize: on-grid: connected to a

large-scale centralized energy system; mini-grid: connected to a small-scale

decentralized energy system; or stand-alone energy system.

6. What is the operational status of the solution: ideation, initial design, prototype

development and piloting, validation of design, small-scale deployment, or full-scale

deployment? How long has the solution been operational?

7. Is the innovation culturally specific or can it be generalized widely through different

social groupings?

Financial and Human Resources and Partnerships Needed to Support the

Innovation

Documenting the characteristics of the developed solution is necessary to determine the

requirements of the solution and its deployment. The questions below could support

information gathering to determine the resources needed to ensure the success of the

innovation:

1. How much does it cost to manufacture, deploy, use and maintain the solution?

64

2. Where does funding for the solution come from? Is there a specific financing

mechanism associated with the innovation? Does the innovation have its own stream

of revenue?

3. How is the solution able to viably deliver outcomes? Are there any innovations in the

operating or financing of the business model?

4. What skills are needed to build and implement the solution? Is it a do-it-yourself

solution or does it require technical expertise? This would affect the individual

transferability, deployment and frugality of the innovation.

5. Is there an uptake cost, i.e., a cost for community members to purchase or subscribe

to the innovation such as a subscription tariff, installation cost, land requirement, or

other cost?

6. What is the role of partnerships in deploying the solution? Does the solution benefit

from (or require) partnerships with the government or other local or private actors?

What are the forms of collaboration that could support success, for example,

subsidies, land concessions, grants, technical assistance, etc.

Characteristics of the Location of Deployment

Questions that should be asked to understand how the specific grassroots innovation fits

into the context of the location of deployment are included below:

1. What is the site of deployment of the particular solution? The site of deployment is

usually the context where the innovation emerges and must be in alignment with

local needs, resources and socio-environmental contexts to prevent any form of

market resistance.

2. What type of community is the site of deployment: rural, sub-urban, urban, or other?

3. What is the population density of the site of deployment? Geographical dispersion

influences the diffusion of grassroots innovation as they usually spread through

word of mouth and social interactions. With high population density, the likelihood

of social interactions is greater which can lead to higher diffusion and adoption of

solutions.

4. What is the average income level of the target population? Users of grassroots

innovations often live in environments with limited cash availability. Hence the

innovation must be in line with their purchasing power, which makes affordability

65

one of its main appeals. Low-cost solutions in low-income settings could influence

acceptance positively.

5. What is the scale of reach of the solution: community, household or individual? The

scale of the reach depends on the magnitude of the problem or need being met.

Some of the solutions are a result of personal needs and will solve individual

problems, while others serve to address wider community specific problems.

6. What is the deployment rate or reach of the solution, i.e., how many people are

benefiting from the innovation? Uptake is a function of how the innovation aligns

with social frames such as customs, stereotypes and behaviors. Innovators can

experience difficulty in product acceptance by going against social norms.

7. What is the level of community participation in the solution? The level of community

participation is influenced by how well the innovation is understood, the ease of use

and access to the solution. Consequently, community literacy can either hinder or

facilitate the diffusion and scale up through community use and input.

8. What existing networks, formal and informal, exist that can support the innovation?

Networks refer to the existence of support structures that the innovator can rely on.

These are often provided informally such as the innovators' social connections within

their community or through more formal relationships with non-governmental

agencies and community groups.

9. Does the country’s specific legal and regulatory framework facilitate or hinder the

deployment of the innovation? Are there additional legal considerations to be taken

into account at scale? - This depends on the extent to which grassroots innovations

are recognized. Some countries have agencies that map out and support grassroots

innovations while other grassroots

innovations are

largely unrecognized.

Standardization of grassroots innovation is required in countries where they are

recognized and in critical sectors like energy. Their regulation and standardization

can also garner affiliations and facilitate uptake.
