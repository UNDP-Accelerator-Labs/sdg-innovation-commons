- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Will produce methanol as a cooking fuel for low and medium income households as a substitute to charcoal, firewood, LPG. income will be generated through methanol sales of at least 40 cents per litre and a cooking stove specifically made for methanol use. Will create distribution and selling points in these area for easy access to the fuel and stoves. Unlike charcoal, fire and LPG, methanol has less emissions of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide making the environment safe for the potential customers.

> Technical Feasibility

Before feeding the 100 TPD MSW a simple system of processing MSW into refuse derived fuels suitable for the gasifier is needed. This system consist of grinding, mixing and compacting of MSW to produce bales (fuel blocks). The MSW bales are automatically batch-fed into the gasification and combustion zone. The MSW bales are exposed to primary air from the underneath, a partial combustion of MSW takes place at substoichiometric conditions generating a burned-out ash in the bottom zone. The gasification rate is controlled by the injection of primary air through nozzles at the bottom of the gasifier and the temperature of the bottom zone is kept at 800–900 ◦C in order to ensure the bottom ash remains solid and does not melt. Syngas is generated from the primary chamber is then fed to the secondary combustion chamber mixing with a secondary air for final combustion. Additional fuel may be supplied in this unit again to maintain a high combustion temperature of not less than 2.5 seconds to reduce the formation of Nitrogen Oxides. Syngas then undergoes series of compressions and filtrations to produce methanol.

> Anticipated Social Impact

it will help in the reduction of  deforestation as methanol that will be produced will be used as fuel for cooking replacing charcoal and in turn reduce the emission of carbon in the atmosphere.
