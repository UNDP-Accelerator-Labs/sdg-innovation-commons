## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

This pilot test shows, once again, how an innovative grassroots solution that works has components that can be replicated in other places. This is the main result of the second experience of the Con Vos Network. Both in Concepción del Uruguay and in Fray Mamerto Esquiú, it was adopted by stores and used by neighbors.
Innovative territorial solutions arise from people's creativity in a context of need and are a source of learning when it comes to addressing their needs.
On the other hand, people take ownership of these solutions and creatively reinvent them, giving them new uses.
These solutions are also an effective tool to amplify public policies that seek to address these problems, as in this case, they expanded the scale of several digital procedures from existing government levels.
In summary, Con Vos Fray proved to be effective in favoring decentralization, saving on traveling time and distance, facilitating digital inclusion, and strengthening community markets.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

One of the main problems was the short time spam we had to implement the project since we got the funds by the end of July 2023 and we had to unfold the whole action before December. We quickly put together a team with outstanding project and fieldwork directors. Having a limited number of nearby stores in the chosen city was also challenging. Therefore, for recruitment purposes, a reduced number of eligible stores -those having computers and internet access- were considered. We managed to overcome this limitation and were able to recruit 31 stores as expected. Certainly, the main challenge was to gather the information to conduct the ex post evaluation of the three questions we aimed at testing: If Con Vos Fray help to

• Promote digital inclusion, which means that more and more people can do online tasks.

• Reduce the time and costs that neighbors need to carry out their tasks and errands.

• Reduce the in-person demand for services in public offices, including ANSES.

• Raise the relevance of nearby stores by training shopkeepers and encouraging their support to neighbors.

• Promote community markets by increasing purchases in nearby stores.

To that end, store owners filled a form with basic users’ information for each procedure completed: age, address, gender, etc. Since we found it difficult to gather this information in the previous edition of the experience, we implemented a cash-for-data scheme to pay for each completed form. Regardless of this scheme, there were many forms with inaccurate or incomplete information. One of the main challenges was to validate the users’ address. This information was crucial to know how much distance each user saved (or not) doing procedures in a Network store instead of doing them in person. When conducting the analyses, we found out that the users’ address information was missing since the directions included were sometimes unclear or refer only to streets intersections, with no street numbers. To solve this issue, we unfold a strategy for gathering the geographic coordinates of users’ address, including latitude and longitude, to calculate distance. We used the addresses of housing, stores and state offices from Google Maps and transferred them to coordinates via Google Sheets. Using the three coordinates columns, we performed a distance calculation from Stata. We calculated the distance between housing and office coordinates, and the distance between housing and store coordinates, and subtracted the two distances to get the net kilometer savings; this allowed us to assess if the solution resulted in distance savings for Network users.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These data allowed us to gather information about motivations and reasons for using this service With all this information, we could estimate the impact of the pilot test on digital inclusion, decentralization of procedures and distance saved by users. In addition, we estimated the impact of the Network in community markets by estimating the number of sales and customers earned by the Network stores. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Our learning questions were: Smart cities improve the quality of life for their inhabitants by integrating technologies into their daily lives. This pilot was a test as well as a second experience of scaling this solution that grants people easy access to a digital environment near their homes, saving time and money.

The pilot test was co-created along with the municipality where it was implemented. We met on a regular basis to establish the goals of the initiative and the different tasks that needed to be undertaken to achieve them. Crowdsourcing was used to collect data on the people who approach the stores to run online errands. The store owners provided this information, and we used a cash-for-data scheme in reward for their effort. This information allows us to estimate the reason why neighbors approach the stores: whether it was related with the lack of access to the proper devices and/or knowledge to run errands by themselves. Moreover, the forms filled by the store owners or employees provided us with valuable information on the time, distance, and money they saved going to the Con Vos Network stores, along with information about other demographic variables.
## Partners

Argentine Undersecretariat of Administrative Innovation of the Chief of the National Cabinet of Ministers and local government officials of Fray Mamerto Esquiú, in the province of Catamarca, Argentina. These were new partners for us although our CO works with different government areas as well as local governments.,. They became our special allies for collecting information and networking. They also helped us deploy the experiments in different communities.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

This topic is a top priority for the UNDP. This pilot project can be implemented in different schemes, some of them at a very low cost, and its power is facilitating the adoption of digital tools. It is about digital inclusion, potentially, digital literacy. All this makes it easy to be adopted by local governments as the two experiences of growth, the two previous pilot tests by which we scaled this solution, showed (one in 2021 and the present one). Plus, it called the attention of the Undersecretariat of Administrative Innovation of the Chief of the National Cabinet of Ministers which took ownership of the solution.

This is a simple solution that addresses different problems at once. It is about saving money and time by going digital with mandatory tasks and errands that originally were completed in person in places either far or poorly connected, or both.It is about gender parity since care responsibilities prevent people to access different services that are now online and would be feasible for them. It is about digital inclusion because more people will go online with different things, and it is also about fostering nearby markets. The solution method is a micro adjustment to the general system. It triggers a big change that can solve the wider problem of digitalization, its consequences, and the gaps of the lack thereof. Plus, it helps build new relationships with the territory, the locals, the nearby city and the virtualization of many aspects of people’s lives.
