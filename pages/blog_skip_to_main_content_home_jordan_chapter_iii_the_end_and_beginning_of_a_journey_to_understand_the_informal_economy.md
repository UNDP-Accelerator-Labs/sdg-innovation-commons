CHAPTER III: THE END (AND BEGINNING) OF A JOURNEY TO UNDERSTAND THE INFORMAL ECONOMY IN JORDAN
(Part of UNDP Jordan Blog Series: Exploring the Informal Economy in East Amman )
After about 9 months of researching and exploring the informal economy in Jordan through the Informal Economy Facility (IEF), we’re back to share some outcomes of this journey. You may recall the first chapter in this series about our framing and approach to destigmatizing and learning from the informal economy. In the second chapter we shared how we passed the mic to informal workers.
As part of the larger UNDP effort on the IEF, the Accelerator Lab designed and implemented the following:
Three workshops to understand the perspective of informal workers on the informal economy
Semi-structured interviews with the support of a quickly deployed research team
Discussion sessions with UNDP and practitioners from various sectors in Jordan to map stakeholders and power dynamics
Read the insights from the three aforementioned activities in the infographic below. These insights are a peek into the complex systems of informality.
Happy infographing! 😊
