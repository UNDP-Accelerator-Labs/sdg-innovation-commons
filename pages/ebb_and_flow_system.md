Description: In an ebb and flow system, plant pots are temporarily flooded with nutrient solution and then drained back into the reservoir.

The flow is caused by a pump connected to a timer that is activated several times a day. When it stops working, the solution flows back into the tank.  

Interesting feature: The nutrient solution can be used many times, as it only floods the pots for a specific time and then returns to the reservoir.
