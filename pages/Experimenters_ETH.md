# Ethiopia’s Innovative Nature-Based Solution for Striker Weed in Cereal Crop Production

### [[0:38]] All right, So please, if you can tell me your first, your full name, your title, and tell it say I agree\. I consent to this recording\.

### [[0:51]] Hi\. My name is Okalo\. I'm the head of experimentation for Ethiopia's axillary dial up and I consent to this video\.

### [[1:00]] Great\. OK, over to you\.

### [[1:09]] Thank you, Okelo\. So could you tell me about an R&D activity you'd like to share? How did it come about? Where did it start?

Yeah, I would like to share with you about our TOP's RNT work Oregon experiment on nature based solution for striker weed or weed weed which is also called Gandra in Ethiopia\. So it is a weed that is affecting cereal crops like sorghum and maize and this which weed has it has a has an impact on this cereal crops and it can reduce production and productivity of the cereal crops from 20% to 80%\. And this cereals are very common in the lowlands of Ethiopia\.

### [[2:18]] Thanks\. So I want to know what was the development issue that you were addressing? What did the situation look like?

Yeah, so we went to tackle the issue with the production and productivity of cereal crops\. Ethiopia is strongly working towards being a full a food, a food sufficient sufficient country as government and development partners are investing a lot on this space and I believe our work can contribute to this work that's already started by several stakeholders\.

### [[3:06]] The next question is who was involved in your journey? What was their role and how did you assure the advice stuck on their perspective were considering and how did you how did their input shape the R&D journey?

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
Yeah, so the major partner on this journey is Ethiopia's Biotechnology Institute\. It's an agency under the Ministry of Innovation and Technologies\. It's a mandated organization to do research and development work on on on biotech related area\. In addition, we have also a toothpick project itself a toothpick project experimented this innovative solutions in different countries, particularly in Kenya where they have already started some scale up work\. So we've invited our local partners, it's You Can Biotechnology Institute to learn from their Kenyan counterparts to develop their laboratory guidances frameworks so that they can adopt that technology to Ethiopia's context using this biotechnology, using Ethiopia, using actually products from Ethiopia\.

### [[4:36]] Thanks\. So can you tell me about the tools and method that you use to do this activity and what factor influenced you, your choice of tubes and metal?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
Yeah, so mainly we've, this is not kind of a very new technology, but it's all about adopting it and tailoring to all the Ethiopia's ecological system\. So we've started from partnership development\. So we brought on board a relevant national counterpart which was it is biotechnology institute and we had a consultation with, we also checked if it's in line with Ethiopia's policy on the nature based solution\. So in terms of specific tools we have used for example laboratory, we have developed and used laboratory protocols, we have conducted laboratory trails and we're currently conducting with our partner field experiments\. That's where we're doing some sort of mini scale up thing on on the field just before going out to scale to the nationwide work\.

### [[6:10]] OK, thanks\. So let's talk about impact\. What is the, what was the impact? What what was the outcome of your R&D journey? How did or will your work impact sustainable developments?

Yeah, as I've already mentioned to you, it's a work in progress is still we're currently on we're we're done with the laboratory trail or experiment work and we're on field experiment\. I'm very hopeful that the field experiment would be successful\. So if it would be successful and if we go to scale, it's a solution that can enhance production and productivity of the series that I've mentioned earlier\. Serial clubs like Maze and Sorghum wait as well\.

### [[7:03]] So for our learnings, what would you do differently if you have to start again?

I think for the scale up team, basically we have a national counterpart, it's a biotechnology institute, but I feel like we need a private sector partner for the scale up team\. So we're currently thinking to bring on board actually after the field experiment\. So it's like I think like it would have been better if we bring on board a private sector partner like from the beginning rather than starting like by the need of the experiment\.

### [[7:52]] OK, start talking about diffusion, but I want to ask you again, what strategies or approach did you employ to facilitate to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of your R&D outscore mainly partnering with government agency\.

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
So in my country Ethiopia, government has an intense presence on ground and government has a strong structure from village label to federal label\. So my or our local counterpart or local partner, it depend Biotechnology Institute is a mandated organization for such biotech technologies\. So we can, I believe we can leverage their mandate to push scale up of this innovative technology\. We are government structures, including the Ministry of Innovation Technologies, the Ministry of Agriculture and research organizations operating under the Ministry of Agriculture\.

### [[9:04]] OK, OK\. Thanks for your time and for your answer\. Thank you very much\.

Thank you so much\.

### [[9:19]] So let's talk about principle\. Can you elaborate on the principle that guided your R&D work\. Where were they important?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
Yeah\. So when start with the user or like start with the mandated organization with one of our first principles\. So it's like we cannot be successful without working with this important agency\. And the second thing is compliance with national policies and strategies\. So it's like before starting this partnership, we have to make sure that this is this biotechnology solution is in line with national policies and strategies\. As you may know, like you know, biotech solutions are sometimes sensitive politically and technically as well\.

### [[10:20]] OK\. And about skills, what skill we have need to effectively identify and understanding the challenge or miss that you that your R&D work aim to address many skills\.

[[principles:Time management and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[skills:Leveraging technologies]]
We have combined many skills actually the lab skills all the lab members were part of this experiment\. So like a pool of the skills and also combination of matrix, you know, from knowing or mapping the ecosystem, you know, mapping who are the important actors in the ecosystem like starting from the early works of the experiment to scale up of\. So we've combined several tactics and we've also deployed different skills, mainly from the lab team\. And it's like we're not an expert in everything\. So we have used skills and expertise at the European Biotechnology Institutes for works related to lab trails and experiments\.

### [[11:30]] Have you, Can I ask you one thing? Have you been able to embed in the Into UNDP country office with any success and how is that? How is that going along? Have you been influencing them? So it the labs are always saying we want to embed within the country offices, we want to influence how they do things\. So has that been happening that you've seen where the labs are are being embedded in the country office and the country office is taking some of the work that the labs have done and integrating it and using it?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Play do not preach]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
Yes, exactly\.Yeah, Yeah, actually it's like we've been experimenting embedment\. It's all all sorts\. Yeah, actually, yeah\. We've been experimenting embedment as country office levels actually level in different ways sometimes, sometimes from starting with sense making exercise with our projects and then programs and sometimes selling our experimented products and solutions to our projects\. So we have used different approach sometimes starting with our projects and programs from zero, initially from science making and sometimes pitching to them our experimented products\. For example, talking of this specific nature based solution, we have a big forestry initiative in our office\. So it's like one of our scale up plan is to kind of leverage this existing forestry project because it's within the scope of the set type of a solution is within the scope of a project and leverage our existing partnership, existing resources to kind of push a scale up or push our agenda to that project\.

### [[13:33]] Perfect\. Thank you\.

Thank you\.
