> Title of the innovation

PLEMDFED AGRI

> Brief description of the innovation

We are in the designing phase of an online platform to market and sell traditional indigenous Zambian foods. We will use this platform to aggregate the demand for traditional indigenous foods from retailers and match it to farmer supply. Whilst meeting the growing demand for healthy indigenous foods we are creating a ready market for small holder farmers and collectors. This platform will also be used to preserve and share Zambian food culture.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

In 2019 our company made an annual turnover of K 1 088 000 from selling over 20 tonnes of traditional Zambian foods to 4 leading retailers accross the country. There has been a constantly growing demand for healthy foods on the market and we want to invest in machinery and logistics to meet the market demand. We are in the design stage of an online platform to market and sell traditional indigenous Zambian foods with support from Standard Chartered Zambia and Bongohive. This platform will increase our customer base by over 100 %. The challenge prize will help us to acquire machinery such as Driers, vacuum Sealers and fillers to process and package indigenous foods that we offtake from farmers. We will invest in cold storage and transport. We are creating a high value chain around indigenous foods and creating opportunities for local farmers and collectors whilst promoting Zambian food culture .

> Technical Feasibility

We currently won a seed fund from the Standard Chartered Women in Tech program of $10 000 to invest in technology. We are in the building process of an online platform to buy and sell traditional indigenous foods. The app is set to be fully developed by December 2021. We are seeking funds to upscale our processing, storage and transport systems as we anticipate a 100% increase in sale after the launch of our app and website.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We are creating a ready market for local Zambian people who trade in indigenous Zambian foods. This will increase their income base and improve their livelihood. We are creating job opportunities for women and youth who work at our food processing plant.
