> Description of the solution

Mirafiori Sud is a neighborhood in the city of Turin that used to be a working middle-class area with a population of over 40.000 people. Thanks to European funds and a project called ProGlreg, the neighborhood has gone through a green renovation, where old abandoned industrial buildings and former railway lines have been turned into parks, green corridors, etc. The area has turned into a hub for start-ups and business innovation, with different nature-based solutions (NBS) that contribute to the urban regeneration of what once was an automotive industrial centre. Among NBSs, there are community-based urban farms and gardens, green walls and roofs, and pollinator biodiversity. The project ProGlreg is being implemented in different cities of Europe, and in the city of Ningbo, China, as well.
