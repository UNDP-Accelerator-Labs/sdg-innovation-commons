UNDP and Partners Launch Electric Mobility Skilling Programme

UNDP and Partners launch Electric Mobility Skilling Programme Empowering the Next Generation of Engineers
December 5, 2024

Students participate in the Electric Mobility Skilling Programme at the Makerere University Innovation Pod
Wanyana Selina Masembe, a second-year Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering student at Makerere University, is among the young women actively embracing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Growing up as the only girl in her family, her parents initially envisioned her as a medical doctor, considering her siblings were already engineers. However, her passion for engineering was sparked in high school during a career day project, where she and her friends successfully built an environmentally friendly electric mower.Bridging the Gender Gap in STEMIn Uganda, girls face significant challenges in pursuing STEM education. They experience low enrolment, poor performance, and high dropout rates. A 2014 report by the Ministry of Education and Sports revealed a worrying decline in the number of girls passing biology and mathematics examinations between 2009 and 2014. As a result, fewer women pursue careers in STEM, with women comprising less than a third of science researchers in the country.Despite government efforts, such as the 2018 Gender in Education Policy, disparities persist due to factors like gender bias among teachers, which impacts the learning environment and career aspirations of female students. To address this, Uganda is focusing on professional development programs to ensure teachers adopt gender-responsive and inclusive teaching practices, particularly in STEM subjects.

Electric Mobility Skilling Programme: A Pathway to InclusivityIn collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Makerere University Innovation Pod (UniPod), and Kiira Motors Corporation (KMC), an Electric Mobility Skilling Programme was introduced to equip students with cutting-edge skills in electric vehicle technologies.Selina was among the female students selected to join this programme, thanks to her demonstrated passion and aptitude in engineering. Despite efforts to encourage female participation, the programme saw a higher number of male applicants. To ensure gender balance, affirmative action was applied, resulting in the selection of 12 female and 13 male students.The programme goes beyond technical training by incorporating lessons on navigating workplace dynamics that may present challenges for women in engineering. This holistic approach aims to equip all participants with the tools needed to succeed in their careers.

State-of-the-Art Training FacilitiesThe UniPod is well-equipped with cutting-edge tools, including powertrain electric vehicle (EV) workbenches, batteries, and production machinery. This program not only maximizes the use of these resources but also builds the capacity of future engineers in specialized fields like renewable energy.Kiira Motors Corporation, a pioneer in sustainable mobility solutions, serves as the program’s industry partner. Renowned for its innovative approach to automotive engineering, KMC offers specialized training in electric vehicle technologies, engineering design, and other related fields.Curriculum HighlightsThe one-year skilling program aligns with global trends in sustainable transportation, emphasizing zero emissions and reduced reliance on fossil fuels. A gender-responsive component ensures that both male and female students are well-prepared to excel in their professional careers.Students gain hands-on experience in electric vehicle powertrain systems, including batteries, electric motors, controllers, and other accessories. The curriculum covers foundational concepts such as battery-powered electric motors and charging systems, including Level 1 (standard home outlets), Level 2 (240-volt outlets), and DC fast charging.

Kiira Motors Corporation: A Legacy of Innovation Established to drive value addition in Uganda’s budding automotive industry, KMC is a state enterprise dedicated to technology transfer, contract manufacturing, and supply chain localization. Its work aligns with Uganda’s Vision 2040, which aims to transform the nation into an upper-middle-income economy.KMC’s journey began in 2007, with Makerere University students and staff collaborating on the Vision 200, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle designed for the Indian market. Since then, KMC has produced several electric vehicles, including buses, and has installed charging infrastructure across the country. Notably, the company is among 13 African firms with a vehicle identification number system and employs a significant number of female engineers.Gender-Responsive STEM WorkplacesImplementing gender-responsive pedagogy in workplaces, particularly in STEM, is essential for addressing societal gender inequalities and ensuring no one is left behind. It remains to be seen how Selina and her colleagues will continue to navigate their engineering journeys, but programmes like this lay a strong foundation for their success.
