## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Vaccines, Access, and Misinformation 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Misinformation spread rapidly undermining good practices of self-care and the confidence in reliable sources of information and in public institutions. Mistrust in vaccines (fostered by misinformation) and problems in the access to vaccination centers from the low-income segment of the population discourage people from getting vaccinated.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

According to data from 2019, there is significant skepticism regarding vaccines among certain segments of the population. For instance, 12% of people without primary education believe vaccines are not effective. This figure accounts for only 4% of those with incomplete tertiary studies. According to the Vaccines confidence and Access index of the Bunge y Born Foundation, mistrust is more generalized within this segment of the population. In sum, we see that the long-lasting inequalities that hamper access to vaccines due to barriers such as distance or lack of time to go to health facilities are now met by a new trend of emerging mistrust in vaccines.   The 2020 trust index was 86.9 at the country level, which, although it remained high, decreased 7.2% compared to 2019.   As for the 2020 access index, its value was 39.5: 48% lower than the previous year. This is sustained in all the regions of the country and in the different educational levels, although mostly in those who have a lower level of education. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some questions were added this year to assess the influence of the current context. The results show that 35% of those surveyed indicated that the quarantine did not allow them to get vaccinated or to vaccinate the children in their families.   Regarding the vaccine against COVID-19, 72% answered that they would get it. Among those who said they would not, 43.1% argued that testing stages are still missing (it should be noted that the data was collected between October and December 2020).

Our main data source is the National Ministry of Health of Argentina: http://datos.salud.gob.ar/dataset Besides, with the collaboration of the Bunge y Born Foundation, we conducted some surveys and focal groups, with very interesting results about access and confidence in vaccines in Argentina: https://www.fundacionbyb.org/icav-confianza-y-acceso-a-vacunas https://www.ar.undp.org/content/argentina/es/home/library/poverty/AccesoConfianzaVacunas.html https://www.ar.undp.org/content/argentina/es/home/blog/2021/AccLabBlog7Eng.html  


Some examples of the communicational pieces used in focus groups:

While in Argentina there’s not a history of anti-vaccination sentiment, there has been a surge in hesitancy around the COVID-19 vaccine. The source of this hesitancy is rooted in misinformation, lack of knowledge about how vaccines work, and the feeling that the vaccine would not be properly tested for safety. Distrust about the effects of a COVID-19 vaccine does not extend to other vaccines. People get negative information about vaccines through acquaintances when they are suspicious of their effectiveness or afraid of their possible immediate side effects —such is the case with the flu vaccine or a (then potential) COVID-19 vaccine. Famous and showbiz people and comments on social media are other sources of negative information about vaccines. The main factors that ease vaccination is being near the health or vaccination center and free vaccines. For young people, being supported and followed up by family members stand out as easy. Adverse weather conditions on the vaccination day, having to go early to request an appointment and the lack of supplies were mentioned as possible complications.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We implemented a comprehensive strategy that involved a methodological triangulation between exploring, mapping, and testing.   When testing, we worked with the Bunge y Born Foundation to investigate vaccines and access. On the one hand, it focused on gathering and identifying misinformation; on the other hand, it identified the source of people’s mistrust in vaccines and the limitations on their access. The interviews and focus groups we conducted led to the discovery of insights to develop the communicational pieces that were tested in the design of the awareness campaign.   The reason why the Lab must work on this, and not other actors in UNDP, is that the work has already started. The Lab already knows the methodology and has already collaborated with the actors involved. But above all, what distinguishes the lab has to do with its experience, knowledge, and mindset about experimentation, because it is an essential part of its work cycle.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What situations make it easier to access to vaccines, particularly for left-behind groups? What opinions and attitudes influence people’s confidence in vaccines and affect their willingness to get vaccinated?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The context of the COVID-19 pandemic had effects on people’s views on vaccination, leaving portions of the population vulnerable to misinformation, which gave us the need to study these phenomena in depth. It also had effects on the population's keeping of the national vaccination calendar due to restrictions on circulation and avoidance of gatherings, particularly in hospitals and primary care facilities.    Our methods and tools let us innovate in data and knowledge creation by adopting a bottom-up approach and working collaboratively with other organizations to do something about this issue of misinformation and inaccessibility. We created with the Healthy Internet Project a browser extension for flagging misinformation on the Internet, and we trained volunteers to use it. With the Bunge y Born Foundation, we designed a workflow that includes in-depth interviews and focus groups to test key visual pieces. This enabled us to generate insights that are being used in an awareness campaign to foster compliance with the national vaccination calendar.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Addressing these new sources of data allows us to obtain rigorous information to scale solutions in a collaborative and inclusive way that involves contributions from diverse contexts. To be more specific, the interviews we conducted led to the discovery of insights to develop the communicational pieces that were also tested in the design of the awareness campaign.  
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Health professionals, decision makers, and the local population would benefit from our work on this challenge. However, that requires that we also work together and collaborate. The champion in our country, the one we should inform or collaborate with, is the Ministry of Health of Argentina, for example.
