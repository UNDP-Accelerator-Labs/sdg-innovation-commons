Dowè is a transit village between Labé and Mamou in Guinea, precisely located 56Km from Timbi Madina. The first building that strikes you at the start of the school year is indeed this mosque. In the normal functioning of mosques in Guinea, there are separate spaces dedicated to the prayer of men and women. Dest toilets and wells or taps intended for the taking of ablution (ritual washing of purification).  At the Dorè mosque, one thing very quickly sublimated me, the support erected to support the tap breaks the rule of applied art common to mosques. Here under the tap is a biline cemented to form a channel allowing the water to flow. Usually the water would be lost on the path in the earth as it moves forward.  Here the change brought is that at the end of the circuit formed by the two lines of cemented blocks there is a kind of rectangular basin which is definitely a water receptacle designed to allow the animals to drink. Yes goats, cattle and others find their accounts there. What a great initiative, to conserve water to serve as many people as possible, even if they are animals.
