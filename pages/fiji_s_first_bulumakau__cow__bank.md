Traditional obligations in Fiji are important but can costly, placing strain on family budgets. Friends and innovators Eleazor O'Connor and Ronetava Ronaivakulua have come up with an innovative business concept that combines modern market forces with traditional Fijian practices.&nbsp;

Fijians can invest in livestock from the Bulumakau (cow) Bank operated by Naisevu Organic Farm in Naitasiri. After purchasing a cow, investors are charged a small monthly fee to raise the cow until they require if for a magiti (traditional feast). For instance, if the investor wishes to sell the cow instead, the business will connect the owner with buyers, helping them invest in their future.
