## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

In recent years, Peru has become a key destination for over 1.5 million Venezuelan migrants seeking better opportunities for themselves and their families. Migrants face major barriers in employment, access to basic services, and social integration in Peru and other countries in the region.

As part as our FC4, we knew that digitalization could a pathway for formalization, but becoming digital requires both structured support from a recognized organization as well as informal support at home or within the community that can help with accessing digital tools, promote social cohesion and financial inclusion simultaneously.

Framing our challenge as a “cause”, and having a constructive/positive approach to develop new narratives of migration became a powerful source of insights. 



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If talent has no borders, if it is not constrained by geographical or cultural borders, then individuals from diverse regions will demonstrate exceptional abilities and achievements across various fields, irrespective of their location.



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Through a design process, we built four user profiles that reflect different archetypes of the migrant entrepreneur in Peru and then we involved allies that could provide knowledge and skills that could complement UNDP’s expertise. Therefore, UNDP Peru’s Poverty Reduction and Prosperity programme and the country office’s human mobility focal point - set out to find expert organizations in this topics that could become allies in this journey. Some of them were UN agencies or programmes, others were nonprofits that served the migrant community in Peru or academic partners, some were government agencies or even private financial sector businesses. 

> If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

- Civil Society
- Private Sector
- United Nations

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

Hypothesis proven: Talent has no borders.

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

CREANDO evolved from a vertical top-down individual learning approach to a horizontal bottom-up collective learning approach with a renewed value proposition that also re-focused the key pillars of the CO’s activities related to migration. As a result, we offered a meaningful experience that motivated our users to open up and transfer us a sense of “hope” and social movement. 

Framing our challenge as a “cause”, and having a constructive/positive approach to develop new narratives of migration, boosted our stakeholders and users’ participation. Every step of the journey became a powerful source of insights. 

We didn’t expect the benefits to be twofold: Participants in CREANDO could gain access to the most up to date business tools, relevant knowledge about options about financial services and network with local business associations and incubators; but at the same time all these partners  were sensitized to the barriers faced by migrant entrepreneurs on a daily basis.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Challenges encountered: 

Migrant and Peruvian entrepreneurs are extremely busy with their businesses and don’t keep usual office hours, so we couldn’t expect them to have enough time to sit for a three hour long session.
Virtual trainings are mostly taken on the go as they perform other business activities, and mostly on cell phones and not on laptops or desktops, so using Mural isn’t always easy and data issues limit using videos or even joining for the full session.
Networking with people is essential and hearing about other entrepreneurs’ successes and failures helps in uncertain times.
Entrepreneurs need specific and practical information that can be immediately applied regardless of their industry.
