## 

"Las Guardianas" are a group of women from the El Manglito neighborhood in the city of La Paz, who in recent years have managed to organize themselves through the Organization of Fishermen Rescuing the Ensenada (OPRE) to protect shellfish extraction concessions and lead the defense of the mangroves in the El Conchalito area. Through the fishermen's organization, they take advantage of different fish products in the area; however, their efforts are not limited to commercial benefits for them and their families. They, being part of this organization, had to do the surveillance on land. This is how they initially arrived, thinking about the fishing resources on which their families live. While there, they recognized the importance of the mangroves and the benefits they provide to the community, but in particular, the vital relationship that these areas have with the marine products they obtain from their work. As they got to know more about the mangroves, they became acquainted with more associations, authorities and people from academia, and recognized the value of the mangroves. Thus, they began to undertake actions to monitor and care for the wetlands, not only for the bivalves.
