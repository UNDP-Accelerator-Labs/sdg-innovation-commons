## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Growing number of women in STEM fields and helping them to advance throughout their careers.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that female students in STEM fields leave the field or get stuck in their careers at early stages.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

We have been working on this challenge from different perspectives for some time already. The reason we have chosen this challenge is the fact that women are underrepresented in STEM areas and this is a lost opportunity both for women and for the economy of the country. For example,  the brain drain that occurs in the country on a regular basis for the past years. Mainly IT specialists are leaving the country. Apart from all efforts that the government is putting to stop the process and grow the number of specialists within the country, we have realized that there is a potential to be revealed within the female target group that is shaded in STEM fields. We believe that females who want to become STEM specialists can become a great alternative solution for retaining specialists in the country. According to different research female specialists are less prone to relocate and start from scratch in other locations.

- Restructured Innovation Agency under Ministry of Digital Transformation and Transport with the special focus in their 5-years plan on girls in STEM
- Growing number of organizations working in this direction, opening of chapters of international organizations focusing on women in Tech.
- Growing number of donors interested to contribute to the topic


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our Lab's contribution upon till now was the fact that we managed to bring together three sides: private sector, government and civil society. We also turned to be a platform and area for the experiments for other small initiatives and organizations working in this direction. This balanced approached helped us to turn to the incubation for the various solutions. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are bringing more women into STEM fields to retain more talented STEM specialists in the country and to grow their number overall.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the best mechanisms to bring young females into STEM fields, retain them and ensure the progress?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are regularly interacting with ecosystem to sense the situation and to adapt our project accordingly. 
The mentorship leg of the project is a proof of concept approach.
We created "360 touch point plan"  using system thinking to ensure that elements of the project cover all gaps. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We work closely with industry to make sure that we are aware of all local interventions and solutions and the results.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are targeting private sector as they shape the labor market in Azerbaijan and their readiness to change is of critical importance.
Also we plan to collaborate with influencers through social media to attract younger generation.
