> Brief description about the identified local solution:

Due to the increasing demand of Oxygen bottles for COVID-19 cases, Mosul Space team started working on a device to generate oxygen using ambient air by a physical reaction. The device pressurizes the ambient air (which has 21% oxygen concentration) and then a chemical material (Zeolite) is used to remove other gases and increase oxygen percentage (up to 90%) and lastly store the resulted high Oxygen gas in a vessel to be used later. 
This device will help the health sector and the patients get access to oxygen with a low-cost portable device.
