## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Digital aides: Trying to bridge the digital divide through formal and informal digital support systems.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to understand the role that informal and formal digital support systems may play in bridging the digital divide with an emphasis on populations (i.e. women microentrepreneurs above 50 years of age, illiterate populations) that are being left behind in the new digital economy, causing the already existing inequalities (gender, socioeconomic status) to exacerbate.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

This action plan follows up on our previous work around designing a “basic digital basket” for microenterprises led by women. As we engaged in exploratory activities in the context of the RFF project “Digi-Chiquihuites” we started to realize many women wouldn’t participate in the project if they couldn’t bring a close relative or trusted person to be their “digital aide”. Participants were eager to benefit from using digital tools in their everyday lives and in their businesses, but they did not feel comfortable operating the devices and platforms themselves. The project even created a special learning path for “Digital Aides” as part of the capacity building component to learn more about their motivations/drivers to serve as digital aides, as well as their learning interests. The need for digital aides is caused by the accelerated adoption of digital tools in the global economy, which has created a “digital gap” that’s exacerbated if you add gender, socioeconomic status, and age to the mix. It is causing already precarious livelihood opportunities to be even more scarce because microenterprises who are not taking advantage of digital tools are less competitive.

While organizing project activities many participants would suggest including a family member/trusted digital aide for them to feel comfortable taking part in the project. (2) In late 2021, Bitcoin was introduced as a legal tender in El Salvador and the government backed Chivo Wallet was launched with a USD 30 sign up bonus. This led to many people who had never been exposed to digital financial products to download the wallet to access the bonus. In the case of the project participants, mostly microentrepreneurs, many of them downloaded and learned how to use the app to collect payments from users wanting to spend their bonus. A lot of people recurred to family members for setting up the app (informal digital aides) and the government launched a national campaign with promoters helping people set up their accounts in malls, public plazas, etc. (formal digital aides). One red flag was the number of public complaints of fraud carried out by these aides, specially, from illiterate and elder users. (3) COVID-19-related digital registration tools drove many people to use their mobile phones to register for government subsidies and vaccination with similar effects from the last section. (4) We also drew inspiration from a similar set of signals picked up by the Argentina Accelerator Lab: https://www1.undp.org/content/dam/argentina/Publications/AccLabArgentina/PNUDArgent-CoLab2022_ConvosNetwork_results.pdf

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

(1)   The RFF project implemented by El Salvador’s CO was designed with key elements of the Accelerator Lab’s methodology, presenting a unique opportunity to leverage project funds and political will (from UNDP and government counterparts) to embed experiments into programmatic activities. The AccLab has been involved since the early stages of project implementation by delegation of the CO’s RR and as part of 2022’s Frontier Challenge around Inclusive Digitization. Many initiatives from development agencies, NGOs and the government are aiming at accelerating the digital transformation of businesses of all sizes, but very few, if any, are testing the efficacy of their interventions. The evidence that the AccLab will produce will be applicable in several scenarios and contribute to the adaptation of existing interventions and the design of new ones which seek to optimize investments and even test new ideas based on current results. (2)   Opportunities for scale are also relevant. The AccLab will work with a new UNDP project to scale the learnings from this extended learning cycle around inclusive digitization of SMEs. Additionally, the Innovation Secretariat of El Salvador has requested the AccLab’s support in developing a proof of concept of decentralized digital aides for SMEs, which will draw from the results of this learning cycle.   (3)   DRA implementation: The AccLab is leading the implementation of a Nationwide Digital Readiness Assessment with the support of UNDP’s Chief Digital Office. The results of this assessment, the implementation of the RFF project and the follow-up activities linked to those two activities have opened a new thematic pipeline for El Salvador’s CO around digital inclusion, which the AccLab is leading.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

El Salvador's AccLab is testing digital service agents and digital kiosks offering "digital assistance" to microenterpreneurs to understand about their unique incentives to adopt digital behaviors.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has convulsed the economic and social dynamics, not only of Salvadorans, but of the entire world. The most affected sectors in this crisis have been commerce, hotels, restaurants and education. The former are a fundamental part of the country's tourism sector, and in this crisis the small businesses in the sector were the first to close their businesses and the last people to open them again. This shock, added to the digital gap that existed prior to the pandemic, particularly affects women in micro and small businesses in the tourism sector.   The Digi-Chiquihuites project will provide entrepreneurs within touristic parks a basket of digital services, made up of mobile devices, training in digital skills and internet connectivity, to safeguard livelihoods, strengthen social protection and improve the financial inclusion of women. Some project participants are eager to take part, but will not be able to do so unless accompanied by digital assistants designated by themselves (usually young family members), to support them in receiving the training and serve as a guide to facilitate access to digital services and products that benefit their businesses and their access to digital citizen services. Can business owners benefit from digital technologies indirectly through a digital aide?   However, not all beneficiaries of the project have a close family member or friend who acts as an assistant, and this is surely a constant for more population groups, so can other figures outside the close group serve as digital aides?   Moving beyond, the challenge of identifying cost-effective mechanisms with scalability potential to help reduce the digital divide leads us to experiment with asynchronous digital aids (video tutorials) and virtual training, which could be made available to the public on web portals, for instance. Are these types of impersonal resources capable of generating skills and, above all, trust in digital matters, particularly those related to financial services?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Quasi-Experiment design using a Difference-in-Difference models, to test the effectiveness of digital baskets and digital assistants to adopt digital attitudes, generate skills and trust in digital services. By using these types of controlled experiments, causality of digital baskets and the role of digital helpers in the outcomes will be determined, leaving confounding factors discarded and as such provides strong evidence for considering a scale-up.   Prototyping a digital promoter's model and a digital services kiosk as instruments for tackling the digital divide. This method will be key to explore in an iterative fashion how a successful public service looks like for tackling the digital divide before considering a large-scale implementation.   Phase-in Randomized Control Trial through VC Zoom to test the effectiveness of video tutorials and virtual training in developing trust and self-reported skills in financial digital services. Using a RCT will provide solid evidence about one of the most challenging topics in terms of digital inclusion (financial services) and their potential to scale-up these tools.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We expect that Smart Wi-Fi generated data can help us contrast what people say they would do and what they actually do, in terms of digital behaviors.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The results from these experiments will inform a proof of concept for a Decentralized SME support mechanism to be implemented by the Accelerator Lab, the Presidential Secretariat of Innovation, and the National Council for SMEs. The Secretariat of Innovation is the government champion for this initiative and has been actively working with the AccLab and UNDP in the implementation of the DRA, which has opened a very important window for collaboration in digital inclusion projects. If the proof of concept is well received, it can be scaled through our CO’s new project with the National Council for SMEs and the Korean Cooperation Agency (KOICA), in which the AccLab was involved designing. Additionally, insights from the digital promoters and kiosks models can potentially inform volunteerism projects that can be adopted by organizations like CONEXION.
