Innovator: Unelco Engie

UNELCO ENGIE is a Vanuatu utility company that is making biofuel out of coconuts as a means to help the country meet its sustainable energy goals. It has made a biodiesel mill and with the help of a loan from ANZ New Zealand, it plans to double the size of its solar and wind farms, while continuing to add electrical infrastructure across Efate.
