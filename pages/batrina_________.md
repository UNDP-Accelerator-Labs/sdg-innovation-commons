## Solution holder:  Rahaf Bdour

We create products influenced by people's stories and inspired by the Jordanian culture. Batrina is a Jordan-based brand that creates storytelling, well designed and affordable everyday products, inspired by the Jordanian culture, influenced by the people of Jordan and produced by local Jordanian craftsmen. Batrina was born from our strong belief of Jordans resources and stories that are not used or told yet that can be transformed into products that presents some of Jordan’s rich history and diverse present. The brand name was inspired from the word  (vetrine) vetrina or batrina in the indigenous Jordanian Arabic, which means a window of a store, in which goods are displayed in. The brand was launched in January 2019 to look at Jordan from a fresh perspective by hearing people stories show and turning them into products that has distinctive new designs to present Jordan as never before.
