[[ai_summary:Maria Gabriela Gonzalez, the Head of Exploration in ACLA El Salvador, led a recovery project called "Chiquitis" to support women working in the tourism sector during COVID-19. The project aimed to provide digital tools and training, known as "digital helpers," which allowed women to access information and resources more easily. Through ethnographic research, design thinking, and prototyping, the team developed two prototypes: an info booth and digital promoters. The project showed positive results, increasing participants' knowledge of digital tools, financial literacy, and attitudes toward technology.]]

# Exploring Digital Basket Innovations in El Salvador

### [[0:07]] Can we start by telling me your name and your position?

Yes, I'm Maria Gabriela Gonzalez\. I'm the Head of Exploration in the ACLA El Salvador, but I go by Gabby, so Gabby's fine\.

### [[0:22]] Gabby, could could you tell me about an R&D activity you would like to share?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:How might we]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
Yes\. So the project is called the Chiquitis\. That's a tough name, but Chiquita means basket and DG for the digital\. So this this was a recovery project from COVID\. And in this project we worked with women that had small businesses in the tourism sector in El Salvador\. And the digital basket, it had a smartphone, a SIM card with access to Internet with connectivity and an 8 week program\. So that was the project\. And it started like we followed the process of R&D\. We did some ethnographic research trying to understand the needs and that's how we came up with the basket\. But what I really love about this project is that when we were doing the project, we started, like women will ask, OK, I'll go to the to the training, but can I bring my daughter or can I bring my grandson or my niece? Because they are the ones that help me whenever I need something from my cell phone\. So that was like an aha moment\. And we figured out, well, this is something important because people, most people\. And then we, we think like, if you think about it, I'm my my dad\. My mom also asked me for help\. So we figured out these are what we called digital helpers\. So within the project, we tried to understand the benefits that these digital helpers could bring\. And we did some experiments and we prototype ways in which people who don't have a digital helper or even people who have a digital helper, but probably it's not as proficient and knowledgeable, can benefit from this\. So we did two prototypes\. One was like a info booth\. So people, the women would go to the booth to ask for help and the other one's digital promoters\. So the promoters would have like AT shirt name tag, they would go business to business\. And yeah, that that's the project\.  
So the Hichiguitas, it started just with the basket, but during the implementation of the project, we also had the opportunity to explore and test this other social dynamics that were very important for us\.

### [[3:03]] OK, thank you for that\. That's amazing\. What was the development issue that you're addressing?

OK, so this was a project in like for COVID recovery\. So it was we were working on the livelihoods of the women working in the tourism sector\. So it was access to to labor and having an, an income\. OK, let's go\.

### [[3:37]] Oh, OK\. How in terms of stakeholders, how can you give me a bit more on the stakeholders and how did their input shape the R&D?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Give the space to others to shine]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
Yes, so we worked with the Ministry of Tourism and then Salvador and, and this was very important because they told us we worked at a park at national parks, national sites\. I would say don't, don't think about like this big natural park, but like tourism sites\. So it was important and they allowed us, they allowed us to go to the field and to kind of understand the how the context was the necessities\. This was during the pandemic\. Is there no people? Is there just few people so we can do something\. So that was very, very important\. Also, we partnered with an NGO who works in digital and connectivity and issues\. So this was also very important because they helped us shape the curricula that we were gonna have\.

### [[4:55]] Awesome\. That sounds amazing\. What tools and methods did you use and why?

[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
[[tools:Prototyping]]
[[tools:How might we]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Well, I would say first qualitative research because this was very important for the creation of the original basket\. And then when we were having these observations and these conversations, like we were able to gather these insights, right, in order to define and prototype the digital helpers, I would say design thinking\. And I said quite a bit of research, design thinking and prototyping, of course, because we prototype the digital helpers and maybe, yeah, not maybe we did\. We used when we were having the prototypes, we used experimental and quasi experimental research methods in order to prove or to test the the digital helpers\.

### [[6:05]] Can you elaborate on the principles that guided your R&D work?

OK, I would say human centered\. So of course being able to listen and to observe and to know what was happening and then flexibility because within the project we discovered this and we very quickly were able to test and prototype and other things\.

### [[6:34]] Now let's if we go to the tactics, what what tactics and approaches did you use to engage stakeholders?

The tactics, that's always a tough one for me\. So I would say, well, I don't know if it's pretty much the same as the principle, but but being human centered, right\. So not thinking in the solution first or not thinking and what we want to do, but trying to understand people's real needs and wants and pains and gains\. And yeah, that's all I can think of\. I don't know what tactics\.

### [[7:22]] Oh, and now let, OK, if we go to the other one, the last one, what skills were needed to effectively identify and understand the challenges or needs for your R&D?

Yeah, so I would say empathy, right, to to be able to absorb these insights\. Also, being able to gather behavioral insights, like to understand why is it that women ask us to bring people with them? Does this happens often, right? I would say good communication as well to setting the expectations of the project, what we were able to do and what we were not going to do\. That was very important as well\.

### [[8:21]] But like reflecting, reflecting on the journey, what was the impact or the outcomes of your R&D journey?

[[principles:Trust]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
[[skills:Digital skills]]
So with the baskets, we have evidence that the baskets increased the participants positive attitudes toward the digitals\. They also increased their knowledge and their usage of digital tools for the bit for their businesses\. They also had an increased knowledge on digital finance, although we didn't have evidence that they would use more digital finance\. So that's like one thing that we need to keep working on, right\. So because we, we also figured out that this was a thing of trust, like we trust the money that we can see and, and touch\. So how can we increase the, the trust in the digital financial sector services? And then for the digital helpers, we learned that they do have a positive impact\. So people can increase or have the same results that I told you through a digital helper, but not as much if it's direct\. So if you have the training yourself, you would have like your indicators would go up and if you do it through a digital helpers, they would go up as well, but not in the same ratio\.

### [[10:02]] Now in terms of diffusion and capitalization, what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of your R&D outcome?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
OK, So the traditional I would say we had like an event at the end of the project, the women, they got like a diploma of participation\. We had blogs published about this, but what I would say that really worked on us were the project's results, because as we had positive results, the government itself started diffusing this, right? The the, the Minister of Tourism would always say the Hitchy Kiwite, even though it's a tough name, but she would always mention it\. So, so yeah, I would say that we were lucky enough to have good results and this and that they were like doing the diffusion themselves\.

### [[11:08]] Wow, that sounds really amazing\. I'm really inspired right now\. Thank you so much, Gabby, for your time and the insights and sharing everything\.

Thank you\.
