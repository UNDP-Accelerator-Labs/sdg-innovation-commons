Guidelines for Eliminating Violence Against Women January 10, 2023 As UNDP Türkiye, within the scope of the Social Innovation Challenge that we organized and in cooperation with Legal Design Turkey, we published a new set of brochures in order to improve the access of women survivors of violence to justice, empower them and help them receive critical information on legal aid.

Brochures titled "How do you seek your rights when you are subjected to violence?", "Roadmap to access to justice", "Health examination and seeking rights in cases of sexual assault", "Report violence against women, be a partner in the solution" provide information on the steps women can take when seeking their rights, the institutions and organizations where they can get help, the steps that should be followed by those who witness violence, the critical steps to be taken in cases of sexual assault and how to prepare a safety plan.
