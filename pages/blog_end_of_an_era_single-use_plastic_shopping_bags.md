"Making bags and other handicrafts is the only way I put food on the table for my kids. I come to the market every week to sell these bags." Make Dlamini, a handicraft vendor at Manzini Market.
Opportunities for businesswomenThe plastic ban in Eswatini presents a valuable opportunity for rural women and Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Many rural women have been crafting sustainable carrier bags from grass, and the ban is expected to boost demand for these eco-friendly alternatives, providing them with stable income and economic empowerment. MSMEs producing alternative shopping bags will also benefit from new market opportunities, promoting local businesses and fostering community sustainability and innovation.We visited the Manzini Market recently and saw how excited these women are about the upcoming ban. The ban presents them with opportunities to generate income from selling reusable shopping bags. We spoke to Make Dlamini, who produces reusable bags made from natural fibre, and she expressed her excitement about the upcoming opportunity."Making bags and other handicrafts is the only way I put food on the table for my kids," she said. "I come to the market every week to sell these bags".She further noted that, on average, she sells between three and ten bags per week depending on the period in the month, giving her an average income of E1,000.00 per month (USD 55) to provide for her family."I can make at least 50 bags per week, and with the upcoming ban, I am hoping for an increase in demand for our shopping bags, which could result in an income of E10,000.00 (USD 550)," she said.

Phatsa Sakho Nawe: Driving ChangeThe Phatsa Sakho Nawe campaign, implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs, EEA, and UNDP, highlighted retailers' support for sustainable practices. Major retailers like OK Foods, SPAR, Shoprite, Pick 'n Pay, and Boxer sell locally made sustainable shopping bags. The plastic ban can further strengthen this commitment, promoting sustainability in Eswatini's retail sector while supporting local MSMEs. Some retailers have already committed to stocking locally produced bags, including those made by rural women.The campaign successfully shifted consumer behaviour in Eswatini, making it possible for shoppers to go without free plastic bags. The campaign encouraged sustainable practices, such as refusing plastic bags and carrying items by hand, leading to widespread behavioural change. Shop assistants have observed an increase in shoppers bringing their own bags, although reminders are still necessary, as many still forget to bring them to the stores. Raising awareness will be crucial to sustaining these changes as the plastic ban approaches.

A Step Toward Environmental Global GoalsUNDP and EEA are excited about this ban, as it aligns with various global conventions and instruments, including the Draft Plastic Treaty. This treaty aims to address plastic pollution globally, and Eswatini's proactive measures contribute significantly to these global efforts. By banning single-use plastic shopping bags, Eswatini is not only protecting its environment but is also playing a vital role in the global fight against plastic pollution.Eswatini's ban on single-use plastic bags aligns with a global trend, following successful examples from countries like Kenya, Rwanda, and the European Union, which have reduced plastic waste, improved public health, and boosted local economies through sustainable alternatives. Eswatini can learn from these experiences to ensure the success of its ban. This move is a significant step toward sustainability, addressing waste management challenges, empowering rural women and MSMEs, and contributing to global environmental goals. Eswatini's actions set a powerful example for other nations, demonstrating that bold steps can lead to a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future.
