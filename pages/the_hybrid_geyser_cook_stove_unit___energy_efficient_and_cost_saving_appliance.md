> Brief description of the innovation

The Hybrid Geyser &amp; Cook Stove innovation (HGCS) is a domestic energy efficient appliance that optimizes heat generated from alternative renewable energy sources such as biogas from food waste; briquettes from charcoal; wood pellets from saw dust, other than using expensive electricity or LPG, to simultaneously heat up water during cooking periods, thus saving on time, heat energy, money, labour and heating materials. The HGCS combines both water heating &amp; cooking capabilities/applications with wider clientele base such as in homes, restaurants, boarding schools, hospitals, lodges, camps, prisons, rural communities welfare centres. In the chambers, excess heat energy is harnessed to heat up water in the geyser reservoir. Water can be heated to boiling point ideal for making instant food preparations or bathing or drinking. 
The HGCS innovation is unique from other stand units, because it combines many features and applications all in one unit thus saving on material cost. These heat energy resources are well processed to minimize pollution and suffocating the user. 

The other benefits of HGCS are: 
1. Saves the environment and deforestation, 
2. Can use up to 4 or more alternative energy sources 
3. Enable user to cook other meals quicker with pre-heated water
4. It is Cost effective and low maintenance
5. It minimizes the burden and hazards faced by women and girls when they walk long distances to fetch wood fuel 
6. It saves the lives of user from inhaling harmful fumes 
7. The end products from all energy sources are rich organic fertilizers

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

currently most boarding, lodge, prisons and markets depend on firewood and charcoal as main source of cooking/heating energy. this has led to widespread and rapid destruction of valuable forests. 

the HGCS unit are designed for both domestic and institution markets which include homes, boarding schools/colleges, restaurants, markets, lodges/hotels, prisons etc. the HGCS will enable the user to save energy cost, save the environment/deforestation, save on labour and time by most girls and women, improve on sanitation and recycling of biodegradable waste material. therefore, the HGCS innovation, will attempt to reverse these environmental and sanitation problems. The HGCS will improve on business/operations and delivery/ efficiency especially in markets where the units can be used to quicken food preparation and safe/clean drinking water, improved sanitation by promoting proper disposal and use of biodegradable food waste thereby contributing to a cleaner and safe environment.

with the challenge prize, more tailor-made units will be fabricated to meet the demands of any user, be it domestic, commercial or institution.

> Technical Feasibility

The HGCS is designed to address domestic, commercial and and institution cooking needs, energy consumption needs, environmental/sanitation care and protection needs... the unit is further designed to address specific user needs. 

I have since built several versions /prototypes, each unit having s modifications according to application and size.

normally, Cold water is piped into the geyser reservoir and is heated up via the heat chamber. heat radiating from the energy resource in the chamber is both transmitted  directly to the pot above and also via the chamber lining surfaces to heat up stored water in the geyser reservoir. Water can be heated to boiling point so that it can be used for drinking when cooled or instant food cooking or bathing.

> Anticipated Social Impact

1. improved health of especially girls and women who spend much of the time gathering firewood and cooking;
2. improved sanitation and pollution around homes/lodges/schools/markets due to usage of waste for generation of biogas fuel
3. reduced waterborne diseases because users will have access to boiled and cooled water to drink or bath
4. improved income expenditures as many users will save since they wont be buying other heating energy resources like charcoal or electricity
