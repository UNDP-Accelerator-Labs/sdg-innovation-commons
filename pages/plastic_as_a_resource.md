> Brief description of the innovation

It is more of a tried and tested method of producing second grade diesel fuel from plastic waste using the pyrolysis method. However, the same process can be used to generate electricity just like Singapore does it.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The low grade diesel fuel can be purified to match that as from petroleum which can be bought by the motorist around the country. Provided with the right equipment electricity generation using the pyrolysis method can provide an alternative solution to the supply of the service and having our own power grid this will allow for generation of income through the charging of a reasonable price to the customers that are connected.
Recycling is one of the ways in which we can try and reduce environmental degradation.

> Technical Feasibility

A lot of research has been done on the effectiveness and feasibility of these proposed methods to recycle plastic and with those written documentation and empirical evidence that exists the project can be a success.

> Anticipated Social Impact

With a running company, opportunities for jobs to the qualified individuals will be available and reducing the unemployment levels the country is faced with. As a plus, this company will be 90% owned by the government as for and my colleagues we are determined to bring sustainable development to our communities and country at large, one of our core values as a company is communism as to that effect it is fit for 90% of the company to be owned by government to help boost our GDP.
