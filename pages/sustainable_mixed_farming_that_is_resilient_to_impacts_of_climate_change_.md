> Title of the innovation

Sustainable mixed farming that is resilient to impacts of climate change.

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is linked to SDG 1 to end income poverty, SDG 2 to achieve food security and linked to SDG 13 in its overall approach. The innovation will focus on growing crops and small livestock which are resilient to the impact of climate change. The focus will be Cassava, Village maize, Millet, sorghum and goats. All these products are very popular on the market. All crops will be grown organically. 
My innovation will be approached in the following manner: Cassava will be planted in high mounds so that should there be flooding, the cassava tubers will remain largely intact and continue to produce cassava leaves. 
In times of drought, the high mound of the other crops will help to preserve moisture for sustained growth. The same approach will be used for the growing of the other crops but the mounds would be smaller. In times of drought, the high mound will help to preserve moisture for sustained growth. The same benefits and capitalizing on its shortage and popularity.
Innovation for the goats will be to monitor amounts and quality of diet to help boost their fertility. 
Partners for this project will be my elder sister and grandfather.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

All chosen product areas have a solid commercial market. Therefore I will have a ready market for my products.
There is a big demand for cassava leaves and tubers, the cassava products get easily sold on markets long before other vegetables. Village maize is currently on short supply on the market. The availability of companies that are promoting the production of cassava in out grower schemes indicates the viability of the product. The same goes for millet and sorghum. At house hold level millet and sorghum porridge have gained popularity. My plan is to enter into agreements with companies that buy cassava tubers, millet and sorghum even before planting to ensure outright sales. Cassava leaves will be sold in community markets.
Goat meat is very popular but in short supply and there is an open market for export. Value additions for millet, maize and sorghum are as feed for chickens, birds, production of local brews and nshima. 
Goats are a cheaper source of hides and skins as well as meat protein at community and is used as barter in some cases.

> Technical Feasibility

Cassava, sorghum and millet will be planted on 2 hectares of land each  with maize on one hectare. All crops will be rain fed. Chicken manure and compost will be used to fertilise.  Goats will be reared on a 4 hectare farm plot. There will be no goat sales in the first year as they begin to calve. From the  second year  no seed  inputs will be purchased as seeds will be secured from the harvests.
 
From October to November there will be land preparation entailing  hiring of  tractor, purchase of Cassava cuttings, 225X 30 kg  manure and 20 kg each  seeds for millet and sorghum. During the same period there will be construction of goat house, fencing land for goat security, selection of  goat breed and purchase of mature 1  male goat and 10 female goats and necessary veterinary medicines.
Cassava, Maize, millet and sorghum will be planted in December.   Thinning and weeding   of millet, sorghum and Maize will be done in January , February and March including further application of manure.
Millet harvesting will be from March to April,  Maize and sorghum from April to June and then packaging and sales of harvest  from June to August.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Sharing of successes, experiences and skills acquired  with other community members will lead to others adopting the innovations  leading to improvement in their production capacities thereby increasing income.
At household level, the innovation will lead to food security and availability of income both for immediate use and investment. It will give voice and opportunity for participation and decision making  in other economic ventures. As resources  grow , and from noted successes  the hectarage for different crops  will be increased and more goats bought.
Innovation is relevant to the current market as all chosen product areas are popular on the market.
