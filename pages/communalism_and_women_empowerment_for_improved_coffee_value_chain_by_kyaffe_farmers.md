Kyaffe Farmers’ Coffee is empowering women coffee farmers through fair trade coffee
Kyaffe Farmers Coffee is a Ugandan social business whose vision is dedicated to advancing the lives of female coffee farmers and their children through rural wealth creation and community transformation. Kyaffe is a Luganda word meaning "ours" which symbolizes communalism and working together as one. For the past three years we have been working relentlessly to empower and organize smallholders using the farmer ownership model and getting women increasingly more involved in our value chain.
