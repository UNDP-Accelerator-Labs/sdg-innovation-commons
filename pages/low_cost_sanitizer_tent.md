A sanitizer tent was built and it consists of pipping and mist sprayer system, LED lighting, pressurized liquid tank, solar panel and controller, and geomembrane walling. Materials used were materials found at the centre including scavenged parts from pile of junk (Obtainium) that was accumulated over time. This was especially useful during the Movement Control Order (MCO) when rural and remote communities are not able to travel outward to get materials for sanitization. However, standard guidelines from Ministry of Health needs to be followed to ensure it is safe to be used.
