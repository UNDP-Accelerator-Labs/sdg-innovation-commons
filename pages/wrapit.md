> Title of the innovation

WrapIt

> Brief description of the innovation

1)	WrapIt is an online platform providing digital Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) service to the general public. These services are currently being denied or restricted in many parts of the country due to ignorance, discrimination and privacy. WrapIt is combating the associated problems by firstly, providing an online platform where the legal age can access sexual and reproductive products and services at anytime and anywhere. Secondly, enabling the general public to purchase or access services anonymously to promote confidentiality. Thirdly, providing a diversity pool of services that can be accessed on the platform from providing self-help products to counselling services. Lastly, providing these combined services to anyone in the diaspora at a free and an affordable fee.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

2)	The platform will generate income through the products and service delivery. There revenue models include:
i.	PRODUCTS: WrapIt primary income will be generated through a markup module on sell sexual and reproductive health products which include condoms, sanitary pads, contraceptive pills, pregnancy tests and HIV self-test kits. 
ii.	DELIVERY: We will be providing delivery services to users that purchase these products of which the user will pay a specific and affordable price.  
iii.	DONATIONS: WrapIt will raise donations primarily through our "Sponsor organization" program. The program enables donors to finance WrapIt costs associated with supporting their mission.
iv.	PARTNER REVENUE: WrapIt will partner with organizations that advocate and provide Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights and the Ministry of Education. Our goal is to build relationships and point our users toward their services.
WrapIt is delivering its services to the youth, adolescents and general public of a legal age that are in need of these services.
The prize money will aid in acquiring a motor bike for smooth delivery, buy equipment (Computers and other peripherals), cover operational expense (internet, hosting, communication, rent and salaries) for the first year of operations. The funds will also help WrapIt cover Furthermore, the aid will facilitate penetration into our target market through branding, advertising and marketing.

> Technical Feasibility

4)	WrapIt is a web based platform that can be accessed by anyone with a smart phone. For convenience, WrapIt for users that would need this service on a regular basis, WrapIt is also providing a progressive application which the users can easily add to home screen and use. Users can pay for their purchase with mobile money and VISA.
The current prototype is a website and progressive application developed with WordPress a content management system (CMS). This system is integrated to a payment gateway (FlutterWave) and delivery system to facilitate orders.
We plan to implement WrapIt in a phased manner so as to track our progress as well as utilize our market response and risk management in line with our strategy.
i.	Phase One (in progress): Developing the website and progressive application and addition the primary products and services (delivery)
ii.	Phase Two:  Partnering with relevant organizations and local authority to facilitate our market reach.
iii.	Phase Three: Adding more services to the platform that will enhance our goal of providing an inclusive platform
iv.	Phase Four: Developing an Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) system that will enable a user without a smart phone to access these services.

> Anticipated Social Impact

3)	The health benefit to society for a program like WrapIt is highly substantial. Not only does it provide intangible benefits in the form of increased exposure to diversity of information access to Sexual and reproductive Health and Rights, but also to society in the form of economic benefit through job creation for the young people. Furthermore, by being a safe digital space to access SRHR services, we increasing the access to health care services which is primarily increasing the access to these products and services.
The niche in this proposal is very relevant to the current market as it explores an area in the market that has not been tapped into and is able to stand test time as it rides on numbers of young people who are currently the most sexually active group and are majority of the population. 
In an advent of protecting a girl child through the supply of sanitary pads, this platform will amplify the distribution of these products and services through a digital platform.
