## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

In order to have a green economic transition in Algeria, below are the top 5 key insights and recommendations we generated:  1. Encourage private sector investment in clean technology and strengthen public-private partnership  2. Creating a green entrepreneurial culture in the educational curriculum 3. Encourage funding of university-level research projects in the field of waste management, 4. Encourage the signature of agreements between the various actors in the ecosystem who work in the waste sector to support the green project leader.  5. Encourage the coordination between ministerial departments and other sectors to facilitate the implementation of projects in waste management

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The used data methods help to get :  1. A mapping of projects and enterprises in waste management and circular economy in Algeria. 2. Sorting with recommendations and learning approaches by the different environmental and entrepreneurial ecosystem elements to work on circular economy. 3. A mapping of potential ecosystem elements working on circular economy in Algeria.  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collective intelligence helped to get together the different elements of the ecosystem working on a circular economy to identify each one's role and get recommendations and actions from each sector to develop this field. In addition, solutions mapping through innovation challenges allowed us to have a mapping about the solutions that exist in circular economy and green entrepreneurship. Projects that through their differences supported us in identifying the themes of the panels and the conferences during the events.
