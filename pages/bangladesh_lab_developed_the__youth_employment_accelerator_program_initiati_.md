## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Bangladesh Lab developed the ‘Youth Employment Accelerator Program Initiative Bangladesh’ (YEAPI-B) with the purpose of designing a scalable online micro-credential scholarship program for Bangladeshi youth to rapidly learn new digital skills demanded by the local business process outsourcing (BPO) market and better prepare them for the 4th Industrial Revolution in Bangladesh. To understand if such a model would be effective, the Lab underwent in generating insights around the following learning questions by executing several standalone and extensive Learning Questions:   1.     Is an online micro-credential scholarship pathway an effective approach for rapid skilling of Bangladeshi youth in the BPO industry? 2.     Can an online micro credential scholarship pathway help create a large pool of skilled personnel to meet the demand of high-value digital skills by local BPO employers? 3.     Can online microcredential scholarship pathway increase female employment and gender inclusiveness in the local BPO industry? Insights Generated: 1.     The Lab’s investigation found that skills-based or competency-based hiring practices have experienced an uptake among local BPO employers in Bangladesh. We also found that online credentials have been mainstreamed with a more than 60 per cent of HR leaders believing that online credentials are generally of equal quality to those completed in-person which is a rise from lower percentages in from the past years. 2.     Lab’s exploration and sensemaking outcomes suggest the lack of human interactions is an issue affecting the effectiveness of online micro-credentials. Such online courses require participants to be highly motivated and self-disciplined and so the BPO industry is in favour of blended courses (including online and offline learning activities) for rapid skill development and so this must be considered when designing development interventions arounds micro-credentials. 3.     Accreditation of online courses would be useful for both the spread of quality education and skill development in Bangladesh and yet it hasn’t happened while India, Indonesia, and Malaysia have already accredited online courses. Such measures will require the expansion of robust IT infrastructure, especially in terms of good and stable internet speed in Bangladesh, to avoid the increasing of the digital divide created by the pandemic. 4.     To bolster the accreditation and ensure smooth operations of the online courses, the Lab believes an online education institute could be developed integrating both industry and academia (comprising all the universities), which would be responsible for the designing and conducting of the online courses and the online course marketplace in Bangladesh, paving the path for formalizing and scaling online micro-credential acceptance in Bangladesh. 5.     The Lab found out that students in Bangladesh have a tremendous interest in merging micro-credential courses with their existing academic curriculum since it will help them to have in-depth learning as well as develop skills based on employer’s demands. In addition, payment process of outbound foreign currency is complex and not feasible for majority of the students. This is a major setback for the lack of skill development initiative taken by the students during their academic life. Therefore, facilitating this process to ensure ease of access must be a top priority.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

YEAPI-B has a systemic-level vision and is initiative to rapidly skill Bangladeshi youth through online learning opportunities which is dependent on robust IT infrastructure, especially in rural Bangladesh to avoid increasing digital divide. Hence, to ensure that no one is left behind the Bangladesh Lab undertook the ‘e-Learning Pilot Project’ initiative in rural Bangladesh to extend and test learning opportunities to the most digitally underprivileged through tablet devices that had digital contents installed in them. Also, the lack of pro-business government and regulatory policies including the lack of accreditation of online courses and opportunities to merge online courses with traditional curriculums at different education levels are barriers for development interventions around micro-credentials.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We chose these types of data because of the Bangladesh Lab’s primary objective of unearthing new information, data, trends, patterns, and evidence around two themes. First, we needed to better understand from Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) leaders and employers what are the skills demand and skills gap in the industry in Bangladesh, and secondly understand the student perspective on micro-credentials.   Against the above backdrop, the Bangladesh Lab commissioned first a study to examine the skills requirement by BPO employers to offer high-end services to the global outsourcing marketplace and such an exploration required collection of data that was not available. We ultimately were able to identify the specific skills that were most demanded by 50 BPO employers in the market and the means through which employees can develop these skills through an extensive survey, participatory observation, direct interviews, and citizen data.     In addition, in Bangladesh, there is much confusion about micro-credentials. What do they understand about micro-credentials? What do potential students want from a micro-credential? What is the benefit of a micro-credential and what need are they fulfilling? What kinds of micro-credentials do students want to study? Presently, the student perspective is under explored. To address this current gap in understanding, UNDP Accelerator Lab chose to explore what students thought of micro-credentials. Our research objectives are twofold. Firstly, to explore prospective students’ behaviour, attitudes and perceptions towards micro-credentials. Secondly to validate the micro-credentials and the characteristics students find most appealing.   We conducted a study that included surveys (1000 students), direct interviews, and open data addressing current gaps in understanding of the following specific aspects: 1. How prepared are Bangladeshi university students for careers in the BPO and IT sector? 2. How are Bangladeshi youth adapting to new models of learning? 3. Behaviour, attitudes, and perceptions of potential students towards micro-credentials 4. Validate what Computer Science/Information Technology and related students find appealing about micro-credentials 5. Identify what topics Computer Science/Information Technology and related students are interested in studying as a micro-credential 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Co-creation: This method allows us to design methodologies for interventions under YEAPI-B. For example, we worked with 6 local universities on the design and structure of online micro-credential scholarships for students and better understand the challenges and opportunities under the scope. We co-created the ‘e-Learning Pilot Project’ with Volunteers Association for Bangladesh’ helping us to design and time our tests correctly, as we had to work together on identifying the best districts, best schools, and best subjects, among several other aspects when designing the pilot. Future Analysis: Online and blended learning at tertiary level is inevitable in Bangladesh. However, the nation still is at an early stage in the formulation of an e-learning policy and the accreditation of online courses, and so it was imperative for the Lab to prepare the necessary foundation for designing and testing scalable online micro-credential scholarship pathways which could potentially be a standard development intervention for large scale rapid skilling of youth in the future. Hackathons: This method was a key step for YEAPI-B because it allowed the Lab to organize an event specifically for girls, many of them from rural backgrounds, and give them an opportunity to collaborate online. All participants of the hackathon receive micro-credential scholarships and some scholarships on specific relevant subjects, allowing the Lab to assess the appetite and performance of youth, especially females for online learning and micro-credentials. Horizon Scanning: Although student engagement in online learning has been growing in Bangladesh, data on the trends around it remains scarce. Little is known about the level of engagement and choices being made by youth on the various micro-credential platforms. Undertaking horizon scanning approach, the Lab had set out to better understand Bangladeshi user demographics and learning behaviour as well as how Bangladeshi users varied in comparison to India, on one of the leading micro-credential providers – edX, and shared findings for the first time in this space. Sensemaking: The lab benefited from sensemaking tremendously through carrying out sector analysis on digital skills including domestic demand in Bangladesh and global market demand which allowed us to unpack the interconnected challenges of education, online learning, COVID-19 pandemic, digital divide, IT infrastructure, and the booming Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry of Bangladesh.  
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Lab joined hands with the Volunteers Association for Bangladesh (VAB) – a grassroots organization dedicated to rural education since 2000 - to pilot an innovative e-Learning project. It assisted rural and disadvantaged high school students from 9 schools across five districts - the majority being girls - on their preparation for the 2021 national secondary school certificate (SSC) examination through e-learning via tablets and digital contents.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

To better understand the potential and challenges of design, piloting, and subsequently scaling up an online micro-credential scholarship program, the Lab consulted with key stakeholders, especially progressive educational institutions, and potential youth participants of the YEAPI-B program to receive valuable feedback in shaping the program. The lab held consultation workshops with representatives from East West University (EWU), American International University-Bangladesh (AIUB), University of Asia Pacific (UAP), BRAC University, Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science & Technology University (HSTU), and Daffodil International University (DIU). 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The lab created partnerships with Women in Digital, UNLEASH Innovation Lab, Reaktor, University of Helsinki, and UltraHack for the UNDP Women’s Digital Innovation Hackathon. Women in Digital was responsible for marketing, promotion, and coordination of the hackathon. UNLEASH Innovation Lab provided resources on the innovation process and it served as the official format of the Hackathon. In addition, 10 UNLEASH Alumni connected virtually during the Hackathon period from Bangladesh, India, Denmark, Japan, USA, Germany, and Hong Kong over the hackathon days and served as facilitators to guide the teams through the innovation process and the hackathon activities. UltraHack provided the technical infrastructure for conducting the hackathon virtually.  Finally, Reaktor & University of Helsinki conducted workshops on their online ‘Elements of Artificial Intelligence’ course and made the course available at free-of-cost to 100 hackathon participants.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Apart from the 6 universities, all the partners of the Lab (Volunteers Association for Bangladesh, Women in Digital, UNLEASH Innovation Lab, UltraHack, Reaktor, University of Helsinki) were all new and non-traditional partners for UNDP. What made them special was that these organizations both national and international offered niche technology, knowledge, and expertise that could be merged with UNDP activities and were never explored earlier, perhaps since Lab for the first time introduced several innovative activities which created the space for their contribution.
