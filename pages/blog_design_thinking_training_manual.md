Design Thinking Training Manual
SEPTEMBER 28, 2021
In 2019, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Iraq, under the Innovation for Development Project, developed and launched the first Iraqi Training Manual specialized in Sustainable Development Goals, entrepreneurship, and Design Thinking Methodology in collaboration with a group of Iraqi youth volunteers, aiming to provide localized training materials for all Iraqis interested in innovation and entrepreneurship.
This manual is the result of research, testing, design, and a lot of trial and error. Since 2015, the project team has collected training tools and ideas from different sources, which have been enhanced to reflect a localized learning journey suitable for Iraqi youth and the Iraqi context. The manual was tested by 700 youth, 15 organizations and one university, before revision to its current form.
