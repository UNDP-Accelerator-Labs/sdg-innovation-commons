Space Technology Agency (STA) specializes in tracking air and water pollution in informal settlements. STA aims to advance the inclusive use of space science tools and services for socio-economic development. STA expects to impact Uganda through an improved sewerage management system and increased mechanisms that will reduce air and water pollution.   STA use modern technology to measure air and water quality against the index, their aerosol micro-robots measure with reference to the Air Quality Index (AQI) and Water Quality Index (WQI) respectively, purity or contamination details are then interpreted in their medium. STA’S solution will make use of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics to determine the quality index. Using the AI route, images of water and air will be fed into a model which extracts features to be utilized in figuring out the quality index of the air or water. The data set created will contain images from different geographical positions with their accompanying quality indices to be fed into STA’s model used in mobile devices and robotics. This solution makes use of robotics with different sensors and cameras. They may include: 1.     Camera 2.     Carbon monoxide sensor 3.     Carbon dioxide sensor 4.     A combined ph. and temperature sensor 5.     Turbidity sensor 6.     Lidar sensor These sensors are used to formulate a micro-robot or even included on a drone used for surveys and to gather necessary data for the air quality and water quality indices. They are made from 3D printed material and electronically recycled components, all of which can be obtained locally.   The solution provides data on change detection for Air and Water pollution in slums of Kampala and provides a warning system for contamination levels in the environment as a means to prevent health hazards caused by pollution.
