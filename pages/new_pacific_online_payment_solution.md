A new and innovative payment platform for Pacific businesses has been introduced by the trade and investment promotion agency, Pacific Trade Invest (PTI) Australia, Fiji Hotel and Tourism Association, Hotel Link and WHL. ‘Hotel Link Pay’ was created by Hotel Link and Kovena, offering accommodation providers a fully integrated solution to process online payments cost-effectively and efficiently via their Hotel Link Booking engine or Front Desk module. With tourism in the Pacific so badly impacted by the pandemic, the service helps enable operators of all sizes to accept payments from guests locally and internationally. This was previously a service that was hard for small and medium operators to access, and often extremely costly.
