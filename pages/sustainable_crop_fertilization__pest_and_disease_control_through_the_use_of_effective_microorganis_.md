> Title of the innovation

Sustainable crop fertilization, pest and disease control through the use of effective microorganisms (EM) while regenerating soils and reducing global warming

> Brief description of the innovation

EM provides fertilisation to crops, helps crops fight against pests disease, is able to control weeds and is able to sequestrate carbon thereby reducing global warming. EM can be made with local materials and can improve farmer yields and profits

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

EM is targeted for both commercial and small holder farmers. EM is cheaper than conventional pesticides and fertilizers and more effective in the long run. EM is organic and has a huge market potential.

> Technical Feasibility

EM is made in the lab and is very easy to make, EM comprises of specific microorganisms. Through establishment of a few demos once farmers see its effectiveness and how cheap it is, the product will sale itself.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The product will increase farmer yields, profits and food security at household level.

> Name of the Innovator

Joseph Mwitumwa

> Age

- 19-35
