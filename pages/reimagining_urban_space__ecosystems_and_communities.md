## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Reimagining urban space, ecosystems and communities
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to connect urban residents with nature and natural ecosystems, to increase demand for and practice of behaviours that support environmental sustainability, and to increase awareness and acceptance of nature-based solutions for inclusive and resilient cities.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Modern life increasingly disconnects human beings--especially urban dwellers--from nature. The disconnect undermines environmental sustainability in at least two ways: (1) people are not able to observe the impacts of their behaviours on the environment; and (2) people undervalue nature--even viewing it as a liability--and thus underinvest in environmental sustainability. With Malaysia's urban share of the population at 77% and growing, there is a need for effective ways to bridge this disconnect.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Malaysia has clear guidelines for the provision of green space in urban settings. However, the National Landscape Department reports that the total area of green space in 2012 is only 12% of the target. Furthermore, green space per person in Kuala Lumpur has shrunk from 13 square meters in 2010 to 8.5 square meters in 2014.


</div>


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Conversations with local community groups in KL and Penang have highlighted the discharge of untreated residential grey water into stormwater drains as a common practice that most residents don't realise harms rivers and aquatic life. In a recent post-COVID futures writing competition held by the Accelerator Lab and other partners, less than 10% of entries had environmental themes, despite the fact that COVID-19 resulted from human-nature interactions, that there were many news articles on environmental recovery during COVID-19 lockdowns, and that climate change is a critical environmental threat. Interest in and uptake of nature-based solutions (NBS) in Malaysia remains niche, even when these solutions and technically and economically feasible, reflecting a need for social innovation to mainstream NBS.


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab, with its network of contacts and array of tools, is uniquely positioned to do the all of the following: (1) map systems around behavioural change; (2) map systems around local government and civil society; (3) engage with civil society and citizen science groups; (4) interpret and synthesise large amounts of qualitative data; and (5) partner with local authorities and schools to engage youth. We have the flexibility to deploy these activities rapidly, unlike our CO counterparts. This is a critical challenge as moving the needle on urban residents' attitudes and behaviours toward environmental systems is necessary to effect societal change for sustainable cities.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are finding nature in the Anthropocene. An adventure into where you’d least expect it: unprotected areas, non-iconic landscapes, “mongrel" wildlife” and cosmopolitan spaces. Because sustainable and resilient futures will require both the tame and the wild, and all of us.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we mobilise communities to create behavioural changes that protect urban rivers and riverbanks.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. Behavioural insights: through interviews and observations, understanding the context in which persistent behavioural change toward the environment takes place. 2. Micro-narratives: documenting and telling key stories that provide a composite picture of a grassroot effort for place-making around the Klang River. 3. Data visualisation: working with a civil society group to explore new methods for helping visitors experience changes in a river site and the impacts that has on engagement and behaviour. 4. Positive deviance: understanding why a grassroots community group has achieved greater tangible impact than a RM 10 million, Government- sponsored effort to raise community groups. 5. Systems thinking: exploring the community and institutional ecosystem and the barriers and enablers these create for grassroot community efforts for environmental sustainability.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data enables us to capture and map a successful approach for creating and sustaining long-term, on-the-ground, citizen-led action for urban riverbank management, and the institutional ecosystem and interfaces that enable or hinder this effort. The data from interviews and ethnographic observation provide the rich and "thick" qualitative data required to understand the systems of interest.

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we improve awareness and acceptance of biodiversity as a nature-based solution for cities?

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. Ethnography: to provide insights into the behaviour of urban communities towards nature in the urban space. 2. Micro-narratives: through crowdsourced/self-reported input and observations, to understand how people perceive urban biodiversity. 3. Social media analysis: to understand how urban nature/biodiversity is communicated and portrayed via social media. 4. Citizen science: most biodiversity data and knowledge is collected and produced by professionals. In an attempt to "democratise" the discourse around urban ecology and biodiversity, we will address this learning question through a more bottom-up approach. 5. Crowdsourcing: mobilising local community to map biodiversity in their neighbourhoods, closing knowledge gaps on the occurrence and distribution of urban biodiversity.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is a lack of real-time, location-specific biodiversity data in urban areas. Existing biodiversity checklists and reports are often done at city level, which is insufficient for more "localised" planning and decision making. By tapping citizen-generated data and linking it to big/open data platforms, we can create an alternative data resource that is accessible to local communities and stakeholders for decision making and advocacy.

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. Behavioral insights: Observe how social pressure from statistics, using locla fmailiar characters in the digital form is able to change behaviour. 2. Pilots: Using local animation with local lnagugae and humour/narrative to communicate and advocate fro SDGs more effectively 3. Sensemaking: Understand and gather data on public's awareness on river conservation and interest in taking action, 4. Social Media Analysis: Investigate the reac and engagement rate of social media on SDG related issues using animation, 5. Social Network Analysis: Analyse which social media platform and format engages audience more effectively on SDG advocacy issues

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data above addresses how effectively local animation and alternative way of outreach increases engagement of the public on SDG advocacy. It helps CSOs and UNDP to understand how to increase participation and ownership, and shift behaviors among the public by using digital means eg. social media trends. It also provides insight into effectiveness of social pressure nudge in shifting behaviors and its long terms sustainability as compared to campaigns runned by incentives.

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. Behavioral Insights: Observe behavior of students on using web-based and gamified ecolife challenges and in sustaining behavior, 2. Co-creation: Co-create a web based eco-life challenge and gamification element, with contents contribution from teachers to motivate and engage students in leanring about low carbon city more effectively , 3. Data Visualisation: Visualising the impact and scale of their efforts in lowering carbon emission to sustain long term behavior and apply social pressure to all schools in exceling further in their efforts, 4. Gamification: Using leadersboards and games for students to learn different ways to lower carbon emission, 5. Prototyping: Prototyping a web-based eco-life challenge to increase participation of wider audience across the country without increase in cost and without relying on incentives.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data help address the gap in how students, teachers and parents can be better engaged in changing behaviors in lowering carbon emission in daily life. It also provides insight into effectiveness of social pressure nudge in shifting behaviors and its long terms sustainability as compared to campaigns runned by incentives.
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Learning Challenge 1: 1. Other civil society groups working on environmental action: document and disseminate a social innovation that has been successful in multiple, different sites, providing contextual insights that help others adopt and modify the approach. 2. Local and state governments: provide recommendations on policy and institutional infrastructure that can enable better interfaces with grassroot civil society groups that offer support for environmental sustainability initiatives. Learning Challenge 2: 1. The use of animation and the learning on effectiveness in engaging the public can be replicated for future advocacy campaigns for SDG and increase traffic to UNDP social media sites. The initiative can be replicated with private sectors, local councils and ministry, taking examples from the Ministry of Water and Environment who broadcasted the animation in several physical events for river conservation. The videos are also useful tool for CSO to engage their community in the future for education on river management. There is potential for Ministry of Education to adopt the contents as part of the river conservation module/syllabus to be used in schools. Learning Challenge 3: 1. The local councils and state governments are potential champions in using the website as a tool and platform to engage the public on environment related issues. IRDA who is our main partner will be further expanding the module to 4 more districts and 400 over schools and students. 2. CSOs to use the platform in sustaining interest in environment conservation with their stakeholders while accessing learning modules. Modules in the website can be further developed for targeted stakeholders, used as an open data platform to hold different groups accountable for environment actions. Learning Challenge 4: There is a lack of real-time, location-specific biodiversity data in urban areas. Existing biodiversity checklists and reports are often done at city level, which is insufficient for more "localised" planning and decision making. By tapping citizen-generated data and linking it to big/open data platforms, we can create an alternative data resource that is accessible to local communities and stakeholders for decision making and advocacy.
