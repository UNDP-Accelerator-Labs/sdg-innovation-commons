> Brief description of the innovation

Zambia has a wide demand for fresh vegetables, Chicken, fish and beef but with very little local production to satisfy the existing market and demand. This is evidenced through many imports carried out by existing chain stores placed across the country. In addition, the demand for fresh produce in local markets increases each year, as well as the demand from local restaurants and existing rural villages. Therefore, this project aims to supplement the existing market through crop cultivation, vegetable production, fish farming, goat and chicken rearing including but not limited to providing employment to the local villagers especially women and youths, to improve their livelihoods. The project further aims to extend free agricultural technical support to all surrounding local communities, to improve their agricultural know-how and capacity, transfer skills, including promotion and creation of financial savings groups that will encourage families to save in groups and use the funds to access farming inputs without waiting and relying on the government run programmes. Further, the project aims to empower local villages by setting up out grower schemes which the project can buy off at an agreed rate.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project being in a rural location, the methodology to be adopted by the project is a participatory approach. The project will endeavor to bring on board groups of women, youth and men to share knowledge and learn from the community members on new and old agricultural methods. The project will operate as a communal farm while retaining ownership and advancing employment opportunities to the locals in form of unskilled labor.

> Technical Feasibility

The under mentioned strategies will be carried out to achieve the set objectives:
-	Sourcing secured financial capital
-	Sinking of two boreholes for drip irrigation and fish ponds
-	Preparation of fishponds
-	Construction of village chicken pens
-	Training of community workers, women and youths including men
-	Registration with existing cooperatives and mapping of agricultural extension officers within the district
-	Purchase of viable certified seeds
-	Excavation of ponds and stocking of fish fingerings
-	Construction of Goat Pen and purchase of Livestock (goats)
-	Stocking of village Chickens
-	Provision of food for work to assist farm families in hunger periods and protect their seed and capital from being used for consumption
-	Supervision, monitoring, reporting and evaluation of project activities

> Anticipated Social Impact

Women produce 60% of the food crop requirements and handle the processing of food crops such as rice, cassava, groundnuts, maize, soya beans, pumpkins, beans, etc. In addition, women are responsible for food preparation, childcare and house management, which influence their time and energy for agricultural activities. Institutional involvement of women in the project area development, is minimal. There is need to integrate them into mainstream development, which requires an expansion of the scope for knowledge and skills. There are many areas where women development, programmed with varying objectives can be implemented such as in this project.
