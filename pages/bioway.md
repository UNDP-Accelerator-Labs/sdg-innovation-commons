BioWay is an application for mobile devices that supports the reinforcement of a strategy in the treatment, processing and management of these various wastes by connecting waste producers and collectors. Aiming for a virtuous circle, the person who wishes to discard the packaging of their products, committed to the environment, registers in the application so that they are considered part of the project and receive the information you need to contribute to good waste management. On the other hand, the app's collector-users  analyze the information received, to generate a strategy for collecting the waste that is generated by the registered people.
