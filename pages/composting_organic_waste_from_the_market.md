Its vision is an integrated approach and to expand the methodology in the country and region. The compost is produced with the advice and methodology of an experienced research institute Landmanagement (Austria). Once finished, the compost is sold to municipalities and other buyers. Courses and consultancy are also provided.&nbsp;
