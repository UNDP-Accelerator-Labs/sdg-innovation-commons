## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The learning intent is to gauge whether or not a collaborative and integrated service delivery to remote locations will help lift people out of poverty faster and/or improve standard of living—in comparison to offering one type of service (such as internet) at a time.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF people living in remote/ rural areas are given access to a range of services to address the digital divide, inequality and poverty THEN their standard of living would significantly improve.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Collaborating with other project teams to design an integrated service delivery approach. Partnering with government body and private sector (satellite internet and mobile service providers) to offer an integrated service delivery (3-5 services) to 3 remote/ rural areas in Fiji that do not have access to electricity/ internet/ mobile services. Monitor and evaluate over a year to measure improvements to standard of living/ quality of life.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Remote/ rural areas  - improvement in standard of living/ quality of life

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Collective intelligence Ethnographic research Interviews

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

NA

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

30% of Solution Mapper, Experimenter, and Explorer time respectively Technical expertise (Financial, digital, legal)

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Project working in areas of poverty alleviation, digitalization, equitable access to services, renewable energy, and reaching those furthest behind.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Governments who may be interested in replicating this experiment or upscaling

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

NA

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

NA

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Integrated/ collaborative approach can be replicated across any thematic area or SDGs.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?
