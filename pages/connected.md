> Description

CONECTADAS is a space where women entrepreneurs and businesswomen can network with each other and with business service providers, while also acquiring new knowledge and/or tools alongside two experts and the business life experiences of two women entrepreneurs or businesswomen in each city where this space is implemented.


The methodology begins with a Speed Networking session, consisting of short 2-minute meetings among all participants of the event to establish contact networks. This is followed by training sessions led by experts, two of which are 30 minutes each. Next, there are meetings with suppliers (reverse fair) where businesswomen and entrepreneurs have the opportunity to meet various business service providers and connect with them. The event also features presentations from role models, where the guests share a bit about their business lives, and finally, the event concludes with a networking lunch.
