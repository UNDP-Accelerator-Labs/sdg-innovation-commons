## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- NGOs and Academia are keen on collaborating with UNDP - Non-governmental entities are more responsive to the activities on the Accelerator lab and have faster responses. - Tapping into the network of these unusual partners is a great way to branch out and promote better community engagement.  - This engagement promotes a bottom-up approach that informs the AccLab of the local challenges and areas of interest. 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Depending on the type of engagement and partner proposed. When it came to promoting a multi-stakeholder partnership between the Ministry of Economy and Planning and a private company for the SDGs Innovative Solutions Platform, with the change of leadership the interest of the governmental entity changed.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

 In terms of our engagement with the NGO as knowledge partners in regards to the SDGs, we provided experts in the different local challenges shared which so far have been "Plastic Consumption" and "The Life Balance of Women in The Workforce". Plastic Consumption had been initiated by university students. UNDP has supported in guiding the students on which areas to tap into to provide transformative and sustainable impact. In our engagement in the development trips (which promotes local tourism), our partners made sure to use the right messaging to promote sustainability such as providing participants with a sustainable kit (glass bottles, wooden tooth brush etc..). The partners also asked the trip participants to document stories of locals and what they learned from them (inspired by the solutions mappers role).

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

To raise awareness on the local challenges and what locals are doing to tackle them as well as support where possible. Tapping into the network of the NGO supported in reaching individuals better as well as create a variety in audience. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with Balad alkhieer Endowment Foundation which aims to educate society about the concept of humanizing charitable work, social solidarity, entrepreneurship mindset boosting and creates communities that support in tackling local development challenges. As UNDP we are supporting in: Providing expertise and awareness on the Sustainable Development Goals; Exchange experience and knowledge support to enhance the Green Circle project; Providing subject matter experts, where needed, to support in enhancing proposed circles; Connecting to Green Circle’s network; Supporting the Development Trips.  The idea behind Green Circle is to raise awareness on developmental issues as well change the mindsets of communities whether it’s NPOs, Private sectors and others. The Green Circle’s level of engagement does not go deep into the technicalities of the solutions to the issue as they do not want to be similar to an incubator’s function. The purpose is to create a network (circles) of communities interested and passionate about a specific issue and cause to bring them together. This is organized through the online platform but consists of in person meetings and discussions on specific topics.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We been a part of several small activities to support universities in regards to raising awareness on the SDGs as well as promote multi-stakeholder engagement. This includes coordinating and moderating a session during UN Day on "on emerging and innovative approaches of partnerships with Academia"; presenting to Princess Noura University (PNU) Students on how to make a better impact on spreading awareness on the SDGs using different tools; in addition to supporting PNU students who have initiated the Green Circle on Plastic Consumption (which would potentially serve as a pilot in PNU and can be scaled to other universities in the future). 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We have gained the interest of Solutions by STC to create the SDGs Innovative Solutions Platform in KSA but have still not managed to secure a governmental partner to proceed. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We had initially gained interest from the Ministry of Economy and Planning to create the SDGs Innovative Solutions Platform in KSA which had been included in the 2022 Annual Work Plan but with the change in leadership the interest is gone. We are currently exploring another UNDP existing partner: the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

NGO: Balad alkhieer Endowment Foundation.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Partnering with a local NGO that similar to the AccLab's direction is broad in terms of areas to work on allowed us to branch out and promoted a bottom-up approach that informs the AccLab of the local challenges and areas of interest.
