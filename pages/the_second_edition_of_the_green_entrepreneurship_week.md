## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Second edition of the Green Entrepreneurship Week


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is the significant issue of waste management in Algeria, as the country has been struggling for many years to effectively manage its waste due to a lack of resources and infrastructure.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The waste generated in Algeria is a mixture of household, commercial, and industrial waste; it is estimated that the country produces approximately 10 million tons of waste annually. However, most of the waste is either burnt or disposed of in open dumpsites, causing severe environmental pollution and health risks. 

Waste management in Algeria has been a significant issue for many years, with the country struggling to effectively manage its waste due to a lack of resources and infrastructure. To address the waste management challenges, the government has implemented several initiatives. These include promoting recycling and composting, constructing sanitary landfills, and encouraging public awareness on waste management practices. However, more efforts are needed to establish Algeria's robust and sustainable waste management system. 

Green entrepreneurship Week brought together a multitude of actors, including the government, the private sector, civil society, and academia, to create momentum within the entrepreneurial and environmental ecosystem that will enable a transition to a green economy.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The accelerator lab has powerful methods that enable various stakeholders in the ecosystem to collaborate and work together toward promoting green entrepreneurship. With its innovative methods, the accelerator lab brings together entrepreneurs, investors, and other key players to identify new opportunities and develop practical solutions for addressing the challenges facing the environment. The lab brings together experts from diverse fields to share their knowledge, experiences, and best practices. By pooling their collective resources, the ecosystem generates new ideas and recommendations for starting new initiatives and projects that promote sustainable development. 

In addition to its collaborative approach, the accelerator lab offers a range of practical tools and resources to support the country office portfolio. These tools include innovation challenges, mapping tools, designing, and others. By leveraging these resources, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders develop their skills and knowledge, build new partnerships, and access the resources they need. 



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Green Entrepreneurship Week aimed to show its support for green entrepreneurship through information, raising awareness, and support for the mechanisms for creating income and wealth-generating green activities in the waste management sector.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

One of the learning questions of this event is the importance of cross-sector collaboration. Waste management is a complex issue that involves various stakeholders such as governments, businesses, non-profit organizations, and citizens. By working together, these different groups can leverage their strengths and resources to develop more effective waste management strategies and support green entrepreneurship.

Another potential learning outcome is the need for innovation and creativity in addressing waste management challenges. Traditional waste management methods may not be sufficient in addressing the growing problem of waste and pollution. Green entrepreneurship offers new opportunities for developing innovative solutions that can create value from waste materials while reducing environmental impact.

Participants in the event also learn about the importance of education and awareness-raising in promoting sustainable waste management practices. Educating citizens, businesses, and governments about the impact of waste on the environment and the benefits of green entrepreneurship, this help to a culture of sustainability that supports a transition to a more circular economy. 

Finally, the event may highlight the need for policy and regulatory support for sustainable waste management and green entrepreneurship. Governments can play a critical role in creating incentives for businesses and entrepreneurs to adopt more sustainable practices and provide funding for research and development of new technologies and innovations.
