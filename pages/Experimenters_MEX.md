# Mexico: Building Indigenous Rights Through Effective Consultation

### [[0:00]] Can you tell me your name, your title, and I consent to this video recording?

My name is Luis Cervantes, and I am the head of experimentation at the Accelerator Lab Mexico\. And your consent, I consent to be part of this interview process\.

### [[0:20]] Amazing\.

### [[0:29]] These are I think the most important R&D questions\. So R&D journey take it away\.

### [[0:44]] Could you tell me about a project in which you think the R&D activity was was important?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
Yes\. So I'd like to talk about a very innovative research projects that were undergoing in the accelerator lab in Mexico that has to do with achieving or its goal, it's to achieve indigenous rights to be consulted before projects are being built in their communities\. So Mexico has signed a treaty and that allows for indigenous communities to decide whether or not they want any project to be present in their in their territories\. And we found that this is not a right in, in Mexico that is that has been widely achieved\. And that there's there's still a gap in terms of, of the exercising of, of, of these rights\. There's notably a lot of communities that feel that way and tons of evidence from human rights organizations and human rights commissioner that in the process of consulting with Indigenous communities, there's a lot of things that could be done a lot better\.

### [[2:25]] So we're talking about Indigenous communities as the as the kind of population you're working with\. What would be the issue that? I mean, consultation is a process that you're trying to tackle with them or work with them at\. What are you trying to do with that consultation? What would be the issue that you're selling?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
So we believe that there's a lot of consultations being made that have been done in Mexico in the in the last decade that can be considered good practices\. Some other consultations that have been clearly not carried away respecting the the, the right of of communities\. And we would say that the issue that is nationwide, the capacity to do a consultation that is fully respectful of human rights is not yet achieved\. And we'd like to work towards the, the building of this national capacity so that the, it's fully integrated into the public sector strategy and, and, and, and institutions\.

### [[3:54]] So like, if I understand there's a basic element you're searching for, which is a human rights, which would be your, your position towards human rights as a way to achieve development\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Well being]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
OK\. So we first of all, we strongly believe that development must be achieved by means of institutions\. And so if institutions are lacking the capacity to respect human rights, they're lacking also the well that puts us in a, in a, in a scenario where development is not sustainable\. It's, it's, it's part of sustainability that everyone's voice is heard, everyone's concern is took into account\. And the in particular that the communities have this right, rightfully respected and that the government institutions have the like full capacity to, to, to do this\. What we see in practice, it's a wide spectrum of consultations that have been documented where the community has been able to decide in a freely manner either if they won the project or not\. And and in the cases where they've wanted, the good relations have been built with whatever entity or enterprise established there\. But also in the other side of the spectrum, we have like the worst practices imaginable being documented where where human rights were definitely not not respected, where there was ton of violence, manipulation, even going to the to the limits of of people losing their lives to the violence created in in these scenarios\. And that obviously also greatly affects the building of trust between communities and government institutions that we believe it's like a important link for sustainable development to be driven by governments\.

[[6:48]] So you've you've been mentioning like government institutions and also entities\. Are those actors part of your your practice?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[skills:Patnership]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
Yeah\. So in this in this research and in this issue, there's three main actors, right\. So it's the government who is whose responsibility is to conduct the consultation process\. It is a responsibility that that falls within government\. There's also the community that it's being consulted\. Whose territory in in which? In whose territory a project will will is suspected to pour\. Yeah\. In in whose territory the the project will be decided upon\. Falls\. And the third main actor is the entity that wishes to establish a project in the in the communities territory\. And in this case, it can be private or public institutions, right? It can be a private company trying to set up maybe an underground pipeline to transport gas\. It can be a mining company or an extract and any sort of like extractive\. It can be an energy company trying to establish solar panels or, or, or windmills, or it can even be the government itself trying to set up a dam or a hydroelectric power\. So those are like our three, the three main actors that take part in this in this process\. And of course, there's also a wide range of secondary actors that usually take part, take take part of this consultation processes such as external consultants, NGOs that work with communities and neighbouring communities who also get involved, etcetera\. You've, you've been mentioning 2 words like being the focus of your work, there's dialogue and there's consultation\.

[[9:01]] Will you see like different tools or you are using them like in the same way as a dialogue is the same as consultation\. How how would you frame those two and have you used any other tools during the process?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
No\. So, so the the main, the main objective of a consultation process is for it to be a space for dialogue where the aim and what's what the law is trying to protect and establish is that this dialogue happens in a way that it's free\. It's prior to the project and it's an informed process where the community can that gives the community enough elements to freely decide if whatever projects been trying to be established and resonates with their view of development\. And the success in this dialogue is if the community was able to make a decision where they felt well informed, free and approached prior to the project\. And violation of those three main main issues is what goes against the right of, of, of being consulted\. Obviously also like manipulation\. And anything that would go against these three principles is what would be considered an unrightful consultation\. And this is thought of as a way to give communities a place in the table and the opportunity to in, in the opportunity of, of, of rejecting a project, giving them also an opportunity to negotiate with the entities who's trying to establish operations in their, in their territory, The the necessary arrangements that they feel they they need in order to agree for that project to be present in their territory\.

[[11:35]] When we talk about Indigenous communities, it's already kind of not a common or probably a community that we have to take more care on how we approach them\. So what has been your ethics approach towards that that work with Indigenous communities?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
So our approach has been in terms of ethics to 1st make sure that Indigenous communities with within the country agree and participate in in the research and that whatever it is that we are finding is validated, validated by them\. So we are basically approaching this research not as a means of extracting conclusions of what we believe should be the way to do consultations, right, but to ask community what their views are and what they believe they need for\. For consultations to be seen as as rightful\. And then try to tackle it from a from their perspective, acting not as the main researchers, but as companions for communities to help them raise their concerns, to help them find the partners with whom to work with and also to establish whatever results metrics we we later device\.

[[13:32]] Are there other principles that you you have in mind that you were\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
So we have two main principles that we set up for in this in this research and innovation project 1 was to to make it participatory research and projects in, in the sense that we are accompanying communities to identify the issues they want to tackle and to validate it with them\. And the other is to approach it from a systemic perspective, try to not necessarily enlist on or only enlist issues, but to understand everything that is considered to be a problem as part of a larger structure, as part of a of of a system\. And trying to understand which are the touch points that are more important to tackle first, because they, they, they touch into the underlying structures of the system, but also what are the, the issues that we maybe need to attend because they're already becoming crisis\. So trying to find this balance between tackling causes and, and, and, and roots of problems, while also making sure that those problems that are already becoming crisis can be attended so that they, they, they, they, even if they're not necessarily root causes, but issues that are present and, and, and that people claim to be fixed\.

[[15:26\]\]\. When you are, when you inside the process, you're, you're checking out like different elements you were taking into account, like it's kind of a tactics and procedures you had in mind\. So which would you say the word, those essential tactics and how would you say they were used to engage with the communities and other stakeholders involved in the process?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
So in order to decide why going into this issue, we basically we're trying to find a balance between 3 aspects, relevance, opportunity and innovation\. And we believe this, this, this is a relevant issue because it's part of a of, of a country's commitment for, for human rights\. And we also believe that there is an opportunity\. There's a in recent years there's been rulings by the Supreme Court in Mexico\. There are gains that can be attributed to the work of of communities that for decades long they've been raising their voice that the right to be consulted was not rightfully respected\. And they are finally reaching the Supreme Court of Justice, who has been ruling against private companies who established in in indigenous territories, whose consultation has been proven to not have been carried away in a rightful manner\. And, and, and that for all a part of the relevance of the issue also presents a time, a timely opportunity\. This is the moment to to work in this issue because of of of of of of these High Court rulings in favour of community\. So we want to like getting into something that already has momentum and where we believe the UNDP can can be of great use\. And also in terms of innovation, we believe that the lab approach and bringing systemic thinking and participatory research can provide a road map to for the country to build this capacity in thinking it from a from a, from a systemic perspective\. And so with these three elements in mind, we began talking with this three main, main actors and asking them if, if, if it made sense, especially with communities\. And they, they, they greatly appreciated that the lab wanted to focus on, on these issues\. And they jumped in and ever since, and we've been working with five or six of the, of the main indigenous tribes in the country, aiming for more communities to, to, to jump in the boat as as this research becomes larger and larger during the process\.

[[18:49]] You're, you're mentioning like difference, the difference here that like approaches to the, to the work you're doing with communities\. And probably if you were in another entity of your environment, you're tackling in a different way\. But that means that probably from the lab you have some setup skills that you have to use and implemented during the project\. What would you say are some of those skills that are are more current or more important for the R&D practice of the lab?

[[principles:Empathy]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
I would say that something that stands out in in the team and in this research is the fact that we've approached it, having people at the centre and trying by all means to never lose sight of the creation of empathy\. In this sense, our first research activity was to conduct a series of in depth interviews with these three main actors\. And the, the focus of, of these interviews was to tap into the emotions, tap into the world views of, of people so that we could codify the elements that constitute the big problem, which is the, the rightful access to consultation in their own words\. And that has helped us this entangle a very complex and and, and, and, and very problematic issues in a series of more easy to relate problems that are framed as the people usually name them with their words and having in mind their worldview\. And each one of these particular project particular problems that constitute this larger problem that we have have codified touches with people's reality and what they have experienced themselves during process of consultation\. And for that, I believe that, yeah, the, the, the main skill has been to approach it with, with empathy and with focus on, on emotions and, and trying to understand their worldview instead of us trying to define the problem from what it's written in laws and in international agreements that our country assigned\. And then approach people and saying, look, these are problems, but finding a middle ground for one last question, one last question\.

[[22:06]] So we understood this is a ongoing project, right? And I think one of the, the things that we can, we can tell it different from the Exeter lab is that we have outcomes during the process\. I mean, we don't have to do the whole process\. What would you say is already an outcome or something that you have probably have evidence to profile, something that you have learned?

So our main outcome in in this process have been a, a road map towards a portfolio of experiments that organizes all the experiments that we want to conduct in a framework of a multitude of specific problems that were codified\. And that among them all constitute the the solving of our frontier challenge, which is this complex problem of achieving rightful consultations in our country\.

[[23:23]] Thank you\.

You're welcome\.
