> Description

The "AIDA's Backpack" initiative addresses the challenges in providing comprehensive sexual education to adolescents and young people using a gamified approach to effectively convey critical topics such as teenage pregnancy, contraception, substance abuse, sexually transmitted infections, and gender-based violence. Its main objective is to empower young people to make informed and responsible decisions. The initiative targets adolescents and young people aged 13 to 20, promoting better decision-making in sexual health and, consequently, healthier sexual lives. This methodology includes a rights-based approach and focuses on gender and new masculinities.


The project also trained 80 youth leaders as peer educators, empowering them to actively participate in training and share knowledge about sexual health with their peers. This approach not only expands the project's reach but also fosters a sense of responsibility and leadership among young people.

The gamified content was developed in collaboration with health professionals, ensuring that the identified thematic priorities were effectively addressed. The solution includes activity planning tools and activity reporting models, providing a broader view of monthly progress.

The AIDA Backpack was recently distributed to 20 health centers in the Municipality of Oruro, and will be distributed to the 9 Platforms for Adolescents and Young People for the Prevention of Teenage Pregnancy, in coordination with the Youth Directorate of Viceminister of Equal Opportunities, covering the entire country.
