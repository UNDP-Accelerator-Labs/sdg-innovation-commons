The innovation is to automate digital  mental health processes of awareness to individuals who have mental health illnesses like birth trauma, depression, trauma, anxiety, bipolar, OCD, addictions, etc to organizations or individuals who offer different treatment techniques like child therapy, group therapy, Cognitive Behavioral therapy, etc There is an urgent need of awareness creation among smartphone users in Zambia for mental health apps.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate money through taking a percentage on all digital payments made through the application. The revenue potential is from a market research we undertook which suggests that our revenue will be 20% for every K100 - K500 weekly subscription paid for the use of the platform by the target market - individuals and organisations. It is estimated that  in the first year 2000 people and organisations would subscribe for weekly sessions. Our target market segment  will be mainly women with birth trauma, men and women experiencing gender based violence, children going through trauma and the youths abusing alcohol and other substances  will use the  platform to communicate their challenges. The players in the mental health value chain include  pharmaceutical suppliers, transporters, mental health practitioners, suppliers of medical implements, and  suppliers of counselling services .  Other revenue streams will include consultancy fees for capacity building programmes targeted at the individuals and organisations that are into mental health promotion. The value addition of this innovation is that it mitigates against unhygienic environment which the mentally challenged can introduce in communities they live e.g diseases

> Technical Feasibility

The application will be both android and ios where the community members with mental health illnesses will be linked to providers of mental health services either physically or online. They will have access to video, chatting, group sessions, individual sessions and digital payments for the services. The application currently is a prototype which will be fully developed starting next month and will be launched this year in November.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This project is aimed at raising mental health awareness and improving health service provision in our community. The project will infuse in technology and community engagement. With community engagement we want to work with the organizations that treat mental health illnesses with technological support and we will be working with one of our community based civil society organizations  who have a vision to create mental awareness. The app will provide the community members with the nearest provider in their areas. The application will see to it that at least 20% deaths resulting from mental health illnesses are reduced by 2023. The impact will be to get a productive human capital required for sustainable  socio-economic development for Zambia by reducing or mitigating against loss of life.
