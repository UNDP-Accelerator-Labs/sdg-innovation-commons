## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Explore the potential of the integration of GIS tools for innovation and acceleration of achievement of SDGs at the Country level.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that to accelerate achievement of SDGs through projects/programmes and operations of a UNDP Country office, we need to leverage the potential of emergents technologies like GIS technologies. GIS tolls enable people to mainstream the spatial dimension of issue that communities are facing, in order to address it properly with innovative approaches for more inclusive actions, while gaining time. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

  The UNDP Cameroon, Country Office have many projects, programmes and operations that have a spatial dimension to be taking into consideration during planning, implementing, M&E cycles. Some actions are also less visible because there are implementing in conflict areas, but at the same time there is a need for UNDP's partners to know, among other information where those actions have been carried out. Proper tools to address those challenges are GIS tools. Peoples, who are involved, are staff for projects/programmes and operations who are the users, and the CO management team for strategics orientation and mobilisation of colleagues. The current situation is that, as now those tools are less used by staffs (63.2% of staff which respond to a survey stated there didn't have yet experienced the integration of GIS tools in their activities.), sometime due to lack or less of knowledge about potentials of those GIS technologies (about 52.2% of responders stated that there are still at the beginner level in term of knowledge about GIS). The undesired effect that it produces is that, we can't scale-up properly development impact for country partners with strategic innovation if we don't integrate sufficiently emergent and suitable technologies in our projects/projects and operations.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The added value that our Acc Lab bring to solve this challenge is that, we already have these GIS skills within the team. It is our lab which has to work on this challenge and not other actor within UNDP because our Acc Lab team masters tools and technics to sense and test the integration of this technology. It is worth investing resources to this challenge because this is addressing a real internal need, but at the same time public sector entities, civils society organisations, research institutes, academia, etc... in the country level, there is also a need and this is a starting point for this integration of GIS , which is planned to be extended furthers to those actors to help accelerate the achievement of SDGs.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

How GIS technologies can contribute to accelerate achievment of SGDs ? 
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.
## Learning questions

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Gaps of data are related to geolocalised (X and Y coordinates) of actions done before by projects/programmes, with open data for instance, we will try to transform decriptive information into spatial data. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Country Office will benefit from this work of the lab, because we are planning to bring support to projects/programmes and operations to integrate concretly GIS in their daily activities.
