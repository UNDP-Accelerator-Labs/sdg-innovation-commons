Young woman was very open for my suggestion to talk to her on that snowy day, while she was serving her clients. She was quite easily openning the roof of the box made of oilcloth with metal frames to keep it safe and sound. Her bread was inside the box and demonstrating her attitude towards her business, keeping bread fresh and away from outside impact. I wondered from her on this box and she gladly shared her story that her husband constructed "house for bread" and even from her voice I felp how she was proud of her husband's support and care. She welcomed my suggestion to take foto of her breads.
