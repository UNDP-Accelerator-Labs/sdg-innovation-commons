The main objective of the project is to complement the field work, through the incorporation and involvement of 500 young volunteers to carry out activities focused on strengthening the capacities of farmers in local regions. These capabilities include agricultural production and the use of technological devices to improve their yields.  


Currently, the project facilitates the knowledge of the "peasant to peasant" methodology for the development of rural extension in 18 departments of Guatemala through the participation of rural youth, who become multiplier agents in their community.
