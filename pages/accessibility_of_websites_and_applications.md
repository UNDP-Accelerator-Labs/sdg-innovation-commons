## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

During the qualitative study that A-Lab Mongolia conducted, people with disabilities and seniors indicated that receiving government and other commercial services through websites and applications is not as easy as it seems. For instance, people with hearing loss pointed out that audio and video contents usually do not have captions or transcripts, and that they need sign language to explain important information because the text is difficult to read. Seniors indicated that websites and applications have too many steps to follow, which confuse and distract them, and user guidelines are also not easy to understand. In other words, web accessibility became an additional layer of difficulty for accessing internet and online services. Therefore, our learning intent was why this is happening and whether there is a way to improve on the accessibility.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we improve  the knowledge and understanding of the accessibility concepts of web developers, then they can apply them in their work and improve accessibility of their website or application.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

First we identified the websites and applications that people with disabilities use the most.  Then we assessed the accessibility of these websites and applications in association with CSO working for PwD Based on the findings of the accessibility audit, we identified main recurrent problems with accessibility We sourced a company that specializes on capacity building and software for accessibility We worked with the government to invite the company as well as web developers of government websites and applications We conducted accessibility training workshop for web developers Web developers corrected accessibility mistakes/problems during practice sessions.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Website or application 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

First we used facebook survey service to reach out to people with disabilities to identify the most used websites and applications. Then we worked with the MNFB to develop the methodology to test accessibility of these websites and applications. These included both using special accessibility application, as well as actual people with disabilities testing each and every function and page of the given website and application. In order to reduce subjective bias, each website and application was checked by 2-3 different individuals. Then most recurring problems were reported. Based on the reports, training workshop plan was developed with consideration of practice exercises.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Considerable staff time from the team, sourcing external company for capacity building part, coordination with the government, negotiation with training company, support to CSO on report writing, editing, reviewing, sharing with government. 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The original hypothesis was proven in both areas: 1. Choosing a few websites and applications out of many, all had some accessibility issue; 2. With training provided, some of the accessibility issues were corrected on the spot.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

For the accessibility audit, the methodology proved to be too labor and time intensive. we could have gone with accessibility software alone. Secondly, we needed more time on the follow-up after the training. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

It took 4 months from design to results, mainly because accessibility audit took much longer than expected. Training component was the most straight-forward part.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

USD 20,000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We need to again perform accessibility audit of the websites and applications, which developers were enrolled in capacity building training.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We are discussing with the newly established Ministry of Digital Development and Communication on how to integrate compliance and capacity building aspect in the national accessibility standard implementation.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

From our two experiments, our key learnings are as follows: ·       Accessibility is everyone: When we started our experiments, we focused on people with sight or hearing loss as they are often the target group who primarily come to mind for the web accessibility. However, this leads to the misconception that accessibility caters to only a small fraction of the population and, therefore, is not very important. Even though there may be not many people with permanent loss of abilities, there are many more instances of people having temporary loss of abilities due to illness or accidents, as well as some abilities declining with age. With accessibility features, people can overcome these inconveniences without much reliance on others and without compromising on the quality of life. Therefore, the importance of accessibility is not something that should be overlooked by physically able people, as it is something that benefits everyone in the long run. ·       Address the misconceptions: We also learned that accessibility is still quite a new notion in Mongolia and many people understand it as a complicated, technical, and code heavy process. As such, many people believe that accessibility is expensive, or any attempts to incorporate accessibility would compromise the design and attractiveness of websites and applications. This have led to the will and inclination to adopt accessibility practices to be less than it should or could be. Notwithstanding, our training session with website developers was a fresh outlook that to ensure accessibility, one does not need to develop a new set of codes and the design and visual aesthetic of web pages does not have to be jeopardized. It is important to raise awareness and understanding about accessibility concepts, as well as cultivate compassion to users through addressing misunderstandings and preconceived assumptions. ·       Accessibility integrated design: In order to truly save on costs, it is essential to think about accessibility early on, and embed it as soon as possible during the initial design and development of new websites or applications. Although it is still possible to include accessibility features at the later stage, this would require more time and resources to ‘retrofit’ an element that would be more perceived as an afterthought, rather than something that is truly embedded in the structure of the website from the beginning. ·       Involve the users: Lastly, in any design process it is important to involve people with disabilities as well as other high-need groups. In this way, it becomes possible to integrate their actual needs, respond to their desires, and bring the comfort and familiarity to the next level. This level of integration not only catches a wider audience, thus proving the raison d’étre of the internet in the information age, but from a commercial perspective is advantageous for a company/organization as it vastly improves their reputation.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The main obstacle was really the capacity and specifics of the CSO we were working with. We had to learn about how people with visual and other types of disabilities perceive surrounding environment, their very peculiar way to doing things, social and communication challenges that these people have, etc. Secondly, though they were extremely optimistic of being able to do accessibility audit, their capacity of expressing what they experienced in a way that abled people would understand was the most challenging part. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

UNDP has a noble mission of leaving noone behind in development. Our experiment was a close look into the lives of people with disabilities and revealing that a lot needs to be done in order to bring their needs and obstacles to the attention of abled people. Conscious efforts should be made in order to tailors programs and projects to meet their needs. Therefore, it would be helpful for program staff to plan and design their programs keeping in mind the interests and needs of these people.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

As we mentioned before, many various groups of people would benefit from improved accessibility. Those include people with disabilities, elderly and people with temporary loss of abilities, companies, as well as any public and other institutions. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Accessibility audit was required certain iterations, as we needed to adjust our wants from the actual abilities of the people performing the audit. We considerably downsized the reporting aspect, as those people had problems of putting their experiences into words. Even with that the report of the audit was very difficult to read and understand, therefore, we had to spend a lot of time speaking to auditors and ask them to tell what they experience to us and then we had to put them down in writing. With this report went through several editions and changes.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Though it was great that we involved people with disabilities in the experiment, there is a need to be prepared for the social cost of this exercise. In Mongolia, PwD go through too many difficulties and hardships and therefore, they are extremely suspicious, sensitive, and easily give up on things. This aspect was quite hard to manage.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

In many of the SDGs, the needs and interests of the people with disabilities are overlooked. While accessibility is only one part of it, similar experiments could be designed in many other goal areas. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

In some ways, it was very narrow avenue for interventions, but it really catered to the needs of the people with disabilities. We saw some potential of this being some sort of income generation for training institutions, therefore, we could explore this part more. On other hand, this would have a good buy-in option for both private sector and government.

> What surprised you?

Working with people with disabilities is actually quite hard. We really had to change our perspective and reach out to our compassionate self to understand some of their realities. While we would never be able to fully experience what they go through on daily basis, at least we gained some glimpses into their daily struggles and concerns.
