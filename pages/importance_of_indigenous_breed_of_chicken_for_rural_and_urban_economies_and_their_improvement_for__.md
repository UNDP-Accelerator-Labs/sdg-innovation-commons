> Brief description of the innovation

Indigenous breeds of chicken we play an  important role rural and urban economies in most of the developing and underdeveloped countries.their we provide people with the source of income,also act us a source of nutrition chicken eggs and meat for our own consumption.mostly important,is to improve our lives if given an opportunity to prove it, Also given my fellow youth an opportunity to work with me, together we will improve our lives at community level and also at national level.
I have some indigenous chicken that I'm keeping at my place,(back yard chicken).when the chicken have eggs,I normally take the eggs to incubator and I pay k3 per egg,after 21 day the eggs we hatch into chicks.a day old chick is k12 and a week old chick is k15,a three month chicken depending on the weight and breed some can be k90 some k120  upto k160 and an egg is k5.
If chicken are well feed in a day we can have many eggs depending on how many chicken u have and you can be taking eggs daily to the incubator.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Chicken we act as a source of income when the chick grow to chicken.I we start selling them, mean while some are hatching that are in the incubator,also I we sell eggs, chicks through this I we have source of income I we even empower my fellow youth.
My target is to have 1000 chickens,if I have 1000 chicken which means my fellow youth we be employed,and I believe to say I we have my own incubator,so that incomes can come from different direction,for example if someone brings an egg I we charge the person,if someone wants chicks I we sell to him or her .
For a business to grow or to have higher market value,my price we be fair for everyone,so that I can Carter the community.
Chicken we improve the soil quality for farming or if u want to have a garden at that particular time,and u can sell the manure and the money we act as the source of income

> Technical Feasibility

I we have to build a large poultry made of  bricks and a chicken wire. In order to protect the chicken from predators such us rats and cat .
Sussex is the breed that I'm keeping currently and it's good for eggs and meat production .need electricity for the incubator to operate and for the hatching chicks .
Chicks have to be keep warm like wise.
Feeders are need at that particular time and also need drinks

> Anticipated Social Impact

Given them an opportunity to learn more about bird or chicken and some we be empowered through this innovation.
