Details of Surprise Soap: 

Surprise Soaps are small, clear soaps for children with a plastic toy visible inside. The more children wash their hands, the quicker they're rewarded with the toy. By washing their hands more often, children who use the soaps are helping to make their communities healthier. The soap are locally produced with environment friendly materials (sometimes from recycled materials). The toy that is put inside the soap are made using 3D printing technology, so far Field Ready has distributed thousands of surprise soap either to children inside camp or schools.   We know that kids keep their hands cleaner with Surprise Soaps, and their use eliminates the need for labor-intensive hygiene promotion. How do we know? In a 2019 research project with our partners Save the Children and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, we tested children's use of the Surprise Soaps in an Iraqi refugee camp.

Findings from This Solution:

Findings from that project showed that children washed their hands four times as often with the Surprise Soaps as they did with traditional soap. Their clean behavior often spread to family members - and when that happened diseases such as cholera and pneumonia, which spread easily in crowded refugee camps, didn't. It's a simple recipe: Surprise Soaps + children = more handwashing; more handwashing = fewer diseases. For both the children themselves and their families, friends and neighbors.
