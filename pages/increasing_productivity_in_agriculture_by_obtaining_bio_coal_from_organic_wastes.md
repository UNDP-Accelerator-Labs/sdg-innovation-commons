Organic wastes from homes, workplaces and restaurants are collected separately and collected in organic waste containers placed by municipalities on every street. These containers are brought to the private organic waste processing facility by municipal vehicles. The wastes are separated from their packages and subjected to incineration in a high temperature and oxygen-free environment and bio-char is obtained. This substance, which is rich in carbon and minerals, is used as fertilizer in agricultural lands.
