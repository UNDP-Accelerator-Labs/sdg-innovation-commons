Global Partners is a Benin based start-up specialised in developing and providing drone solutions for agriculture, land use planning, surveillance, and biodiversity conservation. The implementation time is 5 years and above as there has been several trial periods since 2017., I could not find the name of the project so I called it by the organisation's name + country
