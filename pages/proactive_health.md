> Title of the innovation

Proactive Health

> Brief description of the innovation

A technological solution that enables health professional through a web or mobile app to remotely and in real time monitor patient’s vital health indicators such as high blood pressuring, sugar, heartbeat, etc from low cost smart watches used by patients to detect potentially critical deterioration of health for patients and proactively notify health care professional or listed alternative trusted contact for emergency ambulance/prescribed medication dispatch to the patient.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income generation:
This aspect will be addressed by optional introduction of a fee for the proactive remote health care package for each patient on a medical scheme. The fee will cover the cost of software and hardware maintenance including update as well as labor costs for all staff and shareholders hired to run the company.

Operation Improvements:
The proactive remote health care package will provide a new avenue to generate:-
- Real time health care data which can help the health sector formulate new data driven innovative diagnosis as well as more in depth patient health care analytics.
- Machine learning models for prediction, clustering and classification to anticipate health data patterns from patients of different demographics in ways previous unexplored.
- Real time data of patients health data which can help formulate data drive cost effective medication purchase models to reduce medication wastage due to under or over estimation of medication demand for patients.
- The solution will provide a proactive dimension to health care that ensure the procrastinative tendencies of patient that cause delayed medical treatment are averted through the use of low cost smart watches to detect key health care vitals spikes and avail such information in real time to health professionals for actions to be taken.
- The solution will provide new ways for health care experts to perform data driven explorations and research of patient's behavioral patterns daily that trigger adverse health states in order to convey personalized patient behavioral change regimes to increase healthy living.
- The data collected from the patients through the solution can be anonymized and provided at a fee to health research and educations institutions to accelerate access to localized patient data sets for scholarly and research purposes.

Target:
patients with diabetes, sickle cell, asthma or pregnant for a start though the vastness of patient categories will grow after the solution matures.

> Technical Feasibility

- The solution will function through the use of low cost smart watch android app which will collect vital medically prescribed health care information such as heart beat, high blood pressure, etc. 
- The information will be stored securely and displayed in real time of accredited health professionals to monitor via a web app or mobile app which will rank each observed patient by the criticality of the vital data received and alert when a particular patients vitals exceed acceptable health parameters.
- Health care professional will have the option to call a listed patient's trusted contact for immediate health action be taken and if the case exceed tolerable bounds the health professional who observed critical patient can alert an emergency ambulance to pick the patient based on the system defined patient location. 
- The Health professional side of the solution will provide a means for them to indicate when each critical patient is attended to and if a defined time period passes with action from the health care expert the listed patient's trusted contact will receive a text or email alerting them to reach the critical patient and the system will assign the unattended patient to another online health professional.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Life Improvements:
- The solution will provide new ways for health care experts to explore with data the patient behavioral patterns that trigger adverse health states in order to convey personalized patient behavioral change regimes to increase healthy living for patients.
- The solution will provide a dimension to health care that ensure the proactivity health challenge identification for patients which will drastically reduces cases of delayed medical diagnosis and treatment of patients.

Relevance of Solution:
- The solution aligns with the increased drive for nationwide government investment and focus on universal health care coverage for all by leveraging on technology to increase data drive health care and proactive patient diagnosis and treatment and also resonates with the world economic forum's new global drive "THE GREAT RESET" which put emphasis on incorporating technology in optimizing health care.
