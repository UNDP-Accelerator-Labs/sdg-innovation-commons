This innovation is about providing a link between customers to sources of products and services (sellers) online and at an affordable charge.

We partner with local businesses by allowing them advertise their goods and services on our online platforms.  This allows potential buyers to see the availble goods and services and engage us to collect and deliver goods of their choice on their behalf and deliver at their door step at a given fee. We also help small local businesses to find potential consummers by connecting them to where their services are needed.
