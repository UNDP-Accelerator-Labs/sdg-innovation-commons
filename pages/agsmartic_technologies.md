AgSmartic Technologies

> Description of innovation

AgSmartic was founded in 2017 with a mission to help the farmers improving their life by increasing their farm yield, reducing wastage of resources by designing a  system that eliminates the direct involvement of the farmer with respect to irrigation of their fields.
AgSmartic designed a product called CROPLYTICS® which is an autonomous irrigation system uses solar based wireless soil moisture sensor data, satellite images, ET, crop life cycle to come up with a precise irrigation plan. Therefore a new approach of collecting real time data from the field by using soil moisture sensor offers real potential for reliably monitoring soil water status in agriculture fields. Artificial intelligence can help farmers to get more from the land while using resources more sustainable. It provides ways to mitigate the problem and thereby helping farmers to ease the technical know-how through use of advanced technology
