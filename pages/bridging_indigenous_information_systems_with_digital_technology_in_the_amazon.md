Bridging Indigenous Information Systems with Digital Technology in the Amazon
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Digital technology can help close gaps in climate action and improve adaptation efforts for vulnerable groups. However, mere access to and use of this technology does not directly impact the lives of vulnerable groups, such as indigenous peoples. Our challenge is to understand whether and under what conditions improved access to information and knowledge facilitated by ICTs can enhance the capabilities of indigenous peoples in the Amazon to better achieve adaptation, forest preservation, and sustainable livelihoods.

We will address this issue collaboratively with other stakeholders to map technology implemented in indigenous communities, the information and knowledge that this technology has enabled for these communities, the role of key factors in the implementation of ICTs (such as existing indigenous information systems, types of intermediary organizations, the technology appropriation process, among others) and their impact on empowerment of indigenous communities.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In Bolivia, the Amazon—the largest tropical rainforest in the world—includes most of the country's 36 indigenous peoples and is a prioritized region for climate action by the government, NGOs, and other stakeholders. Deforestation is affecting the natural ecosystem and indigenous peoples' livelihoods, leading to increased migration to cities and heightened vulnerabilities. 

ICTs have immense potential to gather evidence to improve decision-making, especially for vulnerable groups like indigenous peoples. Given the substantial investment planned for the Amazon in the coming years, particularly under the new Bolivia GEF project, it is crucial to understand the conditions under which ICTs can enhance the capabilities of indigenous peoples to preserve their forests and adapt their livelihoods to the climate crisis. This initiative aims to provide valuable insights for a national project and diverse stakeholders to better manage impacts.

The Amazon basin covers a significant portion of our national territory, encompassing approximately 50 million hectares of tropical forest. In its entirety, this basin accounts for around 75 million hectares of rich biodiversity. However, in recent years, Bolivia has ranked among the top countries with the highest deforestation rates. According to the World Wildlife Fund, deforestation in the Amazon rainforest could bring the region’s ecosystem to a point of no return, potentially ceasing to function as a tropical rainforest within the next 20 years. Given this challenge, there is an urgent need to accelerate climate action and leverage digital technology as a driver. Understanding the conditions under which these technologies can be impactful is crucial.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Most of the indigenous peoples in Bolivia live in the Amazon region. Deforestation is affecting their main livelihoods, leading to increased migration to cities and heightened vulnerabilities. Institutions are working to enhance the capabilities of indigenous peoples to preserve the forest and adapt to the climate crisis, and the use of ICTs is becoming more common, though with varying levels of appropriation and impact. Research on the conditions that favor such appropriation is still lacking.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Understanding the conditions under which technology can drive positive changes for indigenous peoples in the Amazon to preserve the forest and adapt to climate crisis will help stakeholders supporting climate action to enhance their impacts

One hypothesis regarding the impact of technology on indigenous peoples is the relationship between technologies and existing indigenous information systems, the role of intermediary organizations, and the technology appropriation process. In this context, the museum, with its experts in anthropology, will aid in understanding indigenous information systems an perspectives

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Under which conditions have the new knowledge and information obtained through ICT had positive impacts on indigenous communities

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We will use solutions mapping to identify indigenous local information systems and their relationships with ICT solutions (if any). Through ethnography and facilitation, we will investigate the conditions under which ICTs were integrated into indigenous information systems. Finally, we will develop micro-narratives to share knowledge and provide feedback to the communities, enabling them to understand, seek, adapt, or develop technology that can be useful for them    

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



On one hand, there is a lack of data on indigenous information systems and their relationship with the appropriation process of ICT. On the other hand, there is an information gap regarding the role of intermediary institutions in the adoption of ICTs. 
## Closing
