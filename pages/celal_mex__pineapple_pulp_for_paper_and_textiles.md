## From agricultural waste to sustainable raw material

Mexico generates 6.3 million tons of pineapple waste annually, yet 705 of this waste is cellulose which can serve as a sustainable substitute for traditional cellulose. The green chemistry process of Celal-Mex uses 66% less water and chemicals than traditional cellulose production. 

Celal-Mex is a biotechnology initiative focused on the development of sustainable raw materials from agricultural waste in the form of cellulose and starch for industrial marketing.  Their objective is to take advantage of agricultural waste and give a second use to the byproducts of the field to develop sustainable and competitive alternatives to conventional polymers.
