## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Women's Political participation and the role of "common" media 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our Challenge is that the number of women being included on platforms like parties, parliament, and media and or championing is too little, women are elbowing into the political discourse on a sub regional level by being active community builders and conveners yet we do not see them in power platform or representations of power; media. This has a direct impact on the pipeline of women considered for political roles on all levels. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

We aim to identify the popular perception of women as political thought leaders across segments, if the normative communication channel is reshaped to accommodate women as guests, speakers, and viewers. I.e “making expert talk available to them  in ways that people become more familiar and less alienated from topics that govern their daily lives and their fate in this country.”

The media has (knowingly or unknowingly) participated in systematically distancing women and other marginalised groups from both participating and from accessing the “political arena” in ways that speak to their interests, language, and appeal. 




> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

The number of women in parliament is 8 in 2022, less than it was in the last decade and still now where near getting a women's participation quota adopted.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

The work of Eitan Hersh on politics is for power, that indicates the gender gap between men and women. Men accessing political platforms via political hobbyisim and engagement with the topic in a manner similar to sports TV while women identify with politics as engagement with issues and community. This leaves women who are engaging in creating political discourse both excluded by national media by virtue of common practice and  from political hobbyisim by virtue of the activities themselves.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

his learning experiment, is set to lay ground work that speaks to the current times in both context and content.  The effort is to remove bias and ambiguity in our approach to how we select, portray, and center women in politics.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

It is common practice to have an all male guest list on a political show in Lebanon, women are often tokenized by parties and the media. What if we use "common practice" to create an all woman show, without hinting to that fact at all? such common practice can help change "norms"

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

The hypothesis is one that analyzed and benchmarked the perception and the projection of the “woman as expert, and (potential) political leader” image across TV and mainstream media. 

The test is to use the medium of popular media ( TV show + Facebook + Youtube) to showcase women as thought leaders and political change-makers without: 

Pink washing (i.e publicising shows or content as “women specific” and inturn either alienating other segments OR reducing the likelihood of their viewership and or seriousness of content. 

Using normative aesthetics used by run of the mill talk shows that appeal and are designed for and by men and host men in reprise across episode guests and hosts.

This learning experiment, is set to lay ground work that speaks to the current times in both context and content.  The effort is to remove bias and ambiguity in our approach to how we select, portray, and center women in politics. 




> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Data ethnography: The measurement methods use targeted online reach and and interactive QR code for nominations, this type of data can help us map demographics and their readiness to adopt women in positions of power. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

only data we have is on women running in each cycle and women taking trainings with the elections team, but we dont have data on perception and readiness of adoption of women in political leadership. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This project mobilized 1,5 CAD from Canada and is set to grow over next 3 years.
