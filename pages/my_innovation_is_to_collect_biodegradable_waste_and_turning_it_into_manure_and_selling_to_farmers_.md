> Title of the innovation

My innovation is to collect biodegradable waste and turning it into manure and selling to farmers.

> Brief description of the innovation

Our business will be collecting garbage from households, markets, bars and restaurants 
at a fee and will later recycle biodegradable waste to manure and non-biodegradable 
waste taken to recycling companies.
We intend to produce the product by firstly offering the community knowledge on how 
to dispose waste by separating non-biodegradable waste making it easy to recycle and 
making the biodegradable waste into manure and use for agriculture

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We intend to generate income by firstly charging households for collection of garbage from their homes ,bar owners,restaurants,traders and shop owners.We will then sort our garbage into two categories the biodegradable waste and non biodegradable waste ,the biodegradable waste will be put to rot then we will sell to farmers when it has turned to compost manure the non biodegradable waste will be taken to recycling companies. The prize will help finance the transportation of garbage from their sources to a place we will do sorting and decompose to manure and it will also help us set up our own plant and create jobs for others as we will be able to grow and do it on a large scale.If we collect waste from communities and reuse it we are protecting the environment from burnings of waste that most people do,dumping of waste anyhow and blocking drainages which causes diseases.

> Technical Feasibility

Our focus is on the waste that can decompose so that we can turn it into manure and help farmers . The plan is to firstly get tenders from local authorities to collect garbage which we will later sort into categories;biodegradable waste and non biodegradable waste,we will then decompose the biodegradable waste and take the non biodegradable waste to recycling companies. In the long run we intend to sensitise  communities on separating waste in their homes.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Copper belt produces over 2700 tonnes of waste every day and only half of it is taken to 
the dumpsite, this made us develop interest in waste management. There has been a rise 
in wrong disposal of waste in Communities in Zambia. People are mostly burning plastics, 
pilling them up on the streets, in the markets which is making the environment dirty which 
leads to diseases. In 2018 a lot of people died due to Cholera which was caused by poor 
garbage disposal which had blocked drainages that led to contaminated water which 
later caused waterborne diseases.
Copper belt has an estimation of 2675446 population, our business is going to solve the 
problem by recycling biodegradable waste into manure which will be sold to farmers .
