> Brief description of the innovation

The disposal of enormous quantities of plastic bottles has become a major environmental issue, and recycling them is proving difficult due to their non-biodegradable nature. The amount of plastic garbage in our environment is continually increasing since plastic does not breakdown organically. The proposed our innovation is to manufacturing using  plastic waste   and making  building  bricks, pavers and roofing .These are  have compressive strength, water absorption, and efflorescence as evaluated to other bricks with increasing percentages of plastic. It demonstrates that incorporating smash type plastic waste improves the performance of bricks significantly and will sell cheaper .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

“I've considered it this can make us not only income but create jobs for uneducated people especially youths . I can  possibly try save the environment while  also reducing problem disposal   issues. So, when I acquire these funds I'll be able to employ  the workforce for collecting and picking all types plastic of the streets .As only materials needed is plastic and most the funds will on setting up after and machinery ,once set the market is readily available .

> Technical Feasibility

The use of discarded plastic waste in the production of bricks is an excellent way to alleviate the problem of waste storage while also lowering the cost of building materials.
As Eco waste innovators  is the procedure for preparing bricks ,pavers and tiles. In the mixer, the proportions of sand and sand dust (9:4) were added.

Then, in a 2:1 ratio, two buckets of water were poured and stirred together. After that, the plastics materials were divided into ratios and combined with the raw components after then we heat the liquid is then poured into the mold to produce desired products either bricks or pavers .

> Anticipated Social Impact

This is an effective alternative for disposal of plastic waste  as we use it in designing tiles ,pavers and blocks with better mechanical strength, reduced flammability level, resistant against strong acids and bases and organic solvents, so that tiles can be used outdoor designing and  paver tiles for societal usage.the market is readily available all we need to do is sell them at the cheaper price as compared to the other types .
