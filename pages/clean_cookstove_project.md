> Affected Sector

Households

> Description of the solution

Project providing around 20,000 energy efficient and clean cookstoves for local communities. The clean cookstoves use less than half of the wood previously required, meaning that women and children have to spend less time collecting and chopping the wood, less money purchasing wood, and are breathing in smaller volumes of particulate matter.

> Socio-economic effects

Reduced deforestation in the local area. Better community health due to improved indoor air quality such as fewer respiratory illnesses such as asthma and coughs from smoke inhalation. Lowering atmospheric CO2 concentration and contributing to a decarbonised society. Local training to manufacture, distribute, install and maintain the cookstoves. Community education to understand the problems caused by deforestation

> Type of Measure

- 1. active measures (direct measures for reduction of air pollution)

> Type of sub-measure

- 4. awareness raising and knowladge sharing

> Who led the solution

- local government

> Timescale of implementation

- medium-term (2-4 years)
