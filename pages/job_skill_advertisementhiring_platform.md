Skills Trade Platform - TradeBook: In response to the UNDP Barbados and Eastern Caribbean #IslandHack Hackathon challenge facilitated by the Accelerator Lab, the first place winner was TradeBook, an app and web portal that allows users to create profiles advertising their job skills, which enables persons seeking those particular skillsets to find and hire qualified workers. TradeBook also offers a marketplace option where visitors can browse and list goods for sale in a virtual store model. TradeBook was born with the goal of allowing members to easily identify activities that help supplement income following COVID-19.
