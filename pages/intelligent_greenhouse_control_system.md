> Description of the solution

The intelligent greenhouse control system by Sciento is an advanced solution. It can remotely access environmental data like soil temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and video images. It controls greenhouse equipment such as wet curtain fans, drip irrigation, and shading systems through data model analysis for optimal crop growth. The system offers over 60 types of sensors and control devices, continuously monitors various environmental parameters, and can expand monitoring points. It has features like intelligent monitoring with multiple alarm options, intelligent control of common equipment, and remote control via mobile and computer. Compared to traditional management, it reduces production risks, saves labor costs, and increases production efficiency.
