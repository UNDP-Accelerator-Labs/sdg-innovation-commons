The Friends of the Lake have seen collecting and recycling the oil as a solution to that problem. In 2019 they saved 41,000 acres of Lake Atitlán's surface water from cooking oil contamination, 128% of its surface area.

They collected 19,375.4 liters of cooking oil which was recycled to create soap.
