Healthy and empowered children are the most important addition to the human capital assets of a country. Science clearly shows that care and mental stimulation during the first few years of life are all decisive for the later cognitive and emotional development of a person. Many parents are not sufficiently aware of this fact or lack the knowledge of how to provide their children with the optimal mental stimulation and emotional skills (such as self-control and respect for others). Kindergarten is important but support is needed even earlier in life. This counselling needs to combine obstetric, pediatric, psychological, pedagogic and social expertise and support in one integrated process from pregnancy to entering school. Finland has since before WWII developed a highly successful program of this sort (called Neuvola = Counseling). (There even is the hypothesis that the top performance of Finland in PISA is more due to this early childhood support of cognitive development rather than the school system).
