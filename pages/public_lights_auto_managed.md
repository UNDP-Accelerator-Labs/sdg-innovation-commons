In Guinea, electricity is existing long time ago but with covarage holes. Added to that, in the special rural area, to mitigate power supply need and the management problem to avoid public light being active for 24H in so that the rest of the  population could be served. CONDE has decided to set available his auto-managed Public Lights.  Composed by a LED lightning  and  220 to 12V converter, this solution can be reproduced in different format. It's particularity is the sensor incorporated in the converter that enables the switching to light when dakness comes or OFF when day light is felt. Using it can help decrease the consumption and waste of electricity.
