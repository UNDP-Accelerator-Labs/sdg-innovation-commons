## Title

Learning "glocally" about resilience to climate change...
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

“How to increase resilience to climate change starting from the solid waste management perspective”

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

We first focused on the Metropolitan Area, where Municipality of Guatemala collects solid waste for Guatemala City and other 14 municipalities, managing and supporting the largest open landfill in the country.  It is estimated that due to the topographic and hydrological conditions, part of the waste disposed in the landfill as well as the open dumpsters in the ravines, is been washed out across the norther basin (Río Las Vacas), which encounters and pollutes the largest river in the country,  Río Motagua.   What is causing or driving it? a)Mainly the lack of acknowledgment on responsibilities (duties) on solid waste management by generators: individuals, citizens, household generators, mid-generators, large generators, institutions (public and private in different scales) and producers.  b)Solid Waste Management costs depending on technologies and solutions. However, even though the Municipal Code established that municipalities are responsible for the comprehensive solid waste management, it does not state how to collect financial resources for such duty.  c)The governing body (main institution) in environmental matters is the Environment Ministry, that has acknowledged the incongruity to charge municipalities to provide the comprehensive services without financial resources (not to mention technical on administration operations and specialized management).  d)Generators (anyone who produces waste), currently is not paying for waste management services, except for waste collection service within the metropolitan area, and provided by private small companies.  e)Therefore, waste management is limited to be operated in a very empirical way and supported by the financial resources each municipality can commit to this matter.  f)Waste management requires not only financial resources if we aim to stop polluting our soils, ravines, rivers, lakes, oceans like is happening in Guatemala as a country.   Who is involved? a)Generators (of any kind and any scale) that must be accountable for their own waste.  b)Ministry of Environment  c)Municipalities  d)Congress and Constitution Court (to back legally any municipal taxation towards solid waste management)  e)Any private or grassroot stakeholder who’s currently managing waste in a parallel or informal way to lessen the impacts of mismanagement.    How does the current situation look like?  It is estimated that in Guatemala the per capita generation of waste and common solid waste is 0.519 kilograms per inhabitant per day; where the composition of recoverable solid waste is estimated at 53% organic matter; 9% plastics (rigid and PET); 6% paper and cardboard; 2% glass and 1% cans (1 Source: Data generated based on the Diagnosis of the National Plan Project. National Plan Project. Project ATN-MA-12949-GU, IDB 2014).      What undesired effects produce?  Unless waste management practices are improved, the flux of solid waste could create undesired effects threaten our entire ecosystem. For instance, the flux of plastics to the oceans could increase by an order of magnitude within the next decade (Jambeck et al, 2015). In Guatemala the undesired effects go the Central-Northern Basin (Río Las Vacas), Río Motagua and Atlantic Ocean.

1.The urge to acknowledge waste producers must hold accountable for waste handling, management or acquire the services for waste treatments.   2.Most of the products to assure health-security for Covid-19 are disposable products and many coming from plastic materials. The problem is mainstream focuses on accuse plastic industry, but as long as we don´t hold accountable for our waste (any kind of it) we´ll keep facing environmental and climate change struggles.  3.New “formulas” claiming to be bio-organic or bio-friendly in plastics are being used, not proven and without the means to prove their benefits easily. Not all formulas, such as OXO are responsive to environment, instead they´re generating micro waste plastic as bigger problem to environment specially in hydrological resources.  4.Informality is still growing, and waste recovery chains are fertile soils for informality. Today we have learned from these complex informal systems that actually work as “spontaneous

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab is uniquely positioned and qualified to identify innovate existing and potential solutions in response to needs faced by CO teams and government partners. However solid waste management is a challenge itself needed to be understood from its complexity and very much related to social behaviors including informality.  UNDP searches for solutions towards sustainable development and with the Accelerator Lab, we´re aiming for agile solutions rather than traditional approaches; we´re searching for grassroots solutions and empowering local innovation from person-centered focus. As we’ve learned from our 1st Learning Cycle, we’ve realized the importance and involvement of people in waste recovery chains, in the informal real though.  We´re expecting to learn about responsibilities and accountability on solid waste production (social behavior from pilot communities) and prove grassroots solutions work for solid waste management from the lab the methodologies for this 2nd Learning Cycle. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP Guatemala Accelerator Lab is working on understanding climate change effects from social and economic dimensions. Its scope of work is based on solid waste management, learning from grassroots solutions such as a large informal waste recovery chain.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

From the perspective of solid waste management, what is the understanding of  socio-economic dimensions on climate change? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Data Visualization: Perform exploratory data analysis for uncovering key insights, trends and patterns. Behavioral insights: Understand the behaviors of specific communities when new government programs are introduced. Social Media Analysis: Identify already existing solutions being shared in social media platforms Participatory Design:  Co-creation, Design Sprints: Co-working with the partners to design lab activities and assess results obtained Solutions Mapping: Investigate local solutions on the "informal" waste recovery chain

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data sources would allow to provide insights on waste management statistics in different geographies in the country. However, there is still a gap in spatiotemporal data for analyzing trends over time, as well as demographic data associated to the available statistics. The economics of solid waste management still remains to be uncovered from informal stakeholders who hide relevant information due to threats
