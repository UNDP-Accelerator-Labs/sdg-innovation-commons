Briquettes are produced from agricultural waste mainly groundnut shells. they last for 6 hours and produce almost no smoke. using briquettes means that trees willnot be cut down to get firewood or charcoal hence reducing on the rate of deforastation. generally, our briquettes are alternative to charcoal and firewood.
