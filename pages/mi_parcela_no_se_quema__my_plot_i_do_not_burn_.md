> Description of the solution

Mi parcela no se quema is a national information campaign and capacity-building program raising awareness on the negative impacts of stubble burning. Stubble burning is a significant source of air pollution and contributes to biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and wildfires. Workshops teach farmers to avoid agricultural burning and opt for alternative stubble management practices such as using the stubble as ground cover, feed for livestock, or compost and fertilizer use. New production systems based on conservation agriculture are also promoted, which include maintaining permanent soil coverage, minimum tillage, and crop diversification.
