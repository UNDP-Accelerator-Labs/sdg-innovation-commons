Tu Pan Suk, or Pantries of Sharing

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

During the COVID pandemic, I saw the community pantries being set up across the country. Tu Pan Suk, or Pantries of Sharing have been installed by local people to offer food for people who cannot afford food during the pandemic. Pantries are usually filled with dry food such as rice, canned fish, bread, instant noodles, milk cartons and cooking oil but also fresh food such as eggs. Some even include notepads for people to write messages of thanks and encouragement to each other. On the pantry, there is also a sign saying 'Please take anything you need, and leave anything you can share'. 

In  addition, a map compiling sharing pantries nationwide has been developed so that the community can record where the food pantries are across the nation.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

- Offer food for people who cannot afford food during this difficult time;
- Offer alternative means of donations for those who want to donate but do not know where to drop off donations



> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

- In some locations, I noticed that people are following their conscience, only taking away what they need from the pantries. However, in others, some people being too greedy, snatching everything from a community pantry in one go.
