[[ai_summary:Amaro Ximenes, Head of Exploration in East Timor, discussed a R&D activity focused on implementing a job search and trend analysis application with the government. The project used the Co-creation method, which utilized an open-source platform to develop the app. This approach aims to improve sustainability by allowing the government to manage and maintain the system. Amaro mentioned that data privacy and ethical issues were addressed during development, as the Secretary of State of Youth and Employment coordinated with private sectors and obtained consent from relevant parties.

# Exploring Innovation in Timor Leste: A Collaborative Approach to Job Development

### [[\[0:06]] Could you tell us your name and position please?

Yes, my name is Amara Simenez and I'm Head of Exploration in East Timor\.

### [[0:16]] OK, nice to meet you\. So could you tell us about the R&D activity you would like to share today?

Yes, I think in terms of the our activity in East Timor, we had, we have one activity for the for the implementation of job search and job trend analysis with the government, especially with the Secretary of State of Youth and Employment where we we collaborate with them Co create the application, this application together with the government\. So I think that's the activities that we do with the with the government\.

### [[1:15]] Great\. So what tools and methods did you employ during that?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Co-creation]]
Yeah, as I mentioned we are applying the Co creation method because the other you know in government before we applied this method we already explore in government especially with the Minister of Youth and Employment\. They previously they used the one job shares apps, but it was implemented by the vendor and the reason it was not effective because the vendor deliver the system and they don't have the capacity to operate or to maintain the system\. You know, even just to modify one things require expertise, which is they don't have\. So that's why a club team together with the UNDP in TST more we, we, we analyze this situation and then we come up with the core creation where we are using open source platform to develop the apps with the with the government stuff\. So I think this way, this way it make more sustainable\. And when we deliver these apps they, they can manage by themselves\. I think that's why what we have done through the government, it's kind of in house development, yes, in house development using the open source system, you know, the there's now like we use the PHP Laravel especially we develop these job sales apps, but on top of that we also develop job train analysis\. You know, where these apps, the job sales apps are taking the data, collecting all the data and then this data are generating the job trend for the decision making\.

### [[3:32]] So it's definitely helps for sustainability, yes, in terms of maintenance and then yes, how about this? I mean, the data privacy, all these other ethical issues are addressed during this development\.

Regarding this, this platform, you know, it's like the, the platform because they, they mean the Secretary of State of youth and Employment, they are responsible for all the data for the employment\. So they, they, this data also, they coordinate with the private sector, the government coordinated the private sector\. They normally sign the some form of consent, yeah\. So to, to, to get the data right\.

### [[4:36]] So very interesting to learn, but how, what would you do differently if you had started again, if you like, back in time and started again? Is there anything you'd like to change during the process or approach?

Well, I think as I mentioned that you know previously the IT was not the system that developed by vendor\. They delivered the system and then the cost was very high and then the the capacity internal capacity is not was not there to maintain the system\. So that's why we you know, this is the process where we we we come up with the Co creation as I mentioned\.

### [[5:37]] OK, thank you Amoro for the interview\.

Yeah\. Thank you\.
