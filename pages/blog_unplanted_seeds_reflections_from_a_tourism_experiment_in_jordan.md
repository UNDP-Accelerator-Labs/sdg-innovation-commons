Unplanted Seeds: Reflections From a Tourism Experiment In Jordan

Unplanted Seeds: Reflections from a Tourism Experiment in Jordan Overgrazing by livestock and increasing tourism have placed native plant species in danger, threatening the fragile desert ecosystem

The breathtaking landscapes of Jordan’s Wadi Rum, where expansive red sands meet towering rock formations, have long symbolised the region’s natural beauty. However, an urgent conservation challenge has emerged: overgrazing by livestock and increasing tourism have placed native plant species in danger, threatening the fragile desert ecosystem. In response, the Accelerator Lab launched an ecotourism initiative in 2023 to restore the resilient Ghada plant (Haloxylon persicum) to its native habitat while creating sustainable livelihood opportunities for women in Wadi Rum and Al Disi villages. As the experiment evolved into a broader vision for a “Desert Oasis,” where each camp would develop a touristic experience by planting Ghada around their camp to create green spaces in Wadi Rum, camp owners were reluctant to participate due to low tourist numbers, which made it a lower priority for them. The Seed of an Idea: Planting Al Ghada in the DesertThe initiative began with the reintroduction of the Al Ghada plant, a hardy shrub known for stabilizing sand dunes and thriving in harsh desert conditions. The idea was to offer tourists a unique experience, planting these resilient shrubs to connect with Jordan’s landscape in a meaningful, hands-on way. This eco-experience would positively impact Wadi Rum and provide visitors with a memorable and enriching experience.The idea evolved through consultations with local communities and authorities. It went beyond reintroducing a single species to a more comprehensive reforestation effort encompassing a wider variety of native plants. The Wadi Rum Reserve dedicated two plots of land for the initiative, signalling the start of an exciting new phase. However, challenges quickly arose, primarily around water scarcity and the logistical difficulties of transporting water to the designated planting sites.In response, the Lab shifted to planting around desert camps, creating green zones that would add patches of greenery throughout Wadi Rum. This redesign would have transformed the camps into stewards of these oasis-like spaces, motivating them to seek international eco-certification as part of their sustainability efforts. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen challenges affecting tourism in the region, the implementation of Desert Oasis has been put on hold for now.Key reflectionsLocal Community Engagement: The experiment's goal was to integrate local communities, particularly women, into conservation and ecotourism efforts. While the experiment may not have fully unfolded, the core idea of creating sustainable livelihood opportunities for local communities remains a valuable approach. This engagement could be essential in future phases.Reflection on Global and Local Impact: This experiment highlights the ripple effects of global and regional geopolitical crises on local economies, urging the need for more resilient and diversified economic strategies in regions that heavily rely on tourism.

Although the experiment has halted, the “Desert Oasis” idea remains viable. The challenges faced are not a dead end, but rather a detour that presents an opportunity to refine, rethink, and rebuild with greater resilience. The relationships established with local communities, the ideas ignited through this experiment, and the commitment to restoring Wadi Rum’s ecosystem are not in vain. These efforts can be revived and strengthened when the right moment arrives. For now, the desert waits, just as it always has.
