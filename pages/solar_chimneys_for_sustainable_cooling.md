> Type of the Solution

Passive Cooling System

> Description of the solution

A solar chimney is a passive ventilation system that utilizes solar energy to enhance natural ventilation. It is typically a tall vertical shaft with a glass roof that captures solar energy and heats the air inside, causing it to rise and draw cool air in from below. The rising warm air creates a natural convection current that ventilates and cools the building.
