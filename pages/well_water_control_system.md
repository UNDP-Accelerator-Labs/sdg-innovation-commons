The project addresses the problem of inefficient use and loss of water in Cuernavaca, where approximately half of the water withdrawn is wasted due to leaks and unequal distribution. A solution is proposed that involves metering an equitable distribution of water from wells to users through technology and components such as PVC piping, buckets and electronics for efficient control. The objective is to mitigate waste and ensure more effective use of water resources in the region.
