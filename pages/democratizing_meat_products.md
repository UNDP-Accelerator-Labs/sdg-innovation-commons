> Brief description of the innovation

PATH has identified an opportunity on the market-place to address demand from a market segment exploring an option to expensive meat products.  At the heart of PATH’s growth strategy, is the retailing of cold chain meat products (beef, chickens, pork and other butchery products) directly to the end consumer, in value added form to be delivered through the enterprise’s retailing and distributor network.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It is estimated that 10 million people are living on US$5 or less per day in Zambia. 10 million low income people earning US$5 have a collective purchasing power of around US$100 million. This segment represents a market opportunity for PATH to add value to meat products at scale in Zambia for the middle to low income brackets of the population.

> Technical Feasibility

For the enterprise to penetrate new markets, increase profits and create jobs, it requires significant vertical integration of the enterprise’ processing and retail network to small holder farmers. The company seeks to create an extensive retail network in the Lusaka east area and beyond to include butcheries and fast foods outlets that will drive the sales of our cold chain food products.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our country has a rapidly expanding consumer base, driven by an emerging middle class and high levels of urbanization. However, affordability of meat products for low income consumers continues to be a challenge. There has been large reliance on import markets for meat products at lower income range as they are few Zambian alternative for processing high volumes of these products. This segment represents a market opportunity for PATH to add value to meat products at scale in Zambia and an opportunity to expand business across the country. The enterprise’ is focused on producing quality meat products for the middle to low income brackets of the population. The enterprise expects to create [29] new jobs for youth and women.
