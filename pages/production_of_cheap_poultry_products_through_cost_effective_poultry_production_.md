This innovation is about the production and provision of low cost poultry meat while being environmentally aware and striving for the reduction of carbon emissions and providing jobs especially for women and youths.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will not only generate income for me and the imployees but it will generate income for all bussiness partners on all levels. This will be done by providing cheap poultry products hence increasing the profit for the companies and people doing business with us.
The target market will include supermarkets, fast food companies, restaurants, hotels and shops.
The challenge prize money if I be awarded will be used for the implementation of this innovation plan and to diversify the poultry business.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation is highly convenient it will be achieved by constructing a poultry house and the maize milling machine, as the milling plant is rendering a service to the people and generating an income it will also be generating by-products like maize bran which will be used as part of the chicken feed hence reducing the cost of production and instead of buying chicks we can just buy chicken broiler eggs and use a solar incubator to reduce the cost even further.
And the by-products of the production such as manure will be used for the growing of organic vegetables.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will reduce unimproyment by providing jobs, reduce protein deficiency diseases and conditions like stunted growth, malnutrition and provide a great source of protein to people at an affordable price while contributing to economic development .
The market for poultry products is readily available and highly relevant, As Zambia end up importing poultry products due to the demand for these products which we can produce locally.
