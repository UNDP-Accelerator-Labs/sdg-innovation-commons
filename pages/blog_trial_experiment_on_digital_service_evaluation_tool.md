UNDP has been, since 1973, working with the Royal Government and people of Bhutan to accelerate the country’s development results through innovation, digitalization, development financing, partnerships, cutting-edge global knowledge and technical expertise.
Mr. Mohammad Younus took on the role of the Resident Representative, UNDP Bhutan in November 2022.
Accountability is the obligation to demonstrate that work has been conducted in accordance with agreed rules and standards and report fairly and accurately on performance results vis-à-vis mandated roles and/or plans.
In order to achieve its mandate, UNDP relies entirely on voluntary contributions from UN Member States, multilateral organizations, private sector and other sources, in the form of unrestricted regular resources (core), and contributions earmarked for a specific theme, programme or project.
Our work in Bhutan is anchored in diverse and effective partnerships. We collaborate with a wide array of partners to leverage the range of skills and resources to better serve the development needs of Bhutan.
Integrated development solutions driven by country priorities and UNDP’s new Strategic Plan. Our Strategic Plan 2022-2025 introduces the evolution of #NextGenUNDP into #FutureSmartUNDP.
Putting nature and the environment at the heart of development and advancing climate action remains the core of our partnership with Bhutan.
COVID-19 has changed Bhutan's socio-economic landscape. UNDP is helping Bhutan build forward better, greener and stronger.
Working to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment for green, equitable, and inclusive development.
Towards a smooth transition from the Least Developed Country category and progress on Sustainable Development Goals and Gross National Happiness by strengthening the effectiveness, inclusiveness and accountability of governance system and institutions.
Supporting Bhutan in its endeavor to become more agile, resilient and anticipatory to find new, innovative and inclusive ways of doing development as it recovers from the COVID-19 crisis.
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), otherwise known as the Global Goals, are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.
Our stories highlight our work, impact and results on the ground, focusing on how Bhutan is tackling development challenges and moving the SDGs from paper to practice.
A one-stop shop for multimedia press coverage and in-depth information on development-related issues. We provide news, announcements, press releases and statements by UNDP leadership.
UNDP publications showcase the organization’s thought leadership and expertise and play a key role in fulfilling our mandate to support the realisation of the SDGs and encourage global development.
Our blogs are written by our team drawing on their experiences working with the communities in the areas of climate action, inclusive governance and strategic innovation.
Core is a general fund; it's flexible, unlike money labelled for specific projects. UNDP's core resources have profoundly impacted development across Bhutan and the world. Explore some of the stories funded by core resources.
Our projects drive innovative solutions and sustainable actions on the ground, showcasing how UNDP Bhutan partners with communities and stakeholders to address development challenges and translate the SDGs into real, lasting impact.
UNDP works in more than 170 countries, helping achieve the eradication of poverty and reduction of inequalities and exclusion. We help countries develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, and institutional capabilities, and build resilience in order to sustain development results.
As a public organization entrusted with donor funds and committed to supporting developing economies, UNDP works to improve access to quality assured supplies in a cost effective and reliable way.

In February 2021, UNDP collaborated with the Royal Civil Service Commission (RCSC), Public Service Delivery Division (PSDD) under the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and Gross National Happiness Commission (GNHC) to innovate the ways in which we interact with the community in improving public service delivery.
A systems approach was undertaken to gather insights on the elements that influence public service delivery. The approach helped recognize the inter-dependence of the multiple elements interacting in the service delivery ecosystem. It eventually led to the portfolio of interventions which includes 1) co-designing and experimenting with the digital service evaluation tool to enhance accountability 2) co-creating and testing the training module to build an empathy based public service 3) testing the involvement of service users in improving accessibility to service centres and 4) shortening the service delivery process by revising service delivery standards.
The report highlights the learnings from the design, test and use of digital service evaluation tool.
