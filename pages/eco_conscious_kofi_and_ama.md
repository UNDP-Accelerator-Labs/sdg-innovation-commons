## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The AccLab used behavioural insights methods to design experiments which focused on driving changes in behaviour, increasing take-up of plastic segregation and recycling, and thus improving waste management. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If people are exposed to specially designed nudges, in the form of information interventions based on behavioural insights at "behavioural hotspots" in their communities, they are more likely to take up and maintain plastic segregation/recycling 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Over 3 months in late 2020 and early 2021, quantities of plastic deposited, and perceptions of existing and potential segregators, were studied. Bins were also monitored at two similar "control" locations.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Community recycling bins.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Weigh the quantity of plastic collected from each bin, aggregated on a weekly basis. Interviews and focus groups with those who segregate and recycle their plastics.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months for the actual experiment, but took 6 months to get necessary approvals

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

50% of experimentation time and 25% of solutions mapping/explorer's time.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven. Over the 3 month period, just over 1 tonne of plastic bottles was deposited at the 2 sites. At East Legon, almost 750kg was  deposited, about 59kg weekly, and an average 18% increase above a pre-intervention baseline of 50kg weekly. At Osu, almost 300kg was deposited, about 23kg weekly, and an average 44% increase above a pre-intervention baseline of 16kg weekly. Bins were  also monitored at two similar “control” locations, where amounts of plastic deposited did not vary much or showed some decline, over the experiment period.  These are very positive outcomes, particularly as they were achieved without financial or other incentive systems, pointing to untapped potential for segregation and recycling among households and businesses, and opportunities for green entrepreneurs and investors. At the experiment sites, bins were often full, and excess plastic was bagged separately. Over time, some segregators reported secondary behavioral effects, as their family and friends began to segregate their plastic.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Roll out to more fuel stations in a wider variety of areas with different socio-economic characteristics.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

9 months including: 6 months to get approvals from UNDP and the Private Sector partner, for the experiment to take place; and 3 months for the actual experiment.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

10,000 USD.

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Potentially. The project was featured in the Ghana National Plastic Partnership (GPAP) National Action Road Map - https://globalplasticaction.org/wp-content/uploads/NPAP_Ghana_Action_Roadmap.pdf - see Case Study 8, page 22 on Transforming Behavior.  The AccLab Experimenter has been invited to be a member of the Education Awareness Creation and Community Engagement Task Force of the Government led Ghana National Plastic Action Partnership, and we are contributing to the design of behavioural interventions nationally.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

These are very positive outcomes, particularly as they were achieved without financial or other incentive systems, pointing to untapped potential for segregation and recycling among households and businesses, and opportunities for green entrepreneurs and investors. Over time, some segregators reported secondary behavioral effects, as their family and friends began to segregate their plastic. Success factors include:  a) Co-creating and situating archetypes in local contexts: The archetypes helped people to see themselves in context, situating the plastic issue at an individual and community level, not just nationally or globally.  Billboards combined English with Ghanaian languages Twi and Ga, using the  phrases Fa Ye Adefofrↄ and Kε Fe Nↄ Kooklo, meaning “use something which exists  for something new”. Local communities were mentioned directly including “Osu  Man Bii [meaning people of Osu] – Don’t just throw your plastic away”).   b) Cognitive dissonance: We juxtaposed Ghana’s Independence Arch in the  background and litter in the foreground, suggesting gaps between aspirations  for clean communities and current realities. For some, this was a trigger to pay  attention

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Securing permission to work with the Private Sector companies who operate the community recycling bins.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Environment and Climate Change Cluster in UNDP Ghana Country Office.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Ghana National Plastic Action Partnership, part of the Global Plastic Action Partnership convened by the World Economic Forum, has  already included the experiments in Ghana's National Action Road Map, as an example of a local initiative to Transform Behaviour. The AccLab is also represented on a National Task Force to take forward Ghana's Road Map.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes. Refinement of the data collection method.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The Solutions Mapper and Explorer were involved in scoping the behavioural intervention during and following a UNDP workshop on Behavioural Insights in Tunis, visits to the experimental sites as well as design of the information posters used.
