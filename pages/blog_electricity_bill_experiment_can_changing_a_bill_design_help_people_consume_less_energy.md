Electricity Bill Experiment: Can changing a bill design help people consume less energy?
FEBRUARY 7, 2023
Jordan struggles with increased energy demand and limited resources to fulfil its needs. The scarcity of energy resources puts the country in a vulnerable position as electricity consumption has been steadily increasing while households consumed the largest share.
Accordingly, in 2019, the Jordan Accelerator Lab’s focus concentrated on household energy consumption, identifying the redesign of the electricity bill as a potential pathway to influence behaviour and reduce consumption.
The Accelerator Lab organised a competition to redesign the bill to see if it would enable people to consume less energy. The team selected and merged three winning designs, with one design ultimately making it to the testing phase. The team planned three experiments to test the efficacy of the new proposed bill design compared to the existing one, but only completed two of them.
