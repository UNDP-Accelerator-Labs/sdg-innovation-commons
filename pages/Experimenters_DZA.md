# "Unlocking Local Governance in Algeria: The Accelerator Lab's Experimentation Approach"

### [[0:19]] OK, So my name is Hanan Kaouane\. I am the head of experimentation for the Accelerator Lab, UNDP, Algeria\. And I consent to record this video\.

### [[0:27]] Perfect\. Over to you for the first R&D question\.

I can read\.

### [[0:38]] Yeah\.

### [[0:40]] Could you tell me about R&D activities you would like to share?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
Yeah, sure\. Actually, I would like to share an activity that we did it with the country office\. So it was supporting one of the biggest program at the country office\. It's called the Program Cabinet\. It's a program in partnership with the Ministry of Interior and financed it by the European Union\. Actually, it's a program about local governance where they were thinking at the end of the program\. So it's a program, it's a pilot program of five years\. So in the tour last years they were thinking about adding a component on developing local economy\. So they invited the accelerator lab in order to run an experimentation in this component\. So the experimentation was about applying in your method in the local communities and, and actually like to apply this method, but also to learn about this new methodologies\. As I mentioned before, it's a pilot program and the ministry, they want to do it in many different local communities\. In Algeria, they start only with seven places and during this experimentation we implemented only on five places\. So what was about actually we are in this project, they selected many NGOs and those NGOs they benefit from many trainings and capacity building, but all the financial support in order to implement project on local governance\. After this and after doing the evaluation of those activities, they noticed that when the funding and the financial support ends, the associations of the NGOs, they stop working on the field because they have a lack of financing but also a lack of Technical Support\. And since the project it's about local governance, which means that we need the participation of all the stakeholders into in the implementation of activities\. We were thinking about this new methods and we related directly with the local economy or by the creation of economic activities\. And what we did exactly is instead of having those NGOs as beneficiaries or direct beneficiaries where we support them technically and financially and they implement project, we identify them or we give them the role of facilitators\. So NGOs, facilitators, so UNDP, administer of Interior and the Union, European Union, we support them financially and technically\. But the NGOs, they will support the community in order to implement a project or activities that comes from the local communities or all the stakeholders\. I'm going to explain it more in the next questions\.

### [[3:46]] OK, You can skip around if you want\. You can go to here\. You just talked about that\.

Yeah\.

### [[3:55]] So let's say go to stakeholders just a little bit, pick one or two from this section and then we want the impact over here\. So who was involved in the in your journey and how did you ensure the best of what your perspective were considered?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[tactics:Hustle your gig]]
Yeah, actually I'm just going to take it a little bit personal and I say my journey during this program because it's one of the best experiences that I have lived like during my, my, my, my serve at UNDP and also at the accelerator lab\. So in my journey, first was my colleagues at this program\. So as you know, we are today hits at the accelerator lab and this program or this experience gives me the opportunity with to work with other colleagues from UNDP and from the program\. So they were in my journey and when I joined their program, they start explaining me about the local, local governance, about the democracy participation and about all white did in the three years of the project because I don't in the fourth year, fourth year\. And after my colleague there were the Ministry of Interior\. So each project at UNDP with the ministry, we have national director\. So I was very honored to work with the national director of this project\. So he was like here to give advices, to give a Technical Support, expertise and also a person who know very, very well the local context and also the policies and after\. And we are considering all the colleagues and the Minister of Interiors as our colleagues\. And then in my journey, I had also the opportunity to work with an expert on the local economic development\. But also the most and the best part is of the stakeholders is the people on the local communities, all the women who have like the skills to create something out from nothing, all the academia, the governance like local governance, the youth as well the artisans, the commercials\. So you can say, as I said, like it's a local governance\. So everyone was involved in this, in this experience, but also one of the most important actor is my colleague\. It's a local coordinator of the program\. She lives in the they OK, they were many like 5 and they live in the local communities and they are supporting they are our colleagues and they are supporting the project like from the feed\. So this were all the stakeholders\. I had also the opportunity to exchange also with the financing of the project the some representative from the European Union\.

### [[7:04]] So what where the were there any specific tactic or approach you're using to engage stakeholder?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
Yeah, of course\. Actually we were having let's say three parts\. The first part it's our colleagues at the country office and in the program\. So you are or I was having the role of supporting the program, which means I'm a new in a team and the team exists like for many years and I came to support them\. So that was very, very important to know and to identify from the beginning\. The second, let's say, segment is the Ministry of Interior or the governance or the local governance\. And here it's a little bit difficult where we need to be like very careful on our way of working, especially that the government give us like trust us on implementing the activities and we need to listen\. And also when implemented, we need to include them on this\. And we're having also the third segment, which is the beneficiaries in the local community where we are there in order to implement or in order to support them to implement activities that response to their needs and not our needs\. So the tactics here with the three different segments was different\. So with the colleagues, we had to show support, but also we had to show that we don't know much about the project\. We need you\. Even if we are expert on experimentation, we need your support\. Without you, we can do nothing\. For the government was the active listening\. It was very, very important to listen to their expectations, but also very to listen very carefully to the policies\. For the stakeholders was empathy\. It was very important to observe and listen to them and also include them on what you are doing because sometimes we just interpret things on our way, depends on our background\. But when we implement the activities, we realize at the end that this is not what they need and this is not what they want\. So it was very, very important to include them on those activities\. This is in order to have like a the last result, something that they need and we achieve our goals\. But also it was to keep their motivation to do something like in order to make them feel the active citizenship\. They make them feel that this is their local community, their country\. If they do something, it's for them\. And we are just passing like in this program\. So today we are here, tomorrow we are not\. So we had to make them feel that it's, it's their projects, it's not ours\.

### [[10:12]] So the last one, yeah\. What strategy or approach did you apply to facilitate the division and adoption of your R&D?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Trust]]
Yeah, actually since it was a project on like it was an experimentation supporting a national program, we didn't have much, we didn't have much like freeness to share about the project and about the content\. Because it was like very clear communicated by the ministry that nothing will be shared until the end of the of the project and the closing of the project\. But also this will be very managed by the ministry\. But we found that another, another way\. So we were just trying to negotiate with the partners and we did the first thing we did the human story\. So I was very, very honored to be in the field from a place to another one travelling for I remember it was travelling for two weeks like nonstop from a place to another one, from a bus to train to an airplane with the baskets, with the sandals, with the jacket, without the jacket\. So the different places, the weather was changing, the people were changing\. But I was saying that the impact and even the stories were changing\. So we had the chance to write a human stories and we publish it on, on UNDP Algeria websites and on this human stories were telling how this project changed people lives\. And we were seeing the impact and we were seeing the change\. As I told you in the beginning, that was the first time I was seeing change like happens in one year\. I was seeing householders, I was seeing artisans, women or youth or or men or marginalized people because the project we were applying the we are like, we were focusing on the inclusivity like and leaving the one behind\. So it was like saying those persons who had, let's say, the potential, the knowledge, they were having many natural resources, but they didn't kind of know how to create something valuable from this\. So at the end, we were saying how they were motivated, how they were learning so fast, being so flexible on implementing things and creating jobs for themselves and for others\. And we were seeing how house like single mothers, they were supporting each others, how huge they were supporting other marginalized people\. So we're seeing a real democratic participation, but also solidarity in order to stand up with an activities and especially like economy activities, because that was the objective of our experimentation\.

### [[13:20]] Thank you, Hannane, thank you\. Good work\.

Thanks\.
