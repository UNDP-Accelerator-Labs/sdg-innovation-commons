Design, Diversification and Marketing of Kente Products
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that kente weavers in Agbozume are struggling to make a living due to poor weaving management, high input costs, low profits, and limited product designs. The middlemen and cross border sellers are taking the profits away from the weavers, leaving them with little reward for their valuable and culturally significant trade.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The history of the challenge faced by kente weavers in Agbozume can be traced back to the exploitation of the middlemen and cross border sellers who are taking profits away from the weavers. The kente weaving industry is significant in the cross-border Ewe region between Ghana and Togo and holds cultural and historical value, yet the weavers themselves are not being fairly compensated for their hard work. The root cause of this challenge is the lack of control that the weavers have over their trade and the value chain. They are unable to set their own prices, negotiate better deals on imported yarns, and have limited access to surrounding French-speaking markets. This allows the middlemen and cross border sellers to dictate the prices and take most of the profits. The current situation shows that the weavers hold high value for their traditional weaving methods, but unfortunately, that value is not reflected in the prices they receive for their products in local or international markets. Therefore, they are not equipped with the skills and knowledge to improve their livelihoods and their position in the value chain. Multiple parties are involved in this challenge, including the kente weavers themselves, the middlemen and cross border sellers, the input providers such as yarn sellers, the local government through the Ghana Enterprise Agency and the Association of Weavers in Togo, as well as various organizations and institutions. This situation has undesired effects, including the perpetuation of poverty among the kente weavers, the erosion of cultural and historical values, and the exploitation of vulnerable communities. The weavers are not able to provide for their families, invest in their businesses, or grow the kente weaving industry in the region. The undesired effects of this challenge threaten the sustainability of the kente weaving industry and the well-being of the communities involved. This situation has undesired effects, including the perpetuation of poverty among the kente weavers, the erosion of cultural and historical values, and the exploitation of vulnerable communities. They can't support their families or improve their businesses, putting the future of the industry at risk.

> 

There are available research surrounding the Kente value chain in and around Agbozume? But for this project, we dedicated time for a baseline survey to obtain the key data to finetune our work given the lack or absence of updated (official) data on the matter. January 26 and 27, 2022, 50 weavers from the association and the surrounding areas answered the questionnaires after a presentation of the questions in the local Ewe language. https://www.academia.edu/22683484/Senas_research https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354224229_Socio-Cultural_and_Economic_Importance_of_Kete_Weaving_in_Agortime_Traditional_Area_Ghana

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The UNDP Accelerator Labs bring a unique value proposition to solving the challenges faced by kente weavers using collective intelligence methods and agile approaches based on ethnography. By bringing together a group of weavers facing similar issues, the Labs can increase their weight on the value chain while organizing their efforts to find better solutions to serve their community of trade. This approach is faster and more streamlined than that of other units within the country office which have more of a top-down approach to development work. Also, with the ability to work together across borders, the Labs (especially of Ghana and Benin) are well positioned to solve common issues faced by kente weavers and improve their livelihoods.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the key constraints faced by the kente weavers of Agbozume in improving their livelihoods and how can they be addressed through innovative solutions and trainings? What are the best practices and lessons learned from other Acclabs in improving livelihoods for informal cross-border traders and communities? How can the UNDP-ABC and local partners effectively collaborate to implement and sustain these solutions for the benefit of the weavers in Agbozume?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The co-creation and collective intelligence methods allow for a more inclusive approach in answering the learning question and finding solutions to the challenge. By involving all relevant stakeholders, a deeper understanding of the challenge and more effective solutions to overcome it, should be achieved. The peer exchange method will complete the two others by helping to build through the Kente association to be put in place, a supportive network for the kente weavers of Agbozume and allows for a collective and inclusive approach to problem-solving, learning, and improving in their trade.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The existing data gaps addressed using primary data sources like surveys, observations, direct interviews, and focus groups are the lack of first-hand insights and experiences of the key stakeholders and end-users. By combining these methods with co-creation and collective intelligence, the UNDP Accelerator Labs in Togo and Ghana can gain a more holistic and inclusive perspective plus an in-depth understanding of the challenges faced by the kente weavers in Agbozume. The value added by these sources of data is that they provide a more nuanced, yet precise understanding of the challenges faced by the kente weavers, allowing for targeted and effective solutions to be developed. The insights gathered through these methods can inform the training modules and solutions created by the communities, ensuring that they are tailored to the needs of the weavers. Furthermore, these sources of data can be used to monitor and evaluate the impact of the solutions, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement over time.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

First off, our work fits into the mandate of the UNDP Borderlands Center and its mandate. There is no doubt that lessons learned can help inform future projects and initiatives. Secondly, solutions tested and proven through this initiative could be picked up by other weavers in the region and informal crossborder traders and communities in general. Sharing experiences and techniques and the insights from the trainings provided through the association could help improve productivity hence profitability. Thirdly, national trade organizations, development agencies, and local governments can act as champions and partners in promoting and scaling up the solutions developed since they are by design inline with the needs of the constituents and potential target communities for development projects. Additionally, private sector partners, such as trading companies and supply chain managers, will benefit from the improved livelihoods and increased efficiency of the informal cross-border traders and communities through the products woven.
