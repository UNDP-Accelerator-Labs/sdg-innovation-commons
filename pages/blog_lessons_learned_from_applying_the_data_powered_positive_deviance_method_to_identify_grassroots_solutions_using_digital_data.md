Executive Summary

This report presents six learnings from four pilot proj-

ects conducted by the Data Powered Positive Deviance

(DPPD) initiative, a global collaboration between the GIZ

Data Lab, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network, the Uni-

versity of Manchester Center for Digital Development, and

UN Global Pulse Lab Jakarta. The pilots seek out grassroots

solutions to development challenges that range from the

interaction between livestock farming and deforestation

to gender-based violence and insecurity in dense urban

environments in Ecuador, Mexico, Niger and Somalia. The

learnings relate to the early stages of the DPPD method,

originally proposed by Albanna & Heeks [1], and focus

mainly on the access to, and use of digital data. They are

summarized as follows:

Four
Pilot
Projects

W e are testing the DPPD method with local teams in Ecuador, Mexico, Niger and

Somalia to respectively identify grassroots solutions to the interaction between

livestock farming and deforestation; gender-based violence and insecurity in dense urban

environments; cereal production efficacy and efficiency; and optimized rangeland man-

agement (Table 2). At the time of writing this report, the four pilot projects have reached

the end of the quantitative analysis phase (Stage 2 of the method—Table 1).

Agricultural practices are one of the main causes of deforestation in

the Ecuadorian Amazon region. Ninety-nine percent of deforested

areas are transformed into agricultural land, sixty-four percent of

which is used as pasture land for livestock farming and other pur-

poses (REDD+, 2016 [4]).

The pilot project in Ecuador engages with cattle farmers in

the Ecuadorian Amazon who operate in areas of potential forest

clearance for farming without themselves contributing to defor-

estation. Positive deviants are defined as cattle-raising farms with

deforestation rates that are significantly lower than what might be
expected for three consecutive years. Using the DPPD method, our

goal is to identify sustainable farming practices and scale them to

reduce the negative effects of livestock farming on deforestation.

We identify potential positive deviants using land cover and

land use data derived from satellite imagery, as well as climate, soil,

socio-economic and cattle vaccination data.

DPPDMexico

In November 2019, Mexico City’s mayor issued a gender-based vi-

olence alert, activating a series of measures to reduce violence

against women. On average, ten women are murdered per day in

Mexico, and in 2019 more than half of those femicides occurred

in public spaces (UN Women, 2020 [5]). Violence against women

occurs on the street, in parks and, to a lesser extent, on buses,

minibuses and the subway.

The pilot project in Mexico looks into factors contributing to

lower rates of outdoor violence against women and girls. Positive

deviants are defined as geographic areas, so-called AGEBs*, that
have lower incidents of outdoor gender-based violence than what

might be expected, given their socio-demographic and economic

initiatives on what factors might contribute to the design of safer

public spaces in Mexico City.

Towards

agricultural
productivity
in Niger

Sustained agriculture in Niger is under tremendous pressure as cli-

mate change and the reduction of rainfall affect crop cycles. Crops

mature in a drier context, which reduces production quality and

aggravates food insecurity. In the broader Sahel region, more than

four million people are food insecure, and 80% of lands are at risk

of degradation (WFP, 2018 [6]). In Niger, 1.7 million people are es-

timated to become food insecure in 2021 (WFP, 2021 [7]).

The pilot project in Niger aims to identify and scale practic-

es of positively deviant cereal-growing communities that produce

healthy yields of sorghum and pearl millet. Positive deviants are
defined as cereal farming villages that have higher quality pro-

duce than what might be expected, given their agro-ecological

conditions. Our goal is to identify and leverage the local practices

and strategies driving this outperformance to inform the design

of interventions that can support communities in increasing their

agricultural productivity.

We identify potential positive deviants using readily avail-

able earth-observation and administrative data.

Repeated droughts in Somalia between 2010 and 2017 have caused

more than a quarter of a million deaths, and contributed to the

displacement of roughly 4.2 million people.

The pilot project in Somalia aims to identify positively devi-

ant pastoral communities that are able to sustain the health of their

surrounding rangelands despite the recurring droughts. Positive

deviants are defined as community rangelands that are healthier

than what might be expected, given local climatic conditions. Our

goal is to build on local knowledge to help communities understand

how they might preserve their rangelands in order to maintain their
pastoral livelihoods.

We identify potential positive deviants using vegetation and

climate data along with administrative land cover data.

Six
Learnings
from the
Pilots

T en months into the pilots, all teams—including the global coordination team—took

the time to reflect on the work accomplished and the lessons learned from it. This

activity was supported by a number of learning formats, including documentation calls,

four online sharing sessions with all teams, and various online surveys. While the global

team was responsible for compiling and curating the learnings presented here, they are

the result of a collective effort. This section presents the six major learnings that emerged

from this process. They are illustrated with examples from the pilot projects and highlight

how the learnings might inform future DPPD work.

Learning 1:
Remain
flexible
in the face
of data un-
availability

10

What we learned

The core idea behind the DPPD method is to leverage digital data

to identify potential positive deviants. This assumes that relevant

data are available, accessible, reliable and usable. However, in con-

texts like the ones in which our DPPD pilots are being conducted,

digital data is often scarce, and data landscapes are incomplete if

not entirely non-existent for specific development issues.

All four teams experienced difficulties in accessing data.

Several had to adjust their project designs to be feasible, seeing

what data was available, accessible and reliable. In some cases,
they had to adapt their way of measuring performance, while in

others, they had to simulate units of analysis (hypothetical village

boundaries), as no precise data was available. These adjustments

however, did not change the domain or regional focus of the pilots.

How we learned it

In Somalia, we initially set out to find pastoral communities in the

West Golis region that were able to maintain their livestock size

throughout recurring droughts. We hoped that understanding their

positively deviant practices could contribute to bending the curve

of internal climate migration. We mapped several available data

sets, based on our initial understanding of pastoral activities in the

region. These included mobile phone data to see mobility patterns,

and community-level vaccination data to count livestock.

Unfortunately, setting up the necessary partnership with a

local telecom company turned out to be impossible, which meant we

could not get access to the mobile phone data. In addition, the high

level of aggregation of the accessible vaccination data prevented any

meaningful statistical modeling. After looking into several alterna-

tives, we decided to pivot the focus of the project away from count-

ing livestock to measuring the health of community rangelands, a

key factor in maintaining livestock. We assumed that rangeland deg-

radation and overgrazing were in fact the main threats to pastoral

livelihoods, as these would be among the main drivers of livestock

depletion. If it were possible to identify positively deviant commu-

nities that preserved their rangelands through severe droughts, we

could help scale up these livelihood-sustaining practices. This new

direction was mainly driven by data accessibility—in this case re-

motely sensed vegetation indices that reflect the health of range-
lands—but the general focus on pastoral livelihoods was preserved.

What we take away

When applying the DPPD method, the problem to be addressed

should drive the project design and provide guidance on the data

required. However, necessary data might be unavailable, inacces-

sible or unreliable. Thus, viewing data as a mere technical aspect

that can be accounted for once the project implementation has

begun can result in substantial challenges.

11

There is value in mapping out data landscapes early on as it can help

determine whether the DPPD method is applicable. However, there is

a tension between the relative rapidity of the mapping exercise, and

the lengthy process of securing access to available data, and ensur-

ing its reliability. Put simply, the mapping exercise may indicate that

data exist, but it does not guarantee they can be used. The difficulty

then is to maintain a focus on the problem, i.e. the development

issue to be addressed, as time and resources are spent on efforts to

secure access to and validate data, without the guarantee that these

will succeed; while properly pondering the temptation to reframe

the problem according to whatever data are readily accessible.

We advise to remain flexible and creative in dealing with

a potential lack of data, and to be open to adjusting the original

project design based on how accessible and reliable certain data

sources are. When data is entirely missing for a given issue, it might

be possible to look for proxy measures in so-called alternative data

sources. However, it may also be that DPPD is not suited for the

project at hand.

What we learned

The DPPD method requires access to very specific data from a

number of different sources at high levels of granularity. While

in some cases, data might initially appear to be readily-available

and usable, it may well be unsuitable for the identification of pos-

itive deviants because of low granularity and/or coverage. Indeed,

highly granular data is seldom publicly available and often only

accessible through partnerships with holders of the raw data, like

government entities or private companies.

While our four pilots used different strategies to get access
to adequate data, one common learning emerged: integration of

the pilots into pre-existing programmes and partnerships with rel-

evant stakeholders and data holders significantly accelerated the

process of identifying and accessing relevant and usable data.

How we learned it

Our pilot in Ecuador is a case in point: it was integrated early on with

the UNDP ProAmazonia programme, which already had a multitude

of partnerships in place. This made it possible to access granular

cattle vaccination data from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Agriculture,

detailed training sets for land cover analysis from the Ministry of

Environment and cadaster data from the national agricultural survey.

What’s more, preliminary results were repeatedly present-

ed to government partners for feedback. Throughout these interac-

tions, insights emerged on new sources of data that could be used

for the pilot, suggesting a strengthened interest of external stake-

holders. This led to increased access to quality data for the team.

Overall, the pre-existing partnerships accelerated access to a range

of different datasets, and facilitated analysis and interpretation.

What we take away

Access to adequate secondary data poses a challenge for all de-

velopment initiatives. This is particularly true when working with

the DPPD method, as it requires both data that can be used to

infer individual or collective performance, in addition to data that

describes their contextual realities. The data further needs to be

sufficiently granular to establish a norm for similar individuals or

groups, so that deviance from that norm can be identified.

We stress that the different data sources used must overlap

spatially and temporally so that they can be integrated. Spatially,

the coverage of the contextual data should be broad enough to

include all units of analysis whose performance is being measured.

Temporally, the contextual data should be recent and longitudinal

enough to enable the identification of “true” positive deviants, i.e.

positive deviants that remain so over time, not just at a specific

point in time, as the latter could be confounded by random effects.

Learning 3:
Map and fill
know-how
gaps early

What we learned
Access to the right data is essential to the DPPD method. Howev-

er, simply looking for potential positive deviants in data without

understanding the contextual specificities that might make one

outperform their peers, or how these might show in digital data

can easily lead to wrong conclusions.

While a considerable amount of know-how was already

present in each team, additional data analysis skills, local domain

expertise and an understanding of the local data ecosystem were

necessary for each pilot. All four teams had to consult with or recruit

13

analysts who were able to combine quantitative data skills with an

understanding of the specific local context.

How we learned it

The team in Niger included two analysts with domain-specific data

expertise. This proved very helpful not only for assessing what data

was available, but also for selecting adequate data sources as well as

appropriate performance indicators and sampling strategies. With

the help of the analysts, we were able to decide on a particular sub-re-

gion of Southern Niger where rainfed sorghum and pearl millet were

mainly cultivated. We also learned that the soil-adjusted vegetation

index (SAVI) was more suitable for arid climates than other, similar

indices we had originally focused on. Finally, we realized it was im-

portant to narrow our investigation temporally to the local rainy sea-

son, in order to reduce possible confounds related to intercropping.

What we take away

Performance and underlying practices of potential positive deviants

need to be understood within the country- and domain-specific

contexts investigated. This requires a multidimensional analysis

that considers socio-economic, cultural and structural factors that

might affect the “positive” outcome—and that might do so differ-

ently across countries, regions or even communities. Specific know-

how is needed for determining the right performance indicators

and variables to look into, as well as for analyzing the data in more

than a descriptive way.

We advise bringing data analysts and local domain experts

on board early to move quickly from brainstorming and abstract

conceptualization to iterative, integrated and grounded analyses.

What we learned
The conventional Positive Deviance approach looks at small sample

sizes in largely homogeneous contexts. For example, a few dozen

families in a single village. This is very powerful for singling out

and detailing particular behaviors that might explain successful

practices, in part because non-behavioral factors can largely be

disregarded since they are more or less the same for the entire

observed population.

Learning 4:
Scale
with
caution

14

We initially assumed that by using large amounts of digital data,

we would be able to simply transpose the principles of the conven-

tional Positive Deviance approach to larger sample sizes and geo-

graphic areas. However, we learned that using such data implied

greater heterogeneity and therefore, more possible confounds.

For example, more geographic coverage meant a higher level of

abstraction and an increased difficulty to determine whether “pos-

itive” outcomes were in fact due to certain practices, or whether

they were simply due to a combination of contextual factors.

How we learned it

In Ecuador, we used remote sensing data to calculate the deforesta-

tion rates of a large sample of cattle raising farms. However, farms

were of all shapes and sizes, and we found that cattle density was a

likely a driver of deforestation. Indeed, a higher cattle density could

put pressure on farmers to expand their pasture. We had to control

for this confounding factor to ensure a fair and meaningful com-

parison between farms, and to be able in the end, to attribute low

deforestation rates to sustainable cattle farming practices—not just

to an imbalance in the number of animals and the size of the land.

Unfortunately, we identified additional confounding factors

that we were not able to control for, as the data did not exist, or

because we were not able to access it. For example, the type of

farm production system, whether beef or dairy, or the fact that

some farmers rented out parts of their land.

What we take away

Contextual factors, from access to roads and other infrastructure,

to levels of rainfall and hours of sunlight, differ significantly across

places and populations, and these factors are sometimes sufficient
for explaining the differences in performance among individuals

or communities.

To increase the likelyhood of identifying “true” positive de-

viants at the scale afforded by digital data, we advise to choose

groups with similar contextual factors that might affect perfor-

mance, while controlling for confounding factors and/or applying

intermediary techniques like homogeneous grouping. These strat-

egies can help ensure that identification is based on relative perfor-

mance, not absolute performance. Doing so increases the chances

15

that the “positive” outcomes are due to individual- or group-level

factors that are not structural or contextual, meaning, they can

more likely be transferred and amplified within the communities

of identified positive deviants.

What we learned

Digital data is often collected at regular intervals over long periods

of time. This opens the possibility for longitudinal observations of

positive deviance, and of variations or consistency in deviance.

In most pilots, we were able to distinguish between individ-

uals or groups who became positive deviants (from low perform-

ing to high performing), who remained positive deviants, and who

stopped being positive deviants (from high performing to low per-

forming). We learned that consistent positive deviants over several

years of data were more likely to be “true” positive deviants.

How we learned it

In Ecuador, Niger and Somalia we conducted longitudinal investi-

gations to identify positive deviants that were able to sustain their

relative advantage over time. After engaging with local domain

experts in Ecuador, for instance, we found that the average cattle

lifecycle (from farm to fork) was three years. It wouldn’t be possible

to judge whether a farm had reached its maximum cattle density

(triggering deforestation), while still preserving forest proportion,

without analyzing deforestation rates throughout this lifecycle.

“True” positive deviants were thus farms that were able to maintain

low deforestation rates for three consecutive years.

What we take away
Being able to identify who is a positive deviant over time, who be-

comes one, or who stops being one can inform on the determinants

of high performance, but also on factors that might reduce positive

deviance or evoke any other transition from one deviant state to

another. Further, we believe that by observing contextual factors

and performance over time, it will be possible to better under-

stand the sustainability of positively deviant practices, as well as

their interaction with other extrinsic factors (not indvidual or group

practices or behavior).

17

What we learned

Digital data, and more generally secondary data, can inform on

the activities and behaviors of human beings, but also on the en-

vironments and settings in which these take place—whether the

urban infrastructure, the public service systems or the policy and

regulatory mechanisms that govern them. The notion of positive

deviance in the DPPD method is therefore not necessarily limited

to human practices or behavior.

Throughout the initial design stages of our pilots, we sought

to ensure that differences in performance could be traced back to

positively deviant practices. We controlled for non-behavioral fac-

tors, such as a more suitable climate for agriculture or greater fi-

nancial endowment. However, we learned that “positive” outcomes

often depend on a range of extrinsic factors such as programmatic

interventions, infrastructure or government policies. Identifying

these factors and understanding how they enable or contribute to

positive deviance can provide a suitable basis to design nuanced

interventions that take these interactions into account and thus

increase their possible effectiveness and contextual fit.

How we learned it

In both our pilots in Somalia and Mexico, we conducted initial data

analyses and held conversations with local domain experts to map

a range of factors at individual and systemic levels that likely inter-

act and enable specific practices.

In Somalia, we learned that preserving rangelands required

good practice at a community level—for example, for soil and water

conservation—as well as at a higher, government-level—for land

tenure policies and campaigns against private enclosures. Under-

standing these different factors and how they worked together
turned out to be crucial for assessing the conditions in which com-

munities lived—and especially the challenges they faced—the re-

sources they were able to access, as well as other factors that might

have inhibited or enabled the emergence of positive deviance.

In Mexico City, we focused directly on positively deviant

public spaces that had lower crime rates than others, instead of

trying to identify individuals or communities that might have been

less prone to act out violently against women and girls. We had to

work with the limitations of reported acts of violence—lower re-

ports do not necessarily mean lower incidences of violence—but we

controlled for a range of variables that were likely to contribute to

the safety of public spaces. Ultimately, we were less concerned with

individual behaviours and more with how certain features of the

physical environment, for example lighting, the existence of alarm

buttons or economic activity, might have led to the emergence of

positive deviance.

What we take away

Seeing that the notion of positive deviance in the DPPD method can

go beyond the behavior of individuals or communities, we recom-

mend that DPPD interventions focus on more than just adapting

practices. For example, an increase in crop yield can be due to ap-

plying an existing fertilizer in the “right” way—a practice that can

indeed be identified and scaled. However, it can also be due to the

introduction of a new fertilizer—a non-behavioral factor that can still

be scaled. Even non-behavioral factors that cannot be influenced

like the level of rainfall can be compensated, for instance through

the usage of irrigation techniques. Further, if positive deviants are

non-human entities like public spaces, we advise to focus on how
structural attributes like infrastructure or governance mechanisms

affect their “performance”. Note that this will also affect the selec-

tion of data sources and types.

Ultimately, we believe the DPPD method is a good tool for

addressing complex development challenges, as it enables the

identification of both behavioral and non-behavioral factors that

contribute to a “positive” outcome, and thereby provides a suitable

basis for the design of nuanced interventions that seek to “influ-

ence” multiple factors simultaneously.
