> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The La Miel Microgrid Project began with the supply of energy in September 2018 through two diesel engines. With the plant in operation, the company undertook the conversion of the plant to a hybrid photovoltaic system - batteries - diesel engines, a project that culminated in June 2019 with the start of the supply of clean energy to the community, leaving the engines as a source of backup power. The project was executed with co-financing from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), through Loan Contract No. 3692/OC-PN "Innovation Program for Social Inclusion and Productivity", having been the Company benefited by the Program of Promotion of Research and Development of the National Secretariat of Science, Technology and Innovation (SENACYT).

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- No

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Proven implementation of product, service or process at scale

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

It is the first example of a hybrid micro-grid in Panama that combines fossil fuels with a photovoltaic energy.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?
