> Anticipated Social Impact

We believe more thank 50,000 will benefit from this project  cause it will save time for the students instead of travelling 5 hours to buy freshly produced food they will only wait for an hour or less to have it delivered meaning they will save 4 hours to study.
Money will be saved currently each a student uses k10 in transport to buy food that multiplied by 100 is 1000 being wasted.

Our market is worthy 750,000 monthly this is when we multiply k15 by 50,000
