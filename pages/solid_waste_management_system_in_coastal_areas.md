## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Solid Waste Management System with Coastal Area Municipilities
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



The daily waste generation in Banias is 70 tons in winter and 100 tons in summer, transported 8 km away to disposal sites. Over the past 12 years of crises Banias has faced infrastructure damage, equipment loss, and the retirement of numerous waste management employees. Major challenges include inadequate sanitation vehicle maintenance, limited fuel and resources, a shortage of neighborhood containers, and the lack of household waste sorting. These issues collectively hinder the effective implementation of proper waste management strategies.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



These challenges are significantly impacting the overall well-being of Banias, with repercussions extending to the city's economy and various socio-economic facets. The environmental consequences are particularly concerning, as the mismanagement of waste poses a threat to diverse life forms and species in the area. Furthermore, it adversely affects the sea and marine life, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive solutions to safeguard both the city's prosperity and its ecological balance.



> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab will collaborate with the coastal area team to craft a digital waste management system. A human-centered design methodology will be employed to ensure the system aligns with genuine needs of users, effectively tackling challenges. The Digital waste management system aims to enhance operational efficiency, optimize the management of scarce resources, and diminish environmental impact, thereby contributing to a more sustainable and effective waste management solution.
