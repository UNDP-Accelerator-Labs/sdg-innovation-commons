## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

National Innovation Summit, Publication and Ecosystem Building
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is on enabling the ecosystem for innovation and lead to policy shifts and commercialization of research and development landscape in Malaysia with partnership from various stakeholder. Awareness building and promotion of 'low tech high impact' innovations with grassroot participation is of particular focus. .  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The innovation ecosystem in Malaysia is fragmented with different ministries working in silos and duplicating initiatives for different innovation stakeholders. The pathways for innovation growth eg. from start up and small enterprises to medium enterprises and unicorns are often unclear and confusing for the innovator community. Issues on double dipping for innovation funds often occurs due to lack of communication and collaboration among government agencies. The current landscape also focuses a lot on high tech and digital solutions with the aspiration to drive Malaysia's IR4.0 towards a high income nation. This often leaves out grassroots innovations that solves actual problems at the grown and causes unsustainable solutions to community challenges.

.        According to the National Survey of Research and Development (R&D) in Malaysia 2019, less than half (43.9%) of R&D expenditures come from business enterprises, while 38.2% of total R&D funding originated from the business enterprises.  ·       Malaysia should also direct investments and policy direction towards developing and retaining local talents that can contribute to the growth of Malaysia’s R&D ecosystem. The country also recorded 5.9 researcher per 1000 labour force, which is comparatively low to Japan’s 13.9 researcher per 1000 labour force, or to South Korea’s 17.4 researcher per 1000 labour force.  ·       Almost 80% of research today is being conducted in higher learning institutions, with just over 9,000 patent applications made in Malaysia between 2013 and 2022, according to data from the World Intellectual Property Organisation. This is however, a fraction of the 120,000 research publications Malaysia has produced in the same period[3]. This is a signal that while new inventions and innovations were developed mainly by the higher learning institutions, they require support – mostly, in terms of larger monetary contributions - to translate their ideas and research into concrete outcomes.  ·       Further, the return on Ideas, or ROI, can be improved. According to the Malaysia Knowledge Economy Study, every 1% increase in innovation capacity increases a country’s GDP per capita by 0.36% and for Malaysia, an increase in innovation production could translate to US$1.21 billion (RM5.06 billion) additional to the country’s GDP of US$336 billion.  https://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/wipo_pub_gii_2021/my.pdf [2] KPMG. 2021.

The challenges faced by the innovators were documented during the Impact Measurement and Management (IMM) sessions and Social Impact Challenge Accelerator with our government partners. The workshops and accelerator were attended by more than 35 start ups and social enterprises who expressed their challenges in navigating the local innovation ecosystem to commercialise their R&D. Futhermore, interviews were conducted with 20 innovators screen and selected from 180 over solutions submitted by 7 ministries to be included in the inaugural innovation publication- Publication can be found here: https://www.epu.gov.my/sites/default/files/2022-09/Malaysia%20Innovates%202022_1.pdf.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

UNDP Accelerator Lab was sought after by the Economics Planning Unit due to our expertise in innovation, SDG, sustainability and engagement grassroot communities and CSOs. We were tasked to map out sustainable solutions, develop a screening matrix for solution selection to be showcased in the publication and summit with the aspiration to bring together all the ministries in improving commercialisation rates of R&D and innovation prototypes that contributes to economic development  in a green and resilient manner.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Partnerships for SDG in the works with 7 ministries and 50 over innovators across Malaysia brought together for an Innovation Summit and Publication in a never seen before scale. Over 1310 participants with 50 booths from across Malaysia with 44 international and national speakers participated in the event.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How do we ensure a coherent innovation ecosystem that benefits the local grassroot community in tackling pertinent issues and support sustainable economic development?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-create with government agencies and other stakeholders in the innovation ecosystem to map and showcase solutions in a summit and publication. In the process, horizon scanning and sensemaking on key industry and areas in relation to 12th Malaysia Plan  is required to make an impactful event and publication with follow up actions between collaborators. Community asset mapping was also done in UNDP projects to showcase grassroot innovations that bring about social change with sustainability and community resilience as a focus.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Solution Mapping and ecosystem mapping- There are currently no systematic mapping of solutions among the different agencies and ministries who are working with different types/levels of innovators and enterprises.  Sensemaking, direct interviews and qualitative interviews, qualitative and quantitative data, stakeholder engagement - conducted with selected innovators to understand the ecosystem gaps and curate key messages with key speakers during the summit to influence paradigm shifts in policy that supports the innovation ecosystem. Participatory and collective approach -  Ministries, private sectors academia and CSOs are invited to co-design the summit sessions, exhibitions and publication.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Grass root innovators will benefit from the promotion of their work to other stakeholders for potential partnerships and scaling opportunities, eg. government grants and impact investors. This also helps to synchronize and align the innovation initiatives among the different ministries and agencies. The research and management unit (RMU) in the Economics Planning Unit is key collaborator that will allow UNDP to incorporate cutting edge innovation methods and sustainability into the ecosystem.
