Innovative

> Description of the solution

High-performing envelopes (the parts of a building that separate the indoors from the outdoors, including exterior walls, foundations, roof, windows, etc.) are the most effective way to reduce the thermal needs of buildings. Compared to other solutions, the selection of envelope structure and materials is particularly important given the long lifetime of buildings and the cost of construction. High-perfomance enevelopes can reduce demand by 30% to 50%.
