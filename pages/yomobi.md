Project focused on youth unemployment, data collection in the field during Covid-19 lockdown, food security, and supporting the informal economy in urban informal settlements. The project has trained youth in collecting data on a task-based application to gain a better understanding of vulnerability and food insecurity in communities in Gauteng. Identified vulnerable households are provided with an emergency relief voucher via an e-wallet which they can redeem at recognised retail outlets. Informal shops and traders have also been registered to be able to redeem these vouchers, thus supporting the informal economy during the exacerbated vulnerability caused by Covid-19.
