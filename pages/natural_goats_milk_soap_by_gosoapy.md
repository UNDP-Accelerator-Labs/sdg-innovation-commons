GoSoapy is producing a natural Goats Milk Soap in the Nakivale Refugee Settlement in Uganda. Thousands of goats exist in the camp, however goats milk has not been used at all. The social enterprise provides an additional income to refugee goat farmers by buying their milk as one of the main ingredients for a luxury goats milk soap. This enterprise is part of the Social Innovation Academy (SINA) community
