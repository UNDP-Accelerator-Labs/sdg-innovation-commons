> Title of the innovation

Restoring the long list confidence in the Education system

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation hopes in restoring back the long lost confidence in Education system due to lack of employments for educated due to power given to caders.
Due to lack of employment parents prefer their children to become caders rather than going to school. This is due to the fact that the graduates are not respected in the societies as much power were given to caders rather than the educated.
Therefore, my project will not only be helpful to me but also to many unemployed graduates out there. Because it wishes to bring back that long lost confidence and awarenes on the importance of education in both parents and learners so as to reduce rates of drop out.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation, will generate income to me and community at large in that, the school will be opened meaning that the little that the learners will be paying it will enable me to have some income, not only me but also other members of staff.
To add on, when the number of the educated increase in the community and the their acquired skils  are appreciated it helps the community to develope to the higher heights. In that even the attitudes of such members of community will have positive impacts to the community .

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is designed in such a way that it must suit all levels of children in the community. This is done my ensuring that the fees to be paid by learners to be minimal so as to suit all learners with different background.
My implementation plan, is that as soon as possible to find a free building and rent it, then print out the forms and fliers to start the awarenes compaign so as to let people know how important it is for every child to have access to education.
Application forms to be accessed by all members of community hence it has to be sold at a very cheap price.
As soon as the people enroll with us to start giving the learners the best education because that's what they deserve.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It can improve people's lives as it going to reduce the levels of unemployment in education sector so as to boost up the confidence that was lost when there was no difference between the educated and uneducated.
Bearing in mind the fact that petauke district have few secondary schools my innovation will help in creating space for every child to have access to education. By so doing it will reduce congestion in public schools as the fees will be almost the same.
