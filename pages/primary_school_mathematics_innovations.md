> Title of the innovation

Primary school mathematics innovations

> Brief description of the innovation

Different and simple ways of solving mathematical problems in primary school

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It will me generator income in the sense that I will compliment different innovations in primary school mathematics and sell them to different schools and also by teaching this mathematics at a few to those who are interested to learn.

> Technical Feasibility

these are designed from local materials and are made using hands, no complicated processes. They can be implemented by exposing the to primary school pupils

> Anticipated Social Impact
