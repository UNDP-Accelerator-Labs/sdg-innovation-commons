The innovation will focus on Product Engineering and Business Development
And It will take 3-6 months to come up with a working prototype.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our targeted employees are youths from low-income homes who will be groomed in various skills to help their families as well as contributing to the economy as well as helping the younger generation realize the importance of going green.

The ZEMI innovation will focus on local delivery companies and will offer lifetime support to every investor/partner or client. hence business continuity is guaranteed.

With the unstable prices of fuel and electricity, city logistical companies are not working efficiently. Hence our first Prototype is a fully designed and Zambian-made delivery e-bikes. Frames and Body Panels are made locally while electronics will be imported.
The proposed implementation plan is quite detailed to fit in the 200-word limit.
