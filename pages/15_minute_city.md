> Description of the solution

Initially proposed in 2016 by Carlos Moreno, the ‚Äú15-Minute City‚Äù is an urban model that allows everyone, in every neighbourhood, to meet most of their daily needs within a short walk or bike ride of their home. Among other objectives, it aims to reduce unnecessary and unwanted travel and promote a modal shift away from private vehicles, delivering all the rewards of green and healthy transport and cleaner air. Overall, the goal is that of building safer, more resilient, sustainable and inclusive cities, as depicted in the Sustainable Development Goal 11. The concept has been adopted by Barcelona, Bogot√°, Melbourne, Ottawa, Paris, and Shanghai.

> Socio-economic effects

Increased accessibility to services, local economic development, health benefits from both active modes of transport (walking, biking, etc.) and improved air quality.
