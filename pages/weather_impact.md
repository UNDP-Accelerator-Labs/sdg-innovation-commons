Weather Impact provides agrometeorological forecast and advisory services to support smallholder farmer's decision-making. 

Our forecasts are available in various languages across Africa, Asia and Europe. We condense complex, real-time data into accurate, user-friendly text messages, via our own mobile app, existing apps, our website, or SMS. Our services support farmers in making decisions such as when to plant, fertilize or harvest. Weather Impact’s objective is to provide reliable local weather data which prevents climate related losses and helps optimize global food production. We forecast: daily weather, extreme weather, monsoon onset, seasonal weather outlook, and pest and disease risk.

Deployed in Angola, Burundi, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Myanmar, Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, Tanzani
