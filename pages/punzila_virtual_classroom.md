> Brief description of the innovation

Punzila Virtual Class is a platform that offers e-learning and teaching tools that include virtual space for live class, one-on-one tuition, recorded tutorials and chart-rooms accessible on any internet device. Punzila is accustomed to Zambia’s education system whilst designed to develop individual student capabilities.

How Punzila Works
Live Classroom: Teachers / lecturers login their account to either schedule classes, invite students, use whiteboard, post notes / assessments etc. Student’s login to attend or record lessons, ask or post questions etc.

Pre-recorded Tutorial &amp; notes: Students log-in to access notes, view or listen to pre-recorded tutorials of entire syllabus.

One-on-one or Small Group Tuition: Teachers and lecturers can be appraised and hired for private tuition in one-on-one sessions or small groups on the platform.

School &amp; Tutor Profiles: Punzila hosts profiles of learning institutions, self-employed lecturers and teachers accredited to the Teaching Council of Zambia that offer tuition services on the platform.

Chartrooms: University student chartroom’s are mainly for group study and research. High school students interact, socialize and study in class, career and club chartrooms. PTA chartroom is where high school teachers interact with parents, host meetings etc.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Uniqueness &amp; Competition
Punzila’s uniqueness lays in learning and training tools customized to Zambia. E.g. “pre-recorded tutorials” of syllabus and “K10 student monthly subscription” are unrivaled by Google class. Tools like “tutor appraisal” self-employs teachers in the tool “one-on-one tuition” that develops individual students. Tools like “whiteboard” surpass current use of social media where tutors can’t draft formulas or draw diagrams live.

Customers:
Tutors and students from low and middle income schools lacking e-learning and currently using inadequate social media.

Tutor Self-EmploymentPunzila creates self-employment to unemployed teachers and lecturers by linking them to students for online tuition services.

Revenue:
Punzila is sustain through monthly subscription of K10 per student and K20 per tutor. We offer “target advertising space” for universities, private schools, manufacturers of school shoes, bags, break-time snacks etc.

Challenge Prize UseThe prize will help market and build content like pre-recorded tutorials to improve user experience thus increase customers, revenue and growth. Will also localize our server to reduce operational costs.

Environmental Impact
Punzila reduces use of paper that is used in the manufacturing of note and text books as students use the platform. Reduced student travel on vehicles will minimize carbon emission.

> Technical Feasibility

Punzila has been developed as an ordinary web-based application that is friendly and accessible on any internet device through various web browsers such as Google chrome or mozila fire fox. It is stored and uses a remote server, application server and database. The web server manages the requests that come from our users, while the application server completes the requested task. The database is used to store any needed information.
Some advantages of the above simple system are:
Allows multiple user access to the same version of our application.
Does not need to be installed on our user’s device
It is accessible on any platforms such as a desktop, laptop or mobile phone.

Prior to scaling up our business plan, we intend to run a pilot implementation plan to determine if they will be need for any adjustments on the platform or additional improvements. For two weeks will be assess the true performance of the platform with one class of 50 nursing college students and their lecturers alongside a class of 45 secondary school students with their teachers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The trajectory for online education is here to stay as the world moves forward beyond COVID. Zambia’s low and middle income schools are struggling to transition not because e-platforms aren’t available. But rather it is because western platforms like Google class, Moodle or Astria are not locally adapted regarding design and cost. They aren’t designed for immediate use for a regular Zambian teacher, student or parent who have smart phones but aren’t tech savvy despite some platforms being free.

For this cause, Punzila is foremost adapted to the Zambian user and education system. Our platform requires less effort from the user whilst those like Astria and Moodle require a teacher or institution to setup a school learning portal.
Regarding cost, Punzila is affordable as we enlist teachers and pupils as low as K 0.33 per day.

We are persuaded to grant access to online-education for 4.4 million children in Zambia and their teachers. Punzila prevents children from social isolation during lock downs that lead to high dropout rates and exposure to violence and exploitation. This is so because Punzila is also a social hub through chatrooms like class, club and career.

Compared to the current use of social media like whatsapp where teachers just post picture of school notes, Punzila is interactive in that there is communication between teacher/lecturer and pupils/students. Some sessions can be delivered live, where learners can “electronically” raise their hands and interact in real time (e-learning NC, 2020). Our platform allows for structured course or learning experience delivered electronically. It also includes performance support content. 
We also include pre-recorded syllabus content, videos, quizzes, simulations, games, activities, and other interactive elements just as stated by the (Association for Talent Development, 2020)

Punzila improve quality of education by reducing teacher student ration from 1-to-40 to 1-to-1 for individual tuition and 1-to-10 for small group class tuition whilst creating employment for unemployed teacher and lecturers.
