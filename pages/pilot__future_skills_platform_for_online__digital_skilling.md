## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Klariska Moodley

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

13 March 2024

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Experimentation

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Unemployment

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Can digital skilling increase access to employment opportunities

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (Trial and erros, prototype, a/b testing)
- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)
- Experimental (Randomised assignment and/or control group)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Private Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Business Process Enabling South Africa - NGO

Private businesses offering facilities for training of staff, and offering employment of trainees post skilling. Including:

Volkswagen South Africa

Evolution

COEGA

Loomee Group

etc.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To asses:

1. If the skilling platform works - can it be used to successfully skill youth

2. Can basic and intermediary digital skilling result in increased employment for youth

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If youth gain basic and intermediary digital, then they are able to gain better quality employment. 

If the Future Skills Platform works as designed, then it can be used to upskill youth within the digital sector in South Africa, particularly within the global businesses services sector.  

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Assess/compare trainees' digital skills pre and post training

Assess employment status of trainees pre and post training (will require long term assessment for accuracy)

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

youth employment and youth skills

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Interviews and observations pre and post training

Date from skilling platform regarding completion of training and assessments

Interviews with employers post training and employment

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 year

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
