# Tanzania's Tourism Sector Builds Resilience with AI-Powered Insights

### [[0:02]] So tell me your full name, your title, and please say I consent to this recording\.

My name is Tabasa Rambuni, head of Experimentation\. I consent to this recording\.

### [[0:17]] Amazing\. Over to you for the interview\.

### [[0:21]] Hi Tabia, could you tell me about R&D activity that you would like to share with us?

[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
Yeah, I would like to share about an experiment that we conducted in the Xerreta Lab, Tanzania, working with the Zanzibar Commission for Tourism to analyse tourist sentiments from different tourist popular tourist websites and travel sites\. So Zanzibar is a semi autonomous part of Tanzania made\-up of two islands, Anguidia and Pemba\. And it is also one of those places that were really affected by COVID\-19 because it is highly dependent on tourism\. So the idea around this experiment was to build on the work that the country office was already doing on building resilience in the tourism sector in Zanzibar\.

### [[1:36]] So can you tell us how did it, how the idea did it came and where did it?

[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
Well, like I said, like I just said earlier, Zanzibar is highly dependent on tourism and it was highly affected by COVID\-19\. So we wanted to find ways to build resilience in the sector and competitiveness\. We had done preliminary studies and found out that the rate of return for tourists is really low for Zanzibar compared to other small islands\. So that was also adding was making the situation worse\. So first there these economic shocks that were unprecedented\. But again, the, the industry itself needed to have some sort of strategies to, to, to ensure that the sector is very competitive and productive because it is one of the most important economic sector for the, for the island\. It contribute about 27% of the GDP and it's also the major source of employment for Mozhanzibaris\. So that was the premise for us to carry out this experiment\. So we had started with a very a brief, I would say experiment whereby we worked with a private institution in Tanzania called Sense AI to to analyse feedback or reviews from tourist sites like booking\.com and TripAdvisor to see what is it that people are saying about Zanzibar\. And after that initial experiment, we shared the data with the Zanzibar Commission for Tourism and we built on this experiment to build a full, a full\-fledged model, which we are currently working on and it is in, it is in the final stages\. And this model now will go a step further and also extract data from again, populatory sites and analyse the data and provide insights through dashboards to policy makers\. But we also are potentially thinking of making this data available to maybe businesses so that they can make informed decision related to to strategies around tourism\.

### [[4:39]] Who was involved in your journey?

And yes, so for the initial experiment, like I said, we were working with Sense AI, which is specialized in AI and also other data related projects\. But we have also been working with the with the Zanzibar Commission for Tourism and currently we are working in the in this second phase of the project, we are working with SDG AI in Turkey, which is part of UNDP\. They are currently our technical partners supporting us in this work\.

### [[5:30]] Yeah, great\. So how did you ensure diversity stakeholders perspectives will consider and how did they input shape?

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
We have been working very closely with the Zanzibar Commission for Tourism because there will be the custodians of this solution\. So from the very beginning, we started involving them in the work\. We tried to learn what the issues are around the sector\. We also try to understand the business needs so that the initial product corresponds or responds to these business needs\.  
 So that is the process we have taken\. We have been having by month by monthly sprints and we have tried also to capture learnings from these sprints\. And we have been engaging the, the Commission throughout to make sure that we truly capture the, the we truly capture the, the business requirements and we translate these into the technical or technical aspects of the solution\.

### [[6:53]] So in terms of the tourism method, what tourism method is did you use to do what you just described online?

[[tools:Human centered design]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tactics:Human centered design to engage people]]
We've used, we've used a number of tools and methods\. It's AI would say it's a combination of, of tools and methods\. For example, we have, we have done stakeholder mapping to sort of have an overview of who would be potential users of this solution\. But apart from that we have also, I would say the human centered design has been has been like our our compass for this entire project\. We have taken that approach to also make sure that the entire solution is built on the principles or the basis of human centred design\. So we have used design thinking for example, but also we have been doing iterations because we have, we have used, we have, we are using the agile method\. So we have been having two sprints every month\. And in these two sprints, we are sort of see, we, we are able to see bits and bits of this solution\. So it is some sort of an incremental design kind of approach\. But apart from that, we have also, we have also been trying to capture the, the, the, the, the, the business needs as they evolve\. And we have also been communicating this to the technical team to make sure that they are adopted as the solution is being developed before the the final roll out\.

### [[9:11]] So also were were there any specific tactics or opportunities to use to engage stakeholders by him or at least resistance to work?

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
Yes, we we have been intentional in making sure that we get the buy in of the the critical stakeholders\. One of the ways we've done this is through, for example, hackathons bringing together the government actors who would probably find this solution useful\. But we have also brought together other actors from the private sector, from the CSO's\. So we we have tried to convene all these actors\. We have presented the prototype of the solution\. We have sold their inputs on the solution\. We have presented the technique or aspects of the solution\. We have also sought their feedback\. We have sought their technical capacity\. I mean their technical also insights for those who are like technical\. We have also involved the for example, the Ministry of Tourism so that they are also informed on what is happening\. So this is is one way we have we have we have done it to make sure that we get the buy in\. But we have also gotten to we have got we have gotten to ask all these different actors their insights and opinions related for example, to usability of the solution\. Also, we have also sought their their feed, not their feedback, but I would say rather their opinion on how they think or feel that we can scale this solution\. What are the other use cases, for example, we can develop from what we have at the moment so as to make sure that there is a sense of ownership, but also to start to work on scalability and ensure that the solution is sustainable in the long run\.

### [[11:43]] In terms of the principles, can you elaborate any principles that faded you and your work?Principles that kaded you work?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
Yes\. So we have, first of all, from the very start of the project, we have tried to make sure that we follow the principles of digital public goods\. So when we started working with the engineers, we made it clear that we would want at the end of the day, the solution to be open\. So in case another country maybe or another small island wants to adapt the solution, they can do that by just, you know, customizing what we have\. So we have made sure that we follow the principles of digital public goods\. The solution is interoperable\. It allows also other, for example, government agencies that would find this data useful to to connect to the to the solutions API and be able to make use of the data that is available\. But like I said earlier, we are also finding ways to make sure that we can make this data available to other actors in the sector and probably even including the the private sector once we figure out the proper business model that will work for that\. But at the moment, the the architecture of the solution itself allows for, for, for allows for the solution to be accessible and other actors to access the the data that will be made available in the platform\. But apart from that, as far as other aspects or principles, for example, digital transformation is concerned, we are also intentional in making sure that those will be using the solutions are equipped with skills, with the right skills to be able to use the solution\. And yeah, so those are the kind of things that we've done\.

### [[14:24]] Great\. So if you can't remember any skills, what skills were needed to effectively identify and understand the channels or needs that you are in the work aiming to adjust? So were there any skills needed, I mean to identify the challenge to understand the needs?

[[skills:Systems analysis]]
[[skills:Systems mapping]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
Yes, quite a number of them\. For example, you, you need to have systems thinking skills to understand the the landscape of the of the sector itself\. Like I said earlier, for you to be able to map use cases, you also need to kind to adapt a systems thinking kind of approach\. But you also need research skills for the initial, for example, to, to, to conduct, to, to capture the qualitative data that is present, to see what is already out there, what could work in this kind of setting\. There are also technical skills required even though at the lab we are not the engineers or the the developers of the solutions, but for this solution to come together, there is a need for technical skills\. Yeah, to so from we, we are sort of tapping that from the technical partners\. But we do also need like the basics, the basics of for example, design thinking to understand how that works\. How can you adapt a human centred approach and one ways to, you know, apply design thinking kind of skills, you also need skills around strategic foresight or futures thinking\. Because also for us to convince these, these different stakeholders on the importance of data in AI, at some point we needed to apply all sort of train them on foresight and futures thinking to see how data can play a role in, in guiding them to make informed decisions at the present with the future in mind\. So that is also important because with tools like AI, you are able to stay ahead of the game\. You are able to be proactive, to act proactively because you have like this solution allows you to have near real time data that allows you to see what is happening in the, in the tourism sector\. So with that, then you are able to act in advance\. You, you are, you are not being reactive, but you are being proactive\. So with for that, you know, to make sense, we needed to embed, you know, these foresight and and futures thinking kind of thinking\.

### [[17:51]] Last question\. Yeah, just one, I think I'm going to take one\. I would say impact and outcomes\. Yeah, and we will wrap it up\. So what was the outcome of your identity journey and how did you work impact, sustainable diploma?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Design]]
Yeah, at the moment we are not in a position to articulate or clearly measure impact\. But what I can say is we are already seeing momentum in what we are doing\. We have already, we have already observed or rather we have started to see other government agencies coming to us requesting for something similar, which is a validation that this could be of value for sustainable development and for evidence based police making\. But up we, we believe once this is rolled out and is out there will have a major impact in accelerating sustainable development goals\. Because as I said earlier, tourism is a important sector for Zanzibar\. And if we are able to to make sure that it's competitive, then we are we are assured of the sustainable livelihoods for Zanzibaris who depend on this sector for survival\. So we have time for\.
