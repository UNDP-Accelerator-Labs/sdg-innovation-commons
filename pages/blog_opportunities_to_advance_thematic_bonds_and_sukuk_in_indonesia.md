HIGHLIGHTS

This brief presents an overview of the current situation and highlights the

opportunities for Indonesia to increase the volume of thematic bond and

sukuk issuance that contribute to achieving the country’s commitment to

sustainability and climate agenda. This involves expanding the range of

bond types issued, such as Sustainability Linked and Transition Bonds,

and reaping the benefits of issuing bonds and sukuk in local currency,

considering

Indonesia’s economic growth

trajectory and other

macroeconomic factors.

Indonesia is a pioneer in issuing sovereign thematic bonds and sukuk

such as the Green Sukuk, SDG Bond, and Blue Bond, but the private

sector issuance of thematic bonds/sukuk is nascent, with most issuances

occurring in the foreign market.

Globally, there is an upswing in the volume of thematic bonds and sukuk

issuance, which can be attributed to critical factors, primarily the

confluence of ESG and Net Zero commitments, regulatory support, and

the burgeoning demand from sustainability-conscious investors.

Local issuers face cost and resource barriers to thematic bond and sukuk

issuance. These include developing a framework, undergoing external

review, identifying eligible projects, and complying with impact reporting

requirements.

Local investors are interested in thematic bonds and sukuk as they align

with ESG reporting and offer diversification opportunities within existing

portfolios. The Indonesian market has a growing appetite for new types of

debt instruments, alignment with international standards, and impact

reporting.

KEY STEPS IN
ISSUANCE PROCESS

O

nce a potential issuer decides to issue a thematic bond/sukuk, particularly tied to the

use of proceeds, it needs to undergo three stages, Pre-Issuance, Issuance, and Post-

Issuance.

Pre-issuance – This stage involves engaging stakeholders, framework development,

second-party opinion, and project selection.

Issuance – After the pre-issuance process and external review, the next step is

launching the thematic bond/sukuk into the market. This involves structuring the offer,

preparing the investor presentation, book building, pricing, and managing the

transactions.

Post-Issuance – The final stage in the issuance process involves an Impact Report

that seeks to quantify the environmental or social impact of a project/asset and an

assurance report on allocation of proceeds.

The details of the critical stages in thematic bond/sukuk issuance broken down into steps

are mentioned below:

ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS

To understand the market situation, the issuer needs to engage with stakeholders such as
regulators, investors, and international bodies to help understand the trends in the thematic
bonds, market demand, frameworks, and existing incentives. A feasibility assessment may
determine the issuer readiness to issue the bonds/sukuk.

9
ESTABLISH A THEMATIC BOND FRAMEWORK

A regulatory framework for thematic bonds/sukuk is critical as it defines green/social activities to
resolve ambiguity in the selection of projects. The framework assures investors of the use-of-
proceeds and avoids the risk of impact washing.

The current landscape of thematic bonds/sukuk is complex, with various thematic bond
guidelines and standards available in the market. Green/Social/Sustainability (GSS) Bond
Principles and Climate Bond Standards are the most adopted international guidelines for issuing
thematic bonds/sukuk.

According to the GSS Bond Principles, a GSS bond is defined as any bond instrument with
proceeds exclusively dedicated to finance eligible projects aligned with the four main
components of the Green Bond Principles: (i) use of proceeds; (ii) evaluation and selection
process; (iii) management of proceeds; and (iv) reporting.

IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE BUDGET ITEMS

Following the thematic bond/sukuk framework, the issuer identifies eligible assets from their
portfolio. The assets must be equal to or greater than the size of the bond/sukuk.

ARRANGE AN INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL REVIEW

Select an independent verifier to assess the thematic credentials of the bond/sukuk in order to
assure investors. An independent review can be a second-party opinion, third-party verification,
or a green/social rating.

A second-party opinion provides a view on the green/social aspects of the bond/sukuk from an
external expert, typically an expert on social and environmental issues. The consultation focuses
on reviewing the issuer's environmental and social criteria to select projects for funding. Issuers
are given some level of comfort that their 'green' or ‘social’ criteria are appropriate, and investors
can be confident that the issuer tends to invest the proceeds appropriately.

The GSS Bond Principles recognize third-party independent assurance as the most rigorous form
of assessment. Widely applied to financial and non-financial reporting, it is conducted by audit
professionals in line with national and/or international professional standards such as the
International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000) and relevant quality and
independent professional standards to ensure that the assurers are genuinely independent of
the bond/sukuk issuer. Third-party assurance gives investors the highest confidence that the
bond/sukuk issuer’s processes to track the management of proceeds or to report on outcomes
are robust.

10Key Steps in Issuance Process108 In addition, currently ISSA 5000 General Requirements for Sustainability Assurance Engagements is being reviewed and is expected to bepublished in 2024.

Issuance Stage

ISSUE THE THEMATIC BOND/SUKUK

After the pre-issuance process and external review is completed, the next step is launching the
thematic bond/sukuk into the market. When issuing thematic bond/sukuk, the issuers may
include their climate or social attributes in their marketing material and investor documents to
generate demand from sustainability-conscious investors. The issuance stage involves the
following five stages, as highlighted in the figure below :

MONITOR AND REPORT

An allocation and impact report is developed that seeks to quantify the social and/or
environmental impact of a project/asset through quantitative and qualitative information. The
allocation section details a list of projects funded by thematic bond/sukuk proceeds. Further, the
methods and critical underlying assumptions used in preparing the performance indicators and
metrics, including the impact created, are mentioned in the impact section.

ASSURANCE PROCESS

For this step, the issuer engages an auditor to evaluate the project selection process based on
the thematic bond/sukuk framework. The auditor also assesses the allocation of proceeds to
eligible environmental or social projects as disclosed in the impact report.

9 The issuance process is similar to a conventional bond. For further details please refer to this reporthttps://www.unescap.org/kp/2021/introduction-issuing-thematic-bonds11Key Steps in Issuance Process11
Case Study 1 :
Government of Indonesia’s SDG Bond

In September 2021, the Republic of Indonesia issued an SDG Bond worth EUR 500
million (USD 584 million). This was the first sovereign SDG-labelled bond issued in
Southeast Asia and the first issued in line with the Republic of Indonesia SDG
Government Securities Framework that covers green, blue, and social sectors.

10

The Indonesia SDG Bond has financed four projects across three sectors under four
ministries: health, education, religious affairs, and information and communication
technology. More than half of the proceeds (55 percent) were directed to the
education sector through scholarships for elementary school students, about a third of
the proceeds (34 percent) was allocated for basic vaccination while the remaining
amount (11 percent) facilitated internet access in Borderline Frontier, Outermost, and
Least Developed Regions in Indonesia.

UNDP worked in partnership with the Ministry of Finance during all stages of the
technical aspects of SDG Bond’s pre-issuance and post-issuance stage. This
collaboration included developing a feasibility study and the securities framework,
supporting the verification process, and the impact reporting.

Case Study 2 :
Bank Negara Indonesia Green Bond

Bank Negara Indonesia or BNI issued a green bond with a principal amount of IDR 5
trillion (USD 337 million) in 2022. BNI is the first national bank in Indonesia to issue
green bonds denominated in rupiah. The debt securities were divided into 2 series,
i.e., A Series, with a total principal value of IDR 4 trillion and a term of 3 years, and B
Series, with a total principal value of IDR 1 trillion and a term of 3 years. The average
coupon rate was 6.45%. BNI's green bond generated immense interest from investors
during the book building, and the bonds were oversubscribed by 3.1 times.

16

Prior to the Green Bond Issue in March 2023, BNI developed a Green Bond Framework
and engaged an external verifier to issue a Second-Party Opinion (SPO). According to
the BNI’s Green Bond Report published in June 2023, BNI has managed to allocate
77% of proceeds from BNI 2022 Green Bonds. The details of the allocation among
various sectors are presented below. The majority of the allocation is for Sustainable
Transportation (62%), followed by Waste to Energy and Waste Management (15%), and
the Renewable Energy sector (11%).

ICMA recognizes the importance of transition. Sustainable finance should encourage activities that contribute toward meeting the goals of the
Paris Agreement. In Asia, this type of financing can help companies notably in the fossil fuel industry and to hard-to-abate sectors to
decarbonize. ICMA’s Climate Transition Finance Handbook doesn’t define specific projects as transition, but rather gives guidance on an issuer’s
corporate level strategy, commitments, and practices to achieve its climate transition goals. In particular, ICMA’s guidance recommends that
companies adopt following science-based targets and national and sectoral frameworks for climate action. ICMA considers that transition is a
theme that can be financed by use-of-proceeds and sustainability linked bonds while acknowledging the use of an additional “climate transition”
label for bonds as is the case in some jurisdictions.”

Case Study 3 :
Bank of China Transition Bonds

Bank of China (BOC) is one of the largest Chinese state-owned commercial banks. It

has an extensive business and lending portfolio to clients across various geographies

and sectors. In line with the Government’s commitment to achieve an emissions peak

before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060, BOC has embarked on financing

transition activities to reduce the organization’s carbon footprint and carbon risk

exposure in credit portfolios. The transition strategy adopted by the BoC is science-

21

based and includes targets and pathways referring to the International Capital Markets

Association (ICMA) Climate Transition Finance Handbook.

In 2021, BOC issued Transition Bonds worth CNY 3.3 billion (USD 778 million) in the

offshore market. The net proceeds were utilized to fund eight Natural Gas based

Cogeneration Projects (92.2 percent of the total amount issued) and one Waste Heat

Recovery and Power Generation Project (7.8 percent of the total amount issued) at a

cement plant. The allocation amount and the annual GHG emission reduction is

Key Points

the

Several guidelines are available for transition bonds in the market – among which the
International Capital Markets
Climate Transition Handbook published by
Association (ICMA) is the most widely used. The document sets out guidance on
issuing a transition bond but is silent on when a transition label should be used.
Currently there is a lack of clarity regarding what constitutes a transition bond. This
lack of a clear set of definitions unfavourably impacts how investors perceive
transition-labelled bonds. Therefore, there is a need for more explicit taxonomy to be
developed in the market to define what constitutes transition bonds.
From interviews with underwriters and investors in the Asia Pacific region, there was a
common refrain that investors who are committed to ESG and sustainable finance tend
to view “transition” projects critically. With investors beginning to report sustainability
metrics, declaring “net zero” targets, and introduce exclusion policies for carbon-
intensive industries, they may be reluctant to put their capital towards transition bond
that is financing “amber” projects (which are still contentious under the ASEAN
Taxonomy) – while non ESG investors who normally invest in conventional Indonesian
sovereign bonds may still be interested in this bond.
Aside from concerns on transition washing, critics argue that the term 'transition
bonds' has been used to divert attention away from the actual mechanisms for
transitioning and verifying progress over time. Though transition is a relevant topic, a
new or separate label is not seen as necessary, and that the market should move
away from labels and only refer to ‘use of proceeds’ style bonds where targeted
impact is disclosed and the key outcome indicator – regardless of the proceeds.
It is therefore important for issuers looking to finance transition through transition
bonds to have a clear and science-based pathway
linked to their net-zero
commitments and aligned with targets in the Paris Agreement.

SLB offers flexibility as the issuer is free to use proceeds from such bonds (brown or
green), as long as it meets its sustainability improvement targets – in this case, the
proceeds can be used to provide financing support for instance to PLN to accelerate
the retirement of a certain number of coal plants within a specified timeframe, while
also specifying the projected emission reduction target from this activity.
issuers while providing scientific and
SLB offers flexibility and versatility for
measurable outcomes and impact for investors. There is also a market consensus on
their definition, alongside an established mechanism for reporting, which may reduce
the confusion within investment decisions. A few examples exist of countries (e.g.,
Uruguay and Chile) and businesses/institutions choosing this approach over transition-
labelled bond issuance to finance transition activities.
While sales of transition bonds have been slow in 2021, the issuance of sustainability-
linked bonds with climate-transition targets has been increasing – where more than 70
percent of the USD 15 billion of sustainability-linked bonds sold include climate
targets.
There are some concerns about SLB, regarding how ambitious the Sustainable
Performance Targets are, or the step-up coupon rate is not strong, but overall the
market views it as a credible instrument in the transition phase for companies.

Case Study 4 :
Uruguay Sovereign Sustainability-Linked Bond

Uruguay’s USD 1.5 billion Sustainability-Linked Bond (SLB), issued in October 2022 is

one of the first issuances of sovereign SLB. This SLB directly links the government’s

financing strategy and cost of capital to achieving Uruguay’s climate and nature-based

goals set under the Paris Agreement. The SLB embeds two Key Performance

Indicators (KPIs): (i) reducing the intensity of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in the

economy and (ii) preserving the area of native forests in the country. The KPIs are

measured by Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs) that align with Uruguayʼs first

Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) as shown in the table below. This bond has

a penalty/reward structure for performance, with a step-up in the coupon if targets are

missed and a step-down if they are exceeded.

To maintain transparency and accountability, the government requested the United

Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to act as external verifiers for both Key

Performance Indicators (KPIs). The External Verification Report concludes that the KPIs

were prepared according to the methodologies outlined in the sovereign SLB

Framework. The report also mentions that the KPIs adhere to the methodology and

good practices established in the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

(IPCC) Guidelines and the relevant provisions and guiding principles of the Methods

and Guidance (MGD) of the Global Forest Observations Initiative (GFOI). Further, the

data and information used in this report comply with the quality principles in terms of

Transparency, Accuracy, Consistency, Comparability and Completeness established by
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).25

Selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Following the SLBP, the KPIs should be: (i) relevant, core and material to the issuer’s overall business,

and of high strategic significance to the borrower’s current and/ or future operations; (ii) measurable or

quantifiable on a consistent methodological basis; (iii) externally verifiable; and (iv) able to be

benchmarked, i.e., as much as possible using an external reference or definitions to facilitate the

assessment of the SPTs level of ambition.

2

Calibration of Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs)

The calibration of SPT(s) per KPI is vital to determine the level of ambition and realism in structuring

SLBs. The SPTs should be ambitious, i.e. (i) represent a material improvement in the respective KPIs and

be beyond a “Business as Usual” trajectory; (ii) where possible, be compared to a benchmark or an

external reference; (iii) be consistent with the borrower’s overall strategic sustainability / ESG strategy;

and (iv) be determined on a predefined timeline, set before (or concurrently with) the issuance of the

bond.

An SLB framework should disclose target-setting details such as timelines for achieving targets, trigger

events, frequency of SPTs, and verified baseline/reference points for KPIs. The calibration process

should also consider recalculations or adjustments to the baselines, competition and confidentiality

considerations, and associated risks. The issuer's ESG and operating strategy should be described to

reach SPTs along with any other key factors beyond their control.

3

Bond Characteristics

The cornerstone of SLB is that the bond’s financial and/or structural characteristics can vary depending

on whether the selected KPI(s) reach (or not) the predefined SPT(s). Trigger events can impact these

characteristics, with variations in the coupon being the most common example. It is recommended that

these variations of the bond's financial and/or structural characteristics should be commensurate and

meaningful relative to the issuer’s original bond financial characteristics.

4

Reporting

To address transparency and accountability requirements, issuers of SLBs must publish, and keep

readily available and easily accessible the following documentation: (i) up-to-date information on the

performance of the selected KPI(s), including baselines where relevant; (ii) a verification assurance

report relative to the SPT outlining the performance against the SPTs and the related impact, and timing

of such impact, on the bond’s financial and/or structural characteristics; and (iii) any information enabling

investors to monitor the level of ambition of the SPTs (e.g., any update in the issuer's sustainability

strategy or on the related KPI/ESG governance, and more generally any information relevant to the

analysis of the KPIs and SPTs).

5

Verification

Issuers of SLBs should get their performance level verified against each SPT for each KPI by an external

reviewer at least once a year, and in case for any date/period relevant for assessing the SPT

performance leading to a potential adjustment of the SLB financial and/or structural characteristics, until

after the last SPT trigger event of the bond has been reached. The verification of the performance

against the SPTs should be made public and is a necessary element for the SLBP.

2727Key Components in Issuance of Sustainability Linked Bonds
KEY MESSAGES

A. Further incentives are required to drive local issuances

Sustainable finance is still nascent for local companies in Indonesia and requires

regulatory support in terms of incentives to catalyze the market. Though there are

existing incentives provided by OJK as mentioned previously, they are not considered to

be a deciding factor by prospective issuers to enter the market.

To help spur the market, some incentives to be considered are:

Financial grants to issuers for complying with thematic bond/sukuk standards

(developing framework, external verification, impact reporting);

Tax incentives, such as reduced or deferred tax, for issuers and investors involved in

thematic bonds to make them more financially attractive.

B. Building a local ecosystem of verifiers

As the domestic thematic bond/sukuk market continues to expand and evolve, there is

an ever-increasing need to ensure its integrity, transparency, and trustworthiness. One

pivotal aspect in achieving this is improving the quantity as well as the quality of local

verifiers.

While the role of local verifiers is indispensable, there are several reasons why

enhancing their capacity is imperative for Indonesia's bond market:

International Integration: As Indonesia's bond/sukuk market integrates more with

international markets, there is a need for local verifiers to understand and speak the

‘local language’ while meeting the global standards and expectations.

Market Trust: Enhancing local verifiers' capacity helps build and maintain trust in the

bond/sukuk market, both among domestic and international investors.

Market Complexity: The bond/sukuk market is becoming increasingly complex, with

a diverse range of issuers, products, and structures, as also aligned with the

continuous update of domestic market regulation. This complexity demands more

comprehensive and sophisticated local verification capabilities.

28

C. Guarantees for local currency-denominated bonds

Guarantees in the local currency bond market offer several benefits. Firstly, borrowers

can repay their debt using the local currency, which helps them protect against

exchange rate fluctuations. Secondly, borrowers can secure a favourable fixed interest

rate throughout the bond's life. Thirdly, borrowers can easily access capital markets,

D. Thematic bonds/sukuk have the potential to finance just energy transition and

sustainable development

With the current commitment to move towards just energy transition pathway, Transition

labelled Bond/Sukuk can be an alternative source of financing this effort. As no definite

framework or guidelines are available, issuers could consider using Green or SLB bond

principles following the ICMA framework. SLB will be more relevant for industries in the

brown sector and seeking a pathway to achieve sustainability.

SLB can be a useful tool to finance broader sustainability objectives such as addressing

social justice, reducing inequality, enhancing access to education and employment

opportunities, and achieving climate targets.
