## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To test a systems approach of simultaneous interventions, in order to tackle the indiscriminate dumping of waste in an inner city community. The system of interventions included mapping locations of households and businesses and studying their patterns of waste generation; encouraging households and businesses to register for waste-collection; raising awareness; reducing waste-collection charges and developing partnerships between the formal and informal sectors for the area. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If a systems approach of introducing different simultaneous waste-management interventions is adopted (as opposed to single-point interventions over time), then households and business in the inner-city community are more likely to respond positively along a number of defined metrics, leading to improvements in waste-management. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We supported the public and private sector partners in designing and testing different interventions in 405 households and businesses. Led by the Municipal Assembly, we encouraged all residents to register to have their waste collected by an outsourced waste-management company. Registration was through door-to-door mapping of households and businesses and residents’ use of waste-services (formal and informal).    As registration progressed, informal collectors were approached to partner with the waste-management company, either by continuing to collect waste or becoming streetcleaners with equipment (brooms and tricycles) provided by the company.     Following consultation with the community, a daily collection charge of 1 GHC (US$0.20) was introduced, aimed at balancing concerns about affordability with the private company’s need to cover its costs. Daily, weekly or monthly payment options are available to cushion the impact of these charges.   Designed more effective communication about waste. Instead of general messages about good sanitation, communication focused on practical benefits of registration. For example, what does registration mean for a market trader?    Conduct 30 interviews with the community and stakeholders, undertake observation, and analyse administrative data on waste-collection.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

individual households and businesses in a community

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Interviews, observations and analysis of administrative data.

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes.   By involving members of the community in the process of registering with the waste-management company, registrations jumped from 2% to 64% of the community in 3 months.    As registration progressed, informal collectors were approached to partner with the company, either by continuing to collect waste or becoming streetcleaners with equipment (brooms and tricycles) provided by the company.  In this way, some informal collectors have maintained their incomes while contributing their detailed knowledge of waste-management in the area.   Following consultation with the community, a daily collection charge of 1 GHC (US$0.20) was introduced, aimed at balancing concerns about affordability with the company’s need to cover its costs. Daily, weekly or monthly payment options are available to cushion the impact of these charges.     Effective targeting of communication about waste was also key. Instead of general messages about good sanitation, communication focused on practical benefits of registration. For example, what does registration mean for a market trader? Practically more frequent waste collection (twice a day), making markets more attractive to potential customers; and waste bins located sufficiently close to be accessible but far enough to reduce unpleasant smells.  

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

5000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

No due to a lack of funding.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

The private waste-management company was not recovering its costs, in providing services to a low-income community. Generally, revenue from low-income communities is heavily subsidized by revenue from high-income areas.  These interventions are best seen as a medium-term “investment”, using registration and charging as routes to secure a focus on proper waste management, gradual changes in behaviour, and thereby reducing the costs of keeping the community clean in the longer term.    Instead of “either…or” debates about formal or informal waste-collection, blended “both…and” partnerships can work on the ground. In Accra, rapid urbanization has already made these old dichotomies less relevant. Innovative minds are leveraging cross-sectoral knowledge and innovation to test different partnership models (including very loose arrangements).   Clearly, there are limits to what partnerships alone can achieve, without tackling behaviour. Mapping, registration, charging and targeted communication may appear to be merely traditional policy responses, but they also provide ways to gradually change behavior by encouraging new waste-management habits. The key is involving the community and stakeholders in defining jointly and realistically which new habits are desirable and sustainable in the community’s unique circumstances.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Covid-19 restrictions.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Environment and Climate Change Cluster colleagues in the Ghana Country Office who reviewed drafts of the blog, and then arranged for the findings to be shared.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Government, civil society and the Private Sector.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Take the time to observe activity in the community - don't believe everything you are told by the authorities or the community. Check facts.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The Solutions Mapper and Explorer were involved in community visits.

> What surprised you?

1. At the time of the study, it cost local businesses about 2 GHC ($0.40) daily to have waste collected by the formal sector - the informal sector charges about 50 pesewas ($0.10). Unsurprisingly, informal collection is a very popular option for waste disposal.  2. A frequent narrative is that high unemployment and the relatively low start-up costs of informal waste-collection attract the unemployed to waste-collection – a positive outcome for employment. Competition among waste-collectors then drives costs to residents down – also a positive outcome for the community, but with unintended consequences. Where income (from collection) cannot cover costs (of transport to transit points and then landfills) some collectors may resort to dumping.    3. Residents also described many instances of indiscriminate dumping by other residents, which is not helped by weak enforcement of sanitation byelaws. Despite some notable successes, enforcement remains a challenge as dumping is often clandestine, occurring at night or coinciding with heavy rainfall when waste is thrown into gutters. This also leads to a “waste-attracting-waste” phenomenon, where piles of waste can quickly mushroom into public dumpsites.
