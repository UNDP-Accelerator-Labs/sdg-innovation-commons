## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. It is critical to differentiate between the digital transformation at national and corporate level but at the same make sure that the "in-house digital transformation" is aligned with the national priorities for digital development.   2. Such alignment should become the basis for the Activation Plan on in-house digital transformation to be led by well-organized Task Force in the CO.    3. Within the Activation Plan specific directions to be indicated to optimize the process:  3.1. Institutionalization of the efforts  3.2. Digital Readiness Assessment  3.3. Introduction of "Digital by Default" principle  3.4. Harnessing innovative data for development    4. Chief Digital Office is a great team ready to support our internal efforts and align them with the corporate policies   5. Data in terms of digital transformation should be also differentiated as "mission-focused data" and "in-house data"; based on that diverse skills of the staff members to be developed.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes. The barriers mostly refer to the fact that in-house digital transformation is a relatively new sphere for the CO, thus, this is the real exploration.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There was a need to dive deep in understanding the key consequences and barriers for digital transformation of the CO.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Sensemaking allowed to conduct preliminary analysis and find potential entry points and low-hanging fruits to accelerate digital transformation. System Thinking helped to find multidimensional approach to digital transformation and find partners for collaboration.
