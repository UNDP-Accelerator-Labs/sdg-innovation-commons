## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Eventhough the project never took off as Acc labs role kept on diminishing:

Focus on beneficiaries: The importance of understanding and meeting beneficiaries needs is crucial for the success of public service projects.

Use of technology: The integration of technology can improve efficiency, accessibility and user experience for public services.

Collaboration and partnerships: Effective partnerships between government agencies, private sector, and community organizations can lead to better outcomes and innovations, in this case the partnership between UNDP, TBI and the Government of Zanzibar was a key success factor

Data-driven decision making: Using data and analytics can inform and improve decision making, as well as increase transparency and accountability.

Agile project management: An agile approach can help to quickly adapt to changing requirements and prioritize value for customers.

User involvement: User feedback and involvement in the design and delivery of public services can lead to better outcomes and increased satisfaction.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

This exploratory engagement was integrated into the process of establishing Zanzibar's Presidential Delivery Bureau. UNDP Tanzania was instrumental in assisting with HR and capacity building for the newly hired team. The Acc lab's role was to assist the project's Innovation component. The Tony Blair Institute's primary role is to keep the bureau operational. We are currently unsure whether the services of the Acc lab will be required in the long run.
