In 2022, Mauritius made
considerable
progress in socio-economic recovery despite
the challenges posed by the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions and
persistent supply chain disruptions impacting
global economic activity, with expected growth
rates of 7% for the year.

Of note is the impressive recovery of the
tourism sector, which saw 862,560 tourists by
November 2022, following the lifting of travel
restrictions and government measures to attract
high-value visitors in the short, medium, and
long term. To maintain this positive momentum,
the Government prioritized sustainable growth,
focusing on system resilience, promoting a
sound business climate, and attracting quality

DIRECTIONS
OF CHANGE

supporting countries towards three directions
of changes: structural transformation,
leaving no-one behind, building resilience

SIGNATURE
SOLUTIONS

througth six signature solutions: poverty
and inequality, governance, resilience,
environment, energy, gender equality

ENABLERS

enhanced by three enablers:
strategic innovation, digitalization,
development financing

This combination will help UNDP continue to deliver what it does best: integrated development solutions driven by country priorities

The programme continued to rollout business continuity through e-government enhancements including
support to Statistics Mauritius and the Registrar General.

In line with the National Determined Contributions commitments, Mauritius continues to invest in
ecosystem resilience and to implement its renewable energy ambition of a 40% reduction in GHG
emissions and 60% renewable energy in the electricity mix by 2030. The UNDP energy portfolio was
expanded during the year to include the commencement of the GEF Electric Bus Transportation project
alongside the ongoing GCF Transformation to a Low Carbon Economy project. Of note, has been the
provision of capacity development for women in the renewable energy value chain in partnership with
the Government of Australia. In terms of climate action, adaptation and resilience, the UNDP-AF Coral
Restoration, GEF Invasive Alien Species and EU-funded E€OFISH project continued to contribute to
coastal resilience, sustainable livelihoods for fishing communities and natural resource management.

In 2022, the UNDP strengthened its programme by focusing on three directions of change regarding
structural transformation, leaving no one behind and building resilience. The programme contributed
to all six of the signature solutions using enabling tools in strategic innovation, digitalisation and
development financing and by expanding our portfolio to include technical advisory support and
policy analysis, leveraging local, regional, and global resources, and capitalizing on opportunities for
development impact in an upper-middle- income context.

The Mauritius Country office hosted a high-level country visit of Ms Ahunna Eziakonwa, Assistant
Secretary General, Assistant UNDP Administrator and Director Africa Bureau. Her visit coincided with
the African Economic Conference, co-hosted by the Government of Mauritius in collaboration with the
African Development Bank, UN Economic Commission for Africa and the UNDP; and with the UNDP
Senior Economists retreat. The visit was a first in a significant period and provided the opportunity
to showcase the continued contribution of the UNDP within a upper-middle-income context; and to
reaffirm the UNDP’s commitments to the development challenges and opportunities in Small Island
Developing States (SIDS).

Contribution to the
Directions of Change

The UNDP multi-country office supported the rebound in tourism, with policy
reform measures to reposition the sector informed by a UNDP-supported
strategy and action plan. The multi-country office also contributed to efforts to
integrate the economy into the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA),
with research and analysis, and the formulation of a national strategy and
dialogue on the participation of women-owned businesses in trade.

The UNDP continued to promote resilience by investing in climate mitigation
and adaptation through the establishment of an Automatic Digital Management
System to amplify the energy ambition; and initiated a programme to promote
electric bus transport. 4.2 hectares of coral reefs were restored to protect
coastal zones under the AF-funded coral restoration project.

Government co-financing was received to implement the eHealth programme
aimed at providing integrated health data and patient access to quality health
services across the island and achieving an inclusive health sector through
structural transformation.

The focus on leaving no-one behind was through inclusive programming.
In addition to empowering women in trade, solar PV kits were provided to
low-income households and women and youth trained on solar PV energy
systems. Fisher folk capacities were strengthened to enable participation in
the value chain, while restoration of coral reefs was implemented with local
community groups. In partnership with the Government, NGOs, civil society
and the private sector, Stockholm+50 consultations raised awareness of over
1,300 citizens about their role in addressing the triple climate crisis – climate
change, nature and biodiversity loss and pollution.

Contribution to the Moonshots

The UNDP multi-country office in Mauritius supported a National Strategy and Costed Action plan to
address multi-dimensional poverty and a Gender Responsiveness Plan for Women Entrepreneurship
Development which identifies 8 key priority areas to position women in regional trade. These initiatives
contribute to moonshot target 1 - Helping people to escape out of multidimensional poverty.

Contributing to address multidimensional poverty, over 200 fishers were skilled in livelihood improvement
and sustainable fishing in the lagoons, while 117 people (32 percent female headed households) were
skilled in coral restoration activities. About 30 unskilled & unemployed women, from 2 regions ranking
low in the Relative Development Index, were trained in Income Generation.

The UNDP promoted private capital investment through the launch of the SDG Investor Map for Mauritius
which identifies 6 priority sectors with 17 Investment Opportunity Areas where commercially viable private
sector solutions can address development needs at scale. This will deliver on the 17 SDGs and contribute
to moonshot target 4 – Promoting public expenditure and private capital investment in the SDGs.

Women participation
was central to the
coral restoration
efforts along the
South-East coast
of Mauritius.

Enabling Social Workers and
Public Institutions to Fight Poverty

The UNDP Country Office in Mauritius partnered with ENL Foundation (ENLF) on the “Stepping Up”
project. Implemented between October and December 2022, the project aimed at empowering
30 unskilled & unemployed women from Le Bouchon and L’Escalier, two villages with low rankings
according to the latest Relative Development Index, through a Capacity Strengthening Journey &
consolidating women income generating, educational & sustainable agricultural initiatives.

To meet the project’s objectives, a needs analysis was carried out during the project’s inception phase.
Based on the findings, the women were invited to participate in discussions on self- knowledge,
communication skills, emotions, and conflict management. Additionally, a Psychosocial Support
Programme was implemented, and the women engaged in peer-to-peer exchanges with role models
from other communities.

Under the “Stepping Up” project, existing infrastructures were consolidated, and equipment and
materials were provided to support agricultural activities. The project also included “Art Therapy”
sessions for 29 children between the ages of 6 and 12.

Supporting Women’s Empowerment
in Business and at Community Level

A 6 percent decline in the number of new women-owned businesses was observed from 2018 to
2022 in Mauritius. Consultations with public and private stakeholders have revealed that women
entrepreneurs in Mauritius face challenges in terms of profiling, access to markets and finance,
and scaling their businesses. In response to these challenges, the UNDP multi-country office
has partnered with the National Women Entrepreneur Council (NWEC) to organize a workshop
aimed at creating opportunities and encouraging women to enter the agri-food entrepreneurial
ecosystem. The workshop, attended by over 100 women entrepreneurs, included testimonies
from participants, group discussions, and networking opportunities to leverage the expertise of
the NWEC in better preparing, coaching, and mentoring women in income-generating activities.

To gain further insight into the participation of women and youth in the fisheries industry, the
UNDP conducted group discussions with the fisher community in four regions across Mauritius
and two regions in Rodrigues. The focus groups in Mauritius reached a total of 131 participants,
of which 13 percent were women. Meanwhile, in Rodrigues, 62 participants were registered for
the discussions, of which 23 percent were women. These consultations will serve as a baseline
study for future efforts to promote greater participation and inclusion of women and youth in the
fisheries industry.

WHILE THERE IS A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF WOMEN
IN SMES, OFTEN UNREGISTERED AND INFORMAL,
FEMALE-LED BUSINESSES TEND TO FACE STUNT GROWTH
DUE TO GENDERED BARRIERS. IT IS HIGH TIME THAT WE
RECOGNIZE THAT WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS
A CRUCIAL PROMOTING FACTOR OF INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC
GROWTH IN OUR COUNTRY.

Women in Decision Making Process and
the fight against Gender Based Violence

The Parliamentary Gender Caucus (8 males and 7 females) were sensitized on Gender-Based Violence (GBV)
and on the status of implementation of the National Strategy and Action Plan on the Elimination of GBV.

The UNDP has remained committed to providing technical assistance to the Parliamentary Gender Caucus in
Mauritius, with a focus on promoting gender equality and the prevention of Gender- Based Violence (GBV). As
part of this effort, the UNDP has facilitated the institutionalization of the eLearning gender module and provided
support to the Steering Committee overseeing the implementation of the “LESPWAR” mobile application.

The “LESPWAR” mobile application, launched in 2021 as a tool to report cases of GBV, has gained recognition
as a potential public good by the Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA). The UNDP Country Office has engaged
in discussions with the DPGA and the Government of Mauritius to determine the best course of action for
promoting the use of this tool.

Mainstreaming Gender
Equality in the Energy Sector
and Climate Action

The UNDP continued to advance its vision of a sustainable and equitable
future where gender equality and climate action are at the forefront of
development efforts through a series of initiatives in 2022. A course on Skills
Development for Solar Photo Voltaic (PV) Chain was initiated for 30 young
women, to address capacity gaps in understanding the basic technical
aspects of PV technology, engaging households and small businesses to
further raise awareness on the low- carbon energy solutions available.

In line with its commitment to gender equality and climate action,
the UNDP multi-country office also convened a dialogue on Women
and Climate Change during
the Stockholm +50 consultations.
The event brought together more than 120 women who shared valuable
insights and experiences in key areas such as Renewable Energy and
Green Jobs, restoration and conservation, and informal sectors of activities
impacted by climate.

Scaled-up Action Towards
a Low-Carbon Economy

Under the “Accelerating the Transformational Shift to a Low-carbon Economy in the Republic of Mauritius”
Project funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF), a study was carried out on a Green Jobs framework. With
the new target of 60 percent renewable energy in the country’s energy mix by 2030, it is estimated that
7,000 jobs could be created in the sector. In this context, the UNDP, in partnership with MARENA, the British
High Commission and the Australian High Commission, supported various scholarship schemes through
which more than 65 beneficiaries were trained.

The UNDP Country Office supported the Government of Mauritius to (i) update the Electricity Act;
(ii) finalize Grid codes for renewable energy technologies, standards, regulations and accreditation of installers, and
(iii) ensure the funding of incentives for investment in the Renewable Energy (RE) sector. The Act caters for a single
buyer system and reinforces the Utility Regulatory Authority as the sole electricity regulator in the country. The RE
Roadmap 2030 was reviewed and the preparation of a report on green jobs in the country was also supported.

As result of the installation of 18MW of Battery Energy Storage System in 2021, the national grid can
accommodate more than 200 MW of intermittent renewable energy sources of electricity. By the end

of 2022, approximately 120 MW of intermittent solar and wind generators were connected to the grid.
An Automatic Generation Control system was installed to enhance control on the generation capacity.
A tender for an additional 20 MW of BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) has been awarded which will
enable some 450MW of intermittent renewable energy to be connected by 2030.

Following the first independent interim evaluation in October 2021, provisions have been made for the
deployment of a total of 25 MW of small and medium-scale rooftop solar photovoltaic systems under the
GCF project. Additionally, it is expected that some 130 MW of utility-scale systems will be connected to the
grid. Two tenders of around 100 MW of hybrid renewable energy facilities and 310MW of solar, wind and
battery plants have been launched.

The project document for the Low Carbon Electric Bus Transport project was signed between the UNDP
and the Government of Mauritius. This paves the way for the start of the project implementation to promote
capital investments in sustainable transport infrastructure.

Under Stockholm+50, the environmental sensitization of 259 middle management public officers
will contribute towards improved decision making towards resilience building and restoring nature.
Overall, over 1,300 participants were sensitized on the triple global crises.

Effective frameworks for Disaster
and Climate Risk Management

In 2022, the UNDP supported the preparation and drafting of the following legislations under the
GCF Project:

1. Proclamation of the Electricity Act, 2.Regulations on Electricity, safety, quality, and continuity,
3. Regulations on Electricity metering, billing, and collections, 4. Regulations on Electricity licensing,
registration, and fees, 5. Regulations on Electricity Transitional License, 6. Regulations on Tariff and
Renewable Energy worked on by URA, 6. Regulations on standards prepared and reviewed by SLO.
Regulations must be validated by stakeholders prior to submission to Cabinet, 7. Draft Regulations for
Accreditation Mechanism for operators developed.

The development of a ‘Waste Management and Resource Recovery Bill’, also supported by the
UNDP Country Office, was completed. The main objective of the bill is to provide the regulatory

framework to ensure the environmentally safe and sound management of solid and hazardous waste and
a sustainable waste management system through the adoption of a circular economy approach.

With the drafting of the Wetland regulations completed in December 2022, the National Parks and Conservation
Service was provided a legal framework, aiming at protecting the wetlands on the island.

The Environmental Protection Act (Amendment) Bill, adopted by Cabinet in May 2022, is a strengthened
piece of legislation to honour the country’s obligations under Multilateral Environment Agreements (MEAs)
and to achieve targets relating to the SDGs.

The Master Plan on the Environment, also adopted by Cabinet in May 2022, aims to provide for better
environmental management by establishing the foundations for the country’s “transition écologique” (ecological
transition) to a cleaner, greener, environmentally sustainable and climate- change resilient, low-emission and
circular economy.

Management of Natural Resources
and Ecosystem Services

Under the UNDP/Adaptation Fund - Coral Restoration project, community members have been trained on
different ocean coral nursery methods. Oceanography equipment was procured, and staff trained to conduct
current pattern and sedimentation surveys to determine the appropriate sites for coral restoration. Coral
samples have been collected in Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles and their DNA extracted to determine
the genetic connectivity among corals from waters of the Republics of Mauritius and Seychelles.

Under the “Supporting the Economic Empowerment of the Artisanal Fishing Community in the Republic
of Mauritius” (E€OFISH) project, two full sets of Single Buoy Fish Aggregating Devices (FADS) were
procured with additional FADS expected in 2023. A mobile application for the fisher
community was developed to enable them to geo-localize the FADS at sea and to
get pre-fishing biomass data to improve fishing efficiency. All those activities aim
at reducing pressure on the overexploited lagoon by shifting fishers towards the
off lagoon while equipping them with the required technology to improve their
livelihood through digital transformation.

The “Mainstreaming Invasive Alien Species - Prevention, Control and Management”
project supported the update of the National Invasive Alien Species Strategy and Action
Plan 2010 -2019 which will be implemented in 2023. The Project Management Unit has
played a pivotal role in convincing the Rodrigues Regional Assembly to officially request
the declaration of additional areas as Nature Reserve, increasing the protected areas from
the 200 ha in the Project Document, to 559 ha.

WOMEN’S CONTRIBUTION TO RISK REDUCTION
AND BIODIVERSITY IS CRITICAL. WOMEN ALSO
PLAY A KEY ROLE IN TRANSMITTING VALUES TO

Sustainable Management and Disposal
of Chemicals and Hazardous Waste

A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Ministry of Health and Wellness and
the Ministry of Environment, Solid Waste Management and Climate Change for the Indian Ocean
Regional ISLANDS Project funded by the GEF (Global Environment Facility) and supported by the
UNDP Mauritius Country Office. The project aims at protecting human health and the environment
from the harmful effects of hazardous chemicals and wastes in Mauritius by preventing the future
build-up of materials and chemicals that contain Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), mercury and
other harmful chemicals. It also aims at providing solutions to safely manage and dispose of existing
harmful chemicals, and to ensure the management of products entering the country.

With the support of the Government of Japan, the UNDP facilitated the procurement of a 500L- autoclave
for the Victoria Hospital to help minimize health and environment impacts of landfilling healthcare wastes.
The autoclave aims at addressing the problem of hazardous healthcare waste management, especially
in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. After being processed, the waste becomes fragmented,
non-toxic, solid, and dry, and is therefore safe to be disposed of as regular municipal waste.

Improving Public Sector Services

The UNDP Country Office continued its collaboration with the Government of Japan to build resilience
of the Public Sector and undertake a whole-of-society approach to the recovery process following the
COVID-19 pandemic.

The implementation of the pilot phase of an Electronic Document Management System will serve as a
catalyst to structurally transform and enhance processes at the level of the Ministry of Public Service, the
Economic Development Board (EDB), the National Assembly, the Registrar General’s Department and
the Statistics Office.

An integrated e-corrections management system was also established and the system is expected to
be operational in the first quarter of 2023. By facilitating the flow of information in the criminal justice
system, including prisons and probation centres, this initiative aims at improving the management
and rehabilitation of offenders and accelerating the socio-economic and digitalization process in the
correctional services.

In the health sector, the UNDP also assisted in the easing of lockdown restrictions with the
implementation of the All-in-One Travel Digital Form and the national Laboratory Information
Management System (LIMS). The Country Office received additional funding from the Government to
implement the eHealth project and the autoclave in one regional hospital for the Ministry of Health and
Wellness. The UNDP also initiated the procurement of one anti-epidemic robot and its corresponding
software platform to support with the detection of COVID-19 cases among citizens and test patients.
This will also help to reduce the risk of contamination of health professionals.

Connecting with the Grassroots, Strengthening
Capacities and Accelerating Learning

The UNDP Accelerator Lab for Mauritius, Rodrigues, and Seychelles has focused on strengthening capabilities
and accelerating learning among youth and women entrepreneurs through a bottom-up approach. By tapping
into collective intelligence, the Accelerator Lab, including UN Community Volunteers, has been able to mobilize
and leverage new sources of information, ideas, and insights, bringing together different stakeholders to address
shared challenges. Through participatory practices and workshops, the Lab has significantly contributed to
strengthen partnerships with national institutions and enhance the ability of local communities to think collectively
and bring about positive changes.

The Lab collaborated with UNDP Socio-Economic Unit, the Ministry of Gender and Family Welfare, the National
Women Entrepreneurship Council, and the National Women Council to set up a series of workshops aimed at
capturing data, ideas, and knowledge to enhance women entrepreneurship development in Mauritius. The
Accelerator Lab has also collaborated with the University of Mauritius to accompany a group of 25 women-led
entrepreneurs on a journey to improving their financial literacy through short tutorial videos (in Mauritian creole).

In addition, the Lab has been called to led grassroots conversations, during the Stockholm+50 initiative,
to capture the opinions and reflections of people from diverse backgrounds about the urgent need
for actions to achieve a healthy planet and prosperity for all. By recognizing community participation,
local ownership, and grassroots innovations in shaping public policy, the Lab has contributed to a “whole of
society” approach that leaves no one behind.

the country’s development process, providing innovative and flexible support to
grantees throughout the entire project cycle. In 2022, in line with the pro-poor policy
of the Government of Mauritius, the SGP prioritized funding for green job initiatives
and small-scale financially self-sustaining and income-generating projects that
enhance the welfare and capacity building of grassroots and vulnerable communities.
7 more projects were approved in 2022. One of these was supported under
the “Innovation Programme on South-South Cooperation” with SGP Belize for a
project on seaweed as nature-based solution in Rodrigues; and two others under
the ‘’Plastic Innovation Programme’’ thus contributing directly to national policy on
waste management.

Several initiatives were undertaken to complement projects and collaborate
further within the UNDP Mauritius Country Office Programme in view of building
on partnership with the Government of Mauritius for greater impacts. The UNDP
Socio-Economic Development Unit and SGP partnered on a joint project to
support empowerment of migrant vulnerable women in the suburbs of Port
Louis. Through these initiatives, the SGP continues to emphasize community
empowerment, coalition building, and networking, and incorporate lessons
learned into new project cycles. These projects are scalable for high economic
leverage at the macro-level, working with development partners, the private
sector, national academic and research institutions, and regional and national
government. The SGP’s 30 years anniversary was celebrated at an event at
COP27 in Egypt in November 2022 and was held with the UNDP Administrator,
the Global Manager and the Mauritian Ambassador.

Connecting Young
Mauritians and Seychellois
to Mainland Africa

The UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles country office supported the participation
of 8 youth delegates from Mauritius and Seychelles to the YouthConnekt Africa
2022 Summit in Kigali, Rwanda, in October 2022 on the theme “Building the
Resilience of young people on the African Continent to Accelerate Human
Capital and Socio-Economic Development.”

The YouthConnekt Africa (YCA) is a continental platform to empower the young
people of Africa by investing in their ideas, innovation, and initiatives. It aims
at enhancing the knowledge, skills, and experiences of the African Youth by
bringing them together with Heads of State, Policymakers, Business Leaders in
the Private sector, Development partners and Civil Societies. The Summit 2022
was hosted by the Government of the Republic of Rwanda in partnership with
the United Nations Development Programme in Kigali gathering more than
8000 youth from the continent.

PROGRAMME ACTIONS AND RESULTS
The youth delegates engagement started with the pre-summit events which included the Technical
Committee of the YCA and the Youth Focal Point meetings to discuss the key achievements and challenges
of the YouthConnekt Hubs and the Community of Practice. The best practices and solution base approach
to stakeholders were shared. Surrounded by representatives of more than 30 African Countries, the youth
delegates enriched their knowledge on the process of how to support the launching and operations of a Local
hub.

During the Summit, the youth delegates from Mauritius and Seychelles interacted with other young counterparts
from around the continent, discussing themes such as leapfrogging into the Digital era, the active participation of
women in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), delivering innovative financing
for Youth Enterprise in Africa, Ethical and Entrepreneurial Leadership, the mental health of the youth among many
other which are cross-cutting and burning youth issues in Africa.

As youth priorities and ecosystem vary from country to country, the exchange of ideas and knowledge in
the enthusiastic environment of the Summit in a combination of youth-centered activities such as High-level
plenaries, panel discussions, masterclasses, keynote speeches, workshops, exhibitions, cultural programs, and
awards, enlightened the Mauritius and Seychelles delegation on the importance of understanding the youth
priorities for both countries.

African youth is one of the key resources of the continent, and so it is for both Mauritius and Seychelles.
By investing in the youth, that is providing them access to finance their enterprises, the ecosystem to build
resilience and giving them the appropriate platforms to meaningfully contribute to the social, economic,
andpolitical transormation; the nations are contributing to a bright future.

4 VISIT OF THE UNDP

REGIONAL BUREAU
DIRECTOR AND
REGIONAL EVENTS

UNDP MAURITIUS ANNUAL REPORT 2022

The 2022 African Economic Conference (AEC), jointly hosted by the African Development Bank, the Economic
Commission for Africa, and the United Nations Development Program, opened on 09 December in Mauritius,
under the theme ‘supporting climate-smart development in Africa’. The Conference started with a strong call
for Africa to adopt smart technologies to tackle what speakers described as ‘the looming climate change
threat’ to the continent. It was an opportunity to reflect on the institutional capacities to build climate-smart
development mechanisms and support regional member countries to build resilience and transition to low-
carbon development pathways.

Ahead of the AEC, Senior Economists from across UNDP Africa also gathered in Mauritius for their 2022 Retreat,
which focused on strategizing to better support Africa’s economic development and build back stronger.

In December 2022, the UNDP Regional Director for Africa, Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa, carried out a country
visit to Mauritius on the margins of the African Economic Conference (AEC). This was an opportunity for the
Country Office to showcase the UNDP Country Office’s contribution towards the country’s transformative
development agenda as a Small Island Developing State.

The Regional Director engaged in various project activities alongside the Mauritian Government and
development partners. On 06 December, Ms. Eziakonwa joined the launching of the Mauritius SDG Investor
Map, a market intelligence tool developed in collaboration with the Economic Development Board and the
Ministry of Finance to direct private capital to emerging markets where SDG priorities, government policy and
market opportunities converge.

SDG 5 was at the core of the Regional Director’s activities in Mauritius. Ms. Eziakonwa co-hosted and chaired a
Women in Trade Dialogue with the Honorable Kalpana Koonjoo-Shah, Minister of Gender Equality and Familiy
Welfare. Entitled ‘Building

AfCFTA’, the event highlighted AfCFTA opportunities for women in Small
Island Developing States (SIDS) and best practices to enable them to leverage trade opportunities in mainland
Africa. An award ceremony for around 60 women entrepreneurs who completed various trainings on solar PV,
under the GCF/UNDP project ‘Accelerating the transformational shift to a low carbon economy in the Republic
of Mauritius”, was also held during her visit.

In the context of UNDP’s contributions to provide digitally enabled health system strengthening solutions,
the Regional Director and the Honorable Kailesh Jaguptal, Minister of Health and Wellness, launched a 500L
autoclave at the Victoria Hospital to address the problem of hazardous healthcare waste. Ms. Ahunna Eziakonwa
also signed a US$ 5.6 million grant agreement with the Honorable Alan Ganoo, Minister of Land Transport and
Light Rail, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and International Trade, Mauritius. This was carried
out under the GEF-funded “Promoting Low-carbon Electric Public Bus Transport in Mauritius” project, which
aims at boosting climate-smart efficiency within the public transport system.

The UNDP delegation,
led by Ms. Ahunna
Eziakonwa, also carried out a series of site visits
aimed at showcasing the projects initiated by
the UNDP to promote alternative livelihood in
communities affected by the MV Wakashio Oil Spill.
These included UNDP-GEF Small Grants Programme
initiatives, namely the Native Oyster Aquaculture
project, and the Aquaponics Project. The Regional
Director also visited the Refuge Centre in Quatre
Soeurs and the Artificial Reefs in Mon Choisy. These
initiatives, funded by the Adaptation Fund, aim at
increasing climate resilience of communities in the
coastal areas in Mauritius.

Ms. Eziaknowa also carried out a series of courtesy
visits to the President of the Republic, members of
the Government, Ambassadors, and other Donor
Partner to strengthen existing relationships and
explore new avenues for collaboration between the
UNDP and Mauritius.

List of Partners

Courtesy visit of UNDP Regional Director for Africa, Ms. Ahunna
Eziakonwa to His Excellency Mr Prithvirajsing Roopun, President
of the Republic of Mauritius.

Building on existing partnerships and forging new strategic partnerships with Government, the private
sector, public institutions, NGOs, and Civil Society enabled the UNDP Country Office to deliver on its
programmatic offer.

The Joint Programme on SDGs strengthened UNDP partnerships with FAO and UN Women in areas of Food
Security, and UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) and ILO (International Labor Organization)
on Blue Economy. The UNDP also engaged with several partners involved in the implementation of
various projects, including the Ministry of Land Transport and Light Rail, the Food and Agricultural
Research and Extension Institute, and NGOs such as ECOSUD, Reef Conservation and Shoals Rodrigues.
Under Stockholm+50, UNDP partnered with the Ministry of Education to sensitize 240 tertiary students on
the triple planetary crises.

Following the successful engagements on the SDG Investor Map preparation, potential for new partnerships
in future years emerged. The newly established National Advisory Board of Mauritius - an independent
body and member of the Global Steering Group for Impact Investment - is considering a partnership with
the UNDP Country Office and other stakeholders such as the Africa Sustainable Finance Hub, the Economic
Development Board (EDB) and the UNDP Istanbul Centre for Private Sector Development. This collaboration
will aim at advancing efforts towards catalyzing impact investment. Private sector institutions such as the
Rogers Group, a member of Business Mauritius, actively participated at the launch of the map, demonstrating
opportunity to forge partnerships on advocacy.

The UNDP also initiated discussions with the African Development Bank, the Development Bank of Mauritius,
the Mauritius Research Council, Care Edge Africa, and Vivo Energy Mauritius on future partnerships in
Nature, Climate Change and Energy financing.

Operations

The UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles Country Office provided a range of administrative, operational and
project services to the Government. These include the design, delivery and review of activities and initiatives,
which have improved the organizational efficiency and agility of various government departments. The
Country Office also continued to pursue efficiency and acceleration of programme delivery using global
and regional Long-Term Agreements (LTAs) to procure goods and services. This shortened procurement
timelines and enabled the UNDP to meet the various deadlines for the projects. It also provided essential
services including Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT) financial audits and spot checks.
