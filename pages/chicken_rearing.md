Rearing of chickens and eggs for consumption

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate money every 6 to 7 weeks. 
It's going to help others businesses like restaurants and supermarkets to continue operating and our potential offtaker is HUNGRY LION restaurant and neighbourhood. This innovation will contribute to the community by providing food for the community.

> Technical Feasibility

We currently have one chicken run and we are doing the chickens of about 250 birds and we would love to extend the number of birds(chickens) so that we can meet the demands of clients..
So the idea is to implement other chicken runs with the difference of one to two weeks so that the supply is not running out to our clients. Reason being we not meeting up the supply as demanded.

> Anticipated Social Impact

When we produce these chickens it's not just to our ADVANTAGE but also to the community because people needs to eat to survive and also to help others businesses like restaurants and supermarkets to continue to operate
