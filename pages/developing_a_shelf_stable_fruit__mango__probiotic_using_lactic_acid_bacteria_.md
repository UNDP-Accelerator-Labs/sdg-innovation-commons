> Title of the innovation

Developing a shelf stable fruit (Mango) probiotic using lactic acid bacteria.

> Brief description of the innovation

This project is based on developing a fruit based probiotic by using lactic acid bacteria. The indigenous mango fruit will be used in formulation of this product where the pulp will be inoculated with lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus Rhamnosus and incubate it for 48 hrs.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

In Zambia, mango is an indigenous fruit and it is abundant if in season. Because of the abundance, most mangoes are eaten raw and mostly wasted especially in rural areas of Zambia and less are transformed into mango juice, jams and other products in urban areas. So far, the Zambian manufacturing industries have not developed a probiotic from fruits such as mango. This means that fruit related probiotics are not on Zambian market. Because of the value addition in terms of nutrients and health  benefits associated with probiotics and that this fruit is consumed by many, it is projected that there would be a high demand of this product if produced and offloaded to the market. This would generate income for the developer ( myself) and also others that might make profit from orders and resells. This product targets all age groups which means that it would be sold in all markets both local and international if conformity in standards is reached. This prize challenge would help me with requirements to carry out all the planned research on the product to ascertain  its value in terms of nutrition content and acceptability by carrying out sensory evaluation before the product is produced in large quantities and sold on the market, which in turn, will generate income.

> Technical Feasibility

This project will involve 3 parts, sample preparation, laboratory tests, and sensory evaluation. Under sample preparation, the mango will be processed to mango pulp. The mango pulp will be inoculated with lactic acid bacteria and incubate for 48 hrs. After the fermentation takes place, the fermented pulp will be taken for laboratory analysis on microbial load, microbiological contaminants, proximate and other analyses on the product. By using the untrained panel of people, sensory evaluation will be conducted to ascertain the acceptability of the product based on sensory attributes such as taste, aroma, consistency, flavor etc.
With consistence and availability of resources, this whole project is projected to be done within 4 months period.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The availability of nutrient-rich beverages for children and young people on the African market is limited. Owing to the current nutrition transition, many people are moving away globalised foods. Most drinks commercially available contain considerably high amounts of sugar, and regular consumption poses considerable health risks such as obesity, diabetes, and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Should current trends persist, it is predicted that Africa will experience the largest increase in the number of people with diabetes; rising from 19.8 million in 2013 to 41.4 million by 2035 (Mbanya et al., 2014). Despite health benefits, the sustainable provision of current dairy and cereal probiotic supplements to the wider population in low-to-middle-income countries remains an existing affordability challenge to most individuals due increased prices attributed by demand and cost of raw materials such as milk. Traditionally, fermented beverages have involved the use of milk as well as cereal crops such as maize, millet, sorghum or rice (Ezekiel et al., 2018). However, due to increasing lactose intolerance, dairy allergies, cholesterol concerns of milk products, as well as the mycotoxin contamination risk of cereal crops, there is a growing interest in finding alternative media to produce probiotic from non-dairy foods and beverages (Ezekiel et al., 2018; Mokoena et al., 2016). Mangifera indica. L (Mangoes) are nutrient rich and plentiful and relatively cheap when in season and eaten raw by most people over the global and wasted in some parts of Zambia. With the reports on the studies done to ascertain the suitability of mango as a supportive medium for probiotics, it is important for mango to be fermented into a probiotic rich functional that may address high sugar contents, lactose intolerance, dairy allergies, cholesterol concerns of milk products, as well as the mycotoxin contamination risk of cereal crops. This will also improve both nutritional value and health thereby address the global escalating malnutrition.
