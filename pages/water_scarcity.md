## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Water Scarcity
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

A challenge is that Jordan has a severe shortage of water resources which affects people's access to reliable water supplies and depletes the natural water resources in Jordan at a rate that could be more sustainable.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

 Jordan is one of the world's top countries with an extremely stressed water baseline. Over 50% of Jordan's water is non-revenue water. There are political issues with the surface water resources in Jordan with its neighbouring countries. For decades, awareness campaigns on water conservation have filled the Jordanian TVs and street billboards. In the last year, there has been an increased systematic cut in municipal water supply every week.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Signals/Trends (topics that emerged in several discussions and data sources)  
Consider small-scale water harvesting techniques   
Farmers fear changing their farming practices because they feel it is risky 
Little creativity or "going the extra mile" in designing products, experiences, and some small enterprises in Jordan.  Duplication, mediocrity, and commercialism are common. 
Look into agritourism, adventure tourism, exchange tourism, and other forms of alternative touris



</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This challenge was put on hold because the general feedback was that it is beyond the Lab's capacity and budget if we want to look into water harvesting technologies. We might look into it again for 2023 if we were able to map an opportunity with the environment team.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The project is put on hold.
