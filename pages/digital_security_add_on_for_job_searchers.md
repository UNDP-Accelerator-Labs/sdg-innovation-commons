> Descripción de la experiencia

UNDP Ecuador AccLab, together with LaLibre.net, has developed a browser add on to make job searchs safer. It is aimed to flag unsafe digital spaces, before providing your personal data.
This plug-in adds privacy or security features to mozilla browser when navigating in job search platforms.  Acclab "Safe Browse Guide" is free and open source. In its experimental version, it evaluates job advertisements on the two main platforms: computrabajos and multi-jobs, it allows the reporting of misleading advertisements.
