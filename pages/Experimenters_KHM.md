# Cambodia Accelerator Lab: Leveraging Youth Consultation for Inclusive Development

### [[0:05]] Tell me your name and your title and say I give consent to be recorded\.

My name is Juana Rod\. I am the head of experimentation of the Cambodia Accelerator Lab\. I give consent to this interview\.

### [[0:18]] Perfect\. Thank you\. Over to you\.

### [[0:24]] Can you tell me about an R&D activity you would like to share?

I think because I have started working in the accelerator lab around a year now and we have done some O&D activities\. But I today I would like to share one of the activity which is the use consultation\. So under the use consultation, we, we conducted 4 men activity\. The first one is the use online survey, the second one is the used boot camp, the rapid ethnographic study, and the last one is we did the used writing competitions\.

### [[1:09]] What was the development issue that you were addressing?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
In fact, because young people are one of the main target of the UNDP Cambodia and we did this just consultation in order to get the insights or input from young people to inform our country program\. That is why we we need to to talk to them and so that we understand the challenges or the experience that they have observed in their community to inform our country program\. So mainly we need we we try to know what are the development priority for them so that we can design the project or the program that respond or address directly to their challenges\.

### [[2:13]] Who was involved in your zoning and what was their roles?

[[skills:Systems leadership]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[skills:Volunteering and taking initiatives]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
The main theme that involved in our activity are mainly my team member and as well as the young people\. And well, I also should mention that we have contacted many development partner youth association networks that work closely with young people so that we can engage with them directly\. And we could share let's say for the youth online survey, we need to share our survey with a variety of young people so that we can get inside from different use group\. So these are the main group that we have worked with\.

### [[3:05]] How did you ensure diverse stakeholder perspective where consider and how did they input save the R&D journey specifically because these four activity was done and designed specifically for young people\.

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Finding new alternatives]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
So to ensure that the group of young people participate, I mean, inclusively, we, let's say for the use online survey, we share the survey online on our social media platform like the LinkedIn, Facebook\. And we also share like I just mentioned, through our development partner to make sure that any young people from the age of 15 to 30 can take part in this survey\. And for the Just Boot Camp, we also invite people, young people from any area, any social background to, to participate\. And as a result, we we could have young people who are men, women, non binary, young people with disability, young people from different ethnic and indigenous young people also take part in this boot camp\. And for the ethnographic study also, we try to reach out to those young people whom we call hard to reach young people, especially those who work in the in formal sector and the indigenous young people to to to be the participant of our study\.

### [[4:47]] What was the outcome of R&D journey and how did your work in participatory development?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
I can say that this work have an interesting impact because first we, you know, we, we tried to do the O&D with one man principle, which is to leave no one behind\. And this is one of the important framework of the United of the UNDP as well\. So we, we try to ensure that everyone is included like I just mentioned\. And as a result, we were about to get inside from different youth group like I just mentioned, like young people with disability, indigenous young people and young people who also work in garment sector in other SMA or those who also have a very good education\. So we here all the perspective from them and we we were able to understand their challenges and we were also able to see the similar challenge that they have experienced\. We also were able to learn what they want for Cambodia for the future\. So we we can see their vision of the future and what exactly they want for them to grow to thrive individually as well as a country at large\. So that's what we learned\. And this is very important for our organization to design our country program and our project that really respond to the need of young people\. Because as you know, Cambodia, I mean the number of young people is around 2/3 of the total population\. And they will be the core pillar, I mean the the next generation that we are continuing the development of the country\. And then we are able to hear from them, learn from them and do something that respond to their need\. And that address this is really important\.

### [[7:06]] What would you do differently if you have to start again?

[[tactics:Finding new alternatives]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Undertanding the community]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
If I have to start again, I would not do much differently\. First of all, I think the we we have used different method in order to hear from all young people in Cambodia\. Like we did the survey, it was done anonymously that any young people can can do voluntarily without feeling fear of being judged\. And also we did the boot camp that we used the human centre approach to engage all young people to think, to empathize the problem they encounter and at the same time think of the solution that really respond to their challenges\. And we also did the ethnographic study that we tried to reach out to those hard to reach young people, those indigenous young people who live in the rural area, in the community that does not receive as much as as much development as in the urban area\. So, and also we did the essay competition where we allow any young people who prefer to write rather than to speak to share their opinion about our development, privacy as well\. So I believe this method that we use did help us collect very insightful information related to what young people have experienced\. So this is exactly what I would do\. But if you ask me what I would do differently, I probably may think of some other\. Maybe I would just include a bigger side when we did the rapid ethnographic study like because the study that we did cover a smaller size, we would have bigger one later\.

### [[9:14]] What strategy or process did you employ to facilitate the deficient and adoption of R&D outcomes?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
Yeah, after we received this result from the four activity I just mentioned\. So we did the analysis and the insight from the the four study we used to inform our country program\. At the same time we also use it to inform the youth portfolio that our country is developing, which for the youth portfolio we also focus mainly on young people for their future of work\. And also apart from this, we develop reports and we share it online\. So anybody can have a look at it, like even young people themselves or researcher, policy maker, government, NGO, they can also use the insight from our study\. At the same time we we were able to share this nationally on the national TV\. So I believe through this platform, any stakeholder can get the insight from, from our study and I'm sure those relevant stakeholder can use the insight to for their specific purposes as well\. And young people themselves may able to feel empowered and learn and understand and can relate to other young people in the country and say that OK, young people are now being prioritized, being taken seriously\. And this is a good encouragement for them to be more confident and try and take part into the development process\. The local government, that is what the government is Cambodian government is doing, which meant to try to engage them into our development process and decision making\.

### [[11:19]] This is last\. How did you engage with policy maker, private sector communities or others key actors to catalyze product change or impact based on your R&D works?

I, I would say similarly that we try to share the insight that we get from our four study online\. So we share it publicly, we public it on our website and on our social media platform like LinkedIn and Facebook\. And also we we were about to talk to the national TV and this, this is, you know, social media is very powerful at this time of that anybody can can get our document and to use it publicly\. I'm sorry to use it for their specific purposes\.

### [[12:20]] Thank you for the interview and the time and insight\.

Thank you\.
