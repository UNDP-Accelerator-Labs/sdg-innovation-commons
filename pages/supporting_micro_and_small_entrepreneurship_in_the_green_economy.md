## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Supporting Micro and Small Entrepreneurship in the Green Economy
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is a need for additional support for entrepreneurship in the green economy to overcome obstacles and maximize the potential of grassroots solutions

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The countries under the purview of the Trinidad and Tobago AccLab tend to underperform with regard to global metrics for environmental sustainability, as shown by data from the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) 2020, produced by Yale University. Country EPI: Rank EPI: Score 10-year change Trinidad and Tobago 69 47.5 +10.7 Guyana 126 35.9 -6.7 Suriname 81 45.2 -7.1 Despite these rankings, there is anecdotal evidence that the local demand for green goods and services is There is a need to integrate micro and small enterprises, civil society organisations, non-governmental organisations (CSOs/NGOs) and co-operatives involved in the green economy into the mainstream of economic and social activity in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and Suriname. This initiative is important not just for environmental sustainability but also as means of improving the overall operational efficiency of businesses, creating and introducing new products and services, and for sustained employment and social inclusion in the territories.

The Government of Trinidad and Tobago published a report on Green Enterprise Policy, which recognizes that Trinidad and Tobago is ranked 62 out of 180 countries on the 2016 Environmental Performance Index with a score of 74.34.  The report also acknowledges that at present it is not known how many enterprises in Trinidad and Tobago operate according to sustainable practices because certification and standards are generally not in use.  Simultaneously, small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) are significant contributors to Gross Domestic Product and employment. Up to 70% of jobs are in this sector. The government report concludes that it is important to create an ecosystem that facilitates enterprise creation outside of the non-renewable energy sector while emphasising respect for the environment. Partially as a result from this analysis and the need for local food security post-COVID, the government committed an incremental budget allocation amounting to a 50% increase in funding for innovation in agriculture and environmentally conservative businesses. There is a large ecosystem of small businesses, supportive NGOs, government agencies, incubators, and investment vehicles related to the green economy. However, stakeholders are largely disconnected and unaware of the existence and activities of complementary actors. The included image is a preliminary map of the green innovation ecosystem in Trinidad and Tobago.

Newspaper articles have been observed which identify challenges faced and closure of enterprises involved in the green economy. Also, there is an increase in new micro and small businesses due to loss of employment during the pandemic. Also, due to prolonged lockdowns, businesses are moving online, but are inefficiently using digital marketing formats. As such, livelihoods of underserved members of the community are at risk. The lockdowns and other issues from the pandemic have exacerbated the pre-existing economic challenges which are leading to increased proliferation of new business ventures. The government has identified a need for increased investment in preserving our environment and natural resources, while enabling people to improve their livelihoods.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Through our initial exploration of the landscape, we identified a blind spot in the provision of support services to MSMEs. Specifically, we observed that support was targeted towards small and medium enterprises, but very limited resources were available for micro enterprises, despite government specifically identifying this sector as an area of primary interest. As such, our activities and experiments were specifically directed at micro enterprises. We are identifying needs, best practices, and challenges faced in this sector in order to optimize the policies and interventions that are delivered to these stakeholders. 
We have deployed collective intelligence methodologies to attain and share insights with non-traditional and often under-represented stakeholders, analyse on-the edge-trends to creatively gather data, and identify areas of positive deviance among green entrepreneurs in our territories. We have been using this information to determine the strategies that environmental innovators may use to overcome challenges and then collaboratively conduct small experiments to determine the replicability of promising strategies. 
Specifically, we conducted a call for solutions and a solutions challenge. All solutions were grassroots-developed and represent the collective ideas from both the for-profit and social entrepreneurship communities. The successful proposals and approaches from the successful challenges will form the basis of our first round of experiments.
