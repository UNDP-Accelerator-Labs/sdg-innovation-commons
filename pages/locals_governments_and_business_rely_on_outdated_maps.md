## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Locals governments and businesses rely on outdated maps with very limited info (beyond capital and large cities)  - Crowd mapping can bring substantial value to the local communities in the areas of inclusion and city management. Within a short period of time a group of volunteer mappers can generate unprecedented data sets  - Working with un-organized civil society has the potential to generate positive spill-over effects and actions.  - Secondary spots and locations in transit zone miss out from the tourism development and suffer from growing inequality   - Local administrations are not aware of the complaints and feedback from tourists. The culture of feedback collection is almost nonexistent.   - Tourist pain points such as litter and poor restroom conditions are embarrassing for the local administrations ergo they do not want to talk about it and address the issue  - There is a strong interest in the society to improve the conditions and safety of public transport (urban and inter-city)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes. State partners are intrigued and excited by the new tools, but have some difficulties introducing them to their pipelines. The ecosystems need to be adjusted.  The OpenStreetMap and the concepts of “open data” are rather new to local decision makers, hence, the action required sensitization of the mapping solution, showcasing usecases etc. As a next step, it would be needed to plan capacity development actions on the use of mapping products in local policymaking

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Use of satellite data and crowdsourced photos (Mapillary) for remote mapping of inclusion in a particular city provide a body of input data for analysis. Alternative sources of data would require each mapper to visit the city in person. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

They introduced us and the state partners new info source for better local and national policy decisions
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

three NGOs (Ukrainer, Mapping community, R9) 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

relevant during the scaling part

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We engaged UX professionals from the local IT companies through R9 UX Community

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Cherkasy Regional Administration, State Agency for Tourism Development, Ministry of Infrastructure, Ministry of Digital Transformation

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

UX and mapping communities were extremely helpful and can be at the core of the national scaling projects

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Everything tourism-related we saw in other agencies was very boring
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

This combinations gave us the evidence for new user-centric solutions and policy decisions on the regional and national levels

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
