> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Spending time for searching good local partners in each cities (to the local guides)
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Partly YES. Community Safari did help to implement number of different NBS solutions in the participating cities. All of them were co-created by the locals. However, what we found out that the Safari can be use for community creation/activation around any practical actions that can be made in the city to improve it livability (not only NBS). This is something that was valued more by the UNDP collegues (rather than focus on NBS). Sustainability of created prototypes is the main concern (that still needs to be improved): in terms of financial sustainability, as well as practical maintenance of the solutions. Two main hypothesis are arising from this: 1. Possibility to connect Safari with city public budget could improve the financial part of it. 2. Mobilizing new citizens groups around already existing organizations -owners - those who would take care of the final products (e.g. NGOs or House Owners Associations) can improve the practical sustainability of the project.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We went directly to testing- piloting methodology and learning by doing (agile method). We started with first pilots in Kyiv and keep improving the Safari, as we moved to the other cities. At the end we had a fully digital version of the Safari. I would change the M&E procedure with the participants (would ask them for online journaling- e.g. creating a social media account for their NBS prototype and constantly update and post there).

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Very fast - since we started learning by doing. The first results were after first pilot in Kyiv. We learned that we need to move to more digital spaces and have to pal for the better financial mechanisms of the implementation.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

First year 10K, Second year 15K, Third year 20K

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

yes, we are planning to continue it yearly. This year because of the war, we will focus on urban gardening and food security issues.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

With Ministry of Reginal Development and cities' local administration, as well as house owners associations. Now during the War we are planning to Partner with a Canadian Project: https://sadyperemohy.org/?fbclid=IwAR0NIAWWfO5coPDUlL6aN-t0KdqVByX5vST9xBGtW1X3FioH1EUr1vCXmig

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

- Community Safari Gamified Tool is a good bottom-up tool for City Community Mobilization/Co-creation around topic of NBS  - It attracted main youth and activists ("Greta" generation) - It is very good for mobilizing, energizing, uniting  and co-creation NBS solutions in the city, but not yet good for long-term financial and practical sustainability of the developed solutions (e.g. rain gardens, moss-modules) - Safari Tool should be a part of the bigger NBS National Programme focus on cities transformation, with  a focus on natural solutions (involving capacity building for the authorities, urban planners and architects, communal services, NGOs and businesses, combined with development of the financial and institutional mechanisms to promote such solutions).

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

- It is not enough to mobilize locals to co-create NBS solutions in the cities, the bigger financial and institutional ecosystem has to be created around. - However, even without this ecosystem, locals are capable of changing their cities with NBS - but a strong local leader (e.g NGO or HOA) is needed to lead the process. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Environmental and Local Development Portfolios 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

City Transformation Related Actors 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

yes, each year we try with new compilation of the Tool (first - just a game and financing form UNDP, second - digital version of the game, training for the local leaders and financing from UNDP, third - digital version of the game, strong comms campaign, local administration on board, partly financed by UNDP)

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Search for strong local actors (e.g. city NGOs) to lead the process. Give financial and capacity support to them to run the Safari and also help them search for local finance for the solutions implementation. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes easy. Any topic that need local level co-creation.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This was rather experimenting experiment ;-) based on idea learning by doing. But i think it would benefit from exploring different sustainability options (e.g. local ownership models, local financing models and so on), as well as mapping other similar community initiated practical city improving solutions in Ukraine. 

> What surprised you?

That a simple game can generate so much interest, excitement and motivation about locals and at the same time, the energy can go down so easily when it comes to the implementation of the tangible NBS solutions (ownership and leadership is the key).
