## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Exploring Human-Focused Digital Development for Belarus 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Explore approaches to reduce inequalities in access to benefits of the Belarus’ digital transformation.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

“Leaving no one behind means leaving no one offline” is the message that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres emphasized in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the urgent need for a global digital transformation and digital inclusion.

Digital transformation and innovation-driven development are strategic priorities of the Belarus’ National Sustainable Development Strategy until 2035 anchored in the UNDP’s Country Programme Document for Belarus 2021-2025. As recognized in the State Programme “Digital Development of Belarus 2021-2025”, increasing connectivity and raising the digital skills level of the population are indispensable pillars of a successful digital transformation of companies and society. UNDP is providing strategic support to Belarus in applying digital technologies to accelerate the achievement of its development priorities.

It is estimated that 90% of future jobs will require tech and digital skills. In Belarus, 87% of the country’s population use the Internet (88% women and 86% men). However, while 99% of young people in Belarus used the Internet in 2021, the figure drops to only 48.5% of people aged 65-72 who used it for access to information, financial transactions and education. 4.35 million Belarusians (46.1% of the population) use social networks, of which 59.8% are women and 40.2% are men. It is especially important to prioritize the development of digital skills for people with disabilities and elderly people, who are most at risk of being left behind in the global digital transformation.

Up to 70% of SMEs globally have intensified their use of digital technologies due to COVID-19. However, SMEs in Belarus indicate a lack of data culture and digital awareness, internal skills gaps and financing gaps as barriers to further pursue digital transformation. 62% of entrepreneurs are men, and only 32% are women, and this indicator stopped growing from 2018. 180 million jobs globally where women are predominantly employed have a 70% or higher probability of automation. This means that women will require tech skills to adapt to new types of work and working arrangements. The share of women graduates from ICT programmes in Belarus stays at 23%. As a result, they are underrepresented in STEM jobs.

The AccLab will explore new approaches to designing and implementing safe, affordable, and meaningful digital services and products that can make benefits of digital transformation more affordable, available and accessible to all people in Belarus, especially vulnerable people, to empower them and improve their well-being. Improved quality of digital services will support the population in multidimension crisis through improvement of its digital well-being.
