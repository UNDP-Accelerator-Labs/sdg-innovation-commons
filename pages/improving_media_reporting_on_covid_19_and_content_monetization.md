Novi Sad's Content Insights wants to help the media find an adequate reporting model that suits the sensibility of the audience. Another outcome of the project should be to help online media ensure financial sustainability. The assistance will be reflected in the guidelines obtained from the analysis of large data sets on the behavior of the media audience. In addition to the behavior and habits of the audience, these guidelines will be based on responsible journalism. The tips will also apply to the media business and how to make it sustainable in times when advertisers are retiring.
