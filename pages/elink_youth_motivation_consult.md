> Brief description of the innovation

Elink is an organisation for professional speakers, providing the most comprehensive education. Speakers with eloquence, expertise, and experience share their stories of hope.
This business idea came from a first-hand life experience in 2012 after I was depressed. According to research 629million people worldwide, 16% in Africa and 15% of the Zambian population are affected by depression, and due to the Covid19 pandemic these numbers are likely to double. At this point I discovered my purpose and I wanted to share my voice to ease the suffering of others.
We help youths clarify goals, set priorities, get through setbacks, perseverance, fight against fear, build self-confidence, moral and spiritual values among others, we promote professionalism, integrity, passion and honesty.
Our goal is to improve performance, execute high quality service delivery, and meet clients expected standards through professional competency and efficiency. We believe in the ''Never give up spirit'' We aim high.
