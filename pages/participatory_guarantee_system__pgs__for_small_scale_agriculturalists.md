In the photo, a few members invited the public to a very soft launch where they explain the participatory guarantee system (PGS)

A system by which community-based rural (mainly female-led) households collaborate to assist each other in growing pesticide-free crops for sale through the Alliance of Rural Communities of Trinidad and Tobago (ARCTT), an organization that defies label. ARCTT is a rather loose arrangement of producers, companies and an NGO that sells produce from rural communities in Trinidad and Tobago at their own peri-urban marketplace. The group is supported mainly on the confidence and interpersonal relationships that members have. The participatory guarantee system (PGS) recognizes that it is costly to obtain organic certification from Europe and America, so members of the farming community in Brasso Seco are carefully monitoring and documenting their own progress and information as they move towards organic best-practice, with the hope of eventually having their own homegrown label. It is an attempt to decolonize and to "re-indigenize" from the grassroots. Their brand focuses on health and community solidarity. Even when earnings are small, they stretch more than in the urban areas and many community needs are supplied by the solidarity of the women involved (approximately 15 households).
