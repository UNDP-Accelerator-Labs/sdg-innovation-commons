LITERACY PROGRAM ARM OF  SUPER GIRLS REVOLUTION (PURITY A LIFESTYLE 1CON 6:18-20)

> Brief description of the innovation

MISSION:
Our mission is to educate, empower, develop and create a mode of teaching literacy to our young girls at Super Girls Revolution through partnering with learning institutions, organizations and individuals in Lusaka, Zambia.

VISION:
To see young girls at Super Girls Revolution acquire knowledge/skills through education, realize their potentials, live their God given dreams and be agents of change in their communities.

GOALS &amp; OBJECTIVES:
To educate and empower young women to read and write thereby increasing knowledge and building leadership capacity within the communities

To develop and create the habit of reading and writing for literacy growth as girls take up space in leadership.  

To build long lasting relationships with all participants. Ensure that participants take shared responsibility for the outcome and their contributions are included in the program continuity as they are leaders.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Resources such as stationaries and other requirements for the program to ran has to be outsourced from donors, investors, individual donors, companies as stipulated below

> Technical Feasibility

We will schedule appointments with partners and learning institutions (especially community schools) twice at the beginning of each month to build partnerships and create support systems that will enroll our girls in addition to getting their assessments report, and see how best we can work together to achieve a common goal.

We will conduct home visits to our girls once a month and schedule weekly calls to  assess their progress and identify the needs. We will Monitor progress of the girls by checking their end of term reports to inform their support structure and implementing our termly assessment survey(during holidays when conducting home visitation) to assess the impact of the program. This in turn will ensure effective participation from all stakeholders (Beneficiaries, FIH staff and Partners).

	
In future, we intend to have a literacy program center/library which will be open to the girls in our community (program) to utilize for the intended purposes. And this is how we want our weekly sessions to look like;

> Anticipated Social Impact

This program was inspired by  the gaps that we saw in our Super Girls Revolution program. It was noted that a lot of our girls are struggling with reading and writing (when asked to read and write during SGR weekly programs),  others are not in school because of financial constraints and poverty in general.  

Firstly, We aim to enroll girls who are out of school at SGR to community schools and institutions that offer free education, and other girls who cannot read and write to literacy program centers (to enhance their reading and writing).

Secondly, We aim to build long lasting relationships/partnerships with organizations and learning institutions that  provide free services, bursaries, scholarships, and grants. Additionally, donors/individuals who want to donate materials like story books, textbooks and any other stationery are welcome to work with us.  These institutions include community schools, NGOs, social welfare(bursaries), universities/colleges, companies, libraries, literacy centers, individual donors and investors etc.. to help secure the lives of our young girls in the communities.

The long term goal is to offer coaching in subjects the girls are struggling with in school and create stability in all subjects to reduce hindrances in proceeding to other grades and enrolling in their dream career at university level because of not having all qualifications. In most cases girls are asked to rewrite those subjects which takes a year; coupled with other financial constraints to re-take their exams.. To avoid the whole process of rewriting and taking longer, the girls end up in applying for any course that is within their grades which defeats the purpose for them to go after their dreams and may enroll for diploma courses which does not put them in positions of influence.  
 
NB: This will help restore hope and highly contribute to the fight against sexual violence because every girl will be knowledgeable and be aware through these learning opportunities/platforms  that they will be exposed in addition to growing their leadership capacity
