## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Dealing with Air Pollution in Chiang Rai with Social Innovation Platform
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

UNDP Thailand Country Office and the SDG Integration (SDGi) Team of UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub (BRH), engaging the expertise of Agirre Lehendakaria Centre (ALC) in implementing the Social Innovation Platform (SIP) process with an ‘area-based’ social innovation approach to strengthen local governance. The approach helps communities exploring partnerships and investments with public/private sectors, informs policy reforms, and supports UNDP’s role as an ‘integrator’. The Social Innovation Platform has six core stages: 1) systems mapping; 2) listening process; 3) collective sensemaking; 4) co-creation; 5) prototyping and 6) scaling which will lead to new narrative and sustainable change. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In recent years, in the face of population growth, economic expansion and attendant growth in demands for energy, agricultural production, tourism, transportation and general consumption, air pollution has become a leading threat to the health of the environment and population, alike. These translate to onward social and economic costs that undermine the gains of economic and development advancements. Whilst much attention is given to urban industrial and industrial sources of air pollution, non-urban sources of air pollution in Southeast Asia, such as those caused by forest fires, vehicle and industrial emissions, and combustion of low-quality fuels and agricultural burning, are also of significant concern. Political, economic, judicial, and social issues linked with air pollution, such as retribution burning against central governments, make air pollution extremely difficult to tackle as it is not just a technological issue, but one with roots embedded in social inequality, ineffectual governance, policy and incentivization, and misdirected investment.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The four communities in Chiang Rai had chance to work on prototyping. Instead of waiting for order and support from the authority, they learned to test new solutions and got inspired to work further on their own.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

"Thai communities take action against air pollution! Using local wisdom, they create fire barriers, preserve water, & establish a village fund to support firefighting teams. #Thailand #Grassrootsinnovation #AcclabTH
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

Four communities in Chiang Rai: Hin Lad Nai, Khun Lao, Pang Sa, and Khun Han

> What sector does our partner belong to?

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

Under SIP, the four communities provided data (via interview) and worked on following prototypes for air pollution: ·        Agroforestry as a fire barrier: less probability of forest fire and more economic value from the yield of the crop planted in the fire barrier ·        Highland water reservation: a more effective method for fire extinguishing, so they don't need to transport the water to the lower land or nearby canal/waterfall. ·        Fundraising for community fire-fighters and equipment: fund collected for the sale of coffee beans (2%) and tea cotton (5%)

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the "practical solutions" for the communities on reducing air pollution?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We use these methods to ensure that the villages people can share their insights and developed solution that would fit their context.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We need to work more with the authority and public sectors as we have found a lot of conflicts between communities and them.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

All four communities, with support from UNDP, are currently working on a policy proposal for the local government agencies as a first step to include the community in decision-making and secure the scalability of the interventions.
