Shilu Ana is the countries first taxi hail app service. Being pioneers in the market they had to educate the general public of the benefits of an app based service. In the less than 9 months of operation their customer base has grown almost exponentially. As a majority of the South Sudan public do not use smartphones the created a voice based system which still always for the tracking of ride journey when the customer is picked up, providing confidence in a fair fare. 


Many youth who have access to vehicles have joined the platform as drivers, earning more take home in a day than they do in their regular work.
