> Title of the innovation

Civil Glo Renewable Energy Solution

> Brief description of the innovation

Civil Glo Consulting (CGC) is an engineering &amp; consulting firm that was birthed out of the need to have sustainable renewable energy solutions. Zambia’s capital city has a high population density and as a result, there is an inadequate number of sanitation facilities and a high energy deficit resulting in deforestation and depletion of Zambia’s forests. On average 300,000 hectares per year are lost through tree cutting for charcoal making. Additionally, Lusaka’s water table has been contaminated with faecal matter resulting from poor sanitation. This has resulted in Cholera out breaks which are common in high population density and low cost areas where the majority have no access to clean water. Cholera has a high mortality rate of up to 90 %(Over 110 lives lost in 2017-2018 outbreake). CGC came up with a business that solves these problems by emptying pit latrines of faecal matter and use the faecal sludge to produce bio-gas, biocharcoal and Bio-Manure.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

CGC will solve the problem of faecal contamination of underground water by emptying/collecting faecal matter from pit latrines and septic tanks. The faecal matter collected will be used to produce bio-gas in the bio-digesters(Reduce the energy deficit in the country) and Bio-Charcoal that can be used for heating and cooking. Bio charcoal will be sold as a substitute for charcoal hence creating employment for charcoal burners and reducing deforestation. Bio-charcoal will be made by compressing the solid waste into briquettes after carbonation. The digested faecal matter will be packed into bio-manure to be used by farmers.  The uniqueness of this business is that it is 100% environmentally friendly and no waste will be disposed off in the environment. Faecal matter the raw material is constantly being produced and readily available. CGC will make its profits by selling Bio-gas, Bio-Charcoal and bio-manure to households, industries and the farming sector. Bio-gas and bio-charcoal have potential market of about 30% of the population of Lusaka which is about 600 000 persons, 25 000 housing units and over 50 industries. The Challenge prize will help to scale this environmentally friendly business into reality through purchase of land and equipment.

> Technical Feasibility

Over the years the knowledge of generating energy from Animal or faecal matter has been increasing and millions of people across the globe have benefited. It’s currently being implemented even in Zambia. However, in Zambia very few companies if any use faecal matter in their Bio-Digesters and most of them use animal dung. Civil Glo Consultancy CGC plans to use both animal and faecal matter.  Currently for CGC there is no prototype that’s been made yet due to financial constraints. If all financial expenses are taken care of the business will begin its implementation by employing or consulting personnel (both in Zambia and abroad) who have made Bio-digesters to have more technical knowledge on what is needed. Furthermore, a survey will be conducted to understand the public’s perception with the use for Bio-products i.e products from made from faecal matter. Only when this is done will the actual implementation begin. Firstly, by employing competent people related to this type of project. Secondly, purchasing land and equipment such as sewage suction trucks. Thirdly, establishing partnerships with industries, farmers and individuals to purchase our produce for consumption or for reselling.

> Anticipated Social Impact

In the age that we live in the world has positioned itself to tackling environmentally friendly practices that would reduce Climate change such as renewable energy and farming as enshrined in SDG number 13 which is “Climate Action.” Civil Glo Renewable Energy Solution will help in reducing water-borne diseases such a cholera which is caused partly through contaminated water from pit latrines. Furthermore, the use of Bio-Gas and Charcoal will reduce the need for cutting down trees to use for lighting and heating. Furthermore, the use for Bio-Manure will help adopt environmentally friendly agriculture unlike the use or artificial fertilizers which reduce the fertility of soil which results in more land being cut down for Agriculture and contributing to climate change.
