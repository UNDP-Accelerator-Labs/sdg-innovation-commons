Vunilagi Book Club (VBC) is a learning platform that promotes book reading in rural communities in and around Fiji. Many children living in communities with lower socioeconomic backgrounds struggle with literacy skills. The club holds reading sessions in Nanuku - a community on the outskirts of Suva (Fiji's capital). VBC also finds ways to incorporate literacy skills via creative activities to enable children to see the benefits of reading as a skill. It is also the first to target children's literacy skills in underserved communities.
