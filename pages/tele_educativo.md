## Tele-Educativo, spearheaded by nurses, is a platform designed to provide accurate information to Angolan pregnant women, mothers, and teenagers regarding maternal and neonatal health, as well as the risks associated with sexually transmitted diseases.

The platform delivers Tele-guidance, Tele-education, and preventive diagnoses with the aim of averting:

Maternal mortality

Infant mortality

Early and unwanted pregnancies

Arterial hypertension

Thrombosis

Cardiovascular diseases

To facilitate this, the platform offers hospital-grade equipment that enables users to remotely monitor their parameters in the comfort of their homes. Their target audience includes girls aged 13 to 18 and working women aged 18 to 55.
