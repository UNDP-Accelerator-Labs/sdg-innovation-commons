Contributory project: It is designed by scientists, and citizens participate in data collection.

Overall goal: Monitor odors from landfills and other polluting sources. Specific goals: Develop a mobile application for reporting odor nuisance. Geolocate reports from citizens. Build up a long-term database. Study and analyze the reporting database cross-referenced with meteorological databases.

Description of citizen participation Citizen participation consists of data collection. At this stage, upon identifying a disturbing odor, users can log in to the mobile application and report it by filling out a standardized form, where the probable source of the odor, basic descriptors and perceived intensity are recorded. The application will capture this data and record the mobile device's location.  The data will be stored in an open database that can then be cross-referenced with meteorological databases. This helps to correlate citizen detection and warning of nuisance odors linked to wind, temperature, humidity, and pressure conditions, for subsequent analysis (source identification, frequency of disturbance occurrence among the population, etc.).
