## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection. 

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis. 

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process. 
## Overall goal

Jointly characterize the geographical distribution of the mammal pink fairy armadillo (Chlamyphorus truncatus), endemic to Argentina, to contribute to its proper conservation. 
## Specific goals

Contribute to defining the conservation status of the pink fairy armadillo (Chlamyphorus truncatus). 

Create a potential distribution map by combining different participatory data collection methodologies. 

Develop dissemination and outreach materials about the species. 
## Description of citizen participation

Citizens send information through different social media platforms: photos, videos, date and place of the sighting, anatomical and behavioral characteristics, environmental data of the sighting place, etc. If the animals are found dead, citizens preserve the bodies using alcohol or store them in a freezer until the project team can collect them. The specimens are part of the mammalogy collections in the museums of La Pampa and La Plata, and their tissue samples are extracted to carry out genetic studies.
