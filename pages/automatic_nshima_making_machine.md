> Title of the innovation

Automatic Nshima making machine

> Brief description of the innovation

I highly technological machine which is capable of preparing Nshima in a fast most efficient way. It uses principles of engineering to achieve this objective.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This machine will generate money because it will be very much needed in populated institutions such as boarding schools and hotels which need Nshima to be prepared for large number of people.

> Technical Feasibility

The machine uses electrical and mechanical engineering to automate the process of Nshima preparation. The main parts are 
1. Motor
2. Arduino Uno
3.Heat source
4. 2 pots .
Nshima making can be divided into 2 stages.
First stage the water is warmed to 60% and a signal is sent to an Arduino to switch on the motor and the mealie meal is added to make a mixture. The motor is turned off and the mixture is left to cook.
Second stage starts when the mixture or paste is headed to 130° and a signal is sent to the Arduino to switch on the motor and allow the mealie meal into the pot.  When the Nshima is well mixed and is hard enough the process is automatically stopped and the user is alerted of the end of the process.The ac motor control is called Pulse width modulation .

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation is very relevant to the market especially to eating places and functions where Nshima is needed in large amount. Such places find it hard to manually prepare Nshima and this innovation will make it easy and hygienic.
