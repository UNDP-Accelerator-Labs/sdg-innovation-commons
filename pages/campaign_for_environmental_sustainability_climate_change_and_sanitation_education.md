> Title of the innovation

Campaign for Environmental Sustainability Climate Change and Sanitation Education

> Brief description of the innovation

Environment as a whole is the wholistic aspect of human life. For long environmental challenges such as climate change, poor sanitation, communicable diseases among others have persisted. This has led to the loss of many lives and lots of money in mending the damage caused by such. Many strategies means and solutions has come about but their effectiveness has been minimal. Therefore this project aims at bridging the gap which has led to the less effectiveness of the seemingly good strategies in handling environmental challenges. That is by means of changing the behavior, attitudes and beliefs of young and old alike. By incorporating the environment education methodologies to the already existing strategies can be so effective.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The future of human race is dependent on how we handle environmental challenges faced now. Climate Change mitigation and adaptation is vital for economic growth and wellness of human life for example. And as the effect of climate change gets stronger with the happenings such as floods, famines, droughts, wild fires among other, more actions is needed. Many governments, institution organization are  at their helm of fighting these problems. As such we will be the support to that fight, hence we will lobby for financial supports through project propasal writings, look for financial grants, engage with other environmental organizations for support, well-wishers and individuals interested in environmental protection. 
The challenge prize for us is basically meant to help us get started and establish. It will help us withthe purchase if tools such as computers to be used for generating work plans, lessons plans, storing of visual audio data used for teaching. It will also help us purchase green transport such as bicycles to be used for movement during community engagements. This money will be used to allow stakeholders appreciate the value of our innovation in fighting environmental challenges.
As the innovation is implemented on a large scale it will change the face of how people look at the use of natural resources in a sustainable way and fight for good sanitation and health.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation is designed in such a way that it embraces the all persons alive. With the full force of well trained environmental educators to carry out the education of the masses on different aspects of environment, climate change and sanitation, change is inevitable. Schools, private companies, banks, construction and manufacturing companies to mention but a few will have sessions of lessons conducted to them similar to fire drill on different aspects of environment.  We also plan to work with the already established organisations such as ZEMA, UNDP, WARMA, WWF governments ministries such as MWDSEP, MoH among others as sign MoUs in engaging us to incorporate our innovation in their implementations of their projects.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Women girls and young ones are the mostly affected people by the effects of environmental challenges. Our innovation will greatly improve the lives and we'll being if such ones as they are also our target. These ones will have knowledge to adapting to climate change and be proactive in anticipation of any environmental challenges they may face later. It will also improve the lives of others as their will sustainably use the natural resources, have good sanitation and healthy.
The innovation could not have come at a better time than this as the world at large is fighting to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and many other environmental challenges faced today. Before, climate change effects gets to a point of no return it's important such new ideas are embraced and put to use. As the time frame for reaching the goals of SDGs 2030 nears, such innovation as this is vital for the implementations of goals such as, Climate Action, Good Health and Well-being, Clean water and Sanitation among others. This will help in saving our only planet and in turn it to save us.
