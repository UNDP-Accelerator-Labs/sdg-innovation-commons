Breaking Barriers: Empowering Women in STEM for a Knowledge-Driven Future

## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to overcome the leaky pipeline phenomenon and promote women's sustained participation in STEM fields in Serbia. While there is a relatively high percentage of women in STEM, the drop-out rates and limited representation of women in leadership positions hinder our progress towards achieving gender equality and developing a knowledge-based economy. To address this challenge, UNDP Serbia has adopted new, user-centric approaches, seeking to understand the human perspective behind this issue and propose adequate responses. We have also leveraged alternative data sources like LinkedIn to gain deeper close to real-time insights and monitoring.

By taking decisive action to address the leaky pipeline phenomenon, we aim to promote gender equality and create a more inclusive and diverse society. By empowering and retaining talented women in STEM careers, we contribute to building a stronger, more competitive, and future-proof economy for Serbia. 

Ultimately, overcoming this challenge will unlock the full potential of women in STEM, fostering innovation, economic growth, and social progress in our quest to build a knowledge-driven society that benefits everyone.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In the top 10 European countries with the largest number of women in STEM, 6 are from Western Balkans, with 47-52% of women in the field. Even though women in Serbia make 60% of the total number of graduated students, based on the data extracted by Cube, they occupy only around 10% of leading and higher paid positions in companies, while they are paid 23% less than their male peers. Increasing the number of women and girls in STEM is important, but it is not enough to solve the gender gap.

In Serbia, only 7% of women are negotiating for higher salaries, compared to 57% of men who do the same. The number of women who wish to advance and obtain a higher position in their companies makes only 50% compared to men. Most of them hit the glass ceiling and stay at assistant positions with no decision-making power, most often opting out of entrepreneurial ventures.

The gender divide is even larger in the tech sector. Although Serbia has more women participating in IT than the EU average (25% vs. 18%), the higher-ranked and higher-paid jobs are still dominantly occupied by men. Women in the Serbian tech sector hold only 20% of management roles and earn 19% less than men in comparable positions (the same is true for the EU). A positive aspect is that gender equality, in terms of representation of women, in the Serbian ICT sector is improving faster than in the EU, given that the number of women in the sector has increased by 14% annually in the previous seven years, while the number of men by 8%, compared to the EU averages of 6% for women and 4% for men.

During our big bet's growth phase, the following organizations can benefit from our efforts and may be potential champions with whom to collaborate:

Collaboration with government bodies responsible for education, labor, and gender equality can aid in the implementation of policy changes that benefit women in STEM. Advocating for inclusive educational programs and workplace regulations can help to create an environment that encourages women to participate in and advance in STEM professions.

Engaging with enterprises in the ICT and STEM-related industries can result in the implementation of more inclusive workplace practices. Encouraging corporate executives to advocate for diversity and gender equality can have a knock-on effect, increasing women's presence in leadership positions and assuring equitable opportunities. Colesly working with HR managers, and head/talent hunters on how to implement more inclusive and gender-blind processes in their work. 

Collaboration with universities, faculities, and schools can lead to the development of STEM programs that meet the requirements of female students. Mentorship and support efforts implemented inside educational institutions can aid in the retention of women in STEM disciplines throughout their academic journey.

Women's Rights Advocates and Organizations: Working with women's rights advocates and organizations can help to raise awareness of gender gaps and push for policy reforms to promote inclusivity in STEM professions.

STEM Professionals and Role Models: By interacting with successful women in STEM disciplines, you can build a network of role models who can inspire and mentor ambitious women in the business. Their stories and experiences can inspire other girls to seek STEM education and professions.

Collaboration with NGOs and foundations dedicated to gender equality and education can give additional funding and support for programs encouraging women in STEM.

Raising awareness through media sources and collaborating with notable individuals can assist in distributing information about the relevance of women in STEM and attempts to tackle the leaky pipeline phenomena.
