Biogas from all wastes like food wastes, cow dung, peels etc. this helps prevent deadly respiratory diseases. It’s not harmful to people and the environment, I use plastic tanks and metallic tanks for people who are on both small and large scale areas and it’s affordable. It saves people from using charcoal and fire woods hence it helps in avoiding people from cutting down trees for cooking, it helps in all kinds of cooking, like hotel cookings, school cookings and home cookings etc.
