The Women Union of Ha Trung has implemented a project in which they collect, sort waste and make eco-bricks from plastic bottles and bags. Their members also collect plastic banners and posters to turn them into useful products in daily life such as eco-friendly shopping bags and recycled flower vases. Each month, they could sell more than 200kg of plastic waste. The scale of these activities might be small, but the impact is immense in the long run.
