Innovating for the FutureAs we reflect on the past few years, Libya’s economy has experienced a rollercoaster ride. Headlines have been shaped by major financial developments, from debate over removing fuel subsidies to addressing persistent financial deficit and navigating a fluctuating exchange rate.Economic diversification has long been a topic of discussion in Libya. At times, it was considered a luxury to address, while at other times, it was viewed as a necessity. At UNDP Libya’s Accelerator Lab, we decided to approach this longstanding challenge in an innovative way through strategic foresight.By engaging with the global Accelerator Lab network, we gained valuable insights into the power and beauty of deploying foresight and future thinking as innovative strategies. These methods, proven effective in addressing various development challenges worldwide, inspired us to explore untapped economic opportunities in Libya.In collaboration with the Ministry of Economy —specifically through its Modelling and Institutional Excellence Bureau and the Department of Private Sector Development and Investment —we co-created thematic interactive learning circles. These circles focused on six key economic sectors: tourism, technology, renewable energy, transit trade, food industry and finance. Fostering an environment for collaboration, innovation, and co-creation.When Collective Intelligence Meets ForesightUsing a collective intelligence approach, we brought together a diverse group of 65 participants, including government officials, industry leaders, academics, and private sector representatives. Their diverse perspectives enriched the learning experience. Notably, experts brought critical insights, underscoring the importance of inclusive strategies. Through the Three Horizons framework, participants adopted a long-term perspective on Libya’s economic challenges and opportunities.Additionally, rehearsal sessions were conducted in collaboration with the Ministry of Economy and UNDP Libya Country Office, where a group of staff directly engaged in the learning process, while many others indirectly benefited from their participation. The discussions were structured around tailored questions for each sector, guided by the educational materials and facilitators, ensuring that the insights gained were relevant and actionable for all involved.The Three Horizons conversations focused on identifying current challenges, envisioning a diversified future economy, and exploring innovations to drive the transition. Through interactive sessions, participants shared insights and crafted sector-specific visions, enhancing the relevance and impact of the discussions. Tailored materials, including a video on the Three Horizons model, supported the process and increased awareness of foresight practices across the country.

The Three Horizons model illustrates Libya’s journey toward a sustainable and diversified economy. Horizon 1 highlights the urgent need for change, driven by the question: what are the signs that the economic system we have today is no longer fit for the future?Horizon 3 envisions a resilient future for Libya characterized by a diversified economy. In this phase, we engaged in discussions about the possibilities ahead, asking: What visions of the future can we imagine for Libya? This horizon represents our aspirations and the potential pathways toward a more resilient economic landscape. Between Horizons 1 and 3 lies Horizon 2, where the transition occurs. Here, we confronted the uncertain question: What innovations are already disrupting the current landscape, and how can we support their growth? This is the critical space where entrepreneurs and governments can experiment with new ideas to shift the economy away from its dependence on oil and towards more sustainable sources.Unlocking Six OpportunitiesEach learning circle engaged in dynamic discussions on specific topics relevant to the participants' backgrounds, culminating in inspiring storytelling sessions. In these sessions, each group shared theirvision for Libya’s economy, highlighting how the strengths of various sectors can drive innovation and collaboration to unlock six opportunities that can shape Libya’s future prosperity.

A. Tapping into Adventure and Medical Tourism Libya's unique landscapes and cultural heritage present a golden opportunity for adventure tourism. By focusing on medical tourism in scenic areas and promoting adventure activities, Libya can attract both domestic and international visitors.

B. Harnessing Renewable Energy as a Path to Sustainability With abundant natural resources, Libya has the potential to transition to renewable energy. By removing barriers for private sector participation and establishing supportive regulatory frameworks, the country can achieve affordable and clean energy for all.

C. Transforming the Food Industry The food sector in Libya faces significant hurdles, but there are promising avenues for growth. By cultivating resilient crops and aligning education with market needs, Libya can enhance the quality of its food products and build a competitive industry. Encouraging women’s participation in agriculture and food production can drive economic growth and foster more inclusive and sustainable food systems.

D. Embracing the Digital Economy The technology sector is ripe for transformation. By fostering public-private partnerships and implementing inclusive, fair legislation, Libya can transition to a digital economy that drives innovation and growth.

E. Building a Sustainable Financial System Addressing the challenges in the financial sector is crucial for economic resilience. Supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and promoting e-financial systems and services can pave the way for a more digitally inclusive financial landscape.

F. Boosting the untapped Transit Trade and Connecting Libya to the World Libya's strategic location offers significant potential for transit trade maritime, land and Air transport. By developing infrastructure and enhancing transport networks, Libya can position itself as a global logistics hub.

Each opportunity is connected to inclusivity and empowerment, especially for Libyan women, who are essential in building a resilient and prosperous economy in different fields including in agriculture, renewable energy and others. By harnessing the strengths inherent in Libya's diverse sectors and fostering an environment that encourages participation from all, we can unlock the full potential of these opportunities.
