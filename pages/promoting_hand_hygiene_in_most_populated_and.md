Promoting hand hygiene in most populated and high risk public spaces:  RISE International was contracted to construct
and distribute 65 hand-washing stations in different sizes of 20l, 220l and 550l across the 10 districts of Lesotho in places with high population and high-risk areas including bus stops, market centres and health centres. So as to ensure ownership and sustainability of
the stations, UNDP handed over to the Government of Lesotho through Ministry of  Health and Maseru City Council on the 17th September 2020 as the Khubetsoana Taxi Rank in Maseru
