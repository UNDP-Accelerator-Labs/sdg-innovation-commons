> Title of the innovation

Internet Cafe And stationary

> Brief description of the innovation

The photocopier machine has been used for  a long time almost seven years now and computers are old models. If we can have new machines and computers our business will be able to function at its apex, this time we are almost losing customers, due to poor customer service.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If we can have like three big photocopying machines our income would reach ,k500 on daily basis, in those days when we were using only one photocopier machine we use to make a lot of money because we're the only once in town. But we are about three doing the same business, this has contributed to the decrease of our business. So our aim is to Renovate our business.
In kasumbalesa border there is no internet cafe and everyday heavy trucks are moving in and out, and for trucks to enter in Congo there must be legal copies of required documents, which means they need to photocopy documents, but what usually happens is that most drivers comes here in two for photocopying, our go is to open another shop in Kasumbalesa border. So that it even benefit those people who are looking for internet services, and stationary equipment. For example we have about three schools which the two are primary and is secondary,  What usually happens is that teachers will come here in chililabombwe for photocopying.

> Technical Feasibility

Our aim is to meet up with the demand required for the people of Around our community, Couse we have people across the country who pass through this town going to democratic Republic of Congo who are looking for photocopying.
The Total amount should be about k100.0000 one hundred million kwacha to Renovate our business.

> Anticipated Social Impact
