> Title of the innovation

Fingerling Hatchery for Women; 4 types of Tilapia (Kafue Bream, Red Breasted, Green Headed, Nile) of both same sex male fingerlings will be produced targeted at women; including women with disabilities.

> Brief description of the innovation

Hope Africa Initiative (HAI) is a registered NGO, RNGO 101/1589/2021, designed to use six thematic pillars to help the poor and vulnerable. It is also mandated to do business to sustain it. For our targeted groups, getting involved in Entrepreneurship is mandatory.  Therefore, HAI is applying for this innovation fund on behalf of women who may find it difficult to access this fund in order to be helped start new or expand their existing businesses. Our innovation is to use the concept of SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP to challenge poverty and employ a unique DEMAND–LED SELF-HELP MODEL aimed at empowering women with fingerlings and entrepreneurship skills so that they start fish farming. Beneficiaries will be INCUBATED for a few months and a revolving CREDIT FUND created to enable them access capital to buy seed at affordable prices. Other recruited beneficiaries without capital or money will still have free access to seed but pay back later. During this time, access to markets/trends will be provided until Beneficiaries become mature.   To sustain the venture, 50% of the fingerlings will be sold to the open market; Demonstration fish ponds will also be part of the venture as some fish will be sold.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Fisheries department estimates an annual production of 70,000 tons, while national demand is 120,000 indicating a deficit of 50,000.Venture aims to produce Tilapia fry which will be subjected to a hormone treated feed that produces about 95% sex reversed fry (all males).  There will be four production lines each producing 2,750,000 fingerlings. Therefore, for all the four production lines, the expected installed capacity is estimated at 11 million fingerlings per year. Each fingerling price will cost 50 ngwee or K0.5 each (more than breakeven price of K0.13).  At 30% mortality rate, the utilised capacity is 7,700,000 fingerlings that give us sales amounting to K3, 850,000 or approximately US$ 226,470 USA dollars. The new project is centrally located and hopes to take advantage. Our main suppliers are Mwekera and Chilanga for tilapia broodstock, Private Hatcheries, Milling Companies and surrounding Communities for Labour. Our customers are Commercial Fish Farms e.g. Lake Harvest, Yalelo, Capital Fisheries and government for restocking programmes. Others are Small scale private fish farmers. The organisation has zero tolerance to environmental degradation. The proposed project is not big, won’t cause soil erosion or require uprooting of trees, displacement of people or use of chemicals

> Technical Feasibility

A 6,300 m2 (length 90 m and width 70m) building will be constructed for the indoor facilities. The water reservoir will have 3 compartments, simple filtration units of two cubic metres having layers of sand, gravel and stones for filtration. The second unit is settling chamber while the last unit is the water holding tank. It will comprise four main units; the broodstock holding structure will have 160 cylindrical plastic containers of 80 litres each, for holding one female each after injection for final ripening of the ovules as well as for post incubation observation period. The fertilised eggs will be transferred to the incubation unit. Each incubator will contain about 132g of eggs, a total of 3,900,000. Hatching rate is 90%. Hatched larvae will move to early fry rearing section. In this unit, the fry will be fed live feed for 8 to 10 days then transferred to the late fry section. The expected survival rate is 75%. The late fry unit is the largest, with 50 concrete circular tanks. Fish will be in these units for 25 to 30 days. They will also be used for the temporal storage of fingerlings during hardening prior to sale.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The proposed project will create jobs.  The employment level is expected to rise as the business expands. Employment created will improve women’s income and food security will be assured at household level.  With an improved income and food security, the cases of malnutrition among children will drop and ultimately, the child mortality rate will reduce. The introduction of the hatchery will also introduce more fish farms thereby even creating more employment, thus adding to an increase in Gross Domestic Product.  The business expects to utilise new aquaculture methods being used by the Fish Hatcheries and hopes to improve on it.  Pond Diggers, Contractors and the Owners will acquire the necessary knowledge and skills about Hatchery and Fish Pond construction after being taught by the Fisheries Officers.  Contribution to the National Treasury by way of payment to the following taxes and contributions such as Income tax, Levies, Licences,  National Scheme Contributions and annual returns to NGO registration office will be undertaken. It is envisaged, some fingerlings will be exported to neighbouring countries and contribute to a country’s treasury by bringing in foreign currency that the country and business requires.
