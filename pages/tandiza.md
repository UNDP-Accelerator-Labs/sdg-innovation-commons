> Title of the innovation

Tandiza

> Brief description of the innovation

This application is being developed with the objective to cut the barrier for people to financially support Orphanages and other causes they care about all from the convenience of their mobile phones through the use of Natural Language Processing via Voice commands and local Mobile Money services in Zambia to power this easy to use donation platform that will hopefully lower the burden currently carried by Orphanages throughout the country and  potentially Africa, the app has directions options too so users can easily find their way to locations of relevance if they feel like physically making a donation for example clothes, This application could potentially grow into Zambia’s first indigenous crowdfunding platform over time, the current prototype is designed for Orphanages but can be easily repurposed if the need to pivot arises

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The application will look to improving the operations of many already existing Orphanages in Zambia by allowing them to easily crowdfund money from the general public to help with thier daily operations it could be as simple as requesting money for an upcoming event at the Orphanage or buying daily supplies that may be in short supply on any given day, The application will have ads to help with curbing server and hosting costs incurred through running it, it will also have optional sponsored ads and with opt in mailing lists that can be used to generate some revenue with very minimal transaction fees, through this application people will avoid having to commute to Orphanages they hope to help saving on Gas and other resources that can now be easily channeled to those in need

> Technical Feasibility

The current prototype is an Android Application built in Native using Java it is fully functional with a UI and Voice Command capabilities so users can easily interact with the application at any time we will look to having an IOS version developed once funded we will also be able to onboard orphanages in order to help them, we will be able to run online advertising and social media campaigns to help get the word out about our service, print material and billboards to really get the word out, The application currently only supports MTN Zambia Deposits we will look to adding Airtel and Zamtel once funded and look to potentially making a Crowdfunding application where people can seek help for different use cases, depending on adoption

> Anticipated Social Impact

There are no solutions currently tackling this particular issue with most people who donate typically doing this by physically going to the location, This idea has the potential to improve the lives of several people while also giving people the ability to financially support causes they care about easily without leaving their homes during these trying times in the Covid-19 Pandemic, This application use case could stretch to beyond just Orphanages possibly growing to rival established entities in the Crowdfunding domain such as GoFundMe
