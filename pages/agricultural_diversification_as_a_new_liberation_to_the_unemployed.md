For instance, I Nyanga Brightwell and my other 5 colleagues have engaged in Soya beans, fresh vegetable gardening (Onion) and poultry production.
There's wealth, there's money, there's employment in Agriculture.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation is such a great one because if we say for instance, every province to have 200 of them getting involved in Diversification of agriculture, then it's a huge boost to our economy because there will be enough for local supply and for export.
Mostly, the target market is export to the DR Congo.
For example, onion which gets into scarcity mostly in our country would be a thing of the past.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed to get located near the supply of cheap/surface water to provide for all projects.
This would be implemented by the hardworking youths like myself who already own traditional land in mpongwe district of Copper belt province

The innovation would reduce the cases of early marriages and improve the living standards of the local people because there will be employment.
It is relevant to the current market because there would be no more shatage in the country, hence boosting the continuous flow of export
