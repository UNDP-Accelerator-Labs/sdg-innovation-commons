Circular Economy in the City: A Rapid Ethnographic Research on Circular Economy in a Philippine Urban Setting
FEBRUARY 28, 2022
The report entitled Circular Economy in the City: A Rapid Ethnographic Research on Circular Economy in a Philippine Urban Setting highlights the urgency to shift to a more circular economic model in the Philippines due to the burgeoning problem of unsustainable production and consumption. The report informs us about the advantages of the circular economy: it could help in preventing biodiversity loss, fighting climate change, and addressing the waste problem with potential to provide green novel jobs. We can see the gravity of the situation in the Philippines, as it named the third largest source of discarded waste – bulk of which is plastic waste that ends up in the ocean.
