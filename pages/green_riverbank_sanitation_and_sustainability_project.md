"Rivera Verde" or green Riverbank is a project by Fundacion Tropigas.  Due to a lack of gov't intervention, they wanted to collaborate with the Isable river sanitation. This is one of the two major rivers in the city of Santo Domingo. The slum communities around the riverbank are part of the contamination problem because a lot of the solid waste ends thrown into the river. The project consisted in 1) community education efforts to increase awareness and improve garbage disposal practices, and 2) the use of two water collection hunter machines, to collect garbage that floates in the river and usually ends up in the ocean. The AccLab was conduncting a stakeholder mapping when we came across this instituion and tehy told us about the project, which has been featured in the media and has been supported by other public and private institutions.
