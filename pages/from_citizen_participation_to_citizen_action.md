## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



From citizen participation to citizen action
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to discover, learn and systematize the mechanisms that motivate citizen participation and turn it into action. Our experiments, directly integrated with the ongoing projects of the three UNDP Peru programmes, will allow us to learn:




What are participation drivers?

What are the key factors that transform discourse into action?

How is UNDP managing citizen participation internally? 

What are our gaps and capacities needed to sustain participation over time?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



All programmes within the Peru CO have at least one project that relies on citizen participation to collect data, but there isn’t a collective toolbox of common methodologies that provide comparable information at a local level. The Peru CO is currently building localized territorial strategies based on the existing projects, but this challenge will align, disseminate and build internal skills to improve and enhance citizen participation as part of these territorial strategies and provide value-added to UNDP’s portfolio.  




The Peru Accelerator Lab has consistently been building towards this cross-cutting frontier challenge by always focusing on user-centric solutions through its four previous frontier challenges. Now it’s time to close the loop and rely on all of our experiences to build a citizen participation toolkit with relevant methodologies that can be used to collect and understand data, identify future signals and trends, map solutions and create a feedback loop with those that are impacted by UNDP projects.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Lab has a cross-cutting perspective of the Peru CO and can test initiatives that can support projects in more than one programme and experiment varied approaches to citizen participation simultaneously in different topics and geographies. 

The Lab has gathered insights on citizen participation through its previous frontier challenges on changemaker youth, food systems, culture for development and digitalization and will apply them to its portfolio of experiments.

The relationship started when CONCYTEC invited the Accelerator Lab to participate in their National Innovation Week in 2021, and in 2023 we facilitated a presentation at the same event by Maria Veronica Moreno from the Argentina Lab on their citizen science initiative. This has generated interest by CONCYTEC in organizing a pilot experience on citizen science jointly with their research institutes on the mountain and amazonic ecosystems.

The Digiamig@s initiative is based on the Digichiquihuites experience designed by the El Salvador Lab, but has been expanded nationwide with UNV’s participation and their volunteer network. We’re currently in the process of gathering insights from the young volunteers and preparing a videoblog on this experience.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can we activate, build and maintain links with citizens that lead to fluid and sustained participation and action?




What are the tools, methods and capabilities within UNDP needed to cultivate sustained citizen participation?




> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



These methods and tools will allow the Lab to validate and refine the existing methodologies that we have worked on during the past learning cycles with citizens throughout the country, while also gathering insights from our CO colleagues on what works best and what doesn't. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We do not have a systematized and accessible toolbox for sustained citizen participation within UNDP Peru, and several projects that involve citizens usually end up losing momentum. The information and data we gather will allow us to shape the tools that we have been working on during our previous learning cycles and test them with different programmes and in different national contexts.



## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The growth stage for this challenge would be the creation of the cross-cutting unit within UNDP Peru (much like the recently created gender unit) that ensures that all projects have a citizen participation component in its design and/or implementation phases. Additionally, through our work with CONCYTEC and the Peruvian Ministry of Production and its ProInnóvate unit we could collaborate in creating new lines of work in government agencies that leverage open participation in citizen science or in social and environmental innovation projects.
