## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. A Policy on Public Service Innovation does not necessarily mean that innovation will 'happen' over-night - sensitization and understanding what innovation is, what it looks like, developing an innovation mindset and why it matters in the context of improved service delivery is equally important. 2. Innovation leadership is fundamental to embed innovation across disciplines and job functions and categories. It is not enough to have an innovation committee or unit but actual leadership to promote  a certain way of behaving and thinking about things is required 3. A set of basic competency skills needs to be developed - critical thinking, curiosity, communication, collaboration are taken for-granted and require nurturing. 4. Toolkits are great but are only part of a piece of a bigger puzzle in defining how innovation should happen. 5. Collaborating withe the end - users and developing human centered approaches is under-appreciated and undervalued.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes, several: COVID 19 and the limitations of digital literacy and skills, absence of airtime and data to transition to an online platform prevented many from joining potentially productive on-line bootcamps. The bureaucracy and lack of sense of urgency assigned to sticking to a deadline to invite participants.  UNDP's procurement system in printing the toolkits.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These were ideal in monitoring and sourcing participants who would join the bootcamps.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We wanted to see whether a context-specific tool would serve as a catalyst to spur innovation thinking, so a prototype of what existed (re-mixing existing toolkits) was ideal.  We used the bootcamps to introduce the toolkits and at the same time shared the Accelerator Lab methods to develop capacity (training).
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Office of the Prime Minister

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

N/A

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The participatory and training the trainer approach was useful in that we were both participants and observers in the evolving 'experiment'.
