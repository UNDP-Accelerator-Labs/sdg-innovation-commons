THE DISABILITY SAFEZONE PROJECT

> Brief description of the innovation

RATIONALE OF THE PROJECT
The rationale of this project is creation of safe spaces and worthwhile disability zones. The existence of a Disability Zone safe space has potential to elicit heated reactions from society. They have power to strengthen the voice and relevance of persons living with disabilities. Safe spaces have recorded a high number of success stories in most developed countries. The Disability Zone Project seeks to provide emotional security, an interconnectedness of similar values and nurturing/stimulating environment. The Disability Zone Project seeks to pilot a haven safe space for persons living with disabilities. This project will boost the performance of persons living with disabilities, they provide a break from judgment, unsolicited opinions, they allow people to feel supported and respected. This will involve weekly group meetings with a mentor who provides training on health, leadership and life skills, as well as discusses issues that affect Young teenage girls who are disabled on issues to do with sexual reproductive health rights, child marriage and adolescent pregnancy, and how they can seek help. The safe space will  also have a simple rule that boosts its long term impact.

TARGET GROUP
The target group for the disability zone project  will be people living with disabilities physical, health and mental disabilities in schools at Primary, Secondary, Tertiary and locals communities.
GOAL
The overall goal of the Disability Zone project is to create an enabling safe environment for persons living with disabilities.

CO FINANCING
There is Low-to-medium risk that additional resources will need to be mobilized to achieve many of the actions. 
SUSTAINABILITY PLAN
Long term sustainability the Disability Zone Project is very Vital it is for this reason we embark on practicing agriculture ventures and kive stock keeping which are already existing. Furthermore we will market our project professionally and call on board stake holders that can drive this noble agenda with Fountain of Peace and Support Organization at large. Lastly we will take advantage of partnerships with organizations that are existing. We arrived to a consensus that many of these initiatives fail due to lack of a sustainability plan therefore we will strive at creating a worthwhile technical capacity through the development and dissemination of normative documents and support in their application.

> Technical Feasibility

IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
The implementation of the project will be managed by Fountain of Peace and Support Organization. The  process of policy dialogue will determine priorities at international level and this will generate buy-in for national level action. Representative organizations of people with disabilities at each level will be involved at all stages of the project's development - at the level of the "project committee", in the development of each core product/action and the development and monitoring of the project. A strategy for how to effectively involve people with disabilities will need to be agreed at the planning stage for each action. Each level will be responsible for reporting on actions under their responsibility which will be consolidated by Donor. This project fits within the overall programme, policy and monitoring structure of Fountain of Peace and Support. In this context, the project will be subject to all of Fountain of Peace and Supports operational procedures e.g. contracting, procuring, finance control, etc. Fountain of Peace and Support has internal operational oversight and audit procedures which obviate risks such as corruption, a well rounded code of conduct  and mismanagement. Criteria for selecting pilot projects will be developed within the first six months of the project. They will need to take into consideration interest from the country, governance, available infrastructure, human resource capacity, finances available, partner capacity (Government, NGO and social organizations), and the ability for the project to leverage systemic change and increase regional capacity for action. Across the portfolio of activity, attention will be given to ensure gender equality, pro poor emphasis and cross disability involvement with a focus on underrepresented groups. Tools on how to assess the situation and the readiness of countries for policy change will be developed as part of the project. These tools will assist in providing a contextual analysis, building a baseline and identifying stakeholders, and will be employed with countries during national level policy dialogues on the Donor report.
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Fountain of Peace and Support has a results based management system and accountability framework which makes it possible and easier to measure progress against objectives, expenditure and for informing the revision of policies and strategies. Mechanisms for monitoring are intrinsic to a number of the activities:
 Situation analysis which will provide some contextual/ based line information, including gender issues and challenges based on available information. From this analysis progress can be measured, for example on theprojects developed under Outcome. The mechanisms for monitoring each action will be determined based on the action being implemented and the stakeholders involved. 
 The guidelines promote monitoring and evaluation and provide guidance on developing a situation analysis and collecting base line information when initiating programs. This project will also develop more detailed guidance on monitoring which will promote the need to collect disaggregated data- sex, age, and socioeconomic status. Once completed, these guidelines will be used in projects and learning shared through the networks, through writing papers and giving presentations.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This project has as a cross-cutting objective relating to the development of networks at country level. These will support resource mobilization, sharing and exchange. On the other hand the  team will work tirelessly in ensuring well management at all levels. However additional funding for activities will be required beyond the end of this project. Young people with disabilities (YPWD) commonly face more discrimination and severe social, economic, and civic disparities than their non-disabled peers. For many YPWD, exclusion, isolation, and abuse, as well as lack of educational and economic opportunities are commonplace. As a group, YPWD are amongst the most marginalized and poorest youth in the world. Their basic rights are not well met and societal acceptance is often out of reach. People with disabilities also have poorer health outcomes, lower education achievements, less economic participation and higher rates of poverty than non-disabled people. One reason for this disparity is that people with disabilities experience barriers to accessing services. These difficulties are exacerbated in less advantaged communities. The large majority of people with disabilities live in developing countries, often under poor conditions, lacking the basic support and services that would improve their lives considerably. Access to reproductive health information is often not disseminated or available to YPWD. For example, in several developing countries like Zambia, South Africa to mention a few  YPWD often do not receive advice on HIV/AIDS, as the clinics are physically inaccessible, material is not available for those with visual impairments, and providers are unable to communicate in sign language. Moreover, most health care professionals have no disability awareness and, consequently, feel unwilling or unable to address their issues.
Society tends to think that people with disability should be non-sexual. In many cases, sexuality education is withheld because it’s assumed the person ‘won’t need it’. Some people hold the misconception that people with disability shouldn’t have fulfilling sex lives or have access to sexuality education, in case it ‘gives them ideas]. People with disability also find that information on sexual and reproductive health is often inaccessible to them.
