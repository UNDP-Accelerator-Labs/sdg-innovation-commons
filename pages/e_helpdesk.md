> Brief description of the innovation

The E-Helpdesk is a web based system for college students to access the college helpdesk while they are away from campus. Mostly during the pandemic. Unlike phone calls which only allow the helpdesk to attend to a few students, this system can be used by various students at the same time.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The E-Helpdesk is designed for higher learning institutions. It will substitute the physical helpdesk which requires students to be on campus. During the COVID-19 pandemic, students have had issues accessing E-learning platforms. This has been a challenge to most institutions who in most cases use a single phone number. This has reduced the number of students they attend to. 
Even during the time students are in campus this system will prevent overcrowding at college helpdesk offices thereby promoting adherence to COVID-19 guidelines.

> Technical Feasibility

The E-Helpdesk is designed firstly with a Frequently asked questions page, student login page and staff (admin) login page. This system can have multiple admins and students. When a student sends a query, the query is received by one of the helpdesk staff who then responds and forwards the query to the staff member responsible for the query. After which the responsible staff member responds and the response is relayed to the student.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The E-Helpdesk will improve student satisfaction and performance. Because of the quick and easy access to helpdesk services. Because of challenges accessing E-learning platforms in most institutions, students have failed to write their online exams and even submit assignments. This system will prevent this and improve overall student performance.
