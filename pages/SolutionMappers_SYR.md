# The Euphrates River Knowledge Flow Initiative

### [[0:00]] Tell me your name and your job position\.

My name is Kenda Alzaim\. I'm head of solutions mapping from Syria\.

### [[0:06]] OK\. And before we begin, do you consent to for this interview?

Yes, I do\.

### [[0:11]] OK\. Thank you\. I would like you to if you had to give a title to your story that you're going to share, what would that be like in one sentence?

I believe it would be knowledge flow\.

### [[0:25]] Knowledge flow\. OK, OK, so can you tell me about this story, how it started? Can you give me a little bit of the context?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
Yes, actually it started around the story of a river\. So that's where it came\. The aspiration of knowledge flow came from\. It's a river in Syria\. It's called the Euphrates River, and it's actually a cross\-border river\. It goes through three countries, Turkey, Syria and Iraq\. And this river is facing a lot of challenges, whether it's climate change, the recent conflict or ongoing conflict in Syria and actually the policies that are adopted by the three countries\. And this this river serves around 23 million people\. So it has a very, it's very important\. And actually it has a very cultural significance as it was a home for, for civilized like thousands years old civilizations\. The issue is that we were trying to figure out how can we start working on issues in the, on some of the issues that the, the, the river is facing\. And actually what we needed to know is how people are actually affected because of the challenges that are faced because of the climate change\. For example, there is now declining water liver and also because of the policies that are followed by some of the countries, also the water levels are even declining more and more\. So it's affecting not only the life of people around the river, but also it's affecting the biodiversity there\. But when you see the work, and I'm here, I'm talking only about Syria and Turkey and Iraq, when you see the, the work that has been done, you only see work around rehabilitation, but you cannot see work that is related to the biodiversity because it's not on the, on the list, on the priority list anymore\. So what we said, OK, now we need to know where to start because it's again, it's a very complex challenge\. It's a sensitive topic\. So we need as an Exertede lab to know where, where we need to start\. So the first thing that we did is to start to search, like do a research to look for reports to see like human stories around the river\. And what actually we found is very little\. And the things that we found are we considered like inaccessible knowledge in a sense that they were very technical and it needed technical people to know, to comprehend and actually to take an action\. So we thought, OK, if we want people to take an action when it comes, for example, for biodiversity, we need to be able to communicate with the challenge itself that look, the refer is facing this challenge, it's affecting biodiversity in this way\. And this is what you can do, but we don't have that kind of information that is really structured in one place or what we call like we don't have that accessible knowledge\. And actually we were about like, like we were really, really confused until we came across a platform called the Mekong River\. It was done by an organization called 1 Water\. And what they did is that they depicted the, the journey of the Mekong River and they added all the information and they actually added all the information that are related to mechengrivers to make they made it easy for the audience to see it to any type of audience\. So they, they form this kind, this type of accessible knowledge\. And what I mean by that is you can find their photo stories graphic that you can actually read\. You can find numbers that are related to the declining numbers of some type of species that are there\. So you were, even if you're not from the countries that that the Mekong River goes through, you were able to understand the whole challenge and to know where the action can be done\. So we said, OK, why don't we do something similar for the Euphrates River? And that's when we started creating a platform, a knowledge based platform around the Euphrates River\.

### [[4:22]] That's really interesting\. And you mentioned, you know that as a tool\. And would you like to share a little bit perhaps of, you know, when, when you were understanding the context?

Yes\.

### [[4:36]] Who were those stakeholders involved in this journey? What was their role and how did you work with them? How did you share together?

[[tools:Human centered design]]
[[tools:Design thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
OK, so you want me to talk about the tools 1st and maybe we can go to the sequels\. OK, for the tools, actually we, we, we had like tools that we used re implementation, if I can say it\. And during the designing of the platform and post designing, when we finalized thing redesigning, it was when we did like some kind of a system mapping, OK, we needed to know who are the stakeholders for example, that we needed to work with? What is how does the challenge looks like and what do we need? What kind of knowledge do we need to produce and what kind of storytelling tools that we want to use in the knowledge, whether there are photo stories, whether there are articles, videos, stories from the field, these kind of things\. So and visualizations, of course, and graphic design that are related to the, to the\. So these tools we used before we started the design and during we, we tended to use like human centered or design thinking where we needed to go actually into, into the community themselves\. Understand the challenge to talk to people who were going to be the users of this platform, whether there are researchers, the community themselves and UNDP and even the government and post that\. Now it's the time to start publishing and diffusing the, the platform to, to like, like for, for other people, for the users to other people to see it\. So we had like different set of tools, whether it was through workshop, whether, which was through call for research\. Like, OK, guys, we do have this platform now let's we did like a call for research so they we can start generating content to feed into this platform\.

### [[6:28]] OK, that sounds very excellent\. And thinking about moments where you have to pivot or change the course of, you know, the actions because you realize something was needed to be done differently\.

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Proof of concept]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
Can you tell me a little bit those would be the tactics? Yes, at the beginning, actually what we wanted to do is again, it's a very, it's a very sensitive topic\. So we needed to know who we should work with, whether they are the government and whether they are other countries\. So at first, like we, I can say we were naive\. Like we said, oh, OK, it's a very cool thing to do\. We're doing the platform, another platform that we can, that can inform the future, design the future, the future policies and even any kind of research can going to be done around the authorities\. But actually in reality it was very hard, again because of the sensitivity of the topic\. You cannot actually work directly with the with the government\. You need to know what you are presenting to them because they might stop the, the project from the beginning\. So we need to have a valid case\. And then we thought that we designed and finalized the project\. And then we had when we started meeting with the government and we started like, you know, to do this initial kind of communications, we thought, oh, OK, it's very sensitive\. They want to be approving it\. So we need to change the way we are presenting ourselves\. We need to change the way we are doing things in order not to face any the risk of shutting down the whole challenge or the whole project\.

### [[7:58]] Thank you Kenda for sharing that\. I also wanted to ask you, So what is the actual development issue that you're addressing?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
You mentioned you know the central issues, but how is that linked to development problems? Yes, actually the essential issue like what we started with, we were working, we were working around the challenge how the declining water rivers and Euphrates is affecting communities and the Bayesian and affecting biodiversity\. But we shifted we, we and we started working like this challenge became our case for a bigger case, which is knowledge management or knowledge sharing\. So this was the issue\. And if I can put it more into word is it's when we are doing all this kind of research, we are doing all this kind of product products and we are generating all of this risk, all of this knowledge out of this product\. But this knowledge is many times is inaccessible\. Again, either it's because technical, it's not user friendly, or it's not even published or not communicated in the right way\. So we turned from like solving or not trying to work on the Euphrates River to working on a like a link challenge, which is which is like knowledge, knowledge sharing in general that's directed to sustainable development goals\.

### [[9:24]] Great\. And can you tell me, I mean, you've been mentioning in in a way the outcomes of you know, this work and this platform\. But if you want to mention something specific, yes\. Can you please share?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
Of course, now what we have is platform that tell a story around the Euphrates\. And this story can be read by anyone, whether they are local communities, academia, the sustainable development practitioner, the government, the donors, anyone who's interested in this topic can read\. So first, you can use it, use it for advocacy, to advocate for the challenges around the Euphrates River, whether it's biodiversity or the issues that people are facing\. But from more like more realistic touch or like when you're actually working with people, you are in touch with people, you can transfer these stories\. And the other thing that you can do besides advocacy is also you can, it's a space for journalists, researchers, academia to share their products, but in more accessible ways\. So they can turn their products into photo stories or can turn it onto some kind of graphics that can tell the that can tell the outcomes of their research to the public or can bring it bring it front into the into the public\.

### [[10:44]] Thank you, Kenda\. And just trying to wrap up some of the learnings\. I wanted to ask you if you know you had to do this again, how, what would you do differently?

[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
It's not that easy question because it was a learning process\. So what we tried to do from the from the beginning is whenever we had an issue, we learned from it and then we changed\. So this helped us in a way not to regret any step or all to say, to reach upon, to say, oh, I wish I've done it differently\. Whenever we're faced with challenge, we try to quickly adapt to it and try to address it\. So we won't be faced with such kind of question\. And also it's still like for us, yes, the platform is there, but it's still in the has the it's still open for development and it's still open for the suggestions and still open for any kind of yes, any kind of new features added\. So in that journey that you said that, you know, you recognize challenges to then, you know, like readapt and what were some of those, you know, like maybe assumptions that you appear to be wrong and that you have to readapt to\. One of the assumptions is again, like, as I said earlier, that we thought that everyone will be on board, that we're doing something as simple as knowledge sharing product\. And we thought that this product is, is something that will help multiple stakeholders and there's something for each one of them\. There's something for the government to create new policies and to and to advocate for the fretted river\. There's again something for sustainable development practitioners and there's something for the committee themselves\. So we were like somehow naive to thinking that everyone will be on board\. But this was wrong because everyone, the first thing they did think about is not the thing they will be getting out of this platform, but the troubles that they will be that they will be facing if the platform went online, you know, because of the sensitivity of the topic\. And then it was hard because, you know, it wasn't designed yet\. So it was hard for people to imagine also what is added value? Isn't it just another platform on the web? What is different? How it's different from any other things that you've been doing? So we needed, so we did\. So this assumption we needed to work on it and to work on the communication materials that we were on or the communication methods that we're doing to, to bring people on board\.

### [[13:23]] That's great\. And is there anything else you would like to add that you feel it's important?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Data sharing]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
Yes\. And again, it's related to the importance of knowledge sharing and it's related to a message that I said earlier, which is we always, we are very good at generating knowledge\. But when it comes to sharing, I don't think we're doing a good job because we think that all people have the same kind\. Or we have assumptions that all people or who are interested in our topics on sustainable development have the same kind of maybe educational background or cultural background and they can access knowledge easily\. But it's not the case in reality\. So we need to always adopt our ways or change our methods\. So in order for our knowledge to actually be accessible\.

### [[14:16]] So thank you\. Thank you, Kenda\.

Thank you, Alina\.
