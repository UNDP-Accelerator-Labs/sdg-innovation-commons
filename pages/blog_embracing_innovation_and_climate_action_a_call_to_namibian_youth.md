Head of Experimentation - UNDP Accelerator Labs Namibia

As the Head of Experimentation at UNDP Namibia, I have had the privilege of witnessing firsthand the incredible potential of our youth in driving climate action and innovation. Recently, I attended and co-facilitated a workshop at the request of our Sustainable Environment Management, Energy and Resilience (SEMER)(link is external) team, that brought together young minds from across Namibia to discuss and develop solutions for climate change. The experiences and insights gained from this event have inspired me to share some key takeaways and suggestions for our youth as they step into their roles as advocates for climate change.The Power of Networking and ExposureOne of the most significant observations from the workshop was the need for better and intentional networking among the youth. Exposure to events, workshops, and conferences can elevate the level of innovative solutions around grassroots innovation and local indigenous knowledge. Hence, there is a need for platforms to connect like-minded individuals, experts and young people to exchange ideas, learn from each other, and collaborate on projects that address climate change in meaningful ways.Creating Communities of PracticeRelated to networking and exposure, and to foster knowledge sharing and learning, it is also essential to create communities of practice. These communities could serve as platforms where youth can come together to discuss challenges, share successes, and learn from each other's experiences. These networks create safe learning spaces to ensure that valuable knowledge and innovative solutions are disseminated widely and effectively.Chat GPT for Climate Change?Interestingly enough, and not surprisingly, when listening to the pitching of solutions, I could not help but detect that ChatGPT had become a staple go-to, in a number of presentations. While I am a cautious advocate in embracing artificial intelligence (Ai), the reliance on large language models (LLMs) to developing solutions has to be accompanied by moving beyond what the model generates. The pitch session revealed that some solutions presented were typically Ai- Generated, which left me feeling that those presentations were devoid of context and personalization. To create impactful and relevant solutions, we must encourage our youth to delve deeper, contextualize their ideas, rely on the wisdom of their peers and infuse them with local knowledge and personal experiences.Embracing Creat-a-thons and Nature-Based SolutionsOne exciting way to foster innovation is through organising create-a-thons. These are intensive, collaborative events where participants brainstorm and develop solutions in a short period. Additionally, nature-based solutions using biomimicry can offer sustainable and effective ways to address climate challenges. The work of our Accelerator Lab Colleagues in UNDP Ukraine and UNDP South Africa has shown that looking to nature for inspiration, we can develop solutions that are both innovative and environmentally friendly.Encouraging Experimentation and CuriosityExperimentation and curiosity are the bedrock of innovation. We must encourage our youth to be curious, to ask questions, and to experiment with new ideas. Our UNDP Accelerator Lab in Panama(link is external) as well as Argentina(link is external) have embedded the use of Artificial Intelligence and citizen science to foster a culture of curiosity, experimentation and continuous learning. This is necessary for us to unlock the creative potential of our young people and drive forward-thinking solutions for climate change.Contextualizing Climate Change to NamibiaOne other observation at the workshop, is that context matters. It is vital to contextualize climate change to Namibia and understand the relevance of climate change to our youth. Our country faces unique challenges, and our solutions must reflect our local realities. There is a need for us to align climate messaging with issues such as unemployment and resource inequality so that we can foster ownership and action.Using Social Media WiselySocial media is a powerful tool for advocacy, but it must be used wisely and intentionally. Instead of merely following influencers, our youth should use social media to share their stories, raise awareness, and mobilize action. The term “Be found doing” is a mantra that we have come to adopt as both inspiring and a call to action. This mantra helps us embrace the need to actively engage in climate action and share efforts online, creating a snowball effect so that other young people can inspire others and create ripples of positive change.Holding Space for Each OtherOne of the most heartwarming moments of the workshop was witnessing how the youth held space for a young gentleman who stuttered but managed to communicate his message from the heart. This act of kindness and support exemplifies the hope for the future and for Namibia. It reminds us that, together, we can create a supportive and inclusive environment where every voice is heard and valued.Hope for the FutureThe workshop left me with a profound sense of hope for the future. Our youth are ready to lead, and they have the passion, creativity, and determination to drive meaningful change. By supporting them, providing opportunities for networking and learning, and encouraging innovation and experimentation, we can empower our young people to become champions of climate action.The future of Namibia lies in the hands of our youth. As a practitioner in the development space, it is high time that we nurture their potential, support their efforts, and work together to create a sustainable and resilient future for our country. The journey ahead may be challenging, but with the collective efforts of our young people, we can overcome any obstacle and build a brighter tomorrow.
