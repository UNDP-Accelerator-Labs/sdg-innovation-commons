> Title of the innovation

To give chance or time to every learner in residential areas the time  to study out of the house but at home  to push work further.

> Brief description of the innovation

This is a project which benefits both government and residents to have libriries throughout residential areas in Zambia opereting at a small fee rather than having them travel or move to town to study and spend money on transport.
And this will give encouragement to youths or under grade 12 learners to stop spending time at the malls and more time researching at these ‘stay home libraries'.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Residents will pay to study or research from the libraries and pay to use them, the target is undergraduents and adult busy students who need to study away from home but within their home area.
The challenge price will generate an income for an upgrade such as computers and data for research and the value is that it will help our people have an environment they can study in other than Home or School.

> Technical Feasibility

At this point no prototypes have been made, this is but a suggestion.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It would balance up the mode of recreation in the community thus, it would  give learners the zeal and encouragement and a condusive environment to study.(This Idea was created with the all students at home in thought to have a place to study, as a a learner I had difficulty studing from home due to the activities that demanded my attetion, now as a part time student and an employee I still need a place to study from).
