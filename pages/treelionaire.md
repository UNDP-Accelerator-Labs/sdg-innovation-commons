We are chopping down about 15 billion trees a year and planting about 9 billion. While industrial-scale solutions are needed, citizens too can make a difference. Led by the Dhaka Hub of the voluntary organization Global Shapers Community, Treelionaire is a citizen-led tree-planting drive. The project not only ends on planting trees but also extends its support in a concept called tree guardianship and greenwalk. Engaging with students at school and nature lovers, Treelionaire inspires everyone to know more about trees and create ownership inside the community. 


Till date Treelionaire has mobilized and collaborated with 27 hubs across South Asia and planted over 10000 trees. We even made few high level partnerships.
