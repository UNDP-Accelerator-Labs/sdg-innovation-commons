> Title of the innovation

Education for all. Supporting Government to create employment by building a private School. At the the end of the day employing a number of unemployed youths.

> Brief description of the innovation

Education is key to any successful life. If people were to improve their living standards, they must be able to raise their level of understanding the way things must be done. Women are particularly key to developing a country, hence the need to come up with an innovation that will promote women education.
Children are key leaders to wealth creation and this bring about the need for guiding them through the right education. Youths are pillars to raising the standards of living and more productivity. They have all the energy to apply themselves in various sectors of our economy. All they need is entrepreneurial education. Hence the need for coming up with the initiative to create more opportunities for them to access education through a private school to provide the services the country need to see economic development.
This is just an idea in the pipeline. Opportunities have not been there for me have enough finances to realise this dream. My youthful years have been wasted in the street languishing with hard labour just to feed my family.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will be able to generate income in the following ways:
1. School Tuition Fees
Planning to have 2 classes for grade 8-12 with at least 20 to 30 learner. For example, if  one pupil pays K4000 per term, this will translate into K40,000 for a class of 20 pupils. K40,000* 10 classes will give the innovation K400,000. To manage the little resources , a qualified accountant should be charged with the responsibility.
2. Venturing into Production unit.
Production unit can generate more income than the user fees. Tomatoes and onions production as well as aqua culture can be giving the school more than K30, 000 per week. K120, 000 per month.K1,440,000 per year.
I can project the rise from this figure because the more experience gained the more innovative would become.

> Technical Feasibility

The organisation of the my innovation.
I would put up a competent team to operate the innovation. Qualified headteacher, Deputy head, Accountant, members of teaching staff and production managers. With  the rightly qualified team, success would be guaranteed. 
Strict control of withdraws would be another measure that would help control misuse of finances. 
GOOD PAY.
Good pay to the work force is one way in which financial theft can be avoided. If workers are able to generate enough resources, pay them well, thievery will be curtailed. Since I have enough experience in business, I would also come up more ways of sealing financial leakages.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The social impact will be 
More opportunities to my fellow teacher languishing on the streets of Zambia.
Employment for those that had no opportunity to finish their education due financial inability in the production sector. The community stand to gain where a number of learners with financial difficulties would find free access to education.
