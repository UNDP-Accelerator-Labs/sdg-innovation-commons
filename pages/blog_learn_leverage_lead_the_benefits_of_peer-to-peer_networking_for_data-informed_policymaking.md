As this article discusses, some policymakers are turning to each other to tackle these challenges through spaces such as the Data to Policy Navigator and the Data to Policy Network.
A US$9,700 project breakthrough thanks to peer-to-peer learning In Kenya’s Tana River County, water reserves are expected to fall 70 percent(link is external) below internationally acceptable thresholds by 2050. Victor Awuor, Head of Solutions Mapping at the UNDP Kenya Accelerator Lab, is well aware of this fact. Over the past year, he has been gathering data in collaboration with local farmers, herders, the county government, and national water authorities to inform water management strategies. In mid-March 2024, his work caught the attention of a project coordinator in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), who had been leading a similar community mapping project combatting water scarcity. When she read about Victor’s project on the Data to Policy Navigator – a digital public good helping policymakers design data-informed policies – she wanted to learn more.The two connected shortly after and discovered several overlaps in their project approach. However, there was one key difference. While the Kenya project spent US $9,700 in software licenses to aggregate all community data, the DRC project used a free platform called mWater(link is external).This was a striking difference for Victor. While $9,700 might seem trivial in the broader context of addressing water scarcity, he knew these savings could go a long way in supporting the sustainability of this high-impact initiative in a resource-constrained environment.Following his call with the DRC project coordinator, Victor recommended to local Kenyan policymakers that they transition to the mWater platform. He emphasized how this decision could save the region thousands and, more importantly, protect Tana River County's water resources for generations to come. This project breakthrough didn’t happen in a vacuum; it was the result of peer-to-peer learning. Discover Victor’s and other projects on the Data to Policy Navigator(link is external).

Overcoming barriers to data-informed policymaking togetherEach country has its own regional dynamics and cultural identity that make it different from even its closest neighbours. However, commonalities can be found in the challenges that policymakers face in their decision-making processes, particularly in the Global South.Last year, based on conversations with 19 policymakers and 15 data experts across countries, UNDP’s Chief Digital Office identified a set of shared patterns and barriers to decision-making. The list includes limited access and resources, lack of tech know-how, complex governance, among others.However, these barriers can be overcome.As witnessed in Victor’s story, peer-to-peer learning can help civil servants overcome their biggest roadblocks. By connecting with experienced peers and sharing insights, the learning curve becomes less steep. Additionally, this exchange of ideas can generate new learnings, creating a feedback loop for scaling innovation.Ultimately, peer-to-peer learning is a powerful tool: it can turbocharge policymakers, propelling them to impactful problem-solving.As a digital public good available to policymakers across countries, the Data to Policy Navigator is now facilitating this peer learning. The tool was developed by UNDP in collaboration with the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) to address modern challenges faced by policymakers to tackle data access, resource challenges, and technical proficiency.
‘Data to Policy Network' opens the door to global peer-to-peer exchangeWhereas the Data to Policy Navigator provides a platform for learning, the Data to Policy Network provides a vital resource for policymakers to share and connect. The Data to Policy Network(link is external) was launched in 2023 during the United Nations General Assembly(link is external) by a multistakeholder group comprising UNDP, the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, and GIZ (on behalf of BMZ).The Network carves space for policymakers across countries to share lessons learned, discuss setbacks, and celebrate wins in their data-informed policymaking journeys. Additionally, policymakers can attend tailored learning sessions curated by leading data and tech companies, such as the Open Data Institute, BMZ Data Lab, and Paris21.Over the past few months, the Data to Policy Network has been gaining momentum. It already brings together mid- to senior-level policymakers from 26 countries from every continent. Their policy backgrounds are as diverse as their geographic backgrounds, from analysing immigrant needs with geospatial data to guiding agricultural policies with land use data. While some policymakers within the network do have more advanced data expertise, it is not a prerequisite for joining. You too can join the Data to Policy Network!Ultimately, this Network is for any policymaker interested in designing responsive and data-informed policies.
