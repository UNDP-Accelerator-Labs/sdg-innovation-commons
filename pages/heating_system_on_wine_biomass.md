> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The invention's goal is to use wine biomass as an energy resource, specifically to provide heat to buildings using this energy. This energy, along with other benefits, will help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change by lowering greenhouse gas emissions, reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, and improving citizens' quality of life.
The invention works on the following principle: first, biomass should be collected during the wineyard pruning season (December - March) and then transported to the warehouse for drying and storage. Before the heating season begins (early autumn), the biomass is shredded,  transported to the beneficiary as a final product and loaded into the heating system. The frequency with which the fuel is loaded into the heating system is determined by the volume of the storage/bunker. Biomass can be loaded once a week or once every two weeks.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

Yes

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

There are no obstacles in our opinion.
The important thing is that biomass of the required amount has to be collected annually, stored, shredded, and transported to the target site on time.
