> Title of the innovation

Sustainable energy source production  (Biogas production from household waste)

> Brief description of the innovation

our innovation,fuel-gas production,is a complex and technical innovation that we have narrowed to the use of simple and local materials and further employed the use of waste organic matter rather than the industrial application of synthetic matter,our innovation being environmentally friendly targets and promotes waste management as our raw materials are waste products that mostly contribute to environment degradation and degrades the ozone layer as they have high content of methane and ethane. This fuel gas categorically known as Bio gas is a type of gas fuel naturally produced from the decomposition of organic matter. When this organic matter is exposed to anaerobic respiration they free a blend of gases. Scientifically, there’s a fermentation process that breaks down organic matter, turning what once was waste into a source of energy that can be used to heat, cool, cook, or for regular electricity production, once it’s burned.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We will be selling the biogas digester and biogas, our project will help existing business in that we shall be buying equipments such as drums pvc pipes just to mention a few,the equipments that we buy from them will be used to make biogas digesters. Our target audience for a start are truck drivers, farmers in rural areas, and any potential customers in need of our products. The challenge prize will help us to buy a  permanent place where we will be able to produce the gas, apart from that we intend to build a biogas plant. value addition to the environment as earlier eluded, our innovation is environmentally friendly, the usage of the biogas balances the carbon cycle of the environment thereby increasing the amount of ozone by preventing nitrogen oxide from breaking it down in addition to that, it promotes a decent environment, reduces land pollution, air pollution, and will leave room for dump reserved cites to be used for other developmental projects. Our aim is to fight environment degredation and help curb climate change and have healthy and sustainable communities and the environment at large

> Technical Feasibility

the physical design involves simple local materials such as plastic drums, water pipes,  Stop cork, elbows and a funnel.
Having mounted two prototypes,we decided to carefully demonstrate in a video the methodology and show the design of our prototype and futher proved it's efficiency Our project management tool that facilitates  the execution of a strategic plan for our cooparetive innovation by breaking down the implementation process into smaller steps. Firstly, we are a cooperative of 30 youths and all the work will be done by us,  we have an executive comprising the Chairperson, Treasure Secretary, organiser and disciplinary. Being the Chairperson i will be overseeing the the production. Our production site will be located in Lusaka west. Our packing will vary depending on the customer or consumer demand, being Small, medium even large quantity packaging, in terms of marketing, we shall open different social networking sites to advertise our products. Apart from that, we will also do a word of mouth to our customers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation  is not only  restricted to the energy sector,it also expands to the agriculture sector as the product is used in heating of livestock buildings and water  it's further used in running small engines like water pumps for irrigation .it's futher used for pest control and is a fungalcide,it also tackles the health and environmental sector by reducing wastes in our cities which is also a control to certain outbreaks of disease like the precedent cholera out break as it tackles waste management by creatively recycling it into an efficient marketable business product (bio gas). Biogas production is relevant to promote the expansion and optimization of the entire biofuels production process at a low cost.
