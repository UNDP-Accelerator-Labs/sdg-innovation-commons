Executive summary

Frontier technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI),
are projected to be some of the most transformative
technologies in human history. AI in particular offers
profound promises to human development across a variety
of sectors from healthcare to agriculture to the arts.
However, the boons of technological revolutions are rarely
shared equitably between and within nations. Many of
those who could benefit the most are left out of discussions
on the design and implementation of these technologies.

There is an untapped wealth of knowledge and perspectives
that have tremendous potential for guiding technological
revolution on a human-complementary path. However,
incorporating such a mosaic of voices poses challenges in how
to record, understand and analyze the different perspectives in
a comparable manner across geographies, identities and
opinion categories. Yet, identifying trends across these
dimensions provides insights that inform decision-making by
policymakers and developers, and so it is a worthy challenge to
pursue.

The Framework for National Dialogues on Frontier Technologies
(hereafter referred to as the Framework) was designed to meet
this need and offer a mechanism for holding consultations that
can gather perspectives from the Global South on these
technologies. This Framework is part of our Capstone Workshop
project with the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) Accelerator Labs Network, as graduate students at
Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs
(SIPA). We collaborated with Accelerator Labs in Morocco and
Paraguay in March 2024 for piloting to test the methodology,
using AI as the frontier technology of examination.

This Report provides detailed rationales for many of the design
choices and recommendations we made in the Framework. In
essence, the Report acts as a supplement describing our
intellectual journey taken to reach the final Framework.

Introduction

Report Outline

This Report acts as a supplement to The Framework for
National Dialogues on Frontier Technologies. The Framework is
a guide for United Nations (UN) staff to conduct national
dialogues in the Global South on emerging technologies,
gathering perspectives and sentiments from citizens of nations
which are underrepresented in the global conversation on this
topic. Our pilot consultations and this Report zero in on AI as a
key frontier technology, delving deeper into its implications and
potential impacts.

To ensure conciseness, accessibility, and usability, the
Framework focuses only on the most important details a UN
team would need to conduct consultations. This report
documents the underlying rationale, motivation, and
experiences.

These additional details are outlined in the sections below.

Section 2: Global South and Frontier Technology. A technical
overview of AI, a leading frontier technology which was used
as a case study during the design of the Framework, and its
implications for the Global South (a term which is further
defined). The Framework is situated within broader UN
initiatives and Social Science literature, highlighting the gap
in representation of the Global South which this approach
seeks to ameliorate.

Section 3: Design. An overview of the design,
experimentations, and research activities conducted by the
student team from Columbia University’s School of
International and Public Affairs (SIPA). This section details
the piloting of the Framework which took place in March
2024 in Paraguay and Morocco, conducted with deep
support from respective UNDP Accelerator Labs.

Introduction

Section 4: Reflections. Borne primarily from experience in
the piloting phase, with secondary research and expert
interviews as inputs, key approaches are outlined for
optimal consultation delivery. Themes in this section include
the importance of socializing the need for a consultation to
attain partnership for delivery, localizing language and
examples of technology, proactive measures to ensure an
inclusive process, and data analysis methodologies.

Section 5: Next Steps. Following successful piloting in March
2024, and with a growing urgency to represent Global South
voices on technological development, multiple UN entities
have expressed interest in utilizing the Framework. Several
UNDP Accelerator Labs are likely to be early adopters and
there are other initiatives across the UN and civil society
which can benefit from this methodology. Suggestions for
future SIPA Workshop projects, as can be foreseen at this
stage, are also included.

Global South, Artificial Intelligence,
and Frontier Technologies
Background to Artificial Intelligence
and frontier technologies

Technologies like steam and computers, recognized as General
Purpose Technologies (GPTs), are celebrated for driving economic
evolution through the 'increasing returns to scale' concept
(Bresnahan and Trajtenberg 1995). Similarly, Artificial Intelligence (AI)
exhibits characteristics of GPTs, such as substantial intrinsic growth
and wide applicability, particularly evident through its generative
capabilities (Hötte et al. 2023). Given AI's expanding role in both
specialized and everyday applications, it is becoming an essential
element of various frontier technological advancements (Mckendrick
2023).

The debate over defining Artificial Intelligence (AI) is complex, with
numerous perspectives on what characteristics are essential for a
system to be considered "intelligent." UNDP (2018) has used an
overarching definition of AI as the “theory and development of
computer systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human
intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-
making, and translation and interpretation.” OECD countries have
reached a consensus on a comprehensive definition: “An AI system is
a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers
from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as
predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can
influence physical or virtual environments. Different AI systems vary
in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.” This
definition encapsulates the essential features that distinguish AI from
non-AI systems, emphasizing their ability to infer, adapt, and
autonomously interact with their environments (Russell et al. 2024).

10

The emphasis on AI is not just about harnessing its direct capabilities
but also about unlocking the synergistic possibilities it offers when
integrated with other technological innovations.

The concept of AI, formally introduced at the 1956 Dartmouth
Summer Research Project, posits that machines can simulate any
form of intelligence, a belief that has historically outpaced the actual
capabilities of the technology (Dartmouth College 2016). AI's
development trajectory has been marked by distinct phases, with the
current wave of enthusiasm being fueled by advances in generative
AI models, such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, and MusicLM, which create
text, images, and audio from simple prompts, respectively (Altman et
al. 2023).

These models, which have moved beyond traditional classification
tasks, reflect the broader category of frontier technologies that
include digital, physical and biological innovations like drones,
electric vehicles and gene editing (UN 2023). AI can be broadly
classified into three distinct categories, each signifying a different
level of technological advancement and sophistication (Villeneuve et
al. 2018).

Narrow AI is the category which encompasses systems designed to
perform specific, repetitive tasks efficiently by analyzing and learning
from patterns in large datasets. As of latest knowledge, all existing AI
technologies fall within this category. There are also posited states of
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence,
but these are beyond the scope of this national consultation process.
Advances in the technology might require a differentiated approach
to the Framework.

These areas exemplify the significant transformative influence AI
could have across numerous sectors. Nonetheless, the brisk pace at
which these technologies are advancing also presents substantial
hurdles, particularly concerning the fair distribution of their benefits
and the repercussions for employment due to automation, which are
acutely felt in the Global South (UN 2023). The imbalance of who
inputs on the direction of the technology design and implementation
further-compounds the inequality.

11

The applications of AI span various fields, illustrating its versatility and
transformative potential (Villeneuve et al 2018):

Predictive Analytics: Leveraging vast datasets to predict future
outcomes based on numerous input variables, predictive analytics
exemplify AI's capability to forecast with accuracy across different
scenarios.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): This area of AI empowers
machines to understand, interpret, and generate human-like text
and speech, bridging the communication gap between humans
and technology.

Computer Vision: AI models in this domain are equipped to “see”
by extracting valuable information from digital images and videos,
enabling a multitude of applications from facial recognition to
autonomous driving.

Robotics: Traditionally synonymous with AI, robotics embodies the
physical aspect of AI through software-driven machines capable of
performing a range of tasks autonomously or with minimal human
intervention, making it an accessible and tangible representation
of AI's capabilities.

In the context of AI, bridging the developmental divide between the
Global North and South is seen as a critical, human-complementary
challenge. AI's potential misalignment with the values and needs of
users in the Global South poses normative, societal, and economic
disruptions. The general-purpose nature of AI means it is intrinsic to
the function and advancement of other frontier technologies, making
its integration a non-negotiable component for development (The
Economist 2024).

12

Rights-based approach

The rights-based approach to development promotes and protects the
fundamental human rights of the agents and stakeholders for whom the
development practice is designed. This approach takes a different
perspective than economic development that focuses on economic
indicators such as average income and maximizing utilities. The line
between the two approaches is often blurred in development practice.
Some critics, who hold a technocratic view on development, argue that
human rights should be moderately sacrificed for economic growth (see
Easterly 2013). On the contrary, some scholars refute that such an
argument is tragically misguided and human rights are its own
imperative category (Donelley 2013, 229). Sen (1999) argues that in fact
the protection of human rights and economic development mutually
reinforce each other. In other words, not only are human rights an
important end, but they also serve as a means to development. Sen
(1999, 148) reasons that political and liberal rights are preeminent
because of “1) their direct importance in human living associated with
basic capabilities; 2) their instrumental role in enhancing the hearing
that people get in expressing and supporting their claims to political
attention; 3) their constructive role in the conceptualization of ‘need.’”
Such normative considerations are the underlying driving force behind
this work: the goal is to further-democratize participation on frontier
technologies.

The Framework is inspired by the human rights-based approach in the
context of frontier technologies: in particular, it provides a platform for
people in the Global South, realizing their capabilities to have their
voices heard and exercising their rights to expression in policy making
and development practice. After all, technological changes are affecting
every sector of our rapidly digitizing world, for example, changing work-
life balance, worker productivity, and access to education.

The ability to participate in political dialogues and express one’s voice is
fundamental to human and technological development. Not only is the
human rights perspective normatively desirable on its own merit, but it
is also a common practice in the work of the UN.

13

As human rights are a central pillar of the UN, manifested in the
adoption of the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, there is universal
agreement on international norms and standards for a life of dignity and
well-being for all. These human rights principles, defined as universality,
indivisibility, equality and non-discrimination, are at the core of UN
processes and programming. They apply to all equally and adhere to the
firm understanding that all have the right to participate in decisions that
affect their lives (UNFPA 2005).

This framework is reflected in UN development programming, as the
human rights-based approach (HRBA) aims to both protect and promote
these standards at the center of development problems, address
discriminatory practices, and unjust distributions of power that impede
development progress (see UNSDG 2024). Therefore, HBRA mandates
that “the plans, policies and processes of development are anchored in a
system of rights and corresponding obligations established by
international law, including all civil, cultural, economic, and social rights,
and the right to development.” (UNSDG 2024). Even though there is no
universal approach on the implementation of a HRBA in development
processes and programming, the centrality of these principles is
summarized in the Statement of Common Understanding on a Human
Rights-Based Approach to Development, summarized below (UNSDG
2003):

All programmes of development co-operation, policies and technical
assistance should further the realization of human rights as laid
down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other
international human rights instruments.

Human rights standards contained in, and principles derived from,
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international
human rights instruments guide all development cooperation and
programming in all sectors and in all phases of the programming
process.

Development cooperation contributes to the development of the
capacities of ‘duty-bearers’ to meet their obligations and/or of ‘rights-
holders’ to claim their rights.

14

It is important to highlight that rapid technological changes affect
vulnerable stakeholders disproportionately, rooted in current inequities
in access to technologies. This is emphasized by the Assistant Secretary-
General for Policy Coordination and Inter-Agency Affairs, Maria-
Francesca Spatolisano, stating that “knowledge gaps exacerbate existing
disparities in income, education, employment and access to housing and
health services.” (UN 2024).

The Framework thus aims to acknowledge and learn from these
disparities in the Global South. It offers guidelines, along the lines of a
human rights-based approach, to processes and programming led by
the UN. The methodology looks to integrate the voices of marginalized
and vulnerable stakeholders in conversations on the effects of digital
frontier technologies. This way, the Framework reaffirms the notion that
human rights apply to all equally and have the right to participate in
decisions that affect their lives, particularly of those who are only users
of these technologies and have not been involved in their design and
implementation.

Status quo in frontier tech in Global North and Global South

“There are many examples of successful AI implementation in
the Global South which needs to be modelled and seen as
examples by rest of the world, rather than always referring to
Global North case studies.”

Eleonore Fournier-Tombs,
Head of Anticipatory Action and Innovation at the United Nation Centre for Policy Research

It is important to note that the UN does not have an official definition of
the Global South. The political construct of the meaning of Global South
and the artificial division of the Global North and the Global South are
controversial. The existing literature treats the Global South not as
merely a geographical concept. Rather, the Global South is embedded
with economic, political, and historical connotations.

15

It also has to do with colonial history, which shapes the political
dimension and the social culture in a historically traceable and
unanimous way in the so-called Global South (Arun 2020). Scholars
explore these collective identities and the power dynamics beyond the
nation-state (Mahler 2017). Moreover, some literature regards the
Global South as a metaphor that refers to marginalized players, not
necessarily nation states. However, the term’s adequacy in addressing
the unique challenges and opportunities these countries face regarding
the rapid development and deployment of frontier technologies, should
be re-evaluated.

The binary model that artificially divides the Global South and the Global
North further bears conceptual and practical challenges. On the one
hand, the meaning of “Global South,” as mentioned above, is
conceptually ambiguous. On the other hand, it forces us to think of
frontier technologies and their impact from two politically and socially
distinct perspectives. Although this could be a good interpretative
model, the readers are invited to consider the notion of Global South
and Global North as a descriptive model. Arguably we tend to pay more
attention to the voices from the Global North for its advancement in
frontier technologies and prevalent technology guidelines. The Global
South is marginalized in this regard. This Framework should be seen as a
democratization of perspectives on frontier technologies on a global
scale. It aims, to some extent, to deconstruct such binary models
through inclusive consultations and dialogues worldwide.

“When technology is imported without knowledge of how it
will be useful to the local context, Paraguay often gets ripped
off as the technology does not live up to the expectations
which foreign sellers had ramped up.”

Paraguayan government official

The term “Global South” should be used to acknowledge structural
limitations. In addition, Global South is an umbrella term that captures
subnational entities within countries, including cities, states, and
regions, which will be key actors in global conversations on policy and
governance of frontier technologies.

16

The Framework aims to bring nuances to this binary model, to give
spaces and agency to those who have been absent and marginalized
from global discussions on frontier technologies, and to ensure inclusive
governance. The use of the binary descriptive model, to repeat, is not to
further divide the world along the political rhetoric of North and South,
but to promote inclusive technology development and ethical guidelines.

Generally speaking, the Global North is more productive than the Global
South in technology infrastructure, development and ethical guidelines.
The Global South typically lacks sovereignty in producing, using and
developing frontier technologies Currently, countries in the Global South
encounter hurdles such as lower incomes, high poverty rates and limited
educational opportunities, which pose challenges to integrating frontier
technologies (De Asis 2023). These obstacles include knowledge gaps,
resource constraints, language barriers, infrastructural limitations, and
legal and political challenges. AI adoption, as an example, is less
advanced in the Global South, compared to the Global North, where
these technologies are more readily integrated into various sectors. For
instance, no African country is in the top 50 for AI preparedness
(Gutteres 2024). Moreover, the Global South's participation in global AI
governance dialogues is often limited (AI Advisory Body Interim Report
2023). In addition, the underdevelopment of AI, and thus the low AI
literacy and awareness, makes it hard for marginalized people in the
Global South to meaningfully engage in dialogues.

Moreover, in the case of AI, the countries that have produced the most
ethical guidelines and regulations within the international community
are predominantly located in the Global North (Jobin et al. 2019). In
other words, technology in the Global South is operating on the
paradigm of the Global North in many ways. The problem lies in the fact
that this paradigm of design is ill-suited for the Global South, and it
worsens the systemic harm and inequality between the Global South
and Global North (Arun 2020). Thus, it becomes increasingly important
to understand how the Global South perceives frontier technologies and,
more importantly, how people in the Global South, across diverse
demographics, engage with these technologies in their daily lives.
Current global inequalities are rooted in the context to which frontier
technology is applied, and thus the exclusion of stakeholders from the
Global South will only exacerbate this inequality (Chan et al. 2021).

17

However, the lack of such technology regulations in the Global South
may lead to harm and human rights issues (Arun 2020). People in the
Global South, from all corners of society, as equally the end-users of
frontier technology, must be included in the process of formulating
technology guidelines and ethical norms.

are trained in the Global North are deployed in the Global

Benefits for the Global South

Over the past decade, the Global South has embraced myriad
technological tools to confront a broad spectrum of traditional
development challenges outlined by the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals. Within this context, a diverse array of emerging
trends has surfaced, notably for AI, in the domains of agriculture,
healthcare, education, environment, finance and social policy.

In the realm of agriculture, AI-driven applications have been
particularly useful for just-in-time crop disease detection. For
instance, the banana, a globally popular and essential staple food in
many developing countries, faces challenges in production due to
various diseases and pests. AI disease and pest detection systems
exhibit a promising trend, providing crucial support to farmers in
developing communities (Selvaraj et al. 2016).

Healthcare has experienced notable attempts to integrate AI to
address the unique needs of rural communities in the Global South.
For example, AI predictive models have been successfully
implemented to offer free automated voice calls to engage
expecting mothers in rural India in telehealth services, spanning
from pregnancy to the child's first year.

18

This initiative has reached over 2.9 million women across nine states
(ARMMAN 2023). Similarly, in Zambia, on-device AI models, functioning
without internet connectivity, have provided feedback scores to enhance
the capabilities of minimally trained ultrasound operators in resource-
constrained areas (Mutai et al. 2021).

In the education sector, AI applications represented a $500 million
sector in 2019, and estimates suggest that by 2024, its utilization in
education will surpass $6 billion annually (Visaltanachoti et al. 2021).
Diverse projects within this domain range from identifying students at
risk of academic desertion in Colombia (Zea et al. 2019) to the
development of teaching assistants to support science education in West
Africa and beyond (SuaCode.ai 2023).

These examples represent only a fraction of the wide-ranging AI-
powered applications that can benefit people in the Global South.
Anticipation surrounds the expected surge in AI innovation over the next
decade, with active efforts from companies, governments, and various
organizations to expand initiatives for the development of technological
infrastructure. However, it is imperative to acknowledge two caveats.
First, the distribution of benefits within a given nation can be quite
imbalanced. Second, research findings indicate that AI has the potential
to exacerbate existing systemic problems, including bias and
discrimination, especially towards women and marginalized
communities, or to stoke new forms of discrimination (Nicoletti et al.
2023).

“It comes up a lot but you shouldn’t treat the Global
South in the same way, while its true there’s a lot of
nuance and there are a lot of GS countries with thriving
AI ecosystems. Binary view can be exclusionary and
obfuscates the issues and potentials.”

Eleonore Fournier-Tombs
Head of Anticipatory Action and Innovation at the United Nation Centre for Policy Research

Risks for the Global South

The risks and challenges posed by AI to the Global South are multi-
faceted. First, there is a notable gap in representation and inclusion of
governments from the Global South in high-level AI policy discussions
and working groups. Their perspectives on AI’s potential and risks are
largely absent, which could lead to policies and developments that do
not consider their unique circumstances; this is in addition to the
perspectives of everyday people from the Global South, which is even
further under-represented (Chan et al 2021)—this is what the
Framework seeks to ameliorate. The establishment of AI research labs in
the Global South is hindered by infrastructure challenges and high costs,
limiting their presence to a few countries such as India, Brazil, Ghana,
Kenya, and South Africa (Okolo 2023). This scarcity is exacerbated by the
"brain drain" phenomenon, where local talents, once trained, often leave
for opportunities elsewhere, further impoverishing the local AI
ecosystem in terms of leadership and skilled workforce (Google 2022).
Another notable trend is gaps in investments in AI. Of the $300 billion
estimated global investment in AI by 2026, only $6.4 billion (2%) is
expected for Africa and the Middle East (IDC 2023). At the same time, a
concerning trend is the outsourcing of data labeling jobs to the Global
South, where labor laws and wages are less stringent. For example,
Kenyan workers were hired for data labeling tasks for OpenAI, facing
low wages and exposure to harmful content, which raised ethical
concerns about the working conditions and the psychological impact on
these workers (TIME 2023).

The digital divide represents an even broader societal challenge,
preventing access to the internet and the adoption of digital services.
This divide is particularly stark on the African continent, where internet
access is hampered by infrastructural deficits (United Nations 2023). This
gap threatens to exacerbate inequalities and hinder progress towards
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to poverty, gender
equality and climate change. Furthermore, digital literacy is crucial for
making the most of digital services, yet countries in the Global South
face a significant skills gap. This gap not only limits individual and
societal opportunities, but also impacts the labor market, with a looming
displacement of jobs that require digital skills unmet by the current
workforce (GIGA 2023).

20

Vulnerable and marginalized groups, including minorities and the
displaced, often suffer the most from the digital divide. For instance, in
Uganda, digital ID systems have inadvertently deepened social inequities
by excluding significant portions of the population from essential
services, due to factors like lack of internet access or electronic devices
(UNDP 2022).

Overall, while AI and other frontier technologies present opportunities
for addressing development challenges in the Global South, they also
bear significant risks that need careful management. Addressing these
risks requires inclusive policies, investments in local capacities, and a
focus on bridging the digital divide to ensure that technological benefits
are equitably shared.

Mapping of ongoing conversations

In the context of such an inequality, it is imperative to map the ongoing
conversations around frontier technologies with a critical perspective.
Numerous communities, especially those in the Global South are notably
absent from these conversations, despite the potential implications for
their livelihoods (AI Advisory Body Interim Report 2023). Co-designing can
help better align technology to the needs and wants of these
communities - this is the main motivation for the Framework.

In conversations about AI within the Global North, there is a consistent
focus on topics such as privacy and the development of reliable systems
for healthcare and smart cities (Timcke and Schültken 2023). Although
there are recognized risks related to espionage, warfare and cybercrime,
AI systems in the private sector are often associated with positive
outcomes and societal benefits, as highlighted by Manyika and Bughin
(2018). Political leaders express concerns about surveillance, automation,
the future of employment and the potential for widespread job loss, as
evidenced by legislative efforts like the European Union's Digital Services
Act and Digital Markets Act (Timcke and Schültken 2023). Furthermore,
existential risks associated with AI, including the potential for
autonomous weapons or uncontrolled AI systems, have prompted
significant discussions at high-level forums, e.g., at the UK AI Safety
Summit (Harwell 2023). Risk frameworks and mitigation strategies have
been incorporated into major legislation by the European Union on the AI
Act (European Union 2024).

21

Polls also show substantial concerns over discrimination and the social
impact of AI (The Lloyd's Register Foundation 2021).

Conversely, conversations about AI in the Global South are more
cautious. Academia and civil society organizations in the Global South
tend to pay more attention to the social consequences of AI systems,
whereas governments and private enterprises often overlook these
discussions. Researchers from the Global South particularly emphasize
issues related to colonialism and imperialism, as noted by Kwet (2019)
and Birhane (2020). Moreover, although there is anticipation of benefit,
e.g., AI will significantly enhance precision agriculture in the Global
South, as suggested by Ampatzidis, Partel, and Costa (2020), there are
concerns that these systems may also pose risks to land ecosystems,
causing harm, distress, and damage to animal welfare and the
environment, as highlighted by Ryan (2019).

Overall, while AI and other frontier technologies present opportunities
for addressing development challenges in the Global South, they also
bear significant risks that need careful management. Addressing these
risks requires inclusive policies, investments in local capacities, and a
focus on bridging the digital divide to ensure that technological benefits
are equitably shared.

This indicates that those in the Global South contextualize AI ethics
within existing power dynamics. From this standpoint, it becomes
imperative to examine the long-term impacts of AI on these power
structures, acknowledging that if unchecked, AI could exacerbate
existing inequalities on both national and international levels.

Amidst these backgrounds, the UN’s role and convening power becomes
all the more important. One such effort to ensure equitable inclusion in
global convenings include the UN’s Global Digital Compact (GDC), which
includes a specific objective to govern emerging technologies, including
AI, for humanity. The GDC has seen significant contributions from the
Global South, emphasizing the need for inclusivity, equity, and
addressing the digital divide. The perspectives and demands from the
Global South highlight the importance of a multilateral, inclusive
approach to digital and AI governance that considers the unique
challenges and opportunities faced by developing countries.

22

The G77 and China, representing a significant bloc of the Global South,
stress that the GDC must reaffirm “the importance of inclusive and equal
participation by all countries, the vital leading role of the UN in AI
governance and international cooperation, in addition to the importance
of providing capacity building, technology transfer and knowledge
transfer to developing countries in this regard,” (Ikonere 2024). This
perspective is rooted in the recognition of the digital divide and the need
for equitable access to digital technologies and the benefits they can
offer. Accelerating and scaling up digital capacity-building, especially in
the Global South is urgent, as noted by UNDP in their submission, as it is
“the most frequent request we receive from our partner countries in
relation to digitalization.” (UNGIS 2024).

The GDC also received submissions from, and continuously engaged
with non-state stakeholders from the Global South. For example, the
submission of the Global Digital Justice Forum represents a collective
input from a diverse group of development organizations, digital rights
networks, feminist groups, trade unions, and corporate watchdogs from
the Global South. It highlights several issues and proposes principles,
goals, and actions regarding the regulation of AI. It emphasizes the need
to address immediate concerns caused by the concentration of
economic and political power, social inequalities, and the potential
misuse of AI technologies in military contexts. Key principles include
ensuring public oversight of AI (“No AI is too powerful to evade public
oversight”), implementing the precautionary principle in AI regulation,
and preventing AI uses that threaten peace and human well-being.
Governments are urged to enforce transparency and accountability
regulations for AI service providers and promote investments in
infrastructure and human capabilities for AI development (Global Digital
Justice Forum 2024).

"The AI Loop is about understanding the tech people in this
field, their common habits and codes, they have specific habits
that they share which we need to unpack to diversify a
discussion."

These discussions underscore a growing acceptance of AI's inevitable
integration into our societies. However, it is essential to note the
tendency to focus on preparing individuals to adapt to technological
change rather than critically evaluating whether such technology aligns
with their needs. Despite the global discourse surrounding AI, the top-
down nature of current global conversations merely touches on the
surface of a nuanced and intricate topic. Therefore, there is a clear and
pressing need for a framework that actively gathers perspectives from
grassroots levels, ensuring an understanding of the diverse needs of
communities worldwide. This emphasizes the urgent necessity for
fostering inclusive dialogues that empower all stakeholders to shape the
future of AI in line with shared values and aspirations. Ultimately,
meaningful progress can only be achieved by actively engaging and
having dialogues with people at all levels.

The AI Loop, developed by members of the Sciences Po Media Lab (Big
Data and Society 2024) is a framework for situating actors along the AI
production and implementation lifecycle (loop). The framework
conceptualizes AI as being built on data that is generated in the world at
large, then used to train models, which are in turn applied in the real
world, creating more data and looping back. Within this loop, there are
distinct roles that actors play in understanding what AI means,
establishing AI models, and building systems that integrate these
models. Around this loop is the regulatory world that bounds the AI loop
through government legislation. This model offers an interesting
sociological perspective. It was used to analyze the results of several
consultations conducted in France that intended to document the
concerns and perspectives of national actors involved in the
development and deployment of AI. These concerns and perspectives
were then categorized into key archetypes that were situated within the
AI loop. Similar approaches were taken with a survey conducted in the
UK by the Ada Lovelace and Alan Turing Institutes (June 2023), wherein
major application types of AI were put to interviewees to derive cases
with highest perceived benefits and risks.

These surveys represent novel methodological approaches in
conceptualizing the role of AI in our society so that we can better gather
citizens’ perspectives.

24

However, their focus is so far only on specific Global North countries,
and this limited scope means that the challenges are not the same as
in the South. Therefore, while substantial inspiration has been drawn
from their methodology it is important to acknowledge that many of
their approaches are not directly transferable to the diverse landscape
which encapsulates all Global South countries. To achieve a balance
between cross-country comparability and in-country specificity, as
described in the Framework, an endogenous logic is applied for
localizing and sequencing consultation processes.

How the UN is bridging the gap on conversations
with the Global South

In March 2024, the UN General Assembly adopted by consensus a
resolution establishing principles for the deployment and use of AI.
The resolution provides a comprehensive vision for how member
states should respond to the opportunities and threats posed by AI.
More importantly, the resolution lays out a path for international
cooperation on AI, including promoting equitable access and taking
steps to manage the risks of AI, protect privacy, guard against misuse,
prevent exacerbated bias and discrimination. Crucially, it has been
developed in consultation with civil society and private sector experts
and encompasses both top-down and bottom-up approaches, as the
resolution addresses the priorities of many developing countries, such
as encouraging AI capacity building and harnessing the technology to
advance sustainable development. The AI resolution makes clear that
protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms must be central
to the development and use of AI systems (UN 2024).

The UN has the power to amplify the voices of people in the Global
South to ensure that AI benefits are not monopolized by a
concentrated few, while risks and harms are absorbed by others.
However, the UN can only understand the opinions, hopes, and fears
of civil society and how people envision the role of AI in their future, by
including their voices directly into this dialogue.

25

Following the guidelines and principles of the UN's Post-2015 “Future
We Want,” this Framework collects voices from diverse groups of civil
society in a dialogue around AI and frontier technologies. For UNDP,
the information gathered in these national consultations is directed to
UNDP headquarters in New York with the overarching goal to inform
the global conversation on frontier technologies like AI. Key
information on the specific frontier technologies, like the AI landscape
in specific countries, will be provided to local UNDP country offices for
further dissemination with relevant stakeholders (UNDP 2024). Non-
UNDP entities are also encouraged to utilize this framework.

Methodology

Purpose

The purpose of the Framework is to facilitate consultations that can
provide the UN with a plurality of perspectives on the potentials and
risks of frontier technologies, as perceived by individuals in the Global
South. The Framework should help structure national dialogues
facilitated by UN teams. Therefore, our work in designing the
Framework focuses on two main activities:

Participation and Observation in National Dialogues: By organizing
and attending dialogues, we ensure that the Framework is
adhered to and captures emergent themes and insights directly.
This would also allow engagement with participants and
facilitators, enhance the depth and breadth of data collected.

Consolidation and Reporting of Dialogue Outcomes: By analyzing
findings from the dialogues, we crafted a narrative that reflects the
perceptions of technology in the Global South in the countries
where the dialogues took place. For each consultations process, we
developed a comprehensive report to be disseminated to relevant
stakeholders within the UN system, ensuring that the insights and
perspectives from the Global South significantly influence larger
processes and discussions at a global level, such as those
occurring within the UN Secretary-General's Advisory Board on AI,
the High-Level Panel on Digital Cooperation, and Office of the
Secretary General’s Envoy on Technology.

Team structure

We adopted a flexible approach to team roles so that we could adapt
with agility to project needs:

We organized our team into three equal work streams to reflect
dimensions of the Framework that needed to be designed and
aligned:

Who should consultations consider including? Which
stakeholder groups and demographics are important to
speak with?
How can consultations be conducted? Which modalities and
for what purposes?
What questions should be asked? Which order should the
query take to enable a logical flow to the discussion?

Following the piloting phase, we restructured to focus on the
important aspects that emerged during our travel:

Framework design and iteration to ensure robust but concise
guidelines.
Findings from the piloted consultations, considering how
data should be recorded and analyzed.
Familiarizing the approaches in an accessible and mutually
beneficial manner. Giving consideration to the likely
stakeholder landscape of UN entities and designing intuitive
graphics to explain the logic of the Framework.

At each stage, the groups were never siloed, and cross-collaboration
was built-in through inter-group teams focused on specific questions
we needed to solve to build a better Framework.

Approaches taken

As our Framework prioritizes flexibility and modularity, so too did we
have to inform our design process through a mixed-methods
approach. Some activities that we undertook through this process
included:

White-boarding was integral to our work, as this was fundamentally
a design project driving towards a modular Framework. Through
many cross-team sessions, we brought in each group’s expertise on
Who/How/What to iterate on key logic that drives consultations.
The outcome of these exercises was our prototype that we piloted
in Morocco and Paraguay, as well as several other schemas such as
stakeholder mapping and outreach strategy which are shown in
Annexes 4 and 5 of the Framework.

Expert interviews with academics, advocates, journalists, and
methodology experts greatly improved our understanding of the
wider landscape of digital development in the Global South, the
challenges of running consultations such as these, and the UN
ecosystem that might utilize the findings from these consultations.

We used red-teaming to divide members into blue and red teams.
The red team is tasked with adopting an antagonistic stance,
against which the blue team has to defend. In our case, the red
team were stand-ins for participants with personas that may be
problematic for the Framework to navigate. These included those
with almost no technology literacy, disruptive participants, or
someone who was highly knowledgeable on the topic and wanted
to only speak to their area of expertise. This exercise was extremely
helpful for fine-tuning our Framework to account for such difficult
instances, thus pre-empting steps and guidelines for facilitators to
navigate such situations.

29

Methodological approaches for piloting

To maximize the learning potential of our piloting phase in-country,
we adopted differentiated approaches in our methodology:

In Morocco, we engaged with large groups, using few modalities.
In Paraguay, we engaged with small groups, using many
modalities.

Overall, we found the approach in Paraguay to be more manageable
for facilitators, small enough to allow for deep dives that can generate
insights, and appropriately multifaceted for reaching a broader
audience. This is our main rationale for the recommendation that can
be found in the Framework for a “mixed methods” approach to
running a national consultation.

Morocco

Country Overview

Morocco, officially the Kingdom of Morocco, is a country located in the
northwestern corner of Africa, bordered by the North Atlantic Ocean
and the Mediterranean Sea. The country ranks 120th on the Human
Development Index, categorizing it as having medium human
development (UNDP 2024).

Morocco's culture is shaped by Arab, Berber, African, and European
influences. Arabic and Amazigh are the official languages, with Darija
being the primary dialect spoken. French is widely used in business,
education, and governance, a remnant of French colonialism from 1912
to 1956. Spanish is spoken in northern areas, reflecting Spain's
historical connection (BBC News 2023).

Morocco is emerging as a significant player in the field of AI in Africa,
showcasing a favorable ecosystem for the development of a holistic
and responsible vision of AI. The country is recognized for its assets in
research and training, positioning itself among the top 5 African
countries in terms of AI readiness (Morocco World News 2023). This
readiness is underpinned by a growing AI market, projected to expand
by 17.44% between 2024 and 2030, reaching a market volume of
US$1200.00m by 2030 (Statista 2024).

30

Several key stakeholders are instrumental in shaping AI policies and the
development landscape in Morocco. The government agencies play a
crucial role. While Morocco has a national digital strategy, it does not
have a national strategy specific to AI, meaning that there is no
integrated vision to address the challenges and opportunities of AI.
Notable agencies include the Digital Development Agency (DDA), which
engages with a variety of stakeholders, including companies and
research institutions, to foster digital development. Other major projects
include Morocco’s AI Movement International Center which was the first
in Africa to be designated as category II by UNESCO (2023). Universities,
such as the University of Hassan II in Casablanca, are involved in
developing AI-powered systems for healthcare, exemplified by an AI
system for early diagnosis of diseases leading to blindness.

Despite the promising growth and integration of AI across various
sectors, Morocco faces challenges such as gaps in technological
infrastructure. The country has made efforts in this area, for example,
advancing mobile data consumption: 100% of the population has access
to electricity, and 88.1% of the population use the internet. However, the
fact remains that major infrastructural provisions are crucial to enable
the deployment and development of AI (UNESCO 2024).

During the field work, a prominent challenge came up related to
Morocco’s multilingual context with its diverse languages: Arabic, French,
and English. This necessitates creating AI tools that are culturally and
linguistically sensitive.

Challenges arise from the limited availability of high-quality datasets for
non-dominant languages, potential biases in AI models trained primarily
on English language data, and the complexities of formulating inclusive
AI policies and governance that address the needs of all linguistic
groups. Additionally, efforts must be made to bridge the digital divide to
ensure equitable access to AI technologies across Morocco's diverse
linguistic landscape.

To address these challenges, stakeholders have called for robust AI
regulations to ensure ethical, transparent, and responsible AI
deployment. There is a need for dialogue among civil society
organizations, governments, policymakers, and citizens to understand
the implications of AI technologies and develop policies that mitigate
potential harms.

Plan for the week and methodological approach

The SIPA team, composed of five Workshop members, landed in
Morocco on Saturday, March 9th, 2024. Over the weekend, we took
the opportunity to regroup, immersing ourselves in the country's
vibrant cuisine and rich culture. Additionally, Najoua Soudi, Head of
Solutions Mapping at UNDP Accelerator Labs Morocco, graciously
invited us to share an iftar meal during the week.

Key findings

To understand the findings that came from our week of focus groups,
we need to first situate the conversations to understand who we spoke
to. The people we spoke with had a fairly high level of education and
an understanding and awareness of AI overall, but we were generally
in cities or working with partners connected to tech. Additionally, we
spoke to mostly, though not exclusively, youth participants (which in
Morocco is defined at between 18 and 35). Our second consultation in
Oujda was the main exception, with contributions to the conversation
coming almost exclusively from an older demographic during that
consultation. Some older adults participated in the Berkane
conversation as well as both Salé conversations. The participants were
all middle to lower socioeconomic status, and consultations were held
in English, Arabic, and French.

When given an opportunity to select an area or sector to discuss in
connection with AI, education came up in most of the consultations.
Other areas discussed were privacy and job markets.

AI tools: Throughout the consultations, ChatGPT emerged as the
most frequently mentioned technology, with a notable emphasis
on its application in research and its prevalence on social media
platforms.

Themes of consultations: When given an opportunity to
select an area or sector to discuss in connection with AI,
education came up in most of the consultations. Other areas
discussed were the role of privacy and security, as well as job
markets.

Figure 4: themes

Overall, there was a great interest to learn more about the vast
field of AI and its benefits in consultations, which is the reason
why many participants were seeking to have a dialogue with
others on this issue.

Figure 5: benefits

34

AI in education: Throughout the consultations, participants
expressed the belief that AI could enhance education. One
strength of AI is its ability to process large volumes of
information and generate clear answers much faster than
humans. Participants felt this meant that there was potential
for time to be saved in research, learning, and translating.
While cheating was mentioned as a potential risk of increased
AI use in education, it was also dismissed as not presenting a
severe risk, since it can be addressed by teaching proper
values and integrity to students.

AI and privacy: Comments on privacy and security were
varied, including on both a personal and national level. In
multiple consultations, data privacy concerns were
mentioned, particularly in connection to social media, and
photographs or deep fake applications of AI.

AI and job markets: Responses about the potential impact of
AI on future job opportunities were varied and often
contradictory. While many participants expressed concerns
about AI replacing jobs in the future leading to fewer
economic opportunities, many others mentioned an increase
of economic opportunities, especially in fields like e-
commerce or for those individuals who are proficient in AI.

Maintaining values and integrity: One consistent theme
across many of the different areas mentioned was a strong
desire to ensure that “Moroccan values” were maintained
through any use of AI, particularly ensuring that a strong
human component accompanies any use of the technology.
One participant referred to this as the necessity for “human
supervision” to ensure it is used appropriately.

35

Responsibility: We noted that when asked about
“something going wrong” with AI, responses immediately
focused on misuse of the technology, with little to no
mention of AI hallucination or other malfunction. When
mentioned, tech malfunction examples were often about
non-AI based tech, although a small number were true AI
hallucination or embedded bias. Throughout the
consultations, the developer was the one that is always
mentioned to be responsible for AI. However, there was
also a strong sentiment that the responsibility for
mitigating local risks of AI fell largely to Moroccans. The
reasons behind this sentiment differed: some felt that
developers had already done what they could to mitigate
risk, while others believed that technology makers were
solely interested in profit and disregarded the risks. Trust in
developers was stronger among people who were avid
users of AI, or who worked in AI development. Parents and
teachers were among the other groups of people
mentioned as holding responsibility over AI use.

Strong desire for AI training: Another theme was the
importance of access to training on AI. This was brought up
during a number of other consultations, including those
about future job suppression, avoiding risks, and
excitement for the future. While the specific objectives or
content of the training were not explicitly outlined by
participants, there was a clear and consistent emphasis on
the importance of AI education. Suggestions were made to
integrate AI into educational curricula, highlighting its
importance for both individual and collective readiness. The
people we spoke to were highly interested in learning more
about AI and how they can make use of it in their own lives.
Many participants expressed the understanding that AI is
crucial for their future and that those who do not keep up
will be left behind. We feel this is one of the strongest and
most consistent insights offered from these preliminary
consultations and is worth attention.

Methodology amendments from trip

Our time in Morocco provided valuable insight into hosting
consultations and contributed to the strengthening of the
Framework and recommendations made.

Clear communications: Close collaboration and
communication with partners are essential for the success
of consultations. This collaboration ensures alignment of
objectives, shapes participants' expectations, and allows for
a more tailored approach to engagement. Partners' deep
understanding of the local context and community
dynamics provides invaluable insights for designing
meaningful dialogues. Open communication fosters trust
and mutual respect, enabling us to navigate challenges and
adapt our approach as needed, ensuring that the
consultations are relevant, engaging, and beneficial for all
involved parties.

37

Co-creation: It would be beneficial to foster closer
collaboration with the local Accelerator Labs before the trip.
This would help allow a clearer understanding of the
stakeholders involved in the consultations, allowing for better
preparation and tailored approaches. Furthermore, allocating
more time prior to the consultation for co-creation would be
beneficial. This proactive approach would enable facilitators to
anticipate potential challenges in the dialogue's
implementation, providing ample time to secure additional
support like translators or notetakers to assist during the
consultations.

Working with partners: Working with partners: Good
communication with partners about the purpose of the
consultation is essential, but not always sufficient during the
preparatory stages. Different entities have different interests
and agendas. Working together requires aligning objectives
early on, meeting all partners’ priorities in the middle, and
spending the necessary time on designing the agenda,
messaging, and tone of the consultation correctly. This
consideration has been emphasized in our Framework,
focusing on effectively socializing the need for consultations
to avoid any priming effects that might influence participants’
expectations or responses.

Selecting consultation modalities: Each consultation
modality has benefits and drawbacks, many of which are
contingent on the number of people and space limitations. We
planned for focus groups which work best with small groups
of people who share similar backgrounds and knowledge
levels. In order to get enough participants, higher numbers of
invitations were sent out.

38

This is a
Heer

We were fortunate to get higher than expected participation
based on those invitations, which resulted in rooms that had
in the range of 15 to 30 people. These were effectively closer
to “town halls” than focus groups, which affected the
dynamics of the consultation. This highlighted the importance
of tailoring consultation methodology to the participants, and
choosing the right space, both for quality of responses as well
as ease for the facilitator. New recommendations in the
Framework address the appropriate times to use different
modalities, and resources to allow facilitators to adapt.

Managing participants: During consultations, facilitators
have the difficult task of keeping the conversation focused
and balancing the voices in the room, particularly when
stronger voices threaten to overpower weaker ones.
Facilitators should be aware of existing cultural power
structures that have made it into the room and can
influence who is given more time and space to speak. In
Morocco, gender as well as age dynamics were clear in the
consultation. For consultations to be inclusive, it’s important
for all participants to be able to share freely. Smaller group
sizes could be more manageable for facilitators, allowing
for better capture of sentiments and more balanced
participation. New recommendations in our Framework
offer strategies for facilitators to achieve this balance, both
during the consultation and in the preparatory phase. By
intentionally forming smaller, more diverse groups, we can
create an environment where participants feel more
comfortable sharing, ensuring a richer and more inclusive
dialogue.

Adjusting questions: These preliminary consultations
allowed us to observe how questions were interpreted by
participants and pointed to where adjustments needed to
be made. In some cases, this meant adjusting wording to
make questions more straightforward or to keep the
sequence from feeling repetitive.

39

Given that our consultations also took place in up to three
languages, sometimes all in the same conversation or even
sentence, our time in Morocco also highlighted the role that
translation can play in facilitating consultations. Expanding
the question list and adding notes on intention allows
facilitators more agency in selecting questions, ensuring
better flow of conversation, and mitigating confusion of
participants. This approach also allows for facilitators to
probe deeper into responses offered, which helps to mitigate
priming effects of socializing or address mirrored responses
from participants based on what they have heard and not
first-hand experience.

Travel considerations: Travel and logistical considerations
should always be carefully planned, especially when aiming
to implement dialogues in rural areas. In the case of
Morocco, combining travel challenges with Ramadan
proved to be particularly difficult. For future consultations,
it might be more practical to plan our consultations in a way
that does not disrupt the debriefing process each day. This
could involve scheduling shorter trips or ensuring
accommodations that allow for necessary daily reflections
and adjustments.

Paraguay

Country Overview

Paraguay, officially the Republic of Paraguay, is a landlocked country in
South America, bordering Argentina, Brazil, and Bolivia. Paraguay is a
developing country, ranked 105th on the human development index.
Paraguay’s colonial history, ending in independence from Spain in
1811, shapes the country’s society and culture until today.

Paraguay has two official languages, Spanish and Guarani, and 70% of
its population is bilingual. However, divides can particularly be
observed between urban and rural contexts, with half the rural
population being monolingual speakers of Guarani (CIA 2024).

Paraguay’s digital development landscape is particularly shaped by two
key national entities. The National Council for Science and Technology
(CONACYT) is the governing body responsible for promoting research
and innovation in Paraguay. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Information
and Communication Technologies (MITIC) takes the lead on AI and
frontier technology policies.

Paraguay has made significant progress in promoting innovation and
digital transformation in various sectors, including agriculture,
transportation, and healthcare. One notable example is the
implementation of smart agriculture, where farmers use drones and
sensors to monitor crop growth and soil quality. This technology has
significantly improved crop yields and reduced the use of pesticides,
resulting in a more sustainable and profitable agricultural industry.
However, the nation still lacks the regulatory framework necessary to
safeguard its citizens against potential risks stemming from the
growing reliance on technology. While Paraguay’s first data protection
law is currently debated in congress, the creation of an AI law is still in
its initial stages.

The in-person focus group took place at the ministry of information
technology and communication (MITIC) and focused on public sector civil
servants. Online focus groups were conducted in two instances, one with
the private sector and another with academics and activists engaged in
the local AI landscape. Online surveys were distributed across multiple
WhatsApp group chats. Street consultations used the same questions as
online surveys, and these were conducted on separate days in locations
with different socio-economic characteristics to act as a proxy for the
participants’ income.

Additionally, 11 expert interviews were conducted throughout the week to
enhance our understanding of the local AI landscape and its impact on
society. Interviewees included experts on AI and digital frontier
technologies, including two vice-ministers and key AI developers.

Key Findings

In particular, the street consultations revealed various insights into
peoples’ exposure to and sentiments around frontier technology. In
addition, various trends across socioeconomic structures could be
recognized. Thereby we found that the location of the consultation
conducted served as a useful proxy for socioeconomic characteristics
of participants. This exercise was accomplished by taking in the raw
transcript and answers from surveys (street and online), which was
then categorized by a human into respective dimensions e.g.,
positive/negative sentiment, or source of information about AI.

Further information about this process can be found in the Framework.

When asked where people had heard of AI, social media was the most
common answer for all participants. People who had never heard of AI
were only found in the rural and urban poor neighborhoods, while
everyone in the urban rich neighborhoods had heard of AI at least
once.

Separately, the question was asked whose responsibility it is to mitigate
potential harms and equitably provide access to benefits. As a response,
the responsibility was most commonly associated with “themselves” and
the public sector, whereas the private sector was mentioned less often. No
clear trends across level of education could be discovered.

On the question of how this technology may concretely affect participants,
a significantly more positive sentiment was noticed by participants of the
urban rich zone, while participants of the urban poor and rural zones
mostly expressed mixed, negative or uncertain feelings.

Increasing levels of education among participants also correlated with
increasing positive sentiments, decreasing negative sentiments, and
decreasing sentiments of uncertainty regarding the impacts of the
technology. Similarly, being male was associated with a slightly higher
sentiment.

Low resource languages and AI

Concerns about a lack of localization of technology were mentioned in
several expert interviews. Technology is frequently directly translated
from the Global North without adequate consideration of its applicability
within local contexts, perpetuating a broader colonial legacy of resource
extraction. This underlines the importance for the development of local
AI models, embedding their own history, culture, and language.
However, Paraguay is a bilingual country with 70% of the population
speaking both Spanish and Guarani. Guarani is mostly a spoken
language, resulting in a scarcity of digital text which can be used for
training datasets, an important component of building AI models. For
instance, the Guarani Wikipedia includes a mere 4,000 words, a stark
contrast to the English and Spanish editions, which span between 3 to 4
billion words, respectively. Given that Guarani is more prominent among
the less digitally connected people, the prominence of language skills
intersects to create the potential for compounding dysconnectivity.

Methodology amendments from the trip

Over the course of the week, we revised the Framework five times,
incorporating insights generated during consultations that identified
issues with the current version. The consultations revealed that the
internal logic of the mechanism to determine a person’s familiarity with
AI worked well. However, beginning a conversation with ‘have you heard
about AI?’ was less effective in street consultations and focus groups
with experts (two extremes of knowledge about AI). While in the first
case, respondents were not able to provide an answer at all, in the
second case respondents provided excessively long answers, often out
of the scope of this consultation.

To set the context for the following consultation in both cases, concrete
examples of AI proxies were introduced to participants. This turned out
to be an effective method to correct a difficult start into a consultation.

Precisely, the following amendments were made to the methodology
throughout the week:

During the co-creation stage on Monday, the AI agnostic
facilitation of the consultation was stressed throughout the
facilitator guide, by highlighting the motivation behind
concretization with AI proxies and its importance for audiences
occupying the two extremes of knowledge about AI (experts and
no knowledge of AI).

During the public sector focus group on Tuesday, we recognized
repetitions in the line of questioning of section 2 and 3 of the focus
group which were corrected afterwards.

The switch to a digital modality during our focus group with
academia (activities on Wednesday), showed us the need to
separately visualize each sub-question on a separate digital Miro
whiteboard to not confuse participants.

Lastly, the private sector focus group, mostly consisting of AI
experts, revealed that experts on technology like AI tend to
introduce niche topics into the conversation without coalescing
with other participants. In our following revisions, we stressed the
need for facilitators to guide participants to agree on a concrete
example at the beginning of the sentiment section, to establish a
common basis for further discussion.

Reflections

This section is primarily borne out of our experience during the piloting
phase in Morocco and Paraguay.

Socializing the need for a consultation

Given the rapid advancement and deployment of technology in recent
years, for many it will seem natural that these consultations be
conducted. Others may have questions about the purpose of them, how
meaningful they will be able to be, or even whether there is a need for
them in the first place. Questions and hesitancies may come from local
UN staff, governments, partner organizations, or participants. The
effectiveness of consultations, and quality of the data collected, may be
impacted without buy-in from everyone involved. This makes socializing
the consultations a crucial step in a successful consultation process.

As we’ve outlined in sections above, meaningful conversation on our
digital future has failed to reach everyone who stands to be impacted.
This has left far too many people around the world without a voice. But
even without a voice, those individuals stand to lose or gain from
decisions made at key part of the tech development and regulation cycle,
including decisions regarding data governance and privacy protections,
environmental concerns, ethical guardrails, language functionality, and
meeting user needs.

Wording used in invitations and information campaigns before
consultations have the potential to prime the consultation process in the
participants minds, influencing the answers that are given. This means
that care should be taken to keep all language about the consultation as
tech-agnostic as possible, from start to finish. By being clear and
unbiased in the language around consultations, expectations will be clear
on both sides and the responses received will be as robust and authentic
as possible.

In order to engage a wide-reaching and diverse audience, it may also be
necessary to work with a number of external partners in civil society,
government, or the private sector. These partners may have their own
perspectives and embedded ideas about frontier technologies, which may
come across during consultation, or during the socialization process.

50

This may come in the form of government partners who have active wide-
reaching technology initiatives in progress, or from private sector
partners in the tech industry that are interested in focusing on the
positive messages about their products. This has the potential to bias
participant responses which compromises the data collection process and
any potential findings.

While it is understandable that facilitators would not want to compromise
important partnerships, they also have a moral and ethical obligation to
both participants and the rest of the UN facilitators to keep data collection
as unbiased as possible. Whenever possible, unbiased partners should be
prioritized. When working with biased partners is unavoidable, the
potential bias should be noted in data collection. When entering into any
partnership, UN consultation implementers should engage in intentional
conversation with partners about how the consultations should be
marketed to participants.

Participants may also come in with strong ideas about tech, both positive
or negative, that they have picked up from media, friends, or other
sources. While these perceptions are important to hear, they are also
important to interrogate during consultations. Before consultations, it is
important to be aware of the political landscape around tech in the
country, including what narratives participants are likely to have heard or
picked up in the country. This can include doing topic analysis on social
media or news reporting before the consultations. By doing so,
facilitators are able to prepare questions that ask participants to go
deeper into specific areas that are likely to be mentioned. This will ensure
that consultations go beyond surface level and produce meaningful
sentiment data that are reflective of each individual participant’s
perspectives.

It’s important to note that while the UN plays a crucial role in these
conversations, the organization itself has a distinct positionality. Hence,
participants of consultations may feel obligated to engage or give specific
“correct” answers which they believe the UN would like to hear.
Acknowledging the potential biases in responses and emphasizing the
voluntary nature of the consultations can help alleviate this, as can
encouraging participants to ask questions before or after the consultation
about their purpose.

"Workers [I spoke with] felt more comfortable and start
to assert more of their voice when they’re together -
because they share a common language and are part of a
community… Fundamentally, allow interviewees to come
in groups and meet them where they are."

Envisioning an inclusive dialogue on frontier technology

The dialogues that make up this new set of perspective-gathering on
Frontier Technologies must be inclusive in order to meet their objectives.
Here, inclusive refers to a number of different things. It means including
countries across the Global South, regardless of the stage of digital
development or AI readiness; following inclusive principles on data
collection throughout the consultation and perspective gathering
processes, and making intentional efforts to make conversations
accessible and inclusive to all participants.

It has been discussed above that the “Global South” as a collection of
countries are non-monolithic on a number of key factors that determine
the general tech awareness of their citizens, and their general readiness
for implementing new technologies. It is essential for these consultations
to be inclusive of all countries, regardless of these differences, so that all
perspectives can be represented.

An inclusive approach to data collection includes six principles (United
Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 2018):

Participation: Any and all groups of interest must be engaged to
participate, and should be consulted throughout the entire process,
from planning to analysis. Additionally, when facilitators select which
participants to include, they must pay special attention to vulnerable
and marginalized groups.

52

Data disaggregation: As data is collected, information on specific
demographics of the participants must be collated so that data
analysis allows for the identification of inequalities. This may require
alternate sampling methods or data collection approaches, to ensure
data is able to be disaggregated during analysis.

Self-identification: Data collected on identity-based or personal
characteristics should come from the individuals themselves and not
the facilitators, allowing participants to be in control of what they
share. Additionally, it must be ensured that there are no negative
consequences for choosing to identify or not with specific identities.

Transparency: Intentions and processes behind the collection of data
need to be open to the individuals who participate. The information
gathered should also be made available to participants whenever
possible.

Privacy: Data collected should be treated with care, including
protecting data and ensuring privacy. Data should be de-identified
before being shared, and individuals’ identities should be kept
confidential.

Accountability: Once data has been collected, facilitators have an
obligation to ensure it is used for its intended purpose. They also have
an obligation to ensure that data is used to respect, protect, and fulfill
human rights obligations to the extent possible.

Building off these basic principles, there are some other points that are
worth addressing when specifically considering consultations on the topic
of technology. First, that there may be huge disparities in understanding
or awareness of technology. Limiting participation to those who can
contribute at a high level concentrates power over the future of
technology solely in the hands of individuals with advanced knowledge,
contradicting the purpose of these consultations. While it may be more
challenging to facilitate, gathering the perspectives of those who are less
equipped to discuss AI and frontier technologies must be intentionally
targeted throughout all stages of the process.

53

Second, an essential part of inclusive dialogues must be the accessibility
of the consultations themselves, across multiple levels. Inviting
stakeholder groups to the consultations is not enough, if they are unable
to show up. This means offering intentional and specific accommodations
to the stakeholder groups you are trying to engage with. For example:

Holding digital consultations for individuals who are not highly
mobile.

Offering childcare during consultations when engaging women and
primary caregivers

Sending facilitators to remote areas to reach individuals who live and
work there.

Creating specific auditory/oratory-based survey options for individuals
who are illiterate

This list is non-exhaustive, and care should be taken that the needs of all
participants is met during the consultation process and the consultations
themselves. Without specific accommodations being made, the groups
that need them will not be able to participate and therefore their voices
cannot be included.

As can be seen, considering who is being engaged is only the first step.
Consultations cannot truly be considered to be inclusive unless all of the
above are taken into account and built into every stage of the
consultation process.

Outreach strategy

Step 1: Mapping Stakeholders

To design an adequate outreach strategy, it is important to first identify
the type of stakeholders that will be contacted and are supposed to
participate in the consultations. Stakeholders can be mapped along two
dimensions, which define the extent to which they require means to be
contacted, and the degree to which they require resources to participate.

54

Figure 12: mapping stakeholders: indicative stakeholders mapped on a matrix of difficulty in participating and
being contacted for consultation

Dimension 1: Contacting

The first dimension is characterized by the extent to which the identified
stakeholders can be contacted, and how accessible information is to
them. The information should be publicly available in local languages,
and the communication channels should be suitable to the needs of the
stakeholders. For instance, access to safe and user-friendly online and
digital platforms enables stakeholders to receive invitations to
consultations more readily, as they can utilize social media, email
communication, and newsletters.

It is important to highlight that online communication is the most
straightforward and least costly channel to reach potential consultation
participants. Nonetheless, those who are most at risk of being left
behind tend to have fewer resources to access online channels of
communication and rely more heavily on in-person interactions to be
both informed and consulted. For example, rural communities are often
less connected than urban communities. It is important to consider
hosting community events, workshops, or one-on-one interviews to
meet people where they are.

55

These channels of contact thus inherently reflect the potential at which
stakeholders are at risk of being left behind. An inclusive outreach
strategy therefore should take the personal needs of the stakeholders
into account and apply a range of online communication channels,
complemented by more spontaneous in-person communication.

Dimension 2: Participation

The second dimension is defined by the extent to which stakeholders
have the resources to participate, as a barrier to inclusion may hinder
them from meaningfully engaging in consultations. To ensure channels
for safe, non-discriminatory, inclusive, and meaningful participation, it is
thus essential to consider that certain stakeholder groups are more
vulnerable, and thus face higher barriers and risks to engage in
consultations. The degree to which stakeholders are able to participate
thus depends on the creation of an enabling environment which aims to
meet their needs to overcome these barriers.

For instance, domestic work and direct care of persons often make it
difficult for women to participate in in-person consultation processes
(UN Women 2017). It is important to consider remunerating participants
for their time and, when possible, to accommodate childcare to enable
more women to take part in in consultations.

Figure 13: outreach strategies mapped across modalities and inclusive-exclusive dimensions.

56

Step 2: Linking Stakeholders to Appropriate Outreach Strategies

Once the stakeholders are mapped along the two dimensions, four broad
groups can be defined, based on the extent to which stakeholders have
access to online communication channels and the means to participate in
consultations. Appropriate outreach strategies and consultation
modalities can then be identified accordingly, and these can be mapped
along a scale of more-or-less inclusivity (see figure above).

If a particular stakeholder group is characterized by a higher access to
online communication channels and the resources to participate in-
person, it is likely appropriate to reach out to them via email, social media
platforms, and newsletters, and to organize an in-person focus group
(most closely represented by Group 1). However, if the stakeholder group
faces higher barriers to participation due to e.g., childcare responsibilities
in the case of women, yet are likely well connected (UN Women 2017), an
appropriate consultation modality could be an online focus group (more
closely aligned with Group 2). Further, with decreasing resources to
participate in a consultation, an online survey may provide the flexibility
needed to collect their perspectives (as categorized in Group 3). Finally, if
the stakeholder group has little to no access to online communication
channels, more spontaneous face-to-face dialogues e.g., on the street
could be an appropriate consultation modality (Group 4).

Generally, it is key to consider and accommodate the individual needs of
participants. Lower access to online communication channels and higher
barriers to participation should translate to more in-person interactions
with stakeholders for both the outreach strategy and consultation
modality. This should help create an enabling and inclusive environment
for the consultation.

Overall, it's important to note that the suggested outreach strategies and
modalities aim to provide recommendations for potential outreach
approaches, as categorized by the four groups in the above figures.
However, this list is not exhaustive and open to further channels of
communication and engagement. For instance, more creative approaches
to participation, such as social media discussions, and radio conversations
could offer meaningful ways to engage stakeholders. These modalities
should therefore address the challenges for stakeholders that face higher
barriers to both communication and participation, and account for local
needs.

Reconciliation approach for comparability

Cultural difference reconciliation across countries

In an increasingly interconnected world, the need to understand and
bridge cultural differences across countries is paramount, especially in
the realm of research and data collection. This section of the report
outlines principles and strategies aimed at ensuring the comparability of
surveys across diverse cultural landscapes. For example, in many Western
cultures, surveys that ask about family might assume a nuclear structure,
but this can overlook the importance of extended family networks
prevalent in many Asian and African cultures. By addressing the nuances
of survey focus, question design, sampling methods, and analysis, we aim
to foster a more inclusive and accurate approach to collecting and
interpreting data from varied cultural contexts. Principles to ensure that
Framework questions are comparable across different locales (Bryson et
al 2012):

Cultural contextualization in surveys

Customize Introductory Texts: Adapt introductory or explanatory
texts for questions to include culturally relevant examples or
context, helping respondents from diverse backgrounds relate to
the questions.
Cultural Sensitivity in Phrasing: Ensure question phrasing is
culturally sensitive and avoids idiomatic expressions that may not
translate well across cultures. This involves a feedback cycle to
ensure surveys minimize biased data collection. This includes
consulting with various groups familiar with the culture during the
survey design, translating the questions, testing the engagement
with locals, and redesigning at the end of each cycle to
accommodate for cultural differences.

Question Design for Cross-cultural Comparability

Harmonize Question Wording: Strive for close comparability in
question wording, ensuring that the essence of questions remains
consistent across languages and cultural interpretations.

58

Adaptive Response Scales: Use response scales that are culturally
neutral and easily understandable across different cultural
contexts. This may include using visual scales or ensuring that
verbal scales are translated in a way that maintain the integrity
of responses in their sentiment level, such as degree of
agree/disagree.

Position and Sequence of Questions: Be mindful of the question
order, as cultural norms might influence how questions are
perceived in relation to one another. For example, in some
cultures, it is considered intrusive to discuss personal finances
early in a conversation. If an early question in the survey asks for
the respondent's income, it may lead to discomfort or refusal to
continue. To avoid this, the survey could be structured to first
establish rapport with more general questions about the
respondent's profession and gradually lead up to the sensitive
financial questions. A balanced and neutral sequencing can
mitigate this.

Sampling and Population Considerations

Diverse Sampling Strategies: It is crucial to employ sampling
methods that capture representation from various sub-groups
within cultures. This includes considering factors such as urban
versus rural locations, which often serve as a proxy for different
socio-economic statuses, alongside variations in income levels,
educational backgrounds, and levels of technological exposure.

Inclusive Eligible Population Definition: Define the survey
population in inclusive terms that consider the cultural diversity
within the target groups, ensuring that the survey reaches a
broad spectrum of the population.

Survey Administration Across Cultures

Multimodal Survey Administration: Offer the survey in various
modes (online, face-to-face, paper-based) to accommodate
different levels of access to technology and preferences across
cultures. Training for Cultural Competence: Survey
administrators are a key link in ensuring an effective survey
consultation.

59

Therefore, these administrators should be trained on cultural
competence to handle diverse respondents sensitively and
effectively, ensuring that the administration mode does not
introduce bias. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that religious,
ethnic, and rural-urban differences deeply influence societal
interactions and perceptions. Training for cultural competence
must therefore extend beyond basic awareness to include a
nuanced understanding of these distinctions.

Ensuring Comparability in Analysis (Analytical Adjustments for Cultural
Factors): During analysis, consider adjustments or weighting to
account for cultural differences in response patterns or literacy levels,
ensuring findings are not skewed by disparities in digital literacy.

Linguistic difference reconciliation across countries

Language is deeply intertwined with culture and affects how people
express their feelings, opinions, and experiences. The same sentiment
can be expressed in various ways across different languages, often with
subtle nuances that could significantly affect the interpretation of survey
results. Understanding and accounting for language differences when
conducting surveys, especially in a context as diverse as the Global
South, is a complex but crucial step in ensuring that the sentiments are
captured as accurately as possible. The following are important themes
on the importance of reconciling language and cultural differences
across the Global South (Harkness et al 2016).

Respect: Accommodating language differences, surveys
demonstrate respect for the cultural identities of participants, which
can enhance their willingness to engage.
Establishing Trust: Efforts to accommodate for and address
participants’ language and cultural context builds trust. This is
particularly crucial for sensitive topics, where participants need to
feel safe and understood to share their honest opinions and feelings.
Reducing Bias: Surveys designed with consideration for cultural and
linguistic differences and cultural sensitivities are likely to minimize
bias, leading to more reliable and actionable insights.
Inclusivity: Surveys that are accessible in the native languages of
participants are more likely to be completed, leading to higher
response rates and improved representative samples.

60

Strategies for reconciling cultural and linguistic
differences

Developing a Framework for gathering voices and sentiments relevant to
the Global South on frontier technologies is a complex process. The
objective to inform national dialogues through sentiment analysis across
diverse linguistic and cultural contexts requires careful planning and
execution. The following sections outlines key considerations and tools
that could be employed to navigate the linguistic subtleties and
differences in survey analysis:

Cultural Adaptation of Surveys through Local Partnerships:
Adapting survey questions to reflect local idioms, cultural references,
and societal norms— a process known as "cultural localization"—is
essential (USAID 2023). This can be achieved through collaboration
with local experts, NGOs, and community leaders who possess a deep
understanding of the cultural and linguistic nuances within their
communities.

Sentiment Analysis Techniques Using Natural Language
Processing: Owing to the multi linguistic nature of the generated
data, there exists an increasing need to perform sentiment analysis
on data in diverse languages (Dashtipour et al 2016). Utilizing
sentiment analysis techniques to draft surveys across different
languages involves a nuanced approach that combines translation
with the understanding of cultural and linguistic subtleties. This
process ensures that the sentiment intended in one language is
accurately conveyed in another, maintaining the survey's effectiveness
across diverse populations. The sentiment analysis can be applied in
the context of translating surveys through the following Iterative
Refinement Process:

Initial Translation: Use advanced machine translation tools to
translate the survey from the source language to the target
language(s). This step provides a base translation that captures
the literal meaning of the survey questions and responses.
Sentiment Analysis of Translations: Apply sentiment analysis to
both the original and translated survey texts to compare the
sentiment conveyed in each language.

61

This step is crucial for identifying discrepancies where the
translation may not accurately reflect the intended sentiment or
nuance. However, this is only possible if models specific to those
languages are available and produce reliable results.
Feedback Loop: Conduct pilot tests of the translated surveys with
a small segment of the target population. Apply sentiment analysis
to the responses to gauge whether the questions accurately
captured the intended sentiment.
Refinement Based on Analysis: Use the insights gained from
sentiment analysis of pilot responses to refine the translation and
phrasing of questions. This iterative process ensures that the
survey's final version is both linguistically accurate and
sentimentally aligned across languages.
Expert Review: Engage bilingual experts or native speakers for
post-translation review and sentiment analysis. Their insights can
validate the accuracy of sentiment conveyed in translations and
suggest adjustments for cultural and linguistic nuances.

Risks of neglecting language disparities

Legal and Ethical Compliance: In many countries, there are legal
requirements to provide access to services and engagements in the
native languages of the population. While ensuring surveys meet
these requirements is a matter of legal compliance, it also reflects a
deep commitment to ethical inclusivity. This becomes particularly
challenging in fields like AI, where much of the terminology, such as
"genAI" and other technical terms, originate in English.

Ethical Research Practices: To uphold ethical standards, conducting
surveys in participants' native languages is essential. However, the
translation of specialized technology terminology requires careful
consideration. It is important to work with linguistic and technical
experts to develop standardized translations that maintain the terms’
meanings while being understandable to non-English speakers.
Where translations for specific terms do not exist, it may be necessary
to include a glossary of terms in the survey or use the English
language terms with explanatory notes in the local language. This
approach ensures informed consent and protects participants’ rights
by making the information accessible and understandable.

62

Approaches to Intersecting Demographics with
Perspectives

An intersectional approach ultimately leads to more inclusive research
and engineering solutions. Taking into consideration the unique benefits
of the approach, the consultation has designed the method described
below. At its essence, intersectionality embodies the intricate interplay of
human identities, showcasing how factors like race, gender, and
disabilities intertwine to shape systematic patterns of discrimination or
biases. This concept illuminates the imperative of recognizing that
addressing individual attributes of identity in isolation, whether it be
gender or race, perpetuates the marginalization experienced by those
whose identities intersect across multiple dimensions. Hence, it is
imperative to be intentional in identifying the intersectional groups
interacting with the frontier technologies.

After conducting the consultation, information gathered can then be
categorized into various tables to draw insights on particular topics and
questions. If the dataset is large enough, such as from a survey modality,
then automated tools in sentiment and topic model analysis can be
utilized. However, this runs into various risks (see section 4.4 above). To
address these risks, it is important to layer an element of human insight
into the analytical operations carried out by machines. In essence,
humans possess a unique ability not only to decipher sarcasm and grasp
local intricacies but also to conduct intricate, topic-specific analyses
crucial for diverse datasets on a complex topic such as frontier
technologies.

The gold standard for conducting analysis on perspectives from
consultations should rely on human analysts. In particular, those with
local and language expertise should review the raw results and categorize
them according to their knowledge to derive accurate insights. This would
ensure the integrity of the data, and limit potential misinterpretation (for
instance caused by automated translation), which often does not catch
intrinsic nuances of local language. If some element of automation does
need to take place, then human annotation at the beginning can at least
offer a benchmark for future human evaluation of the automated results
or this can act as a training dataset to program the automation process.

Example sentiment analysis on consultation responses

An analysis of the above would demonstrate that men in this survey were
more likely than women to have a positive sentiment of the AI application
in their life. This is an interesting finding, but there is room for further
nuancing and due to having captured the raw responses we can conduct
further analyses that link the specific applications to sentiments. For
instance, in this example, it’s clear that men used the example of AI
assistants more than women.

64

The complexity of the human comprehension extends beyond technical
“negative” and “positive” sentiments, and, hence, it is imperative to
introduce alternative modalities, such as “uncertain” or “mixed” in order
to be able to capture a wider spectrum of the emotions and feelings
experienced by people. This in turn helps to gain a deeper understanding
of the gender intersection and see the intrinsic nuances in the perception
of the frontier technologies by the general public.

Next Steps

Potential scaling of the Framework by UNDP in 2024

This work aligns well with major ongoing initiatives at the supranational level,
including the Global Digital Compact and UNDP's AI readiness assessment.

On March 28th, 2024, the SIPA team presented the Framework and findings from
the piloting phase to interested UNDP entities, including the UNDP Accelerator
Lab Network, the UNDP Chief Digital Office, and the UNDP Regional Bureau for
Latin America and the Caribbean.

Following the presentation, these entities expressed interest in using the
Framework to conduct consultations as part of their own initiatives. Further
opportunities for disseminating the Framework are being investigated by the
Accelerator Labs Global Team, with 90 Labs across 114 countries likely being early
adopters of the Framework.

65

Recommendations for future EPD Workshops

Test and learn from the Framework in other countries.

Test and learn from the Framework with:

Different stakeholders
Alternative frontier technologies
Specific topic areas such as privacy

Implementation of the Framework in new settings might take place, for
example, in different countries, technologies, or use-cases.

Alternatively, expansion of the Framework or creation of new methodologies
similar to it can be pursued.

To support these possible projects, we offer several tips for getting the most out
of the exciting opportunity to work in partnership with the Network:

There should be close collaboration with local Accelerator Labs before, during,
and after country travel:

The Labs hold a wealth of knowledge on digital development and relevant
projects that will offer valuable insights to your project.
Ensure that your activities are aligned with their initiatives for mutually
beneficial implementation schemes that can offer useful outputs for both
parties.
Findings from your country travel can be used by the Lab to share with
their network in-country, strengthening the Lab’s position as a thought
leader.

Align on deliverables from an early stage with HQ and request feedback from
Labs (even those which will not be travel destinations) through multiple
iterations. This will both improve the quality of the work and support the
socialization of your deliverable for a more robust implementation.

The Accelerator Lab Network also has access to a wide range of experts that
can support the research phase of your project. Be sure to request the
Network’s support in being put into contact with these experts as early as
possible.
