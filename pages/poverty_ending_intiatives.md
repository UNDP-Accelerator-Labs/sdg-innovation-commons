POVERTY ENDING INTIATIVES

> Brief description of the innovation

One of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals is to end Poverty. Poverty is a collective result of not doing things in a certain way which have predetermined outcomes.

Poverty will be tackled looking at all facets of its existence namely Mind Concept, Under/Zero Utilization of Available Resources and Services, Unavailability of Resources and Services and Innovations for Sustainable wealth Creation.

The Zion Investment wish to engage actively in extraction of oil from both edible and inedible vegetable oil seeds such as groundnuts, sunflower, soybeans and castor bean. This activity has already been commenced at Sinda District of Eastern Province. Other value adding activities will be introduced to ensure only finished products leaves the district. This will translate to high employment and increased income levels in the pilot district.

Our Project will engage small holder farmers on a win-win situation in the outgrower schemes, creation of more value adding centres and market links with small holder farmers benefiting from the process, innovation for manufacturing and use of organic soil fertilization to reduce on chemical fertilizer dependence to improve food security, Information centres will also be established to provide free information on food production, processing and marketing.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Oil Extraction – we will have income through extraction of crude oil from vegetable seeds and processed further into refined oil which will reach big markets.
Currently only crude oil is the product being produced even among all small oil extractors. The setup of oil refining facility will mean production of Zambia Bureau of Standards (ZABS) approved end product (refined oil) which can penetrate big markets locally and internationally.
Almost all the number three meal produced in Sinda is taken to Lusaka and other towns. This by- product of maize milling can be used for animal feed production.
The introduction of other value adding ventures like animal feed production, animal husbandry and food/meat processing will also translate to sustainable and non-rain dependent income among the small holder farmers.
Environment Benefit – the mainstreaming of tree planting in all our endeavors will on the long run mitigate on the climate change challenges and improve forestation and reduce on damaged property and soil erosion from high speed winds. The rain pattern with increased forestry will also improve.
Use of organic fertilizer will also promote of healthy products and improve food security.

> Technical Feasibility

Identification and Engagement of Stakeholder who will include the chiefs, village headmen, their key subject and government ministry line staff. 
Identification of Small Holder Farmers and provision of inputs – we had commenced this process and will only need be revised and come up with a new policy framework to be used in the new arrangement. 
Growing and Monitoring of oil vegetables seeds – using our own extension officers who will supervise this process.
Acquisition of suitable land to set up the envisaged industry
Engagement of Zambia Environmental Management Agency for project environmental impact assessment
Invitation of bidders from the construction industry 
Selection of a Contractor to construct the Plant
Set up of an oil refinery and other value adding facilities including an organic fertilizer plant
Management and operations staff recruitment
Production of  first products which will be taken  to Zambia Bureau of Standards for certification.
Product Certification with Zambia Bureau of Standards

> Anticipated Social Impact

•	Improved Household Income by raising seed production to 150 tons. This will make us realize an estimated projected gross income of US$1,500,000 by the year 2025.
•	Diversification of Maize growing to other cash crops such as sunflower, groundnuts, soy beans and castor bean
•	Improved farmer participation through mutual benefits of win-win crop prices and other benefits from value adding initiatives. The farmer will have cash to support child education which is among the major problems of economic and social development.
•	Stimulate rural industry growth – direct market link of rural agricultural finished products to markets which will translate to high employment levels and improved economic status for the rural youthful population. The estimated projected income from this stimulation is at US$5 million by 2025
•	Protein diet improvements among the rural population hence reduce malnutrition especially in pregnant women and children.
•	The by product of oil processing, the press seed cake will be used as organic fertilizer to support maize growing without use of D Compound basal dressing fertilizer. We hope to produce 90 tonnes of the press seed cake in 2022.
•	Growth of Trees mainstreamed in the project to reduce the impact of climate change
