> Title of the innovation

Making a simple organic fertilisers

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is about making simple inorganic fertilizer which can help local farmers interms of vegetables and grains cultivation ,it has been my concern that a lot of people can not afford to buy organic fertilizers with of low.living standards . Not only that but also the dangers of organic fertilisers to the ecosystem ,for example those who cultivate near the water bodies when sulphur run in those areas it will deplete oxygen hence it can affect aquatic life .Now for my innovation will save both soil and aquatic living room for organisms.
In a nutshell I would like to extend my gratitude that it easy to acquire and will help provide food for soil living organisms.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It will help me invest for my school fees for higher education in order to upgrade my career and for the public it about using cheap and locally made 
feriliser to produce bumper havertsit to provide suplus crops .

> Technical Feasibility

Technically my innovation is designed in such a way that those who grow crop either commercial farmers or substance farmers Will benefit ,to the environment it is 99% good it will not affect the ecosystem which includes those found in the lakes,the bird in the sky and the other living organisms since it will have no sulphate compound .the materials are from those things which are inoganic and they are used in our dairy lifetime things like egg shells , banana pill maize cobs in short something which has the percent of magnesium since its one the most required element for the growth of plants and this fertilizer which mentioned earlier will contain some compounds which will help fighting of roots diseases .

> Anticipated Social Impact

Most people especially in rural areas they don't not cultivate for the reasons that they are lazy, but because of unavailability of fertilizer since their are less number of people who can afford to buy a bag of compound D just to farm on the small scale, hence we having higher levels of poverty in Zambia .So if you were to assist me finish this innovation it can elaborate poverty and malnutrition in Zambia through the providing of inorganic fertilizers to the commercial and small scale farmers in the stock market.
Inconclusion I would like to say that Zambia's economy can get it wortthy if innovations like where to commence.
