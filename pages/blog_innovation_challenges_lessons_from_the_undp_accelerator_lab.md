Innovation Challenges: Lessons From The UNDP Accelerator Lab

Innovation Challenges: Lessons from the UNDP Accelerator Lab
October 16, 2024

This blog post explores the experiences of the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Trinidad and Tobago in implementing various innovation challenges to promote development. We discuss different types of challenges, including broad-spectrum, GEF SGP modality, and sprints, and provide practical examples and lessons learned.The Accelerator Lab has conducted six innovation challenges since 2021, focusing on diverse areas such as green innovation, peacebuilding, and financial inclusion. Through these challenges, we have gained valuable insights into the effectiveness of different approaches and the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing innovation challenges.One of the key lessons learned is that the choice of challenge format depends on the specific goals and objectives of the initiative. Broad-spectrum challenges are suitable for exploring a wide range of ideas and identifying emerging trends, while sprints are more focused on rapid prototyping and testing of specific solutions.Additionally, it is important to consider the level of support and guidance that participants may need. Some challenges may require more extensive training and handholding, while others may be suitable for more independent innovators.By carefully considering these factors, organizations can implement effective innovation challenges that can drive positive change and contribute to sustainable development. Broad-Spectrum Innovation ChallengesThe Green Innovation Challenge (June 2021) was our first and most exploratory challenge, focusing on the green economy, micro and small enterprises, and business informality. We did not specify a dilemma but chose to investigate the challenges, opportunities, and ecosystem support structures needed to strengthen entrepreneurs serving in the green economy in Trinidad and Tobago. The approach attracted more than 108 applicants, resulting in five innovative projects, including a solar-powered hydroponic home system and a controlled indoor agriculture within the female prison.Similar broad-spectrum challenges were undertaken for the Peace Innovation Challenge (March 2022) and the Tobago Innovation Challenge (October 2023), both aiming to prioritize areas identified by citizens and observe emerging patterns.Challenges Deployed Using the GEF SGP ModalityTwo other challenges were deployed using the GEF SGP modality, which involves the Accelerator Lab supporting the design of the challenge, the call for proposals, selection criteria, and project selection panel. The Plastic Innovation Challenge (May 2022) produced a Plastic Waste Consultation Report and six innovative circular economy projects, while the Sargassum Innovation Challenge (November 2023) focused on addressing the challenges posed by sargassum seaweed. Innovation SprintsThe Caribbean Fintech Sprint for Financial Inclusion (May 2023) was a shorter, more targeted challenge focused on designing interventions for financial inclusion in the Eastern Caribbean. Four promising innovations emerged, including digital linking of credit unions, streamlined transactions between agriculturalists and purchasers, and a money transfer service. Why an Innovation Challenge?Innovation challenges offer several advantages, including citizen leadership, partnerships, and opportunities for training and development. By involving a diverse range of stakeholders, including external development partners, judges, and training agencies, innovation challenges can foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and capacity building. Lessons LearnedChoosing the right challenge format: Sprints are better suited for well-defined problems and rapid prototyping, while broad-spectrum challenges are more suitable for exploring diverse ideas.Project selection: Avoid selecting pet passion projects and prioritize projects that align with wider project portfolios.Supporting winners: Provide adequate support and guidance to winners, including handholding and training on reporting and project management.Publicity: Promote winners and their innovations through social media and other channels.Partnerships: Collaborate with external partners to leverage their expertise and resources. ConclusionInnovation challenges are a valuable tool for promoting development and driving positive change. By carefully considering the different types of challenges, the level of support required, and the potential benefits and challenges, organizations can implement effective innovation challenges that can contribute to a more sustainable and equitable future.
