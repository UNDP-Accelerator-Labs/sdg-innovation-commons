# Digitalizing Justice System for Anti Corruption in Democratic Republic of Congo.

OK, My name is Tatiana Lukama Binda from the DRC and I consent to this recording\.

### [[0:11]] Could you tell me about an R&D activity you would like to share?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
OK, so I'm I'm from the DRC and then we are working on a project to digitalize the justice system\. So how this project came about or the project in, in, in actual sense is making sure that the, the systems in the courts are digitalised and also the database in the prisons\. And also a system that was developed to manage the careers of a magistrates\. Because sometimes they'll be placed in different locations\. And then we don't the the government or our partners not know where they placed exactly\. So the system allows them to put a database of which magistrate is placed in which jurisdiction\.

### [[0:53]] So what was the developmental issue that you were addressing?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Negotiation]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
So the developmental issue we're addressing was so access to justice, but also it's part of a bigger project, which is anti correction\. So what we were because the system is manual and it's prone to manipulation\. So what this brought about was that the the processes take long\. If a court case, a case goes to the courts where because it's manual, there's no synergy between the courts and the prisons and how long the process takes\. So the whole role of developing the system was to manage this process\. How long does a case take? The trying to make the process more digital to be able to give U\.S\. data for decision making\.

### [[1:43]] Thank you for that\. So who was involved in your journey and what was their role?

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Pre-post-testing]]
So initially when this project came about was the UNDP decided to develop a system for the justices, the justice sector\. But this was not taking into account the processes and the people that are involved in this process\. So the what we then did as the lab was to approach our our counterparts in in the country office to see how we could collaborate, meaning that test this in a small scale or in a pilot to be able to take into account the different steps and the different stakeholders that are involved in this process\. So it came about so that we could be able to test that the solution actually works and not just handing over the solution to the government without seeing\. And so this is where we developed the pilot in the three provinces\. We did it in Kintrasla, in Okatanga and in Congress on trial, which means that we identified jurisdictions that we could test this in and then we wrote it out in these jurisdictions and then test tested it\.

### [[2:58]] So what tools methods did you use to do what you just described and why?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tools:Co-creation]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
OK was one of the tools that we used was Co creation\. This was very important to get the different stakeholders in one room and to be able to highlight the different steps of the process because this we needed to do this so that there's appropriation from our government partners, from the stakeholders and not just a system that was developed on our end and then given to to them\. So we use the process of so it was a human centred design process and Co creation\. We took every person that is involved in the process from the couriers of the court, from the magistrates at the courts\. We also then involved representatives from the Ministry of Justice, from the Superior Council of the magistrates and also we involved through the justice system\. But people from the prisons because this was supposed to be a process that was interlinked from the court\. So like a case management from the court until the person is tried and then sent to prison\.

### [[4:12]] So what was the outcome of this RND journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
OK, So what we then learnt from this journey was how important it is to implicate the people that are part of the process in the decision making but also in creating a solution that solves the problems that they're facing\. Because we couldn't, we do not, we are, we work in the developed sector, we work at UNDP, but we do not have expertise in the, in the legal system, in the justice system\. So by involving this stakeholders in the process of the Ministry of Justice, the Superior Council of the magistrates, we're able to sit down and look at the implications of the system because this system is it's it's a digital system, but that follows a manual process that has been used for years\. So it was a good learning process to have the people that are implicated in the process testing it out with us debating and coming up with a solution in the end\. And so this is what we learnt from from involving the people in this process\.

### [[5:23]] So what would you do differently, do differently if you have to do this again?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
So what we'll do differently is after the pilot phase\. So after we tested it in the pilot phase, I think would the best way would to be getting high level stakeholders in the high level stakeholders that are involved in the process\. So which means policy change, getting them on board, because what we've then realised that in the pilot, yes, it's we've been able to collect important information\. But for scaling up some of the, the, the users don't see the importance of using the system because there's no policy that hasn't been set in stone on how to use this system\. So for us it, I think what would do differently is to get a policy change and which is very important for the stage that we're at because we're now scaling from the three provinces where we had implemented to six more provinces in the country, which will make it 9 provinces\. So it will be important, important to get this data\. Once you have policy change and people see the importance, it is important because it's going to feed in into the data that we collect for anti corruption, how long cases take, the access to justice that people have, but the users have to see the importance\. And this also comes based on the on the policy that would be put in place\.

### [[6:56]] Thank you\. Thank you so much time and your insights\. Thank you\. We appreciate it\.
