Valorization of Old Tyres for the production of household furniture and Accessories. 

Ganso plynda, inspired by her slogan to give a new "life" to tyres collects disposed tyres and transforms them into personalized household designs for a means of subsistence. Worried about the careless disposal of old tyres on the streets and in water bodies, she gains inspiration to give these tires a new life for the protection of the environment.
