## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Access to quality basic services in the Ministry of Justice
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to understand the services being provided at the Ministry of Justice, namely the Notary service, notary office for diaspora, authentication services, signature recognition, public deeds, birth registration amongst others. Exploring this realm, will allow us to learn where the gaps are, and where the Lab methodology can accelerate learning.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The provision of sufficient, affordable and quality basic services in Guinea-Bissau is extremely limited. It is further exacerbated due to lack of proper information about processes and mechanisms for those services. Some of the main drivers are the weak governance system and political instability limiting State’s capacity to deliver services. The Government, the institutions and the population are involved and some of the undesired effects are long processing times, mismanagement, lack of transparency and often corruption. The endemic fragility coupled with public administration’s poor performance and lack of infrastructure are other aggravating factors that limit services, and related information, to reach all communities. The poor service delivery and lack of an effective and efficient system affect most of the population, urban and rural communities alike. However, rural inhabitants, especially women and children, are the ones suffering the most.

The MICS report from 2019 indicates that the country does not have a functioning civil registry; the share of population with access to electricity is 46.2%; to safe drinking water is 66.2%. While the use of computers is limited (16% for men, 5% for women), on the other hand the high penetration of mobile phones (89% for women, 92% for men) represents a new frontier in transforming public service delivery. https://mics-surveys-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/MICS6/West%20and%20Central%20Africa/Guinea-Bissau/2018-2019/Survey%20findings/Guinea%20Bissau%202018-19%20MICS%20Survey%20Findings%20Report_Portuguese.pdf

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Through collective intelligence workshops&nbsp; with different stakeholders (staff, users, international organizations, civil society, among others.), weak signals were identified: " There is a need for awareness raising and training on COVID-19 to get better responses from staff and users" " The lack of hygiene in the MoJ,&nbsp;contributed to the spread of the virus and other diseases" " There needs to be enforcement of COVID-19 measures in the building, by security, staff and users" " Users feel like they&nbsp;do not&nbsp;have access to simple information such as prices, process or even&nbsp;identifying&nbsp;employees of the MoJ, staff are unaware of these things, they lack&nbsp;the basic&nbsp;knowledge to inform the users." " Users feel like there is little to no respect of the COVID-19 measures given by&nbsp;HC. "&nbsp;There is a frustration from users as they feel like there needs to be more use of technology as they often cannot get a document reprinted, it must be transcribed again because the MoJ does not store their information on a server" "The staff group was very vocal about what they believed were the&nbsp;deep-rooted&nbsp;issues in the MoJ, namely disorganization and lack of information sharing" " Staff felt most strongly about the need of technological&nbsp;advancement&nbsp;and adaptation in the work they are doing, they feel the work is not&nbsp;professionally managed&nbsp;and their time optimized due to manual inscriptions" " Health-wise, staff believed&nbsp;truly little&nbsp;is done to protect their health and well-being, not just with COVID-19 but other diseases such as&nbsp;TB" " Overall, staff feel like they are not being invested into, in the same way they are invested into the job,&nbsp;pay,&nbsp;progression, benefits and personal development is non-existent and the MoJ needs to do more" " Staff felt like users should have access to more information before arrival, many travel from far for simple queries, more information needs to be available for them, online, leaflets etc."

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab is bringing an added value through joining hands with those who lives and operates closest to the problem, using new and innovative approaches such as System Mapping, Design Thinking and Collective Intelligence workshops, in order to co-create solutions with staff, users and other relevant stakeholders. It is worth investing in this challenge because MoJ is the first step of a citizens integration into society.&nbsp;

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

- What is the underlying system behind the poor access to public service provision&nbsp;in Bissau?&nbsp; - How might we improve information about access to public service provision in Bissau? - How might we enforce Covid-19 measurements in access to&nbsp;public service provision in Bissau? - How might we facilitate access to the Notary services in Bissau? - How might we digitalize data in MoJ? - How might we centralize the data?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

&nbsp;Design Thinking, Collective Intelligence and Co-Creation will be used to structure the process and generate insights about the challenges faced as well as possible solutions. System thinking will be used to understand the underlaying drives of the challenge and visual thinking and mapping will be used as a supportive tool when engaging with different stakeholder. The value that these will add to our learning question is that we will be able to delve deeper into the data and understanding the complexities of the problem and well as designing tests that can generate learning about different aspects of the challenge.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is no available data of the work of the staff in the MoJ, nor the users experience. Data in relation to public services in the country is incomplete. Almost all processes are inconsistent and made manually which makes it hard to use and compare existing data, ultimately decreasing the possibility for the Government to take informed decisions.&nbsp;
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
