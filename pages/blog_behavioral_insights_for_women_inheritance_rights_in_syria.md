Behavioral insights for Women Inheritance Rights in Syria
MAY 14, 2023
Numerous challenges and barriers impede women's ability to access their inheritance rights, primarily stemming from social norms, community pressures, and rigid gender roles that shape behavior. Given the complex nature of the inheritance process involving multiple actors, it is essential to identify the prevailing behaviors and delve into the underlying obstacles that prevent women from realizing their rightful inheritances. To address this issue, the accelerator lab collaborated with Magenta to employ behavioral insights approaches (Read more here) . These reports present the research findings conducted by Magenta in collaboration with the UNDP Syria Accelerator labs and legal program team. The Barrier Mapping report is the main outcome of the analysis carried out by the MAGENTA team as part of the project with the UNDP Syria Accelerator Lab on designing behavioral insights interventions to support women’s access to their inheritance rights. It is informed by a rapid desk review of existing literature, a co-exploration meeting with the UNDP field staff and the analysis of primary qualitative data collected in Aleppo. This document synthesizes the approach followed for the analysis, provides an overview of the behavioral drivers for the typical different family members who are involved in the inheritance process and options for interventions for UNDP.
The Design Recommendation Report builds upon the selected interventions proposed by MAGENTA in the Mapping report. It incorporates the valuable inputs from the UNDP team during a remote design workshop, where two priority interventions were chosen and adapted based on the recommendations. In the report MAGENTA provide guidance and support to the UNDP staff in designing these interventions for future piloting beyond the scope of this consultancy.
