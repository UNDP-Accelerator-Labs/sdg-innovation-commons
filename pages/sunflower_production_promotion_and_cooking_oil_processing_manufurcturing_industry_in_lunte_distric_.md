> Title of the innovation

Sunflower production promotion and cooking oil processing manufurcturing industry in Lunte district

> Brief description of the innovation

To promote sunflower production, an outgrowing scheme involving a number of farmers have to be done by providing seed to farmers and buy the same from them for the industry and produce the cooking oil for the district market and the nation at large, and relieve the citizens from the high cost imported cooking oil.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Not much to say on this but very important because:
It's there to give good income through sunflower production to those who can't afford to buy fertilizer for crops that need fertilizer.
It's there to lower cooking oil prices.
It's there to create jobs in manufacturing of oil.
It's also there to promote conservation farming.

> Technical Feasibility

1. To secure seed for at least 100 farmers for 2 Limas each.
2. To construct a storage in preparation of the harvest.
3. To source funds in readness to buy the produce.
4. To source funds for the packaging material.
5. To conduct meetings for awareness.

> Anticipated Social Impact

According to the earlier baseline accessment made before now, the project is even delaying, because the community has welcomed the idea, this will be the first of its kind in the district, hence bringing relief to the area by way of jobs locally, product locally, income availability without fertilizer and promotion of crop diversification. This is very easy for both male and female and youth farmers.
