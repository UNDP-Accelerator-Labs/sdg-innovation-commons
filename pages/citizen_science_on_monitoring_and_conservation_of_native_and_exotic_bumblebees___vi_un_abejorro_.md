Overall goal: Contribute to knowledge through citizen monitoring of the population status of the 8 native species of bumblebees in Argentina. Study the advance of two invasive species in Argentina. Specific:   Study the population status of the species B. dahlbomii (endangered). Record abundance, associated flowers, and occurrence of different bumblebee species in Argentina. Promote society engagement in the scientific process and to communicate the potential problems of biological invasions.

Description of citizen participation Participants send photos of the bumblebees they see and report how many they saw, the date, the place (city/province), and on what flowers in the different platforms of the project (Instagram, Twitter and Facebook), via WhatsApp or through the website, where they can complete a sighting form according to the region of the country they are.
