Blue Economy: Fishing Community-Led Innovations In Marine Litter Reduction In Bangladesh

Blue Economy: Fishing Community-Led Innovations in Marine Litter Reduction in Bangladesh
October 31, 2024

By Ramiz Uddin, PhD; Head of Experimentation, UNDP Accelerator Lab Bangladesh; Samiha Akter Sima, Experimentation and Innovation Associate; Nawmee Jessica Hawladar, Innovation Associate- Climate Change and Environment, UNDP Accelerator Lab Bangladesh; Shanta Islam, Department of Environmental Sciences, Jahangirnagar University. When Marine plastic is a matter of grave concern! The ocean being the largest carbon sinker, consumes 90% of heat and one third of CO2. Rising marine pollution is disrupting this natural process, resulting in increased atmospheric heat. Oceans witness around 12 million metric tons of plastic waste into it each year.Research suggests that, by 2050, plastic waste will likely outweigh all fishes in the sea. Marine plastic pollution(link is external) leaves a catastrophic impact on ocean species, massively disrupting biodiversity. Additionally, deep-sea fishing further threatens this ecosystem. Fishing communities are pulling down the ocean health by throwing hard plastics in mass, to around 40% (link is external)marine pollution directly. Researchers found that, these hard plastics combined with nets and ropes result to between 75% and 86% of floating plastics in the ocean which are larger than 5 centimetres and likely to end up into the ocean from abandoned, lost or discarded fishing gear(link is external) (gill nets, fixed gear etc.). As regular sea-goers, this community can directly reduce marine pollution. Hence, their actions are vital to protect marine health.

Understanding the circumstances, UNDP Accelerator Lab, Bangladesh undertook few major initiatives to protect Marine Biodiversity & promote Blue Economy, in close collaboration with the Department of Fisheries, Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE), Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI), Local Govt., civil society and NGOs. Considering the causality of this pollution, we have selected one of the extremely affected regions for the experiment. Assessments & further approaches in that targeted region of Patuakhali(link is external) were conducted together with our local partners.The boat landing stations at Mohipur-Alipur port, Kalapara, Patuakhali along the coast clearly show the extent of ocean pollution, as skippers and fishermen used to dump leftover boat waste after discarding most of it at sea during their return from fishing trips.

Plastic Peril: The Growing Threat to Our Planet!Every year about 2 lakh tons of plastics enter the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh is currently ranked 6th globally for plastic pollution.(link is external) The situation is expected to get worse, predicting that the Bay of Bengal will receive five times more plastics in 2025 than in 2010. The deadly impacts are already becoming visible.

Disruption in marine ecosystem is causing an increase in dead Jelly fishes at(link is external) sea shore. Sea Turtle is on the decrease in Marine ecosystem. Let’s have a look how plastics become adversely impactful from smaller to broader level-

Moreover, practicing Ghost fishing cause entanglements, ingestion in marine life. Ghost fishing gear(link is external) has been estimated to make up 10% of ocean plastic pollution.The impact of marine pollution on coastal ecosystems is increasingly evident, with conditions worsening each day

How fishing is directly connected to climate vulnerability??The rural coastal communities are facing challenges to meet basic needs due to communication gap and insufficient government oversight, leading to persistent poor living conditions and victims of environmental degradation. Fisheries are directly distressed by the imbalanced ocean ecosystem.A traditional Socio-economic cycle of fisherfolk: A harsh realization of their surviving, not living!!

Generally, fishermen resorts to reusable giant plastic drums for storing water during fishing. Carriage of plastic utensils mostly indicates the high degree of ocean water pollution. This assessment reveals the level of plastic pollution contributed by fishing activities in the sea.

Dissolving the Plastic soup In the middle of July 2024 at Mombipara village of Kalapara, an intense sense-making & awareness raising Program for 2 days on Ocean Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Fishing Community was arranged by UNDP Accelerator Lab, jointly with our local partners. This program also featured 60 selected fishermen from 18,303 number of registered fishermen (source: Need assessment survey,2023) who are also boat skippers, aimed to instil a sense of ownership among them regarding this crucial issue. Therefore, Marine litter collection is a vital concern regarding Blue Economy Prospect in Bangladesh. The experiment highlighted on- ‘Getting through the direct involvement of fishing community in this restoration process.’ The group engaged in highly interactive discussion on-Endangered Marine species like corals, sharks, marine mammals, turtles, red crabs & seabirds etc.Safety at the sea, Role on reducing the Climatic Effect, safe drinking water for their life, IUU Fishing Reduction Strategy Rules & Regulation of Bangladesh Government.They were also provided with Marine Litter Collecting Tools like Drum, Torch, life jacket. First Aid box & Rain coat will be equipped for each as Incentive of collections.

Aftermath of the session Attending 2 days of awareness raising session, providing them with basic knowledge regarding Plastic as a Hinderance of Balance & their ultimate sufferings due to decreasing number of fish in the sea, the participating fishermen were deeply concerned.While monitoring the field after a month of sessions, clear status of those trained 60 fishermen, shows hope!Also, the follow up assessment clarify some great outcomes. Some of their views are structured below-

The after-assessment also reveals that, out of caution, individuals have begun collecting plastic waste from nearby marine waters and storing their daily plastic waste in sacks to bring back to disposal sites where collection drums are provided.They have also confirmed, no more non-targeted or endangered species are caught, if it appears in fishing gears, they release them.Additionally, they prioritize their safety by wearing life jackets during fishing activities.

Accomplishment for a climate resilient solutionCleaning up isn’t just a chore- it’s the only shore solution! Traditionally, stakeholders are assumed to committed to contribute for achieving goals, but involving marginalized community below poverty line was seen as a challenge. Undoubtedly, we are going to witness a transformative shift throughout this pilot approach. To make such fruitful collaborations, our local partners play a significant role.However, this inclusive approach of engaging the largest contributors to global efforts that not only aligns with multiple Sustainable Development agenda but also addresses the urgent need to tackle plastic pollution in Bangladesh as part of achieving Agenda 2030.Remarks: Most importantly, piloting a temporary green waste dumping site dedicated for the bulk of coastal waste for clean landing stations & making this experiment a way more successful to next level through circular economy. Furthermore, waste management experiment for these landing stations is about to be designed. Close monitoring & evaluation on this pilot project will be continuing as we are optimistic for scaling up this pilot experiment in near future to be a part of the Green-Innovations.
