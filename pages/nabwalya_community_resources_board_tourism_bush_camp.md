NABWALYA COMMUNITY RESOURCES BOARD TOURISM BUSH CAMP

> Brief description of the innovation

Nabwalya Community Resources Board (CRB) is recognized by the Zambia Wildlife act 12 of 2015. The CRB of Nabwalya is in a rich wildlife area where hunting takes place but what is lacking is accomodation for local and international Hunters. We need to create a Bush Camp for clients who come to Hunter in the are and make money for wildlife protection and the local people of Nabwalya in order to lift their cost of living and alleviate poverty. The area is sanwitched among three national parks of Luambe, South Luangwa and North Luangwa and this justifies for its being a viable photo tourism, hunting and camping area for clients.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As outlined above this area has plenty of wildlife. The community has already employed 65 wdlife Scots to compliment the national parks. Department in wdlife protection. They recieve more thirty international clients per year From all over the world but there is no enough space to accomodate them. We need to establish a bush camp which will eventually be turned into a photographing and camp. The camp can operate all year round and generate income for the community and use part of the money to do community projects which givernnment alone cannot manage due to the terriane to reach Nabwalya. This is one of the richest and most precious wildlife area for both hunting and photo tourism. We need totally a new structure to built with tourism. Design suitable for international tourism. There are also Zambian Hunters who get very stranded in terms of accomodation once in this area of Nabwalya.

> Technical Feasibility

There is no other Bush camp in Nabwalya apart From the concessional camping areas. Strictly for safari hunting clients while Zambian, SADCC and other clients have nothing. This is a desperate request for the COmmunity. The area has already been zoned for tourism. Has a fishing lagoon for clients already. Needs structures for accomodation. The CRB needs supports in terms of funding for starting construction. They have ten Board members, an account they arealdy use to access hunting revenue for salaries for scouts and administration funds. They work with Chief Nabwalya and all transactions and local Indunas. The team is fully organized and ready to bear responsibility of any support rendered unto them. There is also an accountant or Bookkeeper for recording and taking account of all payments.

> Anticipated Social Impact

As explained above, this project will affect many lives. In case you need verification, liberty is given to contact me or the Chief and the CRB or the Department of National Parks.
