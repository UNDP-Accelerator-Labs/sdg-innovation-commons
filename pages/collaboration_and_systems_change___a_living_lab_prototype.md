## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuly.**

> Hypothesis: IF... THEN....

IF we bring different stakeholders with a common agenda to an informal settlement together, how might we best work alongside them in using their assets to bring about changes in the community?  How might we supplement existing government structures and resources to enhance their use for and by the community? How might we include the community in decisions that affect them so that solutions implemented are sustainable? 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> What is the learning intent of the activity?

The learning intent is to establish whether there is a willingness  of private, public sector and the community to collaborate and work alongside the community for genuine collaboration to take place.

> What is the object being tested?

The creation of a living lab which has several "solutions" and entry points: The Ministry of Home Affairs, Immigration Security  availing services to the community of Groot Aub using the Rural Community ICT Centres that were established in 2010, but are currently "white elephants". The City of Windhoek  the local municipality also seeks to empower the youth, women  but there is very little achieved in terms of economic recovery at present.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity?



Three months starting January 2022.

> Describe the methodology of the experimental activity. For example, sample size and selection; data collection technique; collaboration; randomization technique; data analysis technique

The sample size of the sample is contingent on the community call for interest.  The youth and women make up about 850 of the 1200 inhabitants of the community.  Convenience sampling will be used, and participants will be recruited and registered through the Constituency Councillor's office.  An asset mapping exercise will help determine the knowledge skills and attitudes of the sample before offering them courses which could be delivered through the Rural Community Centre and the City of Windhoek.

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> What are the resources required for this experiment?

Transport to the informal settlement, Meals (for the days of consultation), workshop stationery and resources and Willing partners.
