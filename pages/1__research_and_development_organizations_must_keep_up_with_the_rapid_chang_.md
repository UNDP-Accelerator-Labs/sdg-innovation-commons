## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. R&D organizations must keep up with the rapid changes in technology and the job market. 2. Collaboration and partnerships are required to support the commercialization of research outputs and innovative products, particularly in fostering the academia-industry nexus. 3. Experimenting with a "challenge-based model" and distributed problem solving improves the quality of innovation products and increases market relevance. 4. Because academia is the largest low-hanging-fruit space for innovation products in Tanzania, more collaboration in this space is likely to yield positive results. 5. More financing mechanisms are needed to enable universities to run self-incubation programs that require large budgets.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

There were several significant barriers to implementing this learning process, including: 1. A delay in signing MOUs with some universities due to lengthy procedures. 2. Some innovations required funding, which was outside the scope of Acc Lab's work at the time. 3. Because innovators are at different stages of development, creating a one-size-fits-all training program proved difficult. 4. There are still fewer women involved in university-level innovation; nearly 75 percent of participants were male; we need a special program for girls.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Not Applicable

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Human-centered design  helped  students be more productive, redesigned their work/products and make them accessible by creating relevance to a wider audience (market),  the process went on to alleviate some of the stress that comes from using products that are difficult to use and grasp.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

BITHUB Mbeya- A tech start-up based in the Mbeya region (they facilitated digital marketing sessions), Rikolto- a non-profit that works with farmers, financial institutions, and food value chain actors- ( They provided various learning experiences for participants

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Mbeya University of Science and Technology (MUST) and the Nelson Mandela African Institution for science and technology (NMAIST) - The two instututions hosted both the pre-incubation and incubation programmes for students and out of campus innovators in running the distributed problem solving approach.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Women-led SMEs from the Mbeya region participated in the program; however, the Coca-Cola company was approached while looking for private sector partners to offer an opportunity for innovators to pitch their products.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Mbeya Regional Government took part because the UNDP country office had provided technical and financial assistance to the City Council in developing its own investment guide - a blueprint providing investment information to prospective local and foreign investors with the goal of attracting them to exploit investment potentials in the region in order to stimulate business and enterprise development as well as execute development pathways. The region informed innovators that they could apply for funding through a youth-focused fund to which the city allocates 10% of its revenue.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Bithub- a startup was new and unsual for UNDP.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not applicable.
