## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. A coordinated, whole of government approach is absolutely necessary. When individual Ministries, Departments and Agencies operate in Silos, the effectiveness of service delivery to citizens is significantly negatively impacted. 2. Digital tools are not a panacea. Critically, the underlying processes, policies, and procedures of government agencies need to be optimized to ensure that all members of society can equitably access services, and that services are delivered in a timely fashion. 3. In some cases, cashless solutions are not always practical without significant socio-cultural changes. 4. The UNDP needs to invest more significantly in building its human resources capabilities to deliver relevant digital solutions on behalf of government counterparts. Our offer is not clearly defined, and our internal global technical capacity is either not relevant, or very limited. 5. Despite the challenges, digital identification, digital payments, and digital government benefits provision have the potential to rapidly create significant value for the most vulnerable members of society at a national and global scale.
