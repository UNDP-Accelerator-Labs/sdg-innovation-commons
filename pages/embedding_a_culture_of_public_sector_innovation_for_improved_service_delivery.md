## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuly.**

> Hypothesis: IF... THEN....

If we provide public servants with the tools, methods, opportunities and incentives to innovate THEN innovation learning will move beyond learning as an individual, across teams, the organization and later contribute to an innovation ecosystem which will ultimately focus on improved, equitable and inclusive service delivery.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> What is the learning intent of the activity?

The experiment seeks to establish the following: What are the incentives for public servants to innovate? What would it take to influence learning from an individual, across teams, the organization and later create an innovation learning ecosystem that would focus on improved access to services?  What are the modalities and forms of innovation learning - where, how and when would public servants learn?

> What is the object being tested?

A Toolkit (with methods and guidance) + A series of Bootcamps (To practice the use of the tools) and the incentive (Improved services / More training / Organizational Reward).

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity?



The activity has been running for a year (4x4 90 day learning cycles).  By the end of quarter 1 next year (January - March), I will have an idea of whether the bootcamps, Toolkits have made any impact.

> Describe the methodology of the experimental activity. For example, sample size and selection; data collection technique; collaboration; randomization technique; data analysis technique

The sample size is 250 as these are the number of innovation champions appointed by the public sector.  The sampling technique was convenience sampling through collaboration with the government partner, office of the prime minister.  Data is collected at various points - the registration forms to attend the boot camps, checked against the list of names submitted by the Office of the Prime Minister.  Currently the sample size (of people who have signed up for the boot camps) is about half of the number of registered innovation champions.  Each boot camp sets time aside to complete an evaluation form which asks questions about the usefulness of the toolkit, boot camp and whether they will use any of the tools and approaches at the workplace.  Each participant also has to work on an innovation challenge which is prototyped during the boot camp and is aimed at improving service delivery when implemented at the workplace

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the resources required for this experiment?

The toolkits, facilitators, a training venue with training equipment  and facilities, interested public servants, administrative approval to release participants to attend the training.
