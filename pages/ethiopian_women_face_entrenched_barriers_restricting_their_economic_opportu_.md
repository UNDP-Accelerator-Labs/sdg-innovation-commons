## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Unemployment is nearly twice as high for women versus men. Most working women earn substantially less than men. Access to finances, agriculture inputs, and credit heavily favors men, limiting women’s economic prospects — this merits rethinking structural drivers of how value is created and distributed.

Social norms and inadequate political representation also impede  women’s advancement. Women comprise less than 40% of ministerial positions. Nearly 25% of married women suffer physical abuse indicating a series of both formal and informal entrenched power structures that result in compounding inequalities of voice and agency.

Partly because of the above two, women and girls pay disproportionately higher costs of crises and disasters. This further exacerbates risks and causes economic shocks, violence, and trauma. Factors like rural residence and disability status intersect to further marginalize some women.

Women tend to be engaged as recipients of aid rather than agents of change. Serving women’s needs is crucial but not enough. Lasting transformation requires putting women in decision-making roles to steer community-driven solutions.

The gains in gender equality are often less sustained in  post-crisis. In recovery/stabilization interventions, women may take on more household decision-making power and roles in aid distribution.
