> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

Kara Solar

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

https://karasolar.com/

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

Kara Solar began in 2018 as a partnership between the Achuar indigenous people of Ecuador and engineers, anthropologists, communicators, and other allies to build solar-powered river transport and energy networks in Achuar territory. Currently, Kara Solar is legally inscribed as a foundation in Ecuador.

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Kara Solar's initiative focuses on creating regional transportation and energy systems that include solar-powered boats, solar stations (also called charging stations) and batteries that are specifically adapted to the Amazonian context. Their goal is to provide clean infrastructure to support technological independence, while liberating communities from the restraints of gasoline power. In the Amazon, geographical dispersion demands the use of gasoline-run boats or canoes, at very high prices. Therefore, solar energy implementation (e.g.solar powered boats) can reduce dependencies on petrol and money.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

The cost of creating a regional transportation and energy system is $250,000 which includes the creation of 4 basic elements or building blocks. (1) Small boats - for family use (2) Large boats - communal use, about 12 to 15 people (3) Solar Centers - charging stations for boats as well as other communal uses (4) Battery production - needed for all the other elements to function. Each community assigns and organizes the distribution of the building blocks. Of the $250,000, roughly half of it goes to equipment purchases, while the other half finances the project's logistics, training program, and technical services.

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Tested and working

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

The model created in Achuar territory is applicable to rainforests across the Amazon and around the world. Now, Kara is accompanying indigenous communities in Brazil, Peru, Solomon Islands, and Suriname as they replicate this model pioneered in Achuar territory.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

The impact has been measured by Kara Solar by calculating that the use of one solar boat to transport children to school 5 days a week in the Wichimi community has equal carbon footprint to 75 hectares of forest untouched. This calculation stems from the assumption that if the community can't access a solar power boat, they would have to pay for the gasoline needed for transportation which would likewise be a need for income production which in the Amazon region is closely tied to farming and wood trading, both major responsible for deforestation.

On the other hand before the intervention, over 42% of community respondents demanded a road to connect the Port to Wichimi. After the fluvial school transport was implemented this decreased to 2%.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?
