Executive Summary

We define Grassroots innovations (GIs) as "indigenous solutions, created by actors in civil

society and supported by limited resources, which aim to address local situations and

often achieve sustainable development." GIs, essentially bottom-up solutions occurring in

informal, non-market settings, rarely feature in the mainstream innovation policies that

focus on rent-seeking firms in developing innovative processes and services designed for

conventional markets. GIs, on the contrary, have a different motive altogether. GIs

highlight the importance of psychological and social processes of creativity in innovation,

and collectively, as a movement, GIs drive socially inclusive innovation processes. Local

communities come together to share their ideas on the knowledge, processes, and

outcomes involved in product development when a need emerges, often in response to

perceived social injustices and issues concerning the environment arising from

mainstream innovation models. Famous examples include the Honey Bee Network in

India and the technologies for social inclusion movement in Latin America.

In this study, we worked with UNDP Accelerator Labs (UNDP AL) to explore what

contextual characteristics and set of policies can promote grassroots innovation. We

employed a mixed-method approach that involved qualitative and quantitative data

gathering techniques. The revelations from our literature review, compounded by the

complexity of our task, which involved the participation of 7 different countries worldwide,

and the fact that GIs is a heavily understudied topic, made us realise that a framework to

understand GIs in a way we could apply in our research was non-existent. We decided to

develop a conceptual framework and used it to interview 7 different UNDP ALs

worldwide. In some instances, GIs and policy professionals, to better understand the GI

landscape in each of those countries. We also co-developed a survey with UNDP AL which

we sent to the UNDP AL staff we interviewed and GIs from those countries. Due to time

and logistical constraints, the findings from the survey do not draw causal inferences of

any kind. They are purely descriptive statistics that yield valuable insights that we use to

support what we learned from the interviews. We then discuss the implications derived

from insights we received from both the interviews and the survey.

ix

Our survey results confirmed what we learned from the interviews in almost all

framework domains except IPR. There was no consensus among those we interviewed on

its significance. The survey results also suggest that financial capacity and institutions and

communications and promotional facilities are the most significant impediments faced by

GIs, followed by education and training and technological advancement, consistent with

what we learned from the interviews. Conversely, financial support, such as tax incentives,

when received, can be key enablers that promote GIs.

Context specificity and intercultural diversity make it nearly impossible to develop a set

of applicable recommendations that is replicable from one context to another. Yet, we do

our best to provide a set of policies recommended in three levels: National Governments,

Initiatives, and Local Authorities. Our findings also include a one-page SWOT analysis with

tailored policy recommendations for each of the 7 countries we interviewed. We believe

our study sets up a foundation for future research based on GI and has implications for

policymakers when considering the range of innovation systems it encompasses. We

advocate that countries designing innovation policy should be mindful of GIs and include

them in a way that will allow GIs to thrive.

Introduction

Introduction

1.1 Background

Public policy supporting mainstream innovation activities have historically focused on

instruments that support Research and Development (R&D) and the commercialisation of

innovative products and solutions. However, such policy instruments would be

inapplicable for grassroots innovators (GIs), which are essentially community-based

initiatives that solve context-specific problems. Enacted by local actors, GIs can provide

tailored solutions to pressing issues that can quickly gain momentum with the right

support. Through developing innovative solutions, GIs create a sense of solidarity and

trust in the communities they serve by validating and authenticating the potential benefits

of their output. GIs continuously work towards improving the solution through co-

development and co-ownership, and repeated cycles of iteration. Our research further

argues that policies concerning GIs can also have country-specific characteristics that

need further synchronisation. Our findings and analysis suggest that the use of

mainstream innovation policy instruments to support grassroots initiatives are not

adequate.

1.2 Objectives and Research Question

Our research seeks to explore what contextual characteristics and set of policies

can promote grassroots innovation. As part of our research, 7 different UNDP

Accelerator Labs, namely, the Philippines, Ecuador, Colombia, Bosnia and Herzegovina,

Iraq, Kenya and Ghana, agreed to participate. We interviewed UNDP Accelerator Lab

(UNDP AL) staff and, in some instances, grassroots innovators and policy professionals to

understand the process and nature of GIs. The revelations from our literature review, in

addition to the insights we gathered from prominent academics in the field, led us to

develop a conceptual framework that we used for our analysis and to derive policy

recommendations. We also co-developed a survey with UNDP Accelerator Labs and

distributed it to the countries we interviewed to support our findings. The 7 participating

Accelerator Labs also agreed to distribute the survey to GIs in their respective countries.

The survey results yield relevant descriptive statistics that support our findings from the

qualitative interviews that we conducted.

1.3 Policy Problem and Research Justification

Aside from existing theories of GIs based on the concepts of non-linearity and strategic

niche management (e.g. Geels and Raven, 2006; Hargreaves et al., 2013; Seyfang &

Longhurst, 2013), GIs is an understudied topic. The purpose of this study is to showcase

the relevance of GIs and their contributions, highlight their challenges, and propose that

countries should devote time and resources to creating conditions where GIs can be

nurtured.

1.4 Outline

This report is structured as follows. In Chapter 2, we discuss the policy problem that

underlines this research. Next, we develop the study design and methodology described

in Chapter 3. The literature review is delivered in Chapter 4. Furthermore, we establish a

contextual framework in Chapter 5. Then, we build the quantitative analysis in Chapter 6

and the qualitative analysis in Chapter 7. Finally, Chapter 8 concludes and provides the

policy recommendations.

Introduction

Policy
Problem

Grassroots innovation has historically been a critically understudied research topic.

Contemporary studies in innovation tend to focus on private-sector innovations that

present significant scalability opportunities. However, there is limited insight into the

innovations springing up amongst individual citizens and communities. Part of the reason

for this lack of research interest is the difficulty in measuring GI since GI comes in all

shapes and sizes, and there is no stereotypical innovator that is easily picked out of a

crowd.

Whilst these aspects of GIs make it difficult to study and quantify, GIs lend a great deal of

potential. In developed countries, grassroots innovators tend to innovate for more

utilitarian reasons. Professor Eric Von Hippel at MIT has been studying what he refers to

as “user innovation” in the United States and found that the motivating factors for

individual innovators tend to be more altruistic and “hedonic” (pertaining to self-

satisfaction) (von Hippel, 2017). In developing countries, GIs are pervasive due to large

informal economies. The innovators often create solutions to everyday societal issues that

governments fail to address (Gupta, 2020).

There is much to learn from GIs being carried out by the plethora of extraordinary

individuals and communities worldwide. Their distinctive motivations yield unique

solutions to problems sometimes neglected by typical large-scale innovations and can

offer vast benefits to both developed and developing countries. The absence of

supporting literature and a comprehensive framework in this field represents a policy

problem that we would like to address in this research. We hope our study will assist

governments in both developed and developing countries to help promote GI as a means

to drive economic growth, increase ecosystem sustainability, and reduce inequality

(OECD, 2009, 2011).

Study
Design and
Methodology

We conducted the research using the mixed-method approach. First, we carried out a

thorough literature review and preliminary interviews with experts and lecturers in

innovation to help us identify barriers and potential policy solutions. Second, we establish

a framework that consists of context and policies as a parameter for the interview and

survey. Finally, after the data collection process from surveys and interviews, we run a

comparative analysis across countries to propose a set of policy recommendations. Our

research design is illustrated in Figure 1.

3.1 Qualitative Design and Data Collection

This study relies heavily on the body of literature of innovation. The literature review aims

to summarise, analyse, evaluate, and synthesis the sources (Onwuegbuzie et al., 2010).

We carried out a thematic analysis of “innovation” in general and “grassroots innovation”

in particular, focusing on academic journals, secondary sources, and grey papers. This

desk research was the first step to understand the theories of innovation that build the

conceptual framework.

To finalise the framework, we conducted semi-structured interviews (Appendix 2) with

experts in GI. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim (summary in

Appendix 5). These initial interviews built our understanding of the perspective, causal

logic, worldview, and experience before extracting the fact for an analytic research design

(Lamont & Swidler, 2014). Then, we designed the structured interview (Appendix 2)

according to our framework.

Grassroots Innovation: An Inclusive Path to Development

The structured interviews are used to collect rich and detailed data that could expose the

subject’s stories on the field they are working on (Lee Ann Fujii, 2017). We conducted

interviews with 7 UNDP Accelerator Labs across continents, 4 further interviews with

innovators from two different countries, and one interview with a government institution.

According to the LSE Data Management Plan, our interviews were conducted with

participant and data confidentiality.

The interview transcripts were summarised and analysed to answer the research question

and provide policy recommendation. In addition, we provide a case study of each country

that contributed to this research using a SWOT analysis. The case study approach is

commonly used when investigating a contemporary phenomenon that contains deep

understanding and applies within its real-world context (Yin, 2014). We chose SWOT

analysis due to its capability to consider internal and external factors that could assist the

country’s future planning (Leigh, 2010).

3.2 Quantitative Design and Data Collection

Our quantitative analysis covers two things. First, the analysis of each country’s contextual

background. To be able to formulate a policy recommendation, we conducted a case-

oriented contextualised comparison. This case study method is designed to explain any

similarities or commonalities across cases regardless of their dissimilar outcomes, which

serves more than theory testing but theory elaboration (Tilly, 1984). To carry out the

comparison, we obtain the data for each country’s parameters for the year 2020 from

published indicators (Appendix 4). The result of the comparison allows us to provide a

focused policy recommendation for each country.

Second, the analysis on the factors that support GI which we identified in our framework.

The analysis is based on the results from a survey that we designed according to the

framework and evaluated with the UNDP AL’ team (detail of survey question in

Appendix 3). The survey was distributed to approximately 70-100 respondents connected

to the 7 UNDP AL we worked with. We received 88 answers, yet we eliminated 43

responses that did not complete the survey within 40 days of the circulation. We used the

survey data and qualitative analysis results from the interview to build the main analysis

and formulate policy recommendations that address the research question.

Grassroots Innovation: An Inclusive Path to Development

Before delving into primary research in GI, we looked into the available academic

literature to better understand the context in which GIs develop. Although research

regarding innovation in a broader and more top-down sense is extensive, research

pertaining to GI is fairly sparse. In this literature review, we seek to identify and analyse

what policies or contextual characteristics can enhance or inhibit innovation in the

broader sense, and more specifically, GI, in developing countries. GI is a particularly

conditional subject – one that varies significantly between and even within countries. It is

important to recognize that every country has its barriers towards promoting innovation

and no one policy or solution is applicable everywhere. However, in studying the spectrum

of literature on the subject, we can draw inferences between countries of similar

background and identify solutions that may be more broadly applicable.

4.1 What is Grassroots Innovation?

Grassroots innovations can be described as home-grown inventions or novelties created

by everyday people and used to address challenges that directly or indirectly influence

their lives. Formally, we define GIs as “indigenous solutions, created by actors in civil

society and supported by limited resources, which aim to address local situations and

often achieve sustainable development.”

This definition is derived from several academic pieces focusing on the study of GI. Our

inclusion of the term “indigenous solutions'' is inspired by Anil Gupta’s (2011) description

of GIs as informal local and indigenous innovations by the people. In our definition,

indigenous solutions are not meant to be understood as “native” solutions (although they

can be). Instead, they are intended to be solutions that occur naturally in a given place. In

a paper shedding light on the potential impact GIs can have on sustainable development,

Sefang and Smith (2007) comment that grassroots initiatives tend to “operate in civil

society arenas and involve committed activists” (p. 585). Sefang and Smith (2007) go on

to highlight that GIs are often driven by social need, with a “resource base that is pluralistic

and often sparse” (Sefang & Smith, 2007). Additionally, they note that GIs often experience

“limited commercial activity […] and mutual exchange” (p. 591). While not a prerequisite

of GI, those that seek to achieve sustainable development are particularly desirable. Smith

et al. (2015) describe GIs as “informal phenomena” including different network

Literature Review

7

architectures and a broad diversity of social actors. The authors also highlight that GI

movements tend to use alternative strategies of knowledge production.

4.2 How Does Grassroots Innovation Differ from Broader/Classical

Innovation?

Classical innovation is rather broad in scope. The Global Trade & Innovation Policy Alliance

labels it as “the improvement of existing, or the creation of entirely new, products,

processes, services, and businesses or organization models (GTIPA, 2019). Similarly, Edler

and Fregberg (2016) define innovation as “the introduction of new solutions in response

to problems, challenges, or opportunities that arise in the social and/or economic

environment” (p. 3). Historically, classical innovation has often been used to describe new

inventions or practices occurring in the private sector. However, instead of focusing on

practices that may generate greater profits, GIs often confront “existential obstacles that

market and institution-based niches do not” (Boyer, 2018, p. 33). While classical

innovation tends to focus more on large scale, institution-backed technological advances,

GI (also referred to as “social innovation”) is understood through the everyday practices

of individuals (Howaldt & Schwarz, 2010).

GIs and innovators have been around for centuries. The earliest humans were grassroots

innovators who created new inventions, ideas, and systems to solve common societal

problems. While GI dominated early human history, in contemporary history the focus

has shifted from grassroots innovators to higher-profile, collective innovation efforts

undertaken by private institutions, often driven by market-based incentives. Anil Gupta

(2011) notes that “much of the literature is on the innovations for the people. Much less

is available on innovations by the people.” Indeed, GI has not been as common a research

subject in recent years, but that is not to say its study is unimportant. GIs are special

because they are often driven by curiosity, altruism, and the desire to solve common

problems. These unique drivers of GI yield benefits that are more directly shared with

their fellow community members.

4.3 What are the Potential Barriers to Grassroots Innovation in

Developing Countries?

Overall, barriers to innovation and specifically to GI differ significantly by context. Thus, it

would be inadequate for us to generalise the barriers grassroots innovators encounter in

their journeys. Yet, here we introduce some of the most relevant findings presented by

different researchers and academics.

While exploring community-based initiatives and their roles in governing energy

transitions, Seyfang and Haxeltine (2011) identify four main barriers: 1. the capacity to

create a strong network and build strong links with other actors; 2. constraints related to

securing funding and time availability of the members; 3. growing the movement by

creating broader public involvement and incorporating new members, that also erodes

their capacity to institutionalise and consolidate; and 4. governance and learning

challenges related to maintaining momentum and developing the group and their

dynamics. Furthermore, they identify that as these organisations grow and gain more

followers, they are more prone to encounter fundamental clashes of practices, values or

ideas. Finally, as they expand, GIs find it hard to sustain a socio-technical space and diffuse

their counter systemic ideas into an unsustainable regime or forming a niche.

Jonesa, Seetb, Acker & Whittle (2019) analyse the barriers encountered by art centres in

remote indigenous communities, finding that Grassroots innovators also lack the

managerial and entrepreneurial skills to deal with the social-cultural-commercial

trilemma. Competition between different organisations and social enterprises with the

same goals but different practices, the intrinsic cultural differences such as the

understanding of hierarchy, and the suspicion over outsiders to the community working

locally, raise additional complications for these grassroots

innovators and the

sustainability of their projects. Jonesa et al. (2019) also report that culture plays a

fundamental role in solving the ideological tensions, particularly since dealing with

conflicts can lead to violence if not properly managed. The lack of clarity in how leaders

and members of the organizations interpret these paradoxes blur the boundaries of

work-life balance, causing entrepreneurs to burn out. Finally, Jonesa et al. (2019) also state

that local problems can affect social interactions, such as low levels of formal education

or alcohol and drug abuse. Thus, some support dealing with the cultural tensions on both

Literature Review

9

sides is required to create community-based relationships that lead to integration and

improved development opportunities for the organization and its different stakeholders.

Meanwhile, Smith, Fressoli & Thomas (2012) describe three challenges that grassroots

innovators encounter. First, grassroots innovators need to be equipped with the capacity

to serve the specificities of the locality in which they operate while at the same time

pursuing a broad scale diffusion of their solutions. Secondly, grassroots innovators need

to be adequate to the situations they are looking to transform. Lastly, grassroots

innovators need to work with project-based solutions that pursue social justice goals

while their solutions are rooted in systems and structures of political and economic

power. The authors suggest grassroots innovators face additional challenges as they

incorporate values and aspirations coherent with the local context, including political and

economic realities while developing social-technical solutions that are also functional.

Furthermore, as they have to internalise social justice principles that also consider

changing the underlying structure that causes injustices, their viability is constrained by

the political and economic structures they are looking to transform. The authors caution

against developing a framework too rigid or prescriptive, as it can distort, constrain or

exclude forms of grassroots knowledge that can be considered inconvenient. Smith et al.

(2012), however, point out that existing metrics and institutions of innovation are

currently causing that effect, highlighting the importance of framing in building a more

inclusive concept of innovation, given that mainstream innovation competes for

influencing the innovation policy agenda. Table 1 summarises the main challenges

identified and how they relate to this theory.

Table 1 - GI challenges, framings, and knowledge production from Smith et al. (2012)

Grassroots Innovation: An Inclusive Path to Development

10

Finally, Hossain (2018) states that grassroots innovators are constrained by a triple

tension

in connecting three highly

interrelated

issues: scaling up, success and

sustainability. He argues that funding could be a barrier to developing, maintaining and

expanding GI. The author points out the difficulties grassroots innovators encounter in

diffusing their practices and ideas beyond their local niches into the larger part of

society. He suggests that innovation projects require different local skilled workforces,

support for research and aid in protecting intellectual property. As grassroots innovators

rely on the early stages of volunteering work and lack appropriate infrastructures or

institutional support, their growth could pose challenges related to losing popularity with

their local citizens and alienating the community they are serving. Hossain (2018) notes

that a key challenge is moving from the community level to mainstream adoption. Even if

this is accomplished, success as a grassroots innovator will remain difficult to measure.

He also points out that grassroots innovators find intrinsic and extrinsic challenges to

scale up and succeed. On the intrinsic side, he mentions internal organisation, skill

requirements, vulnerabilities such as key team members leaving the organisation,

significant reductions in funding, high turnover levels among volunteers and local or

national policy changes. On the extrinsic side, he highlights how GIs are context-specific,

depending on their members’ ideological commitment, geographical rootedness, and

competition. He points out that grassroots movements also face the additional challenge

of achieving their long-term goals as they often lack the long-term commitment required.

Overall, the academic literature seems to treat GIs as social movements and not as

innovations per se. Grassroots innovators empower local communities while promoting

a virtuous circle where personal culture and entrepreneurial skills merge, preserving and

promoting local culture. In that sense, language and framing play important roles in

encouraging or discouraging innovation.

4.4 What Policies have Historically Been Shown to Promote Innovation,

Particularly in Developing Countries?

It is difficult to quantify which policies promote GI, as GIs are difficult to measure. The

literature points towards problems that need solving and historically utilised policy

solutions to encourage broader sector innovation. However, there is still no substantial

information available pertaining to the empirical study of GI. Additionally, although there

Literature Review

11

is a significant amount of information about innovation policy in developed countries,

much of this information is “not directly applicable to developing countries because of the

nature of challenges the latter are facing” (Aubert, 2005, p. 6). Developing countries tend

to experience more unique challenges, which can require more targeted solutions.

This section will outline and evaluate a series of policy solutions that have been

highlighted in academic literature before finally providing a series of contextual examples

involving these policy solutions in the following section. We want to emphasise that there

is no single strategy or policy destined to be successful for every country. As outlined in a

PricewaterhouseCoopers (2010) report on the subject of innovation policy, “each country

has distinctive assets and deficits that shape the context in which a government crafts its

own strategy” (p. 4). This is even more applicable when comparing developing countries,

which differ drastically in many facets. We seek to integrate the importance of context

throughout this report while also drawing connections between environments that may

benefit from similar solutions.

4.4.1 Tax Incentives and Grants

Tax incentives and grants towards private sector actors have long been targeted as

potential policy tools to promote innovation. Tax incentives have proven effective in

promoting innovation in many developed countries, but it is not clear whether they are

effective in developing countries. A report by the World Bank Institute points out that tax

incentives are not particularly helpful for most developing, low-income countries (Aubert,

2005). This is especially the case in countries with a large informal sector and/or a poorly

equipped tax administration (Aubert, 2005). In these situations, countries may benefit

more from grants and guaranteed resources provided to research bodies (Aubert, 2005).

Borras and Edquist (2019) share similar sentiments in their paper regarding holistic

innovation policy. In a report published by the United Nations University, Sunil Mani

(1999) claims that while tax incentives and grants can help promote innovation in

developing countries, tax incentives may be preferable when the government wants to

shift more financial risk to the private companies. However, Mani (1999) also explains that

tax incentives or credits might be easier to abuse and “cannot be targeted at R&D projects

with large spillover effects, unlike direct funding programmes” (p. 23).

Grassroots Innovation: An Inclusive Path to Development

12

In contrast, Goedhuys et al. (2015) claim that tax incentives might be preferable to smaller

private firms, as these incentives provide immediate financial aid as opposed to grants,

which require time and effort to apply for. They go on to claim that tax incentives aimed

at increasing R&D in smaller firms would not “suffer from the presence of deadweight

loss” because of the reduced size of these firms’ budgets (Goedhuys et al., 2015, p. 84). In

his paper on innovation systems for economic growth, Charles Edquist (2014) points out

that tax incentives and grants might benefit larger companies more than smaller ones

who need the support.[14] As a solution to this issue, Edquist (2014) points to Cyprus,

whose government created a “stepwise strategy whereby new and more risky industries

receive a fair share of the [grant] budget, enabling them to prove themselves in order to

receive more funding” (p. 22). Finally, a report published by the OECD (2020) found that

R&D tax incentives “have impacts within and across for inducing companies to engage in

R&D for the first time and modifying levels of R&D for companies that already perform

R&D” (p. 66). This report also finds that smaller businesses responded better to R&D tax

incentives than larger companies (OECD, 2020). However, these results come from a study

population of developed countries and might not represent other, less developed

countries.

In summary, tax incentives focused on R&D growth stand to provide the greatest amount

of benefit to developing countries with strong tax administrations and developed private

sectors. However, R&D grants may be more prudent in countries with large informal

economies, weak tax administrations, and high levels of inequity between large and small

firms. R&D grants also provide more potential to help grassroots innovators looking to

enter the formal economy.

4.4.2 Strengthening Intellectual Property Rights

Most sources agree that strong intellectual property IPR are beneficial for promoting

innovation in developed countries. However, the use of IPR to support innovation in

developing countries are controversial. While some claim that strong IPR are crucial in

encouraging new firms to enter the formal economy, others disregard their efficacy

towards smaller-scale, grassroots innovators

Literature Review

13

The use of IP laws may not yield significant results in developing countries for several

reasons. Firstly, similar to the case of tax incentives, IP laws are only effective if a

government can enforce these laws. Even in countries where IP is heavily protected by

the law, like Bangladesh, these laws will not yield results if they are not followed (GTIPA,

2019). Additionally, IP laws have the potential to be most effective in markets where

extrinsic or monetary motivations drive innovators. However, in areas where intrinsic

motivations drive innovators, IP laws will lack efficacy. Studies of grassroots and user-led

innovators, particularly in developing countries, point to intrinsic motivations as the

dominant driver of innovative activity. One such study conducted in India found that very

few innovative efforts are motivated by purely extrinsic incentives (Bhaduri & Kumar,

2011). Instead, a significant portion of innovative efforts were inspired by purely intrinsic

drivers (like the joy of work, duty to social commons, and autonomy) (Bhaduri & Kumar,

2011). The study also observed that “intrinsic motivation is most highly rated at the stage

of idea generation,” the first stage of the innovation process (Bhaduri & Kumar, 2011, p.

51). This could imply that when grassroots innovators are deciding whether or not to enter

the innovation marketplace, they are less likely to be influenced by IP laws or monetary

incentives (Bhaduri & Kumar, 2011). However, motivating factors may differ between

developing countries.

Despite recent resistance to the use of IP laws to promote innovation in developing

countries, the Center for Strategic and International Studies asserts that arguments

against IP laws exaggerate the costs and risks associated with IPR (Lewis, 2008). The report

claims that “countries with inadequate IP protection place an invisible ceiling on their own

growth by creating disincentives for both domestic innovators and foreign investors”

(Lewis, 2008, p. 40). While this report does acknowledge the argument that IP laws neglect

to provide sufficient support to traditional or indigenous sources of knowledge, the

response to this position is that it is important to legally protect these traditional sources

of knowledge (Lewis, 2008). This would appear to be slightly counterintuitive, as these

sources of knowledge are extremely beneficial because they are openly shared and not

privately owned. It may be possible to introduce these traditional sources of knowledge

into the public domain, but this raises further complications. The World Bank Institute

provides an interesting compromise to the two sides of the IP argument. Their report

Grassroots Innovation: An Inclusive Path to Development

14

brings up the possibility of using utility models or petty patents for innovations in

developing countries (Aubert, 2005). These forms of intellectual property protection exist

for a shorter duration but still provide adequate protection and “are more easily obtained

and target a lower level of inventiveness” (Aubert, 2005, p. 26).

4.4.3

Improving Access to Information and Communications Technology

For many developing countries, improving access to information and communications

technology (ICT) can be one of the most impactful policies to promote innovations of all

kinds. Without widespread access to communication forums, such as the internet,

prospective innovators might lack the inspiration or tools to pursue their projects. Active

innovators will have a more difficult time developing and spreading their innovations in

the formal market or elsewhere. However, improving access to ICT can be costly and

difficult. Even in some more developed countries, access to ICT can be sparse in rural

areas that are less densely populated or areas that exhibit geographical limitations to ICT

infrastructure. Nevertheless, it is still important to prioritise access to ICT as an area of

policy emphasis in developing countries.

Zerfass and Huck-Sandhu (2007), in their paper on innovation, communication, and

leadership, comment that “systemic cooperation and communication with various

involved stakeholders becomes essential” concerning innovation (p. 110). They go on to

comment on the ubiquity of communication networks in modern innovation. New

technologies and processes are no longer created by single actors but instead by “a broad

network of relevant stakeholders (p. 110). Although this paper focuses on private sector

innovation, their remarks ring true for grassroots innovators as well. In all countries, user-

led innovations are supported and permeated through the use of ICT. Access to Informal

and formal methods of communication, often via the internet or cell phone, provide vast

amounts of knowledge, unique perspectives, and the elevated potential for collaboration.

Improving ICT infrastructure is cited as increasing innovation, productivity and fostering

socio-economic development (Bankole & Mimbi, 2017). Ayoub Yousefi (2011) state that

“ICT can foster innovation and reduce poverty by making available an empowering wealth

of information to economic agents in developing countries” (p.581). Yousefi (2011) points

to studies by the OECD that highlight the direct economic impact of ICT investments on

Literature Review

15

growth in GDP growth. He acknowledges, however, that investment in ICT infrastructure

can be a significant barrier for developing countries). These costs will likely continue to

decrease with the advent of newer and more efficient ICT. Improving ICT infrastructure

can continue to be hampered by several other barriers, including inadequate electricity

supply, lack of ICT skills, high illiteracy, ineffective regulatory bodies, and corruption

(Touray et al., 2013). It may be necessary to address these issues in concurrence with cost

or geographical constraints. Although expanding ICT infrastructure may be difficult, it has

proven instrumental in promoting long-run innovation in nearly every context. ICT offers

forums of discussion and collaboration for individuals across countries and continents,

enabling community members to become more effective and efficient innovators.

4.4.4 Establishing and Supporting Administrative and Regulatory Bodies

Administrative and regulatory bodies can play an important role in fostering a burgeoning

formal economy and significantly impacting smaller-scale innovators. If provided the

necessary resources, these bodies can facilitate greater ease of bringing innovative

solutions to the formal marketplace. This is accomplished by creating a streamlined

process of establishing and running a business, enforcement of regulations on taxation,

and the instillment of an easily navigable and a reliable regulatory system. Although these

regulatory bodies can serve to assist small-scale innovators seeking to enter the formal

market, they may not provide substantial benefit to grassroots innovators, who often tend

to work and innovate in informal marketplaces.

Regulations can both positively and negatively affect innovation, depending on the way

they are structured and enforced. For example, regulations that inhibit anti competitive

behaviour can diversify market structures, ensuring newer firms can enter the formal

market (OECD, 1996). Yet, some claim that anti-competitive regulations can slow the rate

of technological progress and innovation (OECD, 1996). A research paper looking at a

specific labour regulations in France that impacts firms with more than 50 employees

found that this discretionary regulation significantly hampered innovation amongst firms

directly below the regulatory cutoff (Aghion et al., 2019). While it is not entirely clear

whether regulations that seek to level the business playing field are beneficial towards

innovation, they are likely not highly desirable in most developing countries, particularly

Grassroots Innovation: An Inclusive Path to Development

16

those without any clear domestic powerhouse corporations. Above all, regulatory and

administrative bodies must create regulations and systems that are reliable and

straightforward. When regulations become complex and costly to navigate, they can

prohibit small-scale innovators from entering the market. Additionally, the reliability of a

regulatory infrastructure can encourage increased investment from international firms.

Contractor et al. (2020) find that foreign direct investment decisions are often motivated

by regulatory and institutional factors. When regulations change constantly or are not

enforced, foreign firms may be less likely to invest, as they see the economic environment

and governmental environment as volatile.

Administrative bodies should work hand-in-hand with regulatory bodies, ensuring

structured and transparent business processes. The World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business

rankings provide clear indicators of what beneficial regulatory environment. They utilise

administrative cost and time of starting a business, cost and duration of construction

permits, property registration difficulty, complexity and cost of taxes, import and export

costs, and contract enforcement, among others, to measure how conducive a regulatory

environment is to economic success (The World Bank, 2019). Developing countries tend

to score lowest on these indicators, but there are some exceptions. Overall, this index

highlights the potential importance of simplistic and cost-efficient business regulations.

This is particularly important for countries with new and burgeoning private sectors.

Simplifying the process of starting a business can enable more innovators to reach the

formal marketplace.

4.4.5 Strengthening Access to and Quality of Education

Improving education quality and access can be highly beneficial to virtually all countries.

However, education systems must be changed in the manner most befitting of their

circumstances. Effective education can provide citizens with the tools to help them

become successful innovators and better prepare them for life outside of the classroom.

However, it is not always clear what type of education will be the most effective.

Looking at education’s impact on development, a paper by Gruber and Kosack (2014)

highlights that developing countries should shift focus towards increasing spending on

primary education. The authors suggest that most developing countries should focus on

Literature Review

17

quality and not solely enrolment rates, as increases in enrolment can result in increased

future inequality. This tends to be the case in countries where there is “tertiary tilt,”

meaning “educational resources are concentrated on students in higher education”

(Gruber & Kosack, 2014, p. 253). In countries where education spending is more focused

on primary schooling, the relationship between primary school enrolment rates and

equality is positive (Gruber & Kosack, 2014). Inflated spending on tertiary/higher

education is a problem in many developing countries. For example, the average Sub-

Saharan African country spends nearly 21% of their education budget on tertiary

education, with only 3% of the tertiary-aged population enrolled in tertiary schools

(Gruber & Kosack, 2014). This research suggests that increased primary education funding

and quality can result in a more equitable citizenry, providing more opportunities and

training to those who might otherwise be left behind. This would undoubtedly be

beneficial for grassroots innovators, many of whom may not have the ability to attend

higher education. Some academic papers specifically look to study the links between basic

education and innovation in developing countries. One such paper examining farmers in

rural areas of Ethiopia found that more educated farmers were significantly less risk-

averse than those without education (Knight et al., 2010). This is a positive outcome, as

there is a substantial risk-aversion among African farmers (Knight et al, 2010). Knight et

al. (2010) find that “both schooling and attitudes toward risk were found to be important

for innovation” (p. 19).

While increasing spending on primary education will likely serve to benefit grassroots

innovators, improving tertiary education has been shown to promote private sector

innovation in more developed contexts. A paper analysing the impact of education on

innovation in China found that workers who attended secondary and tertiary schools

were more innovative (Chi & Qian, 2010). Additionally, the paper discovered that increases

in tertiary education enrolment were correlated with increases in patent applications (Chi

& Qian, 2010). However, in the case of China, the positive effect of tertiary education

appears to have diminishing marginal returns to productivity and innovation (Chi & Qian,

2010). Higher education institutions can serve as hubs of more formal research and

innovation. Still, funding for higher education should consider the proportion of the

population with access to this education and the extent to which there is room for growth.

Grassroots Innovation: An Inclusive Path to Development

18

Lastly, implementing tailored, skills-based education and training is important to

improving

innovation outputs. Borras and Edquist (2015) find that developing

competencies among the workforce is essential to ensuring long term economic growth

and innovation. However, they specify that countries and regions need to identify for

themselves what knowledge, skills, and experience will be most useful to their innovation

systems in the immediate and long-term future (Borras & Edquist, 2015). It may be

necessary to develop a comprehensive monitoring body that actively identifies how skills-

based education should be tailored to changing national and regional needs (Borras &

Edquist, 2015). This skills training will likely be best accomplished at the school level rather

than by firms. Private firms may prioritise skills and innovations that immediately impact

their productivity rather than those that build toward long-run future benefits.

Conceptual
Framework

Grassroots Innovation: An Inclusive Path to Development

20

5.1 Background of Conceptual Framework

Prior studies have identified both enablers and barriers to GI (Jones et al., 2019; Seyfang

& Smith, 2007; Smith et al., 2012). However, only a few established frameworks to analyse

and investigate GI. In the light of understanding how GI works in the field, we interviewed

some experts in grassroots or user-led innovation. Inspired by these different frameworks

and approaches in analysing GI, we designed our analytical framework to address our

research question, conduct the interviews and case studies, and provide policy

recommendations.

Brem and Wolfram (2014) found that there have been very few academic discussions on

innovation approaches from emerging markets. They argue that GI has low sophistication,

accomplished intuitively by providing a solution to a problem in the environment or

community (Gupta, 2008). However, they classify GI as high in sustainability due to its

claimed objectives and role in market orientation as it tends to attract international NGOs

to invest in them.

Smith et al.(2017) develop a qualitative framework consisting of context, framings, spaces

and strategies, and pathways to analyse six GI networks worldwide. First, they argue that

broader historical and political-economy context were vital as predominant directions in

the development of innovation. It also provides an opportunity for grassroots alternative

innovation to emerge. The second dimension, framings, analyse GI through their shared

meaning and interpretation. Framings represent how an action could motivate the actors

to build alternative pathways (Leach et al., 2010). Next, they look into spaces and

strategies to identify the place where the innovation emerges. Spaces may not always be

physical. Any social and institutional arena, such as community group and university,

could be considered spaces. Pathways, the last dimension, is how they analyse the GIs

developed over time, transforming from vision to practice to achieve the goals (Smith et

al., 2010).

Gupta (2019) proposed a framework describing factors that contribute to the feasibility

and value of GI. She recognised three antecedents of GI come from different sources,

namely: (1) the innovator itself through the level of education, motivation, and other

personal traits; (2) environment through the local culture and interpersonal networks; and

Conceptual Framework

21

(3) market through demand potential. GI, she argued, would develop to a sustained form

with support from different organisations and stakeholders through funding, marketing,

and organisational support. She emphasises that a sustained value of GI could be either

commercial or non-commercial value.

Given the identified need for GI workshops, UN ESCAP published a workbook that

documents policies and strategies derived from the Honey Bee Network in 2020. The

workbook gives policy recommendations to discover, promote, support, and protect GIs.

It is highlighted in this literature that not every GI needs to be commercialised. Hence,

social diffusion is suggested. This workbook, however, does not take any contextual

difference into account. The idea was built on India’s stable indigenous innovation

network, which might not be applicable to other countries. We incorporate the

recommendations in our framework and develop it further with a contextual perspective.

In addition to analysing existing frameworks in the literature, we conducted a few

interviews with GI experts to understand the complexity of the matter in the real world.

Align with his book, Adrian Smith argued that different innovations emerging at the local

level could share the same agenda and expectation. This shared motivation forms a

network that will support innovation at a higher level. The role of the networks is what

develops many GI movements, such as Honey Bee Network and People’s Science

Movement. Eric von Hippel also suggests to view innovation at the individual and system-

level. In developing countries, different individual innovations work simultaneously to

form a bigger system-level innovation. Individual-level innovation is not necessarily

commercialised; hence it is difficult to measure the value. To understand different

innovation developments among countries, one should conduct a deeper investigation

on innovation-sharing platforms such as Github.

In summary, Brem and Wolfram’s research gives clear criteria to distinguish GI from other

types of frugal and indigenous innovation. Yet, it does not explain the motivation of

emergence nor actions to help it develop. Smith et al.’s literature provides compelling

reason to focus on contextual background. However, the context is not sufficient to

analyse what supports the innovation to develop. Gupta gives a set of moderating factors

that contributes to sustained GIs. Similarly, UN ESCAP provides a set of recommendations

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

22

for the government to promote GIs. Both Gupta and UN ESCAP, however, do not offer

contextual roles in the emergence of GIs.

As a result of our exhaustive research and interviews on GI frameworks, we concluded

that we need a comprehensive framework. We propose a framework that incorporates

two main drivers of GI, the contextual background and the set of policies from either

government or innovation networks.

5.2 Design of Framework

As previously mentioned, the field of GI has been studied and explored very briefly both

by academics and practitioners. We reached out to several of these academics and

practitioners and explored existing literature and case studies, to help us construct our

framework. Each academic, practitioner and piece of literature filled out some empty

spaces in our puzzle, leading our framework to materialise in Figure 2.

5.3 The Logic

Grassroots innovation is not an independent phenomenon. Technological advancement,

sustainability, and scalability of

innovations strongly rely on the surrounding

environment. From the very early stages of an innovation being developed to its

sustainability and growth stages, the environment shapes its path towards success.

Grassroots innovators innovate to the level that their surrounding economic, social,

political and technological contexts allow them to do so.

The key to supporting and encouraging GI is to effectively assess and improve the

contextual elements that greatly impact the emergence, sustainability, and growth of

innovation. In other words, any third party intervention should primarily address the

context, not the innovation process. In an innovation-averse environment, direct

interventions should be extended to help innovators overcome the hostile environment,

which implies solving a problem of inefficiency. Moreover, the sustainability of direct

interventions is highly questionable as direct interventions have little contribution to the

improvement of innovation environments, causing innovators to rely on governments’

support permanently.

Conceptual Framework

23

Figure 2 - Conceptual framework of this research

5.3.1 Context

Our research finds six contextual aspects of a locality that could directly and significantly

impact GIs’ flourishment. The first aspect we found is the level of Technological

Advancement. Technological Advancement refers to both access to high-tech products

in local markets and the production of such products inside hosting countries and regions.

To the extent, innovators have access to high-tech products, their ability to deliver more

effective, more sustainable, and more diverse innovations improves. On the other hand,

firms should stand on the same or higher technological advancement level as innovators

to support innovations for their sustainment and growth stages. We have also

differentiated between local and national levels of technological advancement to address

federalism and transportation issues.

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

24

Once an innovator successfully materialises his/her idea in the form of an initial

prototype, a preview version of an online platform, or a pilot implementation of a large-

scale programme, communication becomes central to the sustainment and growth stages

of the innovation. At the sustainment stage, communication helps ideas propagate at the

regional level. Hosting communities and their surrounding neighbourhoods are primary

markets for GIs. Without proper communication within these communities, innovators

will fail to secure their necessary market share and sustain their innovation. The same

logic applies to the growth level, where targets of communication are firms and

businesses. We found three important elements in Communications and Promotion

Facilities: Access to ICT networks and products, density of community relations (which

addresses average distance between the host and the surrounding communities), and

business promotion culture (to bring the cultural aspect into consideration).

Under Governmental Institutions, three different aspects of political institutions in the

hosting country with three different impact mechanisms are discussed. The first element

is the Level of Decentralisation. Bardhan and Mookherjee (2006) discuss the trade-offs of

decentralisation in developing countries regarding public services provision. As a desired

consequence, more decentralised governments can respond more promptly to public

needs and demands. On the other hand, however, decentralisation reduces national

governments’ control over local governments' financial affairs and can lead to budget

leakage and corruption. Further, the Rule of Law allows innovators to plan and to ensure

their business rights are protected. And finally, under Social Actions and Civil Society, we

assess the ability of innovators to speak up, demonstrate their needs, and demand

governmental support.

We separately assess intellectual property right regulations and their enforcement.

Implications of Intellectual Property Rights for GI have been subject to academic

debates. Some academics argue that comprehensive Intellectual Property (IP) rights and

their strong enforcement have positive impacts on GIs because innovators are likely paid

by firms and businesses acquiring their ideas. On the other hand, other academics

(including Eric von Hippel from MIT) believe that being copied by non-innovators in

Conceptual Framework

25

hosting and neighbouring communities is a method of propagation for GIs and helps

them sustain and grow. With strongly enforced IP rights, the copying process will be

harmed, and some innovations will not reach the sustainment stage as a result. We look

at IP rights enforcement at business and individual levels to be able to analyse both

arguments.

Innovation is not a costless process. Developing and refining prototypes, promoting

innovative products and services, and large-scale provision all need financial resources.

Resources may come from innovators savings or outside sources. Under Financial

Capacity and Institutions, we assess how properly grassroots innovators have access

to

financial resources. We also

look at

the

tax rates as a means

for

encouragement/discouragement of innovation.

Additionally, Education and Training are vital for the process of innovation. Education

systems are designed to teach pupils how to socialise, read, write, and be creative, which

is the central skill for all innovators. Professional training provides innovators with the

necessary knowledge of tools, products, and services around them to materialise their

ideas. This enables innovators to deliver more sophisticated innovations.

5.3.2 Policies

Our framework considers three policy-making and implementation levels: national

Governments, governmental and non-governmental foundations and Initiatives, and

Local Authorities and Grassroots Innovation Labs. National governments can support

GIs by institutionalising their support agenda, introducing and passing bills (e.g. tax

exemptions or budget dedication), or providing primary infrastructure. Foundations and

initiatives are designed as less bureaucratic bodies that relate governments to GI

networks and local authorities, handle public budgets dedicated to GIs, and assess the

overall situation regarding GIs in the country. On the local level, local authorities and

innovation labs manage on-the-ground operations and advocate for more extensive

support from governments and international organisations.

Quantitative
Analysis

27

6.1 Overview of Context

At a glance, the innovation ecosystem across continents varies significantly. According to

the WIPO’s 2020 Global Innovation Index (GII) as illustrated in Figure 3, Asia is the

continent with the highest standard deviation of innovation rank, representing the largest

gap of innovation ecosystem among countries. Putting aside Oceania as an outlier, Europe

is the continent with the least inequality of innovation-supporting ecosystem among its

nations. On average, countries in Africa have the lowest range of ranks, followed by

America and Asia.

Figure 3 - Worldwide innovation ecosystem according to WIPO (2020)

Our preliminary research shows that it is difficult to individually analyse the emergence

of innovation from the context of where it emerges. To formulate a fitting policy

recommendation, an in-depth analysis of each country’s context is necessary. As

mentioned in the framework, we categorise the context into six parameters: technological

advancement, communication and promotion facilities, governmental institutions, IPR,

financial capacity and institutions, and education and training. The findings across each

context would justify the policy option that each country should address. However, there

was minimal data on Iraq. Therefore, the context analysis is limited to the other six

countries.

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

28

6.2 Overview of Survey

In addition to contextual ecosystem analysis, the

justification of our policy

recommendations stems from the survey results. According to the innovators and the

other supporting parties of innovation, our survey resulted in a set of enablers and

barriers of GI. By identifying the barriers experienced by people in the field, we could

prioritise the critical aspects to resolve. On the other hand, the enablers identified through

the survey could be a starting point to create an ecosystem supporting GI.

The survey was in circulation for about 40 days, and we received 45 complete responses.

We distributed the survey to seven UNDP AL which they further distributed to

approximately 10-15 grassroots innovators or people that are involved in the network.

From these responses, we obtained a range of barriers that may affect the growth of a

GI. Illustrated in Figure 4, we identified that the financial capacity and institution is the

most significant barrier, followed by communication and promotion facilities, education

and training, and technological advancement. Interestingly, our survey result shows that

IPR and government institutions are not dominant barriers for GI.

Figure 4 - Barriers to GI according to survey

On the other side, the respondents see the role of financial support for innovators,

including tax incentives and the simplicity of the tax system, as a primary enabler for GI,

shown in Figure 5. Government institutions surfaced as the second dominant enabler,

followed by communication and promotion facilities, technological advancement, and

education and training. Similar to the barriers, IPR seem to take a neutral stance; neither

motivating someone to innovate, nor promoting innovation to grow.

6.3 Technological Advancement

In general, our framework investigates four parameters when explaining a country’s

technological advancement: general infrastructure, ecological sustainability, R&D, and the

capability of a country to foster its knowledge and technology into outputs (detail in

Appendix 4). If we look at GII worldwide data, there is a strong sense that countries with

good infrastructure have a higher capability to translate the knowledge they obtain into

outputs. Furthermore, there is a large disparity between North America and South

America, and Eastern Asia with the rest of Asia. Europe has the best infrastructure and

knowledge creation on average.

As shown in Table 1, we found that the

Philippines, Ecuador and Bosnia and

Herzegovina have the best infrastructure

and ecological conditions among the

countries that participated in our research.

The Philippines also has the highest score

for

translating

their knowledge and

technology outputs. Ghana and Bosnia and

Herzegovina need to improve their R&D to

catch up with other countries.

Our survey results, illustrated in Figure 7,

show that 15% of total votes from the respondents perceive technological advancement

as a barrier to GI. The main concern is access to R&D. They also express some concern

about access to local and international technology. Infrastructure, represented in access

to the city and ports, does not appear to be a concern for GI to emerge and flourish, which

contradicts what the literature suggests. On the other hand, 13% of the respondents

suggest technological advancement, which ranks fourth, is an enabler. Finally, contrary to

what the literature suggests, national physical infrastructure and accessible market data

were not perceived as impactful to help the innovation grow.

6.4 Communication and promotion facilities

Studies show that ICT plays a prominent role in promoting innovation in both developed

and developing countries (Touray et al., 2013; Bankole & Mimbi, 2017). Access to ICT is

essential for innovators to communicate and connect with users, producers, and other

stakeholders. In general, most countries have at least 50 out of 100 people who own a

mobile phone subscription. Regardless of whether they can access the Internet, most

world populations are familiar with using mobile phones for communication. There are a

multitude of opportunities for countries to develop further technologies or policies

leveraging this massive number of mobile subscriptions if not through the Internet.

developments. As seen

in Table 2,

Colombia and the Philippines have the

highest ICT score, exceeding Bosnia and

outlier due to its low ICT score despite

having the highest innovation linkages

among the six. This is due to Kenya’s

university and industry collaboration

that generates innovations (Jowi et al.,

2017).

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

32

In our survey, communication and promotion facilities are the second-highest barriers to

GI. As illustrated in Figure 9, our respondents feel that access to larger markets, access to

more extensive networks of collaboration, access to qualified staff and talents, and access

to the internet are barriers to innovation. In line with what the literature suggests,

grassroots innovators need to have a channel to communicate with other innovators and

the consumers if they want to develop the product or service. On the other hand, our

respondents suggest that communication and promotion facilities could be vital enablers.

The facilities that enable GI are not limited to the Internet and social media. In fact,

physical form of communication and promotion, such as local markets to promote

innovation, co-creating spaces, and hackathons, are more desirable.

Figure 9 - Communication and promotion facilities barriers to GI

6.5 Governmental Institution

The role of government in facilitating innovation is vital (Aubert, 2015). In assessing the

governmental institution context, we compared the political environment, which consists

of political stability and government effectiveness, and regulatory environment that

includes regulatory quality and the rule of law across countries. Theoretically, a stable

government and robust regulatory system should provide an ideal ecosystem for citizens

to express their ideas, innovate, and obtain funding domestically and internationally.

All the countries in our research show a volatile political environment compared to the

more stable developed countries that usually score an average of 80. The regulatory

environment might need significant transformation, especially for Ghana and Ecuador.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, formerly part of the Soviet Union and now recognised as a

environment. This opportunity could be geared toward an innovation-friendly ecosystem.

Figure 11 - Governmental institutions context across
countries

Only 3% of our respondents perceive

governmental institutions as a barrier. These

respondents feel that the guarantee of civil

rights, like freedom of speech, is a barrier to

innovation, which

is

interesting, as we

identified a high threat of freedom of

expression in Colombia and Iraq, through our

interviews. Conversely,

22%

of

the

respondents perceived the governmental

institution as an enabler. Some favourable

aspects of government that support GI include the establishment of dedicated policy for

innovators and entrepreneurs, the ease of establishing companies, and other inclusive

policies supported by the effective rule of law.

6.6 Intellectual Property Right

The literature is well populated with the issuance of IPR as a determinant of how

innovation is evolving in a particular country. However, the law itself cannot yield any

result unless there are policies in place to protect the IP right and enforce any violation.

In countries where innovations are not motivated by altruistic motive, IP laws will have

low effectiveness.

countries

To compare the implementation of IPR, we

use

two parameters:

trademarks and

patents

issued at national or regional

offices per billion PPP$ GDP. Trademarks

are commonly used by

innovators or

owners of a product or service

to

distinguish their product from another

product in the market, whilst ‘patents by

origin’ refer to the value of a patent

registered to an intellectual property body

in a certain country per billion PPP$ GDP.

Ecuador has the highest trademarks among the countries we examined, while Bosnia and

Herzegovina has the highest number of registered patents. Ghana ranks last in these

measurements by a significant margin, implying that the country might need to improve

its IPR regulation and implementation.

Quantitative Analysis

35

Figure 13 - Intellectual property rights barrier to
grassroots innovation

Contrary to some branches of

innovation

literature, we found that only 4% of total votes

see the protection of IPR as a barrier to

innovation at the grassroots level. Similarly, IPR

are not viewed as enablers

to GI. An

explanation

that we obtained

from

the

interview is that many of the innovators face a

trade-off between registering their innovation

and entering the market as soon as possible.

Therefore, many prefer not to lose momentum to enter the market and prefer not to file

for trademarks or patents.

6.7 Education and Training

According to the World Bank data, the enrolment rate of primary education has reached

an average of more than 70%, except in Africa. However, the enrolment percentage

significantly decreases as the education level gets higher. Whilst tertiary education has

been an engine for innovation and correlates with patent application (Chi & Qian, 2010),

the World Bank data shows that only a handful of countries have a share of their

population that complete higher education above 20%. The growth over time shows a

slowly increasing trend for Sub-Saharan Africa and a more significant rise in Europe and

East Asia, which explains the evidence of China in Chi & Qian (2010). North America

experienced a fall of share in the year 2010-2014, contrary to what is experienced by Latin

America and the Caribbean.

Figure 14 - Education and training context across
countries

For the purposes of comparison, we use

six parameters to present education and

training conditions, as seen in Table 5.

From this data, we can attest that

Colombia and Ecuador have the highest

expenditure on education per GDP and

highest school life expectancy and tertiary

education enrolment, compared to other

countries. However,

the Philippines

produces the highest level of graduates in

science and engineering. Both Ecuador

and Colombia also have the largest percentage of firms that offer formal training, which

is significant in increasing the technical skills of labour.

The survey result places education and training as a barrier to GI with 17% of the total

votes. Our respondents also claim that the

local culture of

innovation and

entrepreneurship could hinder the innovation itself. An explanation for this is from what

we observed in the interviews is the lack of trust in local knowledge. Furthermore, limited

technical skills impede the entrepreneur’s ability to innovate. Therefore, it is essential to

recognise the significance of entrepreneurship and technical skills training, apart from
Figure 15 - Education and training barriers to grassroots innovation

formal education, in building an

innovation-friendly ecosystem.

Interestingly, we

found

that

access to formal education does

not contribute as barriers to GI.

This is likely due to the fact that

the observed countries have a

sound

primary

education

system.

On the other hand, education and training appear as enablers for GI. Less than 10% of

the total votes feel that technical training and access to higher education contribute

Quantitative Analysis

37

positively to the growth of innovation. This finding supports many prior studies that state

the importance of higher education to stimulate innovation.

6.8 Financial Capacity and Institutions

The literature has confirmed that financial assistance, either through grants or tax

incentives, is an essential resource for GI to emerge and grow (Mani, 1999). Therefore, a

supporting ecosystem of financial capacity and institutions would be an advantage for

innovators. To analyse the financial ecosystem in the countries we work with, we use five

parameters: ease of getting credit, ease of protecting minority investors, the intensity of

local competition, ease of starting a business, and ease of resolving insolvency.

Figure 16 - Financial capacity and institutions context
across countries

From the data we received, we found that, on

average, Colombia and the Philippines have

the most prominent financial capacity and

institutions. However, we observe that the

ease of getting credit and ease of protecting

minority investors is the highest in Kenya

before

Colombia

and

Bosnia

and

Herzegovina. We found that Bosnia and

Herzegovina has the lowest score of ease of

starting a business. This is likely due to their

recent transition from communism to a

more capitalist economy.

Financial institutions are not limited to banks or other loan providers. A phenomena of

massive mobile money accounts development in Africa is one example. Sub-Saharan

African countries make up to half of the registered mobile money accounts worldwide,

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

38

reaching the number of US$400million according to the Mobile Money Metrics (2019).

Mobile money is a system where individuals can deposit money to an account that links

to a phone number and can be transferred to another phone user or converted back into

cash. This innovation is proliferating in developing countries where bank branches and

ICT are scarce. The use of mobile money in some countries in Africa has proven to reduce

the number of households living in poverty (Jack and Suri, 2016). This technology is a

limitless opportunity for innovators in developing countries to perform transactions, even

in the most rural areas (ibid, 2011).

Figure 17 - Financial capacity and institutions barriers for grassroots
innovation

According to our survey,

financial

capacity

and

institutions are considered

to be the most challenging

barriers but also the most

critical enablers. More than

a third of the total votes

perceive financial capacity

and institutions as a barrier,

primarily due to access to seed capital. Since GI is usually initiated by either an individual

or a small group in the community, seed capital would be the first resource used to

develop the innovation. Meanwhile, access to capital from either financial institutions or

venture capitalists are the latter concern. In addition, a small number of votes raise the

ease of formalising business or organisation as a barrier.

Our respondents believe that financial capacity and institutions are the primary enabler

of GI to emerge. The access to either grants or other financial support promotes

innovation substantially. Furthermore, tax incentives and ease of paying taxes were also

perceived to be enablers. This is supported by evidence in Ghana, where innovators were

granted 5 tax-free years under several circumstances.

6.9 Caveats

There are several limitations in this research that are essential to acknowledge. First, the

analysis of the enablers and barriers is a descriptive statistic. GI are difficult to measure,

Quantitative Analysis

39

prohibiting us from making more sophisticated analysis that includes regression. As a

result, the findings could only identify the affecting factors without reflecting any

correlation nor causal relationship. To accurately comprehend how these factors affect

the GI, a further empirical study should be conducted.

Next, the research was conducted with UNDP Accelerators Labs’ assistance. Most of our

respondents and interviewees are connected to the network of UNDP AL. This similarity

translates to a possibility of bias due to higher education background and similar

motivation to be involved in this research. Future independent study that targets a more

diverse random population could overcome this limitation.

Thirdly, there was very limited data on Iraq due to its unique political and economic

situation for the last decade. Therefore, we could not incorporate Iraq in comparative

analysis among countries. However, we would still include our findings on Iraq in the

qualitative analysis section and provide a policy recommendation accordingly.

Finally, due to time and resource constraints, we could not circulate the survey for a longer

period. Therefore, the number of responses we received might not be representable for

the number of factors we aimed to assess. However, this research could be a foundation

for future study that focuses on GI. Future research with more supporting resources with

diverse and random respondents could strengthen the findings.

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

40

Qualitative
Analysis

41

The information provided by the several interviewees helped us understand each of their

different perceptions and priorities related to GI and how they are working towards

encouraging GI. Following, we present an analytical overview of our findings

7.1 Context-specific

From our interviews, it seems that the most relevant factor about GI is that it is context-

specific. What we mean by context-specific is that a combination of factors such as local

culture, values, geography and history, influence the way in which GIs emerge as a

response to context-specific challenges. Said in other words, grassroots entrepreneurs

will bring to reality innovations responsive to the local challenges based on their

perceptions of the world. These perceptions will not necessarily be aligned with western

values and culture. For instance, in the Philippines, low-tech innovations responsive to the

innovators’ necessities gave life to creations such as a pumpable stove that increases the

size of the flame while cooking or a portable corn sheller to aid small farmers to gain

productivity. In Iraq, the mismatch between formal education and the market motivated

a group of entrepreneurs to create a startup to fix the educational system for software

programming. Therefore, it seems that GI cannot be fitted in the mainstream approach

on innovation that assumes it is mainly technological, led by big corporations, developed

in R&D departments and introduced in a top-down process.

7.2 Diversity

Another relevant characteristic of GI is its diversity. As GIs address local challenges, it is

expected that they present a lot of diversity, which is consistent with the variety of

countries we interviewed. Nevertheless, that diversity is further enlarged as it also

incorporates a representation of the local culture and values. For instance, we learned

about entrepreneurs in Kenya working on a light designed and used to prevent lion

attacks or a device to warn communities of elephant attacks, solutions only suitable to

contexts where the human-wildlife conflict exists. Meanwhile, in Ghana, we learned from

a platform that helps individuals find medicines. In Ecuador, we learned about a

grassroots company that helps households coordinate and prepare their recycling to be

collected by the association of recyclers through a phone application. Furthermore,

diversity is found not only between countries but also within them. For example, in Quito,

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

42

Ecuador, we learned from a collective movement of garment manufacturers that aimed

to promote social cohesion and entrepreneurial values since that is what they identified

as missing in their community.

7.3 Creativity

The diversity of GIs is fueled by the creativity from the grassroots innovators themselves,

where creativity is encouraged as innovators explore different approaches to overcome

the specific challenges they encounter. An example of this is the self-defined creative

Philippines, where the country is composed of many islands. The differences among them

boost creativity as it incorporates different sources of knowledge and perspectives, from

indigenous traditional medicine to modern technological advancement. Furthermore,

creativity equips grassroots innovators with tools to deal with local necessities using their

available resources. For example, entrepreneurs from Iraq reported that during the war,

hospitals needed to fix their machines.

Since the private sector to provide these services at that time was non-existent, some GIs

provided the solutions to keep local hospitals running. The Kenyan team also described

how Kenyans feel a need to innovate to improve their lives, where for example, some

entrepreneurs were printing 3D medical supplies to cover the system’s shortage. The

Colombian team also shared with us this view, where people fix their problems to fulfil

their necessities. The teams from Ecuador and Iraq also shared how institutional events

such as Hackathons that assemble individuals from different backgrounds can help to

encourage creativity and GI.

7.4 Governmental Institutions

All countries mentioned the importance of the government in encouraging GI, as it can

solve collective action shortcomings and create opportunities to ease the process of

creating and scaling solutions. All interviewees mentioned that there are not enough

institutions to support GIs although some do exist. For instance, the Philippines has a law

to promote GIs and a program named GI for Inclusive Development (GRIND) that targets

GIs and provides them with training that helps them overcome initial challenges at the

local level. Ecuador also has a program led by Conquito. Still, it is important to highlight

Qualitative Analysis

43

that the government has a relevant role in the whole innovation ecosystem, not only GIs

in specific.

However, even when the government has an active role in promoting innovation, the

interviewees mentioned that governments are biased towards technology-driven, top-

down, corporate innovation. Thus, GIs that come from the bottom-up and incorporate

many different approaches to innovation, which are not necessarily technological, are to

a certain point, being neglected or left aside. For instance, in Kenya and Colombia, GIs are

pervasive as people do not rely on the government to fix their problems. Yet, GIs do not

view themselves as innovators as the innovation system does not include them. On the

other hand, Iraq and Bosnia reported that as their governments are too big, they hinder

private initiative and innovation by creating dependence and dwarfing the private sector.

Yet, even in these scenarios, the role of the government in encouraging innovation seems

relevant where policy plays an important role as long as the budget to promote change is

available and the efforts are integrated. Furthermore, many countries highlighted the

proximity to the community as an important feature of government programs.

7.5 Procurement

Additionally, as governments tend to procure in large amounts, GIs are systematically

excluded from governmental contracts as they do not have the capacity to produce the

volumes government’s demand. Besides, procurement procedures also seem to be

biased towards

larger corporations. These procedures demand high

levels of

specialization, complex technical requirements, specific legal figures and significant

financial guarantees. In other words, government’s requirements are hard to fulfil and in

the case of GIs, they are left behind even when they could have the capacity to offer the

quality products and solutions the government needs. Governments could encourage GI

by tailoring some of their procurement contracts towards GIs and by easing the financial

requirements for GIs. On the other hand, technical requirements such as certifications

add an additional layer of complexity as they require payments of significant fees that

most GIs cannot afford in order to obtain the relevant documentation. Thus, this is a

requirement that could be better evaluated for each procurement process.

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

44

7.6 Scaling

What appears to be a recurrent challenge that GIs face is scaling their ventures and

coordinating with other relevant players in the ecosystem. Local infrastructures in place

seem to be well prepared to ideate and incubate new ventures. For instance,

entrepreneurs from Ecuador mentioned how they got supported by the local ecosystem

to launch their venture, or one of the interviewed GIs in Iraq specifically focuses on aiding

local entrepreneurs to ideate and incubate their ventures.

However, many ecosystems appear to be immature, missing players, highly centralized

geographically and supported by fragmented silos of specialisation by different

government levels. Particularly important is the financial infrastructure, which is

commonly described as underdeveloped and highly centralized, making it harder for

entrepreneurs to finance the growth of their activities. For example, in Iraq, interviewees

reported that the financial system is not properly working. Many perceive banks as a vault,

not properly trusting them, preventing the possibility of leveraging resources and

becoming a barrier to GIs. In contexts where the financial system is more developed, such

as Colombia, interviewees report that requirements for funding are complex and hard to

fulfil by GIs.

Moreover, institutions such as angel investors are underdeveloped, making it hard for

early-stage ventures to launch as they cannot find the financial resources. Overall,

interviewees report that many relevant financial roles are missing, such as venture capital.

Even when some start-ups emerge with the intent to fill these gaps, regulations can

prevent the development of the financial ecosystem. For instance, in Ghana, where

interviewees report that many fintech are emerging, the local regulations and procedures

to approve their operations are not easy to fulfil. There is significant opportunity for the

government to intervene in both integration and financial infrastructure development.

The government can help better coordinate and strengthen the local ecosystem by

facilitating local intercommunication, increasing integration by fostering networking

spaces, and promoting local financial institutions and access to seed or other types of

capital. Another challenge GIs mentioned is access to technical skills related to launching

and growing in the early stages of product development. As GIs have limited resources,

Qualitative Analysis

45

the size of GI ventures also tend to be small. Moreover, they also mentioned the hardships

they encounter in finding talent. As part of fostering the infrastructure to grow, policies

could target entrepreneurial skills and other basic skills such as digital literacy to further

boost innovation.

7.7 Education and training

Overall, GIs mentioned

that

their educational systems

lack managerial and

entrepreneurial training, which made them seek those skills outside the formal

educational system. For instance, Ghana described that as formal education is not

focused on building skills, the education does not translate into human capital.

Educational systems among the interviewed are diverse, with some having good public

education such as Bosnia and others lacking it. For instance, grassroots innovators from

Iraq reported a relevant mismatch between the education system and the market, even

when formal education has good content. Still, the teaching method is lagging in providing

students with the skills they will need after graduation.

Furthermore, GIs emphasised challenges in finding people with the skills they are looking

for to advance their ventures. GIs highlighted that financial literacy and English are

additional skills that the formal education system is not delivering. Notwithstanding, some

governments are making efforts to provide students with the skills required for

entrepreneurship, such as the new Kenyan curriculum that introduces innovation from

an early age.

The interviewees also questioned the ability of public servants to prepare an adequate

curriculum since they are not ready for a tech-driven future, and defining the skills

required is difficult. Iraq noted that their public servants might not have a proper

understanding of entrepreneurship, specifically how to come with a feasible idea,

implement and fund it. Furthermore, countries such as Ecuador and Colombia also

reported that language can become a barrier as many indigenous communities speak

different languages, and formal education do not fully incorporate adequate language

skills in the curriculum. Additionally, countries like the Philippines reported that

indigenous knowledge is not recognised such as traditional botanical medicine, handed

down through generations. Finally, some countries such as Kenya reported that their

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

46

educational systems are experiencing brain drain of professors, which further deters

them from improving their formal education delivery.

7.8 Information and communication technology

The different interviewees reported that ICTs play a significant role in fostering GI with

Kenya, noting they have the largest mobile subscription in the region. The Internet eases

connectivity and enables communication channels and knowledge that would be costly to

acquire otherwise. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, several GIs described

how the internet facilitated their ventures and drove growth in certain cases. For example,

a grassroots innovator from Ecuador who works with textile manufacturing described

how during the pandemic, the demand for their products increased and how the internet

eased the process of connecting and coordinating inside their network. Ghana also

reported how the internet constitutes a driver of innovation as local innovation mainly

comes from young people who are more connected, sometimes even leveraging remote

areas.

Nevertheless, many countries described that the lack of internet connectivity in rural

areas contributes to the difficulty of incorporating people from these regions into the

grassroots movement, furthering the existing disparities between the capital cities and

remote regions. For instance, Colombia described how the mountains create a “last mile

gap” of internet connectivity, furthering the existing gap between the urban and rural

access to technology.

Furthermore, even when ICTs are in place in the cities, low penetration rates and low

quality, such as it was described by Iraq’s interviewees, make it hard to fully incorporate

the internet as part of the GIs’ business model. Additionally, high costs of acquisition can

also hinder GIs activities as it was described by the Philippines interviewees, or in Ghana,

where the price reported for one gigabyte was one dollar. Therefore, ICTs can play a

significant role in fostering GIs. If internet and connectivity technologies are not broadly

available, they become a structural challenge that needs to be addressed by policy.

7.9 The role of international organisations and networks

International organisations (IOs) play a significant role in fostering GIs. For example, all

the interviewed grassroots innovators mentioned the role of UNDP AL as a key player in

Qualitative Analysis

47

easing their entrepreneurial journey and as a partner in creating new connections

throughout the ecosystem. Certainly, this information is biased as entrepreneurs were

referred to us by the AL. Still, they also mentioned how other IOs with expertise in

innovation and entrepreneurship were fundamental at the beginning of their journey by

introducing them to other players or transferring knowledge, which suggests that the

support of IOs is indeed important. In that sense, they all mentioned how networks they

were exposed to played a significant role in empowering their innovation journey by

providing them with broader opportunities, contacts, funding, talent and sources of

knowledge.

Furthermore, they mentioned how networks help to build trust and connect with reliable

individuals, a characteristic that plays a significant role in contexts that have been recently

hit by war and conflict, such as Iraq and Colombia. Particularly, Iraq’s GIs mentioned how

security issues create distrust and fear, which becomes a barrier for entrepreneurs as

they find it harder to negotiate, with political and economic instability making it riskier to

invest and commit to long-term deals. Thus, insecurity or terrorism created high levels of

uncertainty, leading to a pervasive lack of trust. Even when governments can play a

significant role in building trust by strengthening the rule of law, these processes are likely

to be slow.

Yet, networks or organisations such as UNDP AL can have powerful roles in recovering

that trust by reconnecting individuals, notably as solidarity seems to be a systemic feature

of GIs. Another feature of networks appears to be their capacity to adapt faster to

circumstances by leveraging from shared resources. For example, a GIs innovator from

Iraq shared how during the war GIs provided medical supplies and fixed hospital

machines as these were the emergent necessities. Following these features of GIs

networks, the focus should be on scaling the GIs movement and strengthening the

network. Therefore, a network such as the UNDP AL adds significant value by identifying

key players in the ecosystem. Additionally, UNDP AL plays a key role in bringing GIs

together to target bottlenecks or local opportunities, e.g., the Open Innovation events in

Ghana or Colombia, and serves as a proof of concept that the government can later scale.

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

48

An example of this is GRIND in the Philippines, which reported using the UNDP

methodology to explore and map key players in their GI ecosystem.

7.10 Media

In fostering support towards GI, the media plays a significant role by giving visibility to

many different approaches to innovation and creating awareness about the products,

services, and people in the grassroots ecosystem. For instance, in Bosnia, a former

communist country where innovation is relatively a foreign term, and young-talented

individuals tend to emigrate as they perceive opportunities are insufficient (GEM, 2017),

the media could play a significant role in promoting local role models and narrating

inspiring stories of local entrepreneurs to raise awareness of how pervasive innovation is

in the country and encourage new entrepreneurs to stay at their home country to work

on their ventures.

An example of this is Ecuador, where one of our grassroots interviewees narrated how

the media played a significant role in promoting their innovation and encouraging the

recycling movement they were creating. Kenyan interviewees also mentioned how the

media plays an important role in fostering GI. Likewise, the media also plays a central role

in promoting new narratives of innovation and value. The role of the media is especially

important in countries like Colombia, where grassroots innovators sometimes do not

view themselves as innovators, and where locally made products are less valued.

Consequently, the media can play a significant role by influencing the culture and mindset

related to GI and highlighting the value of local products.

7.11 Intellectual property rights

IPR is a controversial topic. For some, it is an important challenge for grassroots

innovators, as patents represent significant investments that GIs cannot afford and create

barriers to promote more inclusive models of innovation. For others, IPR enable smaller

competitors to protect their innovations against incumbent larger corporations and

creates incentives for fostering more innovation. For instance, Colombia reported that

entrepreneurs are afraid to share their ideas as they could be robbed, or Kenya reported

seeing larger corporations copying ideas from smaller entrepreneurs. Still, in all but one

Qualitative Analysis

49

of the countries interviewed (Bosnia), even when the institutions to protect IPR are in

place, the laws are not enforced.

Furthermore, when registration processes are bureaucratic and time-consuming, GIs face

a trade-off between going to market or registering, making it even harder for them to

protect their ideas. This trade-off was, for example, reported by entrepreneurs from Iraq

and Ghana.

At the local level, knowledge around these types of rights is still not fully comprehended.

The lack of awareness makes it costly for entrepreneurs to understand what they are

patenting and how to do it, specifically with software technologies where even the

regulators do not have clarity about how to patent this type of innovation. For example,

an Ecuadorian grassroots innovator wanting to register their intellectual property was still

struggling to find adequate advice, from the government and local lawyers, about how to

register their phone application and whether it should patent the code, the process or

something else. Yet, even when IPR are a relevant subject, it is in the implementation

where GIs find the real challenge as they struggle to lay hands on the funding, human

talent, infrastructure and other resources required to take their ideas to reality.

7.12 Corruption

Corruption and government bureaucracy represent a barrier for GIs. Power Dynamics are

present at every stage of the entrepreneurial journey, from registering the organisation

to competing against larger players with better connections to the government. Still, even

when corruption appears to be a recurrent problem, GIs seem to adapt and learn to

navigate it by “cheating or hacking” the system. For example, one GI from Iraq reported

how the process to register was complicated and lengthy until he met someone that could

help inside the institution in charge of the registration. However, a good policy could

significantly reduce the barriers GIs encounter in formalising and implementing their

ventures. On the other hand, it is important to highlight that innovation and

entrepreneurship are also political, where there are winners and losers and competing

narratives about what innovation is. As GIs remains an underexplored type of innovation

and grassroots innovators themselves remain small players, advocating for legislation

towards them remains important.

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

50

7.13 Responsiveness

UNDP ALs appear to be very responsive to the local necessities but filtered by their staff

priorities. In that sense, we noticed that the AL’s perceptions and local priorities about GIs

seem to be very much influenced by the profile of the people who are leading the local

team. For example, we noticed the focus of Ghana’s ALs leans towards technology-driven

innovation while the staff’s background is also in technological development. On the other

hand, in Ecuador, where the staff’s background is more related to economics and Social

Sciences, the priorities lean towards economic development and social inclusion.

7.14 COVID-19

Finally, all our interviewees mentioned the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted their

work and their local ecosystems in many ways. COVID-19 has disrupted how education is

delivered, what procedures are followed to register or deal with governmental or

international organisations, how GIs interact with other players, making the internet a

dominant part of their lives, if and when they have access to it. Nevertheless, we see

significant value added by UNDP AL for aiding the local ecosystems by implementing

different measures such as Open Innovation challenges to trigger and lead local GIs

networks.

and Conclusion

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

8.1 Policy Recommendations

As previously mentioned in the report, GI, and the extent of success or failure of

communities in being innovative at the grassroots level, heavily depend on what is known

as “context”. The problem of contextuality and intercultural diversity, make it complicated

- if not impossible - to develop one fits-for-all set of recommendations. Our framework

opens the window to a comprehensive analysis of the context. Based on our framework,

we clustered the set of policies recommended in three levels: National Governments,

Initiatives, and Local Authorities. The aim of this policy set is not to universalize the efforts

for supporting GI, but to suggest a comprehensive list of policies for interested parties to

select and prioritise their supportive activities from.

8.1.1 What governments can do:

•

Institutionalising support for GI in the form of National Policy Initiatives and

Government- Dependent Foundations

• Dedicating budget to the development of GI in the form of Grants and Funds

• Easing Business Registration Process by reviewing regulations and

legal

procedures

•

Improving ICT Coverage especially in most deprived areas and provide co-creating

space

• Enhancing education regarding entrepreneurial skills and technical training

8.1.2 What initiatives can do:

• Directing and distributing Grants and Funds to grassroots innovators.

• Shaping Partnerships with NGOs and International Organisations to reach out to

further financial resources and receive advisory services

• Helping evidence-based and data driven decision making in the field by Data

Gathering and Solution Mapping

• Helping evidence-based and data driven decision making in the field by Data

Gathering and Solution Mapping

• Advocating for Governmental Support of GI

• Promoting the culture of innovation at the grassroots level by attracting Media

Coverage and holding Events

Policy Recommendation and Conclusion

8.1.3 What Local Authorities and GI Networks Can Do:

• Facilitating Access to Financial Resources by acting as guarantor for private loans

and by receiving and distributing grants

• Designing and offering Professional Training Programmes

• Empowering communities for shaping Civil Society and Social Movements

8.2 Conclusion

This report aimed to explore what contextual characteristics and set of policies can

promote grassroots innovation. Through our collaboration with the 7 UNDP ALs, our

research suggests that policies concerning GIs have country-specific characteristics that

need further synchronisation, and traditional innovation policies need to be adapted to

nurture and encourage GIs. The need for creating conducive environments through

appropriate policies is ever pressing, considering how the importance and contributions

of GIs have been neglected for several years.

Our study has tried to provide a rich understanding of GIs through the mixed-

methodology method. We recognised very quickly that a framework to understand GIs in

a way that we could apply in our research was non-existent. Therefore, we have

introduced a conceptual framework that we hope is a helpful tool that will explain the GI

landscape in a specific context better when applied.

Through the interviews conducted with UNDP ALs that participated in our study, the

report has attempted to provide a candid and comprehensive understanding of GIs'

ground realities in the qualitative analysis section of this document. Additionally, we have

also included a one-page brief SWOT analysis with tailored policy recommendations of

each of the 7 countries we interviewed in the appendix. We derived our quantitative

insights from the survey that we co-developed with UNDP AL and distributed it to the 7

countries that participated in the study. Due to the logistical and time constraints, we

could not draw any causal inferences, and our analysis is limited to descriptive statistics,

which nonetheless yielded some valuable insights.

Our survey results confirmed what we learned from the interviews in almost all

framework domains except intellectual property rights (IPR). There was no consensus

among those we interviewed on its significance. The survey results also suggest that

financial capacity and institutions, and communications and promotional facilities are the

most significant impediments faced by GIs, followed by education and training, and

technological advancement, consistent with what we learned from the interviews. Two

notable parallels between the survey findings and the interview results include the role of

information and communication technologies (ICTs) and relevant education and

entrepreneurial skills training. For example, the discussions shed light on the critical role

ICTs play in fostering GIs, specifically mobile subscriptions and access to the internet.

Access to ICTs becomes even more critical in a pandemic situation. The GIs we interviewed

also highlighted how overall, their respective educational systems lacked emphasis on

managerial and entrepreneurial skills training, making them seek those skills outside the

formal system.

Conversely, the survey results suggest that financial support, when received, is a key

enabler to GIs. The findings confirmed what we learned from the interviews, like in Ghana,

where tax incentives were instrumental in promoting GIs. Communication and promotion

facilities follow suit. As mentioned in our qualitative analysis, UNDP AL's role in this

ecosystem is important, particularly in building trust, sharing resources and emerging

practices. Again, IPR does not seem to make much of a difference either way - be it in

terms of motivating a GI to innovate or promoting innovation to grow.

Throughout this study, we have consistently maintained that the problem of contextuality

and intercultural diversity makes it nearly impossible to develop a set of applicable

recommendations

that

is replicable

from one context

to another. We did,

however, propose a set of policies across National Governments, Initiatives, and Local

Authorities that we believe can be beneficial to GIs, in addition to the tailored policy

recommendations we provided as part of our country-specific SWOT analysis. We hope,

through our research, we have adequately documented and demonstrated the critical

role GIs play in our ecosystem. We certainly hope that in the future, GIs will be supported

not just from a policy space but as a movement overall and that our research has to some

extent, made a contribution in the right direction.

Creative in nature, the Philippines adopted the spirit of GI in many areas of the community.

UNDP AL established a journey of solution mapping that they called SalikLabay as an

adventure of finding bottom-up innovations in every single corner. Like many other

developing countries, the Philippines face difficulties in providing ICT to its rural areas.

However, the government's initiatives and support through different acts and projects is a
distinctive point.

Strengths and Opportunities

• People in the Philippines are highly creative. They develop GI for two reasons. First, to fulfil
their personal needs or the society needs using a hack of daily equipment and tools, such
as creating flowerpot from used towels or using banana peel as an insulator. Second, they
might use their innovation as a business model from which they earn their living. For
instance, since the internet is expensive for lower income people, some people invented 1
peso internet with a PC desk and a timer in the middle of a busy traditional market.
Identifying these innovations and providing the support through training and funding,
would increase the inclusivity of innovation in the Philippines.

• Government involvement in reaching out to grassroots innovators across the country is an
exceptional strategy. The training that the government provides for local innovators
through GI for Inclusive Development (GRIND) allows innovators to learn more on scaling
up their innovations. As the program is developing to a national scale, the opportunity to
explore more GI is wide open.

• The government has a commitment to develop an ecosystem that supports innovation in
which funding can be granted to innovators. This could be a perfect opportunity for
Philippines society to invent and scale up their innovation.

• Through a decentralised approach, the government develops R&D centres in regions of the
country cooperated with higher education institutions. If the centres are given the resource
to map GI in the area, the innovation development could be even more inclusive.

Weaknesses and Threats

• Education in the Philippines, measured from the government expenditure and tertiary
education enrolment, is still below the world median. Further attention should be given
not only to R&D projects or higher education, but also primary and secondary education.
• Due to its geographical condition, ICT development in the Philippines might have not
reached the entire population equally. For lower-income households, access to the internet

Appendices

63

might still be expensive. If the equality for ICT access as one of the drivers of innovation is
hardly fulfilled, inclusivity for innovation would be difficult to achieve.

• Even though the government has established pro-innovation projects across ministries,
most of them are still focused on developing ICT-based innovation like start-ups. More
attention to the inclusive part of innovation, such as the GI, could actually benefit the
society as the Philippines are creative and develop creative goods and services better than
half the countries in the world.

Governmental Policies and Initiatives:

• The government’s Grassroots Innovation for Inclusive Development (GRIND) program is a
significant step in the right direction. However, this program should be expanded to the
national scale and built upon. The creation of community innovation centres, particularly
in areas lacking access to higher education or more advanced entrepreneurial skills-
training, could be a beneficial addition to the program. More importantly, the cataloguing
and continued analysis of grassroots innovations would serve to introduce quantitative
evidence that can inform future innovation-based policies. As the Filipino government has
already demonstrated interest in grassroots innovation, the creation of a team to catalogue
and analyse innovations appears to be feasible.

• Access to ICT in the Philippines is suboptimal and unequal. As of 2020 internet penetration
stood at around 67% (Kemp, 2020). This number is growing, but the unequal dispersal of
internet connectivity remains. This is particularly an issue as children are continually
developing ICT skills at a younger age, leaving children in unconnected regions even more
disadvantaged. In addition to expanding ICT infrastructure, the government should work
to incorporate ICT into public schools. While it is difficult to provide internet to schools in
areas where the infrastructure does not exist, introducing students to computers (even
without internet access) can help them gain familiarity with technology that increasingly is
increasingly utilized in nearly every type of job. Students can be taught typing skills,
technology literacy, and potentially computer programming skills. This way, when internet
access is expanded to these areas, the local population will be more able to take best
advantage of it.

UNDP Accelerator Labs Initiatives:

• The Accelerator Lab team can play an important role in guiding the Filipino government
towards supporting grassroots innovators rather than solely focusing on start-ups or
entrepreneurial ventures that may be more tech-oriented and less inclusive. While the
GRIND program is in its early days, it is important to demonstrate the value present in
grassroots innovation. This can be accomplished through in person interviews/meetings
with grassroots innovators, innovation challenges and analysis of innovation impacts.
Detailing success stories and providing voices to inspirational innovators can help
government workers understand the significance of grassroots innovation.

Having so many GIs in different areas, such as social, financial, and educational, Ecuador is

still trying to overcome its greatest barrier, equality of access to important resources. The

development of ICT reaches only the more centralised part of the country (Quito) and the

provision of funding is biased towards big actors in the economy. With such potential, more

participatory policy towards these small innovators should be put in place. Although some

programs have been implemented, such as ConQuito, they remain insufficient to support the
overall grassroot innovation movement emerging in the country.

Strengths and Opportunities

• The Ecuadorian innovation ecosystem seems to be developing slowly but consistently,
primarily driven by a significant share of internationally trained young entrepreneurs who
benefited from the government’s past investment into scholarships. This poses a relevant
opportunity for further accelerating the local ecosystem as there are plenty organisations
providing training and support to local innovators to incubate their ideas and launch them.
• The market mechanisms seem to be well established, allowing for competition that can
contribute to the already dynamic innovation ecosystem that is being built. Market
sophistication also eases the process of market disruption by new entrants gaining market
share for novel well-executed ideas that can become success cases to further encourage
innovation.
Local governments, such as Quito’s government, are contributing in training and funding
early stage GIs. International organisations are also playing a relevant role in further
encouraging the development of GIs by promoting altogether events and spaces for
networking.

•

• Ecuador is rich in the diversity of its resources, landscape and regions, which combined
with the novelty of ideas emerging, aiming towards tackling local necessities that are left
unattended, can offer a great opportunity for public-private partnerships. This is likely to
further contribute to transforming Ecuador's strong social capital into economic and social
development.

Weaknesses and Threats

• The innovation ecosystem appears to be highly centralised. This centralisation is also
reflected in the finance sector, the national infrastructure and ICTs, which are likely to
further increase the disparities between the urban and rural regions and the GIs emerging
from these areas. Besides being highly centralised, the financial infrastructure is also
underdeveloped, as it does not fulfil
the financial necessities from GIs in early stages of growth. Furthermore, banking inclusion
remains a challenge to surpass.

•

Appendices

65

•

Institutions and bureaucracy play a key role in encouraging or discouraging GIs. Where for
example, registration and procurement procedures seem to deter innovation while local
institutions like ConQuito promote it. Besides, corruption and political instability also play
a relevant role in raising barriers for GIs. Furthermore, the overall innovation policy seems
to be biased towards technology driven innovation

• The scaling infrastructure remains underdeveloped and unable to provide growing GIs
ventures with the resources required for accelerated growth after the incubation and
launch stage.
Intellectual property rights remain a poorly understood subject, where GIs require further
support.

•

Governmental Policies and Initiatives:

• While internet access has been improving in recent years, only around 66% of Ecuador’s
population had access to the internet in 2019 (Freedom House, 2020). Although the
government has been making efforts to expand access to the internet, there remains a
significant digital divide along socioeconomic and geographical lines. It is vital that the
government work to not only expand internet access to more geographically challenged
areas, but also subsidise the cost of this internet access. Costs are prohibitively high, and
while government subsidies may be costly, expanding internet access opens up the door
to a growing digital economy, more connectivity, and innovation.

• Available data on the Ecuadorian government’s education spending shows that primary
education expenditure has decreased from 2010 to 2015 (World Bank, 2020). During this
same time period tertiary education increased drastically, reaching levels nearly twice that
of primary spending (World Bank, 2020). Ecuador has made significant strides in increasing
access to tertiary education, but it is important that the government emphasize the quality
of primary education in addition to skills training. When tertiary enrolments increase, those
who are unable to attend university risk being left behind, and ensuring that the base level
of education is of high quality is important for these individuals, particularly if they have
innovative aspirations.

• Promoting communication and cooperation amongst grassroots innovators is an
important step in fostering a burgeoning grassroots innovation ecosystem. This can be
accomplished through the creation of common meeting areas, particularly in economically
disadvantaged rural or suburban areas. Encouraging innovators to share ideas and
cooperate can positively influence their connection to the community and their
innovation’s development.

UNDP AL Initiatives:

• The UNDP Accelerator Lab team should work to expand their human library initiative.
Expanding this project to more remote and vulnerable communities can help to provide
much needed context and motivation for other grassroots.
If possible, involving government officials in these efforts could help to raise awareness
about the important role that grassroots innovation plays in the lives of many Ecuadorian
citizens.

As a country of almost 50 million people with the Andes mountains lying in the middle,

Colombia is very rich in oil and minerals. However, its natural conditions could be an obstacle

to inclusive development. The inequality of access to quality education and communication

networks is evident between urban and rural areas. The community, however, is very

resourceful. A culture of sharing should be developed in the effort to build more trust

towards local products.

Strengths and Opportunities

• Colombians are resourceful. They may not put labels on GIs because they perceived
innovating as being resourceful for either themselves or the community. If such
resourcefulness can be identified and documented, it might give the motivation for other
local communities to develop similar innovations.

• As an upper-middle income country, Colombia is considered strong in the aspect of
institutions and infrastructure thus providing a conducive environment for market and
business development. This is an opportunity for Colombia to engage in more private-
sector innovations. If the corporate social responsibility of the private sectors are
encouraged, along with the raising of social impact institutions, it should increase welfare
and inclusivity of the society.

• Colombia possesses a young demographic that are exposed to access to the Internet and
social media. This group of population carries potential that has not been fully explored.
• The government has many innovation-focused policies yet carried out across different
ministries. Therefore, there are multiple opportunities for training, funding, and
developing available. However, the access to this might not be equal for urban and rural
society.

• There has been a rising number of intellectual property rights and patents in Colombia for
the past decade. The positive trend is perceived as a good sign for the growth of innovation.

Weaknesses and Threats

• Due to its extreme geographical conditions, many indigenous communities are living in
rural parts of the country. Further challenged by political situation instability, it is difficult
to provide public goods and services to the whole population equally. Colombia should
establish a long term plan for equal and inclusive development, especially in the area that
matters the most, education.

• The cultural aspect that hinders Colombia to innovate is the lack of trust. Society has low
confidence towards local innovations and brands, thus fostering foreign products
development more. Moreover, the trust towards the government is among the weakest in
Latin America.

• There is a tendency of extreme capitalism in Colombia. Safety of leaders in social and
environmental movements are threatened. This is a threat for people to freely express
their ideas.

• Government initiatives, despite their large numbers, are carried out by different
stakeholders with a similar focus. As a result, there is no clear distinction between roles
and targeted outcomes. If the government could synchronize the plan and design of
innovation policies, the policies could be better targeted and more inclusive across urban
and rural areas and across innovation types.

Governmental Policies and Initiatives:

• Although the Colombian government is making efforts to support innovators, such as the
work being conducted by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, much of
these efforts are carried out in a top-down manner. The government may benefit
grassroots innovators most by initiating education programs focusing on entrepreneurial
skills that teach small-scale innovators how to start and expand their enterprises.
Currently, the Ministry of Science, Technology and innovation is more focused on providing
funding for masters and PhD studies, which would be unlikely to benefit grassroots
innovators and may be an inefficient use of funds.

• According to the World Bank (2018) the Colombian government spends more money on
secondary education than they on primary education, both on a per student basis and as
a percentage of GDP per capita. This is concerning considering school enrolment is
significantly higher during primary school, particularly for rural Colombians. In the mid
2010s less than half of all upper-secondary students stayed in school until 11th grade
(WENR, 2020). The Colombian government could benefit from strengthening the quality of
primary education, particularly in rural areas, in order to bridge the apparent education
gap. Skills training programs in early secondary school may also benefit would-be
innovators.
Finding funding is a particularly important issue for grassroots innovators in Colombia.
Again, this problem is exacerbated in rural areas. In this circumstance it may be prudent
for the government to promote innovation competitions in rural areas. Although these
competitions are not beneficial in all scenarios, as they are exclusionary, they can serve to
excite local communities and acknowledge government interest in supporting rural
citizens. These competitions are a relatively cost-efficient method of funding small projects
and jump-starting innovation sharing and networking.

•

UNDP Accelerator Labs Initiatives:

• The UNDP Accelerator Labs can play a key role in steering the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Innovation towards assisting smaller-scale innovators. Providing tangible
examples of grassroots innovations, particularly in rural areas may help to place a spotlight
on these underserviced innovators.

• Another potential area of influence is in building communication networks that connect
different rural communities. It is important to promote intra-community and inter-
community network building for grassroots innovators. Organizing competitions or group
meetings may help facilitate more openness and cooperation amongst former strangers.

An upper-middle income, Middle Eastern nation, Iraq benefits 5th largest oil reserves in the

world. Iraq is an oil-centred economy, moving towards diversification only lately. Since the

early 80s, Iraq has been involved almost continuously in military conflicts, at the cost of it’s

security, sovereignty and billions of dollars for military and security forces’ equipment and

training. The uncertainty caused by insecurity and conflict involvement, is the main barrier

to investment, and harms Iraq’s innovation ecosystem through limited financial resources.

Strengths and Opportunities

•

•

International organisations in Iraq are very active in supporting GIs. The Iraqi government
is open to international organisations and provides them with their needed free space to
actively support and promote GI. International organisations such as UNDP Accelerator
Labs and Oxfam can play a central role in supporting GIs in Iraq that could be done only in
a few countries.
ICT communication and mobile networks are widely accessible for Iraqis. With most areas
covered by 3G and 4G upgrasion initiated recently. Grassroots innovators have introduced
internet-based services and products. With wider coverage of 4G and cable internet, Iraqi
innovators can benefit a wider demand base for their innovative internet-based products
and services.

Weaknesses and Threats

•

• Since the US invasion in 2003, Iraq has constantly faced major security threats which led
the Iraqi government through massive military and security expenditure. Although
naturally wealthy with large oil resources, Iraq’s extensive security costs prevent it from
financing and investing in innovation.
Iraqi government concentrates on security provision and economic stabilisation, and the
public sector’s efforts in supporting and encouraging GI are very limited. An initiative
established by the government in cooperation with international organisations and local
innovation hubs can effectively advocate for GI inside the government and beyond, and
direct and empower government’s efforts for supporting GI.
Financial institutions in Iraq are not active in supporting startups and newly emerged
businesses. This causes lack of access to financial resources for grassroots innovators.
Most individual innovators lack necessary financial credit for receiving loans. Accelerator
labs and international organisations can act as intermediaries through which bank loans
are distributed.

•

Appendices

69

Governmental Policies and Initiatives:

• One problem facing the grassroots innovators is the administrative barrier to receiving
financial support from the government. The government has allocated some funds for
financing SMEs, but they placed significant restrictions on this financial support, inhibiting
small-scale innovators from having realistic access. The government may stand to benefit
from streamlining support avenues. They can do so by requiring less input on the behalf
of the applicant and more due diligence on the part of the government workers. While this
is more costly, it ensures that financial support is more feasible for grassroots innovators
who may really need it.

• Grassroots innovators also find it difficult to receive funding from private financial
institutions. This is a difficult problem, but can be addressed by offering capped tax
incentives to financial institutions that offer low-interest loans to grassroots innovators.
However, it should be mentioned that the practice of offering these loans is risky. It is
important to cap the tax incentives offered to financial institutions, so they are encouraged
to research ventures before they provide them with financial support and do not over-
leverage themselves.
In Iraq, issues pertaining to grassroots innovation are often overshadowed by those of
national defense and safety. In order to better encourage activity that is in line with
government priorities, the government could create innovation support systems for
innovations geared towards (non-violent) solutions that improve public safety and defense.
The government could set up communal centers of innovation to encourage cooperation
on these projects.

•

UNDP Accelerator Labs Initiatives:

• As is the case in many other countries, the Accelerator Lab plays an important role in
shaping the perspective that the government views grassroots innovation. Continuing to
catalog and promote new innovations is vital to the growth of the innovation movement.
While it is unlikely that the government will deviate from their current policy priorities in
the very near future, it is important to advance the innovation infrastructure so that there
is a developed network by the time the government is willing to shift their focus.

• Reaching out to institutions of higher education may also be prudent. These schools may

be more willing to provide R&D support or skills training for grassroots innovators.

A major nation in Sub-Saharan Africa, Kenya has one of the most advanced education

systems in the region, and proper ICT infrastructures, as well. However, its unstable

economy and constantly high unemployment rate has left the large capacities that come after

advanced education and ICT infrastructures, unemployed. The inherent culture of

entrepreneurship in Kenya enables nationwide GI movements to happen, and to encourage

self-employment as an alternative to formal-sector employment.

Strengths and Opportunities

• Kenyans receive education through one of the most modernised education systems in
Africa. Thanks to the extensive amount of international aid offered to Kenya every year and
World Bank’s consultancy services, the Kenyan government has designed and
implemented a modernised primary education system in which innovation is a central
value. This creates a valuable capacity for innovation at grassroots level in Kenya.

• Compared to other necessary types of infrastructure, ICT infrastructures in Kenya show
higher quality and better coverage. Businesses and innovations based on ICT are booming
in Kenya. By expanding mobile networks and cable internet infrastructures, Kenya can
further develop capacity for GI.

• The government supports innovation and has introduced initiatives in cooperation with
accelerator labs and non-governmental organisations. However, these initiatives have not
been as effective in building grounds for GI as expected. By running initiatives, the
government should pursue a broader goal of capacity building rather than concentrating
on instant support of current innovations.

Weaknesses and Threats

•

•

Financial institutions in Kenya, though sophisticated and effective, tend to support foreign
businesses rather than Kenyan innovators. The rate of unemployment and informal
economy in Kenya is high. Therefore, grassroots innovators most probably do not possess
full-time positions with secured salaries, and their financial credit is not enough for banks
and financial institutions to offer loans to them. More effective, ground-building initiatives
can help innovators by acting as guarantors for grassroots innovators, or they can directly
offer loans to innovators if their budget allows them to do so.
Lack of enforcement for IPR have been a challenge for Kenyan innovators. There are cases
of ideas used by big firms without the innovators’ permissions. The problem of IPR has two
sides in Kenya, existence of IP regulations and enforcement of them. The first stage is still
pending to be done by the government. They are taking steps towards it, but further effort
by the government is needed to be put behind it.

Appendices

71

Governmental Policies and Initiatives:

•

•

• The Kenyan government should consider utilizing R&D grants to grassroots innovators,
rather than utilizing tax incentives. According to the Kenyan Institute of Economic Affairs
(2016), over 80% of the Kenyan working population was employed in the informal sector in
2015. Additionally, around 5.85 million of Kenya’s estimated 7.41 million micro, small and
medium enterprises are unlicensed (Kenya Association of Manufacturers). This would
imply that the vast majority of ventures would not stand to benefit from tax incentives but
may be helped by the issuance of grants geared towards small-scale innovators who may
positively impact their communities. To best implement these grants, the government
should work to catalogue grassroots innovations. Additionally, the government should
stray from imposing unnecessary new taxes on small businesses, as these might serve to
prevent new innovators from entering the currently sparse formal economy.
Instilling a clear and relatively stagnant regulatory environment will encourage innovators
to enter the formal economy and may enable more foreign direct investment in new start-
ups or innovations.
Education is not a major issue in Kenya, as primary school completion rates were around
84% in 2017, with nearly 82% of primary school students going on to attend secondary
school (UNICEF, 2018). Education spending by level is well balanced in its current state.
However, spending on primary education has seen a decrease each year from 2013 to
2018, with additional funds being put towards secondary, tertiary/university, and technical
schooling (UNICEF, 2018). This is to be expected as secondary and tertiary enrolment rates
increase, but priority should be placed on ensuring primary schooling quality does not
decline.
Intellectual property rights are a challenge in Kenya. Recent instances of corporations
allegedly stealing IP from small-scale innovators has created a sense of apprehension
towards publicizing innovations. It is important that the government creates a streamlined
IP registration process and considers subsidising processing costs for small businesses.
Holding larger corporations responsible for IPR infractions is also necessary to ensure
greater public trust in IP protections.
ICT infrastructure in Kenya has seen significant improvements during recent years. Access
to and use of mobile phones is high in Kenya, particularly when compared with other
African countries (Jumia, 2019). According to Internet World Stats (2021), internet
penetration (internet users as a proportion of total population) in Kenya is currently at
85.2%, compared to 43% in Africa as a whole. However, there is significant disparity in
internet access for rural Kenyans. Broadband access and speeds are both significantly
lower for rural Kenyans (World Bank, 2019). The government must invest in expanding
rural ICT infrastructure to improve internet access and enable greater communication
between rural and urban innovators.

•

•

UNDP Accelerator Labs Initiatives:

• UNDP Accelerator Labs should assist the government in the cataloguing of grassroots
innovations and serve as a point of contact between innovators and government officials.
This will help to paint a picture of the grassroots innovation scope in Kenya and will enable
the government to provide better financial support to these innovators.

• The Kenyan government has had difficulties in spreading awareness of new initiatives
geared towards innovators and start-ups. UNDP Accelerator Labs can and should leverage
their network to publicize and keep track of government programs or initiatives that may
be useful to local innovators. Creating an online message board or email list could be useful
in this regard.

Ghana is home to a thriving innovation scene. The country is equipped with research

institutions, hubs and initiatives to support entrepreneurs and women. The country is also

riding the ICT revolution wave - however, inadequate infrastructure, access to capital, and

bureaucracy continue to pose challenges for GIs.

Strengths and Opportunities

• Ghana and the broader Sub-Saharan region is experiencing a new-ICT revolution driven by
increasing access to mobile devices. More opportunities to create timely monitoring
systems that support the detection of emerging issues in the field have emerged and have
enabled extension organisations or value chain actors to respond to issues promptly.
• To facilitate the development of e-commerce and the digital economy, the government has
recognised the importance of setting up a National ID. In 2003, the National Identification
Authority (NIA) was established to facilitate the implementation of a national identification
system in the country, and as of 2017, the new national ID card (Ghana card) has been
launched. The creation of the Ghana card gives citizens the right to access public services.
It promotes better access to online transactions, financial and other services, and
innovative applications to improve service delivery in the priority areas of health,
education, judicial, and parliamentary services.

• The government of Ghana has demonstrated commitment towards building infrastructure
and the digital divide gap. Through its agency, Ghana Investment Fund for Electronic
Communications (GIFEC), the government has initiated a Rural Telephony Project to ensure
that underserved communities have access to communication needs. This project aimed
to reduce the cost of deployment of infrastructures borne by operators by providing tower
infrastructure on which operators can collocate within these areas.

• More recently, Ghana has leveraged frontier technologies to improve people's lives and
protect the planet. The range and use of technologies have been extensive, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic: AI and big data for screening patients, monitoring the
outbreaks, tracking and tracing cases of the disease, and using drones for delivering
medical supplies to remote communities.

Weaknesses and Threats

• High prices constrain individuals' internet use: more than half of households limit their
internet use because of the cost. Moreover, even before they connect, many people still
struggle to buy a device because they cannot afford one.

• There is a general shortage of skills to use frontier technologies. The use of such platforms
requires literacy and numeracy skills and an aptitude for learning by doing. The
government needs to consider how people can acquire the necessary skills and
competencies to adopt frontier technologies into existing production bases. Inclusive and
accessible education and on-the-job training programs are imperative as more services

move online, and such opportunities should involve women, noticing the critical
contributions they can make.

• To support an inclusive innovation system, the government can respond to alternative
technological change models by facilitating funding, linking these models to existing R&D
institutions, and increasing their visibility through international networking.

Governmental Policies and Initiatives:

•

Intellectual property (IP) laws in Ghana are not fully developed and not widely understood.
Creating clear and comprehensible IP laws/regulations is important for small-scale
innovators looking to enter the formal marketplace. There is a very large informal economy
in Ghana, so IP registration will need to be simple and quick in order to incentivize
innovators in the informal marketplace to transition their innovations to the formal
marketplace. Simplifying and enforcing IP laws can help to encourage formal sector growth
in this circumstance.

• As information and communication technology (ICT) becomes more widespread in Ghana,
it is more important that Ghanian citizens possess the skills required to utilize these
technologies to their full potential. Implementing technological skills-based primary
education would certainly help in this regard. Financing the incorporation of ICT into the
classroom may also prove beneficial.
In conjunction with implementing ICT skills-based education, subsidising internet costs can
be a valuable tool in ensuring greater access to and engagement with the internet. This will
also enable individuals to utilize online methods of skill learning. Working to expand mobile
phone access, particularly in rural regions, can also be influential in spreading new skills
and connecting communities.

•

• Connecting communities with nearby institutions of higher education and research can
also serve to perpetuate a greater sense of interest in ICT skills and studies. Initiatives such
as these will also benefit research centers/universities, as they will gain new perspectives
and expand their networks.

UNDP Accelerator Labs Initiatives:

•

In addition to cataloging grassroots innovations, the Ghana Accelerator Lab can create and
support regional hackathons or innovation challenges. These events would be particularly
impactful in areas where ICT access is relatively new. This would encourage cooperative
learning, innovative thinking, and team building.

• Getting the government involved in these events could enable the Accelerator Lab team to
offer better prizes/incentives. For example, university scholarships, innovation funding, or
government incubation.

Bosnia has a different set of problems than the majority of the developing countries as they

are an upper-middle-income country with high levels of education and public services not

that different from the developed world. Nevertheless, they have many citizens leaving in

search for opportunities abroad and innovation remains underdeveloped specially in terms

of physical goods. As a country with a unique range of social issues and fragmentation, GI

and its social movement nature offers them an opportunity to provide sustainable solutions

targeting local problems and a unifying force for development.

Strengths and Opportunities

•

•

Institutions and public services in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) seem to be well
developed, making it easier for residents to start any venture and grow it. In that sense,
B&H holds an great potential for innovation and entrepreneurship to be unleashed.
In comparison with other developing countries, education and ICTs operate over a higher
quality and have more coverage, positioning B&H in a privileged status among the
developed world where the residents of the country have the tools and the capacities to
take their country to the next level. Furthermore, their proximity to the EU and being part
of the Schengen area offers B&H an opportunity for scaling their ventures as they can easily
offer goods and services to the European market.

Weaknesses and Threats

• The process of starting a business or formalising an existing one constitutes a challenge to
surpass in the local ecosystem, as entrepreneurs might be discouraged from starting a new
venture if the process is not easy enough or if it doesn't offer them significant advantages.
• The government infrastructure to support GI is still underdeveloped and fragmented.
Overall, the country seems to lack a systemic approach to encourage GI and foster an
ecosystem where these kinds of innovations can emerge and flourish.

• The media support for entrepreneurship and grassroots innovators remains insufficient to
unleash its potential. In order to further encourage GI, the society should get to know the
emerging projects so they endorse the work of local entrepreneurs. Overall, it seems that
society remains fragmented and media can play a relevant role in fostering a more
integrative, local and innovative narrative.

• The country faces a process of migration of high-skilled individuals to the EU. As this
process continues, the national capacity of absorbing new knowledge is diminished,
further reducing the national capacity to innovate. A focus on grassroots innovation could
promote residents to stay and start local ventures that address local problems or even
scale to address problems encountered in countries similar to B&H.

Appendices

75

Governmental Policies and Initiatives:

•

Like other former communist countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina faces the problem of
privatizing formerly publicly owned companies. This process is not a simple one, but it is
imperative that this is done, not only to shift economic responsibility and ownership into
the hands of the citizens, but also as a means of encouraging more entrepreneurship and
innovation. Privately held companies will be more diverse and offer differing business
practices and new sources of R&D.

• Entrepreneurial spirit is something that is not necessarily ingrained in the mindset of
citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is, again, mostly due to the country’s communist
history. It is necessary to promote entrepreneurial activities in order to engage a new wave
of innovators. This can be done by instituting innovation-based educational programs and
competitions in primary and secondary schools, funding innovation festivals, and
highlighting success stories in government sponsored media forums. While it is not
possible to require media outlets to report on matters pertaining to innovation, creating
engaging events and stories can inspire these outlets to begin picking up stories relating to
grassroots innovation.

• To combat the migration of high-skilled and educated citizens, the government can offer
financial incentives to qualified university or secondary school graduates who display
excellence in the academic field. Offering entrepreneurial grants for gifted students in
secondary school or university can encourage these students to stay and work in their
home country, rather than leave to pursue jobs elsewhere. Starting small, this program
could take the form of a single incubator, bringing together bright minds from across the
country. Alternatively, this initiative could simply provide grants that enable students to
begin their own independent venture.

UNDP Accelerator Labs Initiatives:

• The Accelerator Labs team could play a significant role in building links between institutions
of higher education and grassroots innovators/entrepreneurs. Universities may be
interested in working with an international organization with a better grasp on the
innovation landscape.

• Additionally, as is the case in nearly every Accelerator Lab, documenting innovations and

highlighting success stories can help garner government and media attention.

10.5 Appendix 5 – Framework Construction Insights from Academics

For the purpose of establishing our framework, we interviewed several academics in the

area of innovation. These interviews helped us to understand the practical view of

innovation before extracting the information to form the framework. In summary, the

academics gave us the idea of innovation network and the perspective to see innovation

from system-level.

10.5.1 Marco Antonio Sardillo

Marco works with UNDP and the Philippines government in developing the Next

Generation Cities project. One of the projects involves helping the government provide

cash transfers to people in cities with no access to bank accounts. Before running any big

systemic transformation or innovation, UNDP and the team would run little experiments.

Innovation can be measured in many possible ways, such as analysing the number of

patents filed or the amount of investment in research & development activities. However,

before measuring innovation, it is essential to have a certain definition of innovation to

focus on.

10.5.2 Adrian Smith

The background of Grassroots Innovation Movement (2017) was the attempt to analyse

the local environmental and social development initiatives in different societies. People

that are involved in those initiatives, however, were refused to be considered as

innovators due to the way innovation is construed. Innovation in a narrow term is closely

related to capitalism, Silicon Valley, and technological-based ideas. Thus, it is vital to look

broader when studying about innovation.

Grassroots innovation pursues different pathways compared to industrial innovation. It

is marginalised by the focus of industrial innovation where the capital and resources are

accumulated. If one is trying to find an intersection between the two, it would be difficult

to find any overlap unless one is looking at how industrial innovation or technological

innovation is incorporated to carve out people’s livelihood.

In his book, he analyses grassroots innovation through a simple framework consisting of

context, framings, spaces and strategies, and pathways. The framework is in-depth

enough to explain the background and process in each initiative yet broad enough to look

for similarities among them. It is not an easy task to establish a framework that bridges

industrial and grassroots

innovation due to

its different drivers, models, and

determinants. Especially, in the case of grassroots innovation, the goal is not always

scaling up.

There are different stakeholders that play a role in promoting grassroots innovation.

Government, for instance, can play a role not only by scaling the innovation up but also

Appendices

87

by providing education and training for the labour markets. Another important role is the

intermediation. As illustrated in the figure below, intermediary organisation is in the

global level. Intermediary bodies can identify and learn the diverse initiatives through

framing and coordinating the grassroots innovation. Furthermore, intermediary bodies

can relocate the resources and scale up or scale wide the initiatives which eventually

would drive a sustainable activity. What Adrian suggested as the most important role of

the intermediary body is that it codifies and documents the innovations and knowledge

of the people involved in successes and failures. Such knowledge can then be learnt by

other local innovations across the network.

Lastly, built on the fact that innovation does not always gain success, it is important to

attentively learn the motivation and aspiration of the people who are involved in

grassroots innovation projects and at some point, dropping the preconceived notions of

success and learn to think about new metrics to measure the achievement.

10.5.3 Eric von Hippel

Innovation can be studied at individual level as well as system level. Taking industrial

revolution as an example, it was the phenomena where thousands of little adaptations

and innovations work together. It is a similar phenomena with innovation in developing

countries. Developing countries are unlikely to produce the next biggest innovation but it

has a hefty number of small innovations.

In the light of determinants of innovation, Eric argued that creating facilities for people to

gather and innovate together, physically or digitally, would significantly contribute to

promoting innovation. In addition to it, he argues that technology has an important role

due to helping innovation to spread out. Training is also something that could accelerate

the process of innovation. In contrast to the literature of innovation, Eric does not think

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

88

intellectual property rights (IPR) affect the emergence of innovation. Innovators would

innovate regardless if an IPR is implemented.

If one wants to understand what promotes innovation, one should not only look into

developing countries but also developed or advanced countries. There are lessons that

could be learned and later offered to developing countries and analysed if it works.

Another way to understand the innovation is to look into one country and see what works

and what does not work. Therefore, it is feasible to compare it with similar context.

Looking deeper into user-innovation, an idea developed by Eric von Hippel in many of his

published works, he argued that users know what they need and therefore innovate,

regardless of the existence of a market. If the innovation is a good innovation, others pick

it up. It signals the company or the market to provide such good or service. Until they are

sure that there is a market there, manufacturers would only observe. Producers usually

steal the innovator’s idea. However, many producers recently have learnt to work with

users and incentivise their ideas.

For the purpose of identifying any innovative projects, the government could surf on the

Internet and see what the citizens do to solve a particular problem. Good innovation

stands out by having the largest frequency of searches. As time goes by, artificial

intelligence technology is getting cheaper and more accessible. This should help the

government to identify the initiatives.

In regard to the barriers to innovation, Eric von Hippel argued that companies that are

not open to user-innovation would be the first. Communities, therefore, should create

their own companies. Any effort to reduce the cost of starting a company should foster

innovation. At times, companies might not be needed anymore. The innovation further

can be accessed through a digitally stored information platform.

10.6 Appendix 6 - Targeted Innovation Policy Based on Context

This section will analyse Kazakhstan, China, Brazil and Rwanda’s approach to innovation

policy. We provide this information is to highlight the government's role in innovation

systems and explain why these countries have historically pursued linear innovation

policy paths.

10.6.1 Kazakhstan

The demise of the former Soviet bloc led to a severe contraction in output and economic

instability in Kazakhstan. However, over the last two decades, Kazakhstan's economic

performance expanded rapidly, and today it is one of Central Asia’s fastest-growing

countries. Kazakhstan's economic growth is based mainly on oil and gas revenues, which

accounts for 35% of its GDP and 75% of its exports (Nordea Trade Portal, 2021). The

innovation sector, however, has struggled to keep pace. According to the OECD (2017),

the Kazakhstani level of innovative activity stands at 3.9%. It is lower than former Soviet

countries, like Belarus (19.6%) and Russia (9.9%), and significantly lower than OECD

countries, like Germany (70%), Canada (65%) and Belgium (60%). A key issue is the weak

domestic demand for innovation, reflected in Kazakhstan’s structural characteristics and

extractive industries' dominance. Kazakhstan's science and technology (S&T) industry is

also scattered, dominated by research institutes that are mainly inherited from the past

and funded primarily by the state. Several Kazakh strategy and policy documents highlight

the importance of university-industry partnerships (UIPs) to promote innovative activity.

Yet, UIPs remain inherently weak and limited to employers' involvement in teaching, the

provision of internships for students, and technical consultancies (Jonbekova et al., 2020).

Facilitating market entry for entrepreneurs and simplifying extensive legislation and

regulation are prerequisites for innovation to thrive in an economy. Indeed, Kazakhstan

has achieved some progress in improving the regulatory environment for private

business, reflected through several improved international ratings. Additionally, several

innovation initiatives like the Fostering Productive Innovation Project (FPIP) - a joint effort

by the Kazakh Ministry of Education and Science and the World Bank - seek to unleash the

country’s innovation potential continuously. Overall, in Kazakhstan, while there has been

significant improvement in creating a friendlier business environment, particularly on the

regulatory and tax front and the quality of infrastructure provision, there is greater room

for improvement in creating conditions for thriving entrepreneurial activity.

10.6.2 China

China's investment in and development of its S&T sectors has received worldwide

attention. Since the 1970s, the Chinese government has issued several S&T policies to

build an innovation-focused nation. Broadly, they include reforms to the S&T system,

increased investment in research and development (R&D), the establishment of high-tech

parks to boost venture capital investment, and improved intellectual property rights (IPRs)

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

90

(Liu et al., 2011). More recently, the Chinese government allocated more than US$ 77.82

billion in science and technology in 2011, with nearly a 20% annual growth rate since 2005,

reflecting its continued commitment to enabling innovation (Fu, 2015). Separately, the

state also introduced industrial policies that support the development of high-tech

sectors to strengthen industrial competitiveness, encourage more investment in

innovation, and promote high-tech trade (Schaaper, 2009).

Overall, the Chinese government has played an important role in the national innovation

system, developing and implementing a comprehensive set of institutions and incentives.

It has created an open market environment and innovation atmosphere that encourages

external knowledge sourcing and acquisition and the commercialisation of scientific

research discoveries and inventions. Innovation-related financial, tax, industry, trade, and

S&T policies serve as effective linkages that connect all the relevant players at various

national innovation system levels. China's key challenges, however, lie in a robust

intellectual property rights regime to protect and facilitate knowledge sharing. There is

also greater scope for the government to design and implement appropriate structural

policies, including competition and regulations, public infrastructure, S&T base and talent

education policies.

10.6.3 Brazil

Brazil's innovation ecosystem historically has had a strong public sector influence. R&D

and the provision of technology traditionally lie in the hands of public institutions. This

practice stems from the idea that the government is responsible for providing the

business sector with (modern) technologies and dates back to import substitution

industrialization (ISI) during the military dictatorship between 1964-1985 and continues

to this day. For many years, the state viewed technology and science policy as separate

from each other. The provision of technology for domestic enterprises is a priority and

reflected in several national development strategies. However, policymakers rarely

address the promotion of entrepreneurial innovation. It was not until the early 2000s

when Brazil emphasized strong industrial policies, focusing on innovation and systemic

processes. The government stimulated domestic companies' increased competition by

opening markets to trade, pushing for economic reform, and encouraging privatization. It

has also promoted innovation throughout the economy by legislating (US–style)

innovation laws that protect property rights. Sectoral funds to financing tools for research,

development and innovation projects have also emerged. Additionally, Brazil also

established two government agencies - the Brazilian Agency for Industrial Development

(ABDI) and the Center for Management and Strategic Studies (CGEE), which stand

testimony to the country's commitment towards promoting innovation policies. However,

public institutions' inefficiencies and a complex bureaucracy that complicate coordinating

initiatives for building an innovation-based economy suggest that there are significant

Appendices

91

path dependencies from the military dictatorship's actions that continue to affect some

of the main features of Brazil’s national innovation strategy.

10.6.4 Rwanda

Rwanda has achieved significant economic, infrastructural and social development in

recent years (UNCTAD, 2017). The government, in several policies and strategies,

acknowledges that the country's socio-economic development is vulnerable and that

building a national scientific, technological, and innovative capacity to sustain the

achievements made thus far is critical to advancing the country's socio-economic

development. Rwanda’s national development vision, known as Vison 2020, is testimony

to the state’s commitment to innovation. It highlights that becoming a knowledge-based

economy is a key development priority. Efforts made by the government to liberalise the

telecom sector and develop ICT infrastructure, including the build-up of a fibre-optic

network over the entire territory, have been instrumental in fostering innovative

activity. In 2012, the government also established the National Commission of Science

and Technology (NCST) to advise on policies, legislation and regulation in science,

technology, research and innovation, and monitor the implementation of such policies

and legislation. The Smart Rwanda Master Plan 2020 (SRMP), launched in 2015, also

articulated the overarching goal of increasing the private sector's involvement, narrowing

the digital divide, improving e-government, and engaging the youth in a digital society.

Despite these various efforts, implementation is inadequate. R&D, while mainly done

through public organizations,

lack

commercialization of research output. The low level of R&D activity in firms has been

challenging to document and empirically assess. Moreover, funds for innovation and

research is largely dependent on the government budget, and inadequate intellectual

property awareness, human resource capacity, and finance access continue to be

impediments to Rwanda's overarching innovation agenda.

10.7 Appendix 7 – Term of Reference

UNDP Accelerator Labs
Advancing innovation policy in developing countries: Pathways to scale for the UNDP
Accelerator Labs Network
Capstone Terms of Reference (ToR) 2020/21

1. Project objective/s

The objective of this project is to establish a greater understanding of the types of policies that
governments of developing countries can use to promote innovation nationally. The project will
identify trends in recent-historical efforts to promote innovation and apply these learnings to current
policy environments. This is a highly practical Capstone that will challenge students to translate a
survey of a broad set of policy-relevant data and theoretical literature into real-time policy
recommendations. The results will be used by the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network – a network of 90
social innovation labs. The work is embedded in the United Nations Development Programme and
covers 114 countries.

2. Context/debate: why is this issue important?

Emergent disruptive influences such as climate shocks, soaring inequality, and disease pandemics
challenge the international development community’s ability to deliver on its work of keeping people
safe, healthy, and out of poverty. In the context of compound global crises, increasing complexity, and
an accelerated pace of change, UNDP sees innovation as critical for developing and delivering solutions
to the world’s most pressing challenges.

While innovation has been a priority of the international development community for several years,
we see a unique window of opportunity now as many governments have realized that citizen-driven
solutions are playing an important role in the fight against COVID-19.

From UNDP’s perspective, social innovation is a way to promote open governance, citizen participation
and greater inclusiveness. UNDP has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to promote innovation
through initiatives such as the Accelerator Labs and Innovation Facility and we see government
adoption of innovation policy as a key ingredient to create the right incentives for bottom-up
innovation as part of sustainable development.

UNDP’s innovation work thus far has focused on partnering with governments to demonstrate
practical prototypes to model the power of real time data, new approaches such as foresight and
behavioural science, and other innovation methods. While UNDP often works on development policy
as related to decentralization, rule of law and access to justice and social protection, we need a broader
evidence base to advise on innovation policy in our partner countries.

About UNDP & the Accelerator Labs Network

UNDP works in 170 countries and territories, helping to achieve the eradication of poverty and the
reduction of inequalities and exclusion while protecting the planet. We help countries to develop

policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience in order to
sustain development results.

UNDP set up 60 Accelerator Labs last year to chart the course for a radically different way to scale
positive change in the world. The labs tackle the gap between how we tackle global challenges and an
accelerated pace of change. The Labs identify, test, and pilot innovative solutions as part of a portfolio
of complex challenges and form a global network that rapidly translates insights into action at scale.
After a successful first year, the network is expanding to 90 Labs in 114 countries (beginning September
2020).

This is a large-scale investment in a global public sector organization. UNDP invested $100M in the
Accelerator Labs as a bet on doing development differently, doubling down on social innovation as a
way to make breakthroughs on global challenges. As the Labs are integrated in the majority of UNDP
Country Offices around the world, this investment is also intended to mainstream innovation into
development work.

The UNDP Accelerator Labs focuses on three areas of innovation:

1) Grassroots innovation: building on the knowledge and ingenuity of women and men living in poverty
and facing the effects of climate change
2) Collective Intelligence: Tapping into the power of people, data and machines to get smarter together
3) Portfolios of experiments: To intervene in complex systems, multiple safe-fail interventions are
needed.

3. Research Question

The central research question is: What polices can governments adopt to promote innovation
nationally? Inquiry should focus on both policy instruments and surrounding governance models (or
policy environments).

4. Key activities to answer the question

Following an introductory literature review, refinement of the research question, and definition of key
variables (e.g. innovation, ecosystem), researchers may structure this project in 2 stages.

(1) Historical review of innovation policy

This research will take the form of case studies of the types of policies that have promoted innovation
in low-and middle-income countries in the last 15 years. In cases where there exist time series data
that demonstrates impact, examples can also be drawn from OECD countries.

Researchers may consider the following sub-questions:

• What policy measures/inputs promote innovation?
• What changes can governments make to governance models to promote innovation?
• What challenges do governments encounter in pursuing policies to promote innovation?
• What are the central drivers (economic, political, social, domestic, international) of

government’s decision to pursue innovation-promotion policies?
• What was the outcome of government efforts to promote innovation?

LSE Capstone Report for UNDP Accelerator Labs

94

Research will be conducted through primary documents (government policy documents, legislation,
budgets, etc.) and secondary literatures. Analysis should identify and compare lessons learned across
the cases.

(2) Analysis of current policy environment of countries where UNDP Accelerator Labs operates
This analysis will concentrate on the real-time locations where UNDP Accelerator Labs currently
operates. Researchers will select between 6 and 12 countries for investigation.

This analysis should include:

• Scoping of policy environment relevant to innovation
• Analysis of opportunities for and obstacles to the introduction or strengthening of policies that

encourage innovation

• A 1-page brief with policy recommendations for each country. These will be part of the final

15,000-word report

• As part of the final report, the analysis should provide a toolkit, or a set of practical, context-
specific options that UNDP can use to advise governments on local innovation ecosystems

The two stages do not need to be connected (i.e. referred to the same set of countries) but, to evaluate
the contribution made by Accelerator Labs, it could be useful to make the connection for at least some
countries in the selected sample.

5. Scope

Parameters for this study are as follows:

• Research and analysis will concentrate on the types of policies governments adopt with the

goal of promoting innovation nationally

• Stage 1: Historical case studies should be drawn from the last 15 years from low- and middle-
income countries; in cases where there time series data that demonstrates impact, examples
can also be drawn from OECD countries.

• Stage 2: Case studies of UNDP Accelerator Lab countries: in consultation with UNDP, choose
12 from list of 114 countries, including at least 5 from Africa and one from each other UNDP
region.

Researchers may consider the following variables and questions when investigating policies relevant
to innovation:

• Structural institutions such as

o Regulatory frameworks
o Tax policy
o Procurement rules
o
Intellectual Property laws
o Data Privacy Frameworks
o AI strategies
o

Innovation zones

• Associated government practices related to

o Spending (R&D, education, and/or other areas)

Appendices

o Financial regulations and incentives, such as promotion of venture capital or

investment in SMEs or start-ups
o Enterprise and property ownership
o Entrepreneurship
o Ethics of technology

• What forms of innovation policy work best in developing economies, particularly those that

have a high degree of informality in the economy?

• How is the effectiveness of innovation policy assessed? What proxies are used?
•

Is there evidence of innovation policy that reduces income and other inequalities? What policy
designs work best?

• What are the instruments governments can use (financial, procurement, IP, etc.) that would
fit into the existing regulatory/policy framework to acknowledge and encourage citizen-driven
innovation?

o How can governments promote “inclusive innovation” in the context of national

policymaking?

o What is the significance of “citizen innovation”? How can governments promote, or at
least not discourage, this type of innovation, regardless of whether it results in
commercial scaling?

o How does a government support bottom-up innovation?
o What actions should governments specifically not do?

6. Sources

This project will entail the use of government data (legislation, policy documents, budgets,
announcements), statistics/macroeconomic indicators, and secondary academic literature (journal
articles, books, policy briefs, working papers, etc.).

Data on patents, taxation, rates of lead user innovation will be explored to understand the impact of
innovation policy.

7. Availability of data

UNDP offices in country will support data access where needed. Researchers should consider the
availability of data during case selection.
