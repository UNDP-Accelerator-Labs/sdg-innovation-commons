RiceFERT is a computerised software and decision support system, that is a site-specific fertiliser management for rice production in Malaysia. It provides location-specific fertiliser recommendations according to a soil test-target yield approach. The recommendation on fertiliser rates is based on four essential components: indigenous soil nutrient status, soil fertility status, crop nutrient requirements, and target rice yield. The variety of rice used will also affect the recommendation.   There is a critical need to recalibrate from using the current blanket rate of fertiliser, which has been in use for more than two decades in rice cultivation, towards a precision fertilizer management system. This is important to ensure that rice crops and soil receive the exact amount of nutrients to achieve optimal health and productivity. This technology recommends more efficient amounts of fertiliser, typically 10% to 15% less than the current blanket rate used in rice granaries. Further research is being conducted in larger scale rice granaries so that this technology can be adapted to the government fertiliser subsidy scheme.
