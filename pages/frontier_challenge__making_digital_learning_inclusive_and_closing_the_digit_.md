## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Frontier challenge: making digital learning inclusive and closing the digital divide   There are my key insights on both the frontier challenge and partnership with a startup:  1. Technologies are great instruments to accelerate our learning, but these can also exacerbate the learning gap resulted from the digital divide. Students in urban communities are benefiting from online learning, while students in rural communities are falling behind.    2. There are less girls & women in IT, partially it is because we lack of gender sensitive educational platforms and communications. In this regards, AccLab with the UNDP communication team work hard to help BalaTech to rebrand its marketing strategy (eg. making girls as the role models in the promo-video), and revise learning contents (including communication language) on the platform to make it gender inclusive. At present, we have 45% of users registered are girls (!)   3. Startups need more mentorship and partnership building supports than the financial grant support in scaling impact.  Thanks to Digital x Scale Accelerator program that provides mentorship supports, I have been supporting our startup in both product, marketing, and partnership building. The CEO of BalaTech commented that "the biggest asset of this program is to learn from you"! I realize, that we could have offered much more valuable resources than financial ones. Acclab UNDP plays as an integrator role to leverage diverse partnership networks to scale up development impact. We engaged UNDP country offices, regional office, UNESCO, UNICEF, Ministry of Education, and partners in other countries.  4.  Startups are not like corporate partners. They need more open and intensive communication. And we need to catch up their SPEED. It is challenging for UNDP because of our operational procedure. But at least, having an open dialogue to regularly share even small progress can be very helpful. 5. We need work on the institutional readiness when we want to bring diverse partners - to think of the engagement modality in advance. It took me about 6 months to identify a proper engagement modality after a long consultation with the regional and HQ legal offices. We were first advised to use the "Innovation Challenge" modality by the Regional Office, later HQ suggested to use the procurement modality "Contract for Goods and Services". There are still many questions on intellectual property between UNDP & Startups remain unanswered.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Certainly!  First, it took me 6 months to identify which modality agreement to use in the partnership with a startup. UNDP Regional Office suggested the program modality "Innovation Challenge". Later, HQ legal office suggested to use the procurement modality "Contract for Goods and Services". Country Offices don't have much experience engaging startups. We were lost in consultation.  Second, I had been calling for the attention on "Intellectual Property". I have looked through almost all UNDP POPP policy papers. If a startup takes grant money from the UNDP, their IP belongs to the UNDP. This works in cases of a startup developing some solutions based on the request of the UNDP, but it does not work for a startup SCALING established solutions with UNDP support. There are much more learning on IP - find our Weekly Reflection and Learning Meeting (Watch 'AccLabs learning session_Innovation-styles Challenges' | Microsoft Stream) Third, in Digital x I am expected to help the local startup to scale out to the CIS region, but I am reminded that my mandate at the CO is only within the country. I still wonder how UNDP scale innovations across border, if our mandates are restricted to the country.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The target audience is young children and youth, thus we chose "engagement with local youth". We conducted focus groups and informational interviews to explore the user journeys. This was needed so that we could have better UX and user's experience. To reach a massive scale of children in the region, we actively use social media, social network/social media data to make target promotion and tracking. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

BalaTech is an established product with MVP. We are helping them to test their hypotheses to make it more engaging through gamification & UX design. The target clients are young children at schools. We conducted behavioral insights and human centered design with youngsters to ensure the product is aligned to their learning behaviors.  During the Digital x mentorship, we also held a small hackathons with our Mentor's team to generate more innovative solutions to enhance the learning experience of BalaTech. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Educational organizations, who can promote BalaTech to their learning networks. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

All public and private schools, who can engage their students to learn programming and to participate at BalaTech Olympiad.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Educational businesses, who can promote BalaTech to their learning networks. We have successfully secured strategic partnerships with BTS Education (Kazakhstan), Business Incubator (Tajikistan), IT Park (Uzbekistan), and Education Era (Ukraine)

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Education and Science of the Kyrgyz Republic, who inform all public schools about the BalaTech Olympiad.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Business partners and media outlets from over 10 countries in the region. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We are conducting active communication campaign to promote BalaTech International Programming Olympiad (taken place on February 19, 2022). UNDP Regional Office, Country Offices, Chief Digital Office, Global AccLabs, UN-TV have shared our Olympiad. We also have UNESCO and UNICEF in informational support. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The unique competitive advantages of BalaTech (www.balatech.org) is teaching programming through GAMIFICATION. Moreover, we have enhanced the user's experience with better UX design. We conducted a couple of focus groups with school kids (users), with mentors, with business partners, so that we can apply human-centric approach to design the product that really meets the needs of users.
