## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The experiment was trying to test two different designs by the public who participated in the UR:BIN Design Challenge. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If waste bin is designed effectively, then we will see increase participation of citizen in waste separation at source.  If there is a national standard of waste bin, then we will see 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The two designs of waste bin were chosen by selection committee based on criterias including: usefulness, accessibility, feasibility, creativity, innovation. The two bin designs were then sent to three different locations (different provinces) to be put together at public place where most citizen are gathering.  They are put closed by the existing bins available in the location. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Each day an observer in each location spends an hour observing and note taking how citizen and waste collectors use the bins, which bin is used the most, and what type of waste fills up the compartment of the bin the most, and how effective in term of waste separation each bin is. 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Each day an observer in each location spends an hour observing and note taking how citizen and waste collectors use the bins, which bin is used the most, and what type of waste fills up the compartment of the bin the most, and how effective in term of waste separation each bin is. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

Three weeks

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

A lot of time allocation from Solutions Mapper in designing the plan and monitoring the experimentation. 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven. Proper design including its physical looks and functions did provide incentives such attractiveness and convenience to users including citizens and waste collectors.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Experiment more and using a bigger sample size and more in-depth study of behavioral insights of the users - citizen. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

8 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

8000USD AccLab Core Budget

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The finding of this experiment is shared with Ministry of Environment and Combatting Marine Plastics (Japan funded Project) to support their project output in delivering innovative waste bins at selected target provinces/cities. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, to use the findings to support developing national standard for waste bins, with Ministry of Environment.
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Waster bin has been an important integral part of waste management system but being neglected by most of the stakeholders and authorities. The national standard for waste bin is yet developed, even mainstreaming the use of color-coding to guide citizen to separate waste accordingly is minimal.  

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

COVID-19 delays the implementation and monitoring activities including the essence and substance of the experiment. We planned to do close and deep interview with citizen and waste collectors but failed to so given the concern of getting affected or spreading COVID-19 virus. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

This experiment was designed in line with the formulation of Combatting Marine Plastic project which one of its output is to provide innovative waste bins to certain provinces and cities.  

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Development partner and waste management authority who are working or investing in designing waste management system.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Test and iterate as many times as possible

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. Involve citizen in designing the solutions for citizen can be applied to any SDGs. Identify a clear objective, create a space for citizen although they are not the expert in the area, equip citizen with subject matter knowledge, and empower them to co-create solutions. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This experiment was conducted by Solutions Mapper alone. The process of sense and explore include ethnographic study with waste collectors and citizens through random interview, desk research on existing waste management system and waste bin as a physical infrastructure, and technical review with engineers and Solid Waste Department, Ministry of Environment.

> What surprised you?

Experiment in action prevails new insights that aren't always on my radar/ thoughts.
