ABOUT US

The Gospel Response to the Vulnerable (GRV) is a Christian Non-Governmental Organization formed to minister to both spiritual and physical needs of the vulnerable.

 

The great commission and needs faced by the vulnerable in Zambia that have necessitated the formation of GRV are as follows: 

The need for true gospel and discipleship in Zambia 

The increase of vulnerable persons in our nation (orphaned children and youths, widows, the old aged, and the different-abled people).

Inadequate educational and social facilities for vulnerable persons.

Incapability of families to adequately support the vulnerable.
Wrong traditional practices 

The increase of social vices that have aggravated vulnerability (E.g. Alcohol and substance abuse, illicit sex, harmful traditional and domestic practices, imprudent lifestyle etc.). 

Thus GRV was established on 26th May of 2018, and incorporated with the Ministry of Community Development and Social Services on 26th September 2019.

The vision for GRV

As of May 2019, there are 10 provinces, 116 districts, 156 constituencies, and 1,624 wards in Zambia. 

Provinces

In every province GRV shall have one university for the best performing school leavers of the province. The curriculum for the universities shall include the biblical aspect in every course the child choses. Depending on special occasions the students can be imported from a different country or provinces.  

GRV will have big hotel and shopping mall in the provincial headquarters and the marketing Centre for GRV products  

Districts 

GRV will get land in all the districts of Zambian of about 200 to 1000 hectors in each province from the chiefs in areas that are fertile and have a river near by. This land shall be used for the following purposes in order to develop free education for the vulnerable and food. 

As a fundraising venture for the vulnerable in that district and pay the workers.

Develop school buildings, colleges, workers houses, aged house quarters, hospital and a seminary for the district.

In order to have GRV work properly in that a district we also in addition to the above mentioned develop housing quarter. Have 5 to 20 hectors in each district Centre and build between 100 to 1000 houses for rentals and also at a very fair rental fee. Then build a shopping more in each district and GRV Big bus in each District. If all this 

 

Apart from this also GRV must buy machinery equipment’s to help in alleviation in that district.

E.G:

Four Trucks per district for road maintenance to easy the transportations of goods of the people in that district 

Stone crushing Machines 

Four Trucks per district for transportation of goods 

Four Truck containers 

Factories for drink marking, water, etc. 

Ward level 

The organization may start up school in areas where they’re no schools or may just help vulnerable pupils from there in supporting them with school necessities.  

GRV may develop certain projects in the area or clubs depending on the researches conducted in that area on how to take the gospel there and alleviant the poverty levels

GRV shall work together with existing churches in the areas in the expansion of God through GRV missionaries that shall include (missionary teachers, healthy workers, pastors, etc.). 

GRV shall involve the community and chiefs around Zambia in many projects where need may be felt for them to participate.

 

I believe if we can do this in every province, district and ward we can achieve in helping the vulnerable without depending on the donors.
