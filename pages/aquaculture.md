> Brief description of the innovation

These are 2 10x20meter concrete Ponds they can harvest around 8 tons of Nilotica in 5 months. This is on my farm in ndola. Chichele forest.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will generate income for me because there is a huge demand for fish in zambia and I will turn into a manufacturer so to speak... for others, my innovation will be of benefit because it will provide a food source and create jobs for the local villagers nearby. 
My target market place is zambia. 
The challenge prize will help me grow because It will help me set up a fish hatchery so I can produce fingerlings for restocking and for sale to fish farmer around.
My innovation doesn't produce chemical waste to the environment. Its natural. And its a recirculation system and will save water.

> Technical Feasibility

I have build two 10x20 meter concrete Ponds. Piping channels around the Ponds and through a biofilter for water recirculation. The biofilter let's agae reproduce in it instead of in the Ponds. The agae then cleaned out and used as fertilizer...

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation will greatly help others around me because the fish is nearby and is very fresh. The fish industry has been in existence for centuries and I believe the current market will respond very well!
