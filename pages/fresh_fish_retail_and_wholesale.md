I buy fish from zamfresh @ 39.7 and sale it at a retail price of 52 per kg. I started with one outlet in rhodesprk and I have extended to Intercity where I have have a small capacity of 100 kg a week sales. I have they potential to grow my business . Right now my capacity is about a 1 tonne a week. But I am able to grow it to two tonnes a week.my business is registered and I am a zambian citizen.
