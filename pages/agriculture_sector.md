> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Agriculture industry is one of the key sectors so far in the southern region of Africa in terms of rapid economic development. Farming is also one of the easiest and cheapest sector with huge profitable income. I can do the best if given an opportunity to meet an empowerment. This can help in generating our economy and create jobs especially in rural areas. Of course the main challenge is when 
we experience bad rainfall due to climate change there for I would like to tackle in all levels of farming which includes as follows: fish farming, pottery, piggery and cattle farming to mention the few. This can help us in boosting our economy.

> Technical Feasibility

I would like to begin with 4 Hector's of land for maize and soya beans, 2 hector's each crop which can open doors for other farming programs such as pottery, piggery, cattle and fish farming after the harvest of maize and soya beans.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation can form a huge impact in empowering jobless people in rural areas especially those with passion and experience but lucking financial support in order to archive whatever they can in agriculture industry. My innovation can also encourage other farmers not to stick on one type of farming but also to venture in various farming activities in order to help the industry grow . It can also train many people to exercise crop-rotation throughout the year so that we generate massive production progressively.
