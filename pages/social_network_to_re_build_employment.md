> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

This group was created in April 2020, after COVID 19 struck Guatemala. A lot of lay-offs began already in a fragile employment environment in Guatemala. A group of individual ladies came up with the idea to publish any job offers as well as people in need of an employment what are their talents and skills in order to get connected and hopefully get a job.  The site has been active since then. Actually other small social ideas/responses have come up from this network "Ayúdame a Trabajar" and they are quite successful.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

Unemployment that has been harshened due to COVID 19 in Guatemala.  Provide the network for people in need (unemployed - demand) and the current (job - offer) supply. Some of them are in the formal market, many others in the informal field. However people seem to find at least certain options to apply to economic opportunities.
