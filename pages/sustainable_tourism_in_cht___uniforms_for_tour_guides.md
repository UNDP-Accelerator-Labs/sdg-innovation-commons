Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT.  To this end, one of the challenges identified during local consultations was that tourists often find it difficult to identify tour guides in crowded places. A potential solution for this could be  providing the tour guides specific uniforms such as the one pictured so that tourists can easily identify them in case they are lost.
