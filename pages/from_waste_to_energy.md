## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. The initiative contributes to a cleaner environment by ridding it of plastic waste 2. It allows the recovery of plastic waste 3. It makes fuel accessible and reduces market prices 4. The initiative requires support to improve the quality of the product 5. It is necessary to carry out an environmental study to identify the impacts and propose mitigation measures

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
No blog on this challenge yet.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. The equipment of pirolise is handmade 2. Insufficient equipment to clean up the fuel 3. Low production capacity 4. The need for an impact study of this initiative

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The gaps that these types of data were addressing are: 1. Insufficient data of local implementation of the solution 2. The behavioral data on the use of such energy source 3. The sensor data to be used in the subsequent experimentation phases will help in understanding the performance of the solution

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

It was necessary to co-create with the local innovators for us to make sure that the learnings are shared. The positive deviance method enabled us to identify the local innovator. The proof of concept and prototyping made it possible for us to co-create a prototype of the waste to energy solution.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Analysis of the energy (fuel) produced with the Laboratoire d'analyse en hydrocarbure: SGS Vivo Energy 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not applicable.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not applicable.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We partnered with Commune I Town Hall to identify the best spots for the test of the collection kiosks. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The laboratory was an unusual partner.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not applicable.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Not applicable.


> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
