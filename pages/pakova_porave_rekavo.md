> Description

The intention of the Farm is to maintain and optimize the family production system, aiming to care for the environment, without using chemicals in planting. The objective is to take advantage of the available resources, which is why everything is reused, either for raising pigs or in the garden, where animal waste (cow manure) is used as fertilizer.
