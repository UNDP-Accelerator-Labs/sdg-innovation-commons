## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Villagers possess a rich understanding of the issue at hand. They possess the local wisdom to tackle problems, but government processes lack the flexibility to effectively utilize this approach. Despite acknowledging the issue, rigid structures and laws limit the state's ability to adapt. Through the villagers' attempts to create prototypes, they have realized they have the ability to take initiative without relying solely on government support. This shift in perspective transforms them from passive recipients to active contributors. It should be noted that the problem area is located in mountainous terrain, making it distinct from flat areas and requiring unique solutions that cannot simply be imported from elsewhere.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Conflict between communities and government is the most challenging factor for collaboration. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Community perspectives and opinions are valuable and frequently overlooked in development processes. Despite being most affected by air pollution, they are often ignored. Direct engagement with the community allowed us to consider unique issues and perspectives not otherwise considered by the state. The state's top-down focus on law enforcement can be inflexible and does not always take into account local context."

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The approach is to guarantee community voices are heard and incorporated into the editing process, ensuring their perspectives on the problem are accurately represented.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Four communities in Chiang Rai

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

n/a

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

n/a

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

n/a

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

n/a

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We had a conversation with UNEP regarding their air pollution project in Chiang Mai. They have installed air quality meters in various government offices, but unfortunately, this solution is not applicable to the area where we operate in Chiang Rai province.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
