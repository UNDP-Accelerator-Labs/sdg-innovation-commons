> Title of the innovation

Climate change

> Brief description of the innovation

This show the impact of how climate change has affected our daily life and how we can improve or find solutions to climate change in our daily living

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

When we deal with climate change we can come up with other business ideas such as fish farming or gardening by using water irrigation this would help our business to grow each and every season of the year because we will have knowledge on how to handle each season and the type of business we can do at a particular moment

> Technical Feasibility

Rite now it is my second time farming tomatoes but with due time I would also want to learn or to know how fish farming is done with the knowledge and equipment I believe I can do it and help my fellow youth in my community to have something to do daily

> Anticipated Social Impact

With where Zambia has reached Of today many youths have turned into taking alcohol not because alcohol is the solution but because they do not have anything to do like the saying ‘an idle mind is the devil’s workshop’ with having something preoccupied on someone’s mind I believe one can not turn into bad habits
So with this innovation it would help many youths in my community
