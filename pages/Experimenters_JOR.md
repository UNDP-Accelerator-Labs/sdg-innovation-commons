[[ai_summary:Muhammad Abmouli, head of experimentation from Jordan, shared his work on career counseling, which began with an online platform for IT training. He researched and found gaps in learning and getting jobs, particularly among youth. The team developed a chatbot to test its effectiveness, finding that it was well-received by young people due to its convenience. They also identified the need for empathy, creative thinking, and partnership to address the challenge. Although their work is still in its early stages, they hope to make a significant impact on career guidance and support for young people in Jordan.]]

# Jordan Career Counseling Platform Development

### [[0:00]] Your name, your title and say I consent to this recording\.

OK, I'm Muhammad Abmouli, head of experimentation from Jordan, and I consent for the on this recording\.

### [[0:11]] OK, now over to you for the 1st\. All right\.

### [[0:16]] Could you tell me about and all the activity that you would like to share?

[[skills:Information management]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
OK, I'd like to share our work on career counseling\. Our work on career counselling started at the beginning when we had one of our town hall meetings at the office and we were sharing what was happening in our projects\. And one of the things that the livelihood pillar were actually working on was an online platform\. This online platform was mainly for for training of it was mainly for training people on IT stuff\. OK, so after, after that, I mean during this during this meeting, we were asked by the resident representative to support the livelihood team on revamping this platform and making it better\.

### [[1:21]] So I think that's you pretty much answered how did it came about and where did you start? So now going to the next question, which is what is the development issue that you were addressing and how and what did the situation look like?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
[[principles:Immersion and engagemen]]
OK, so the the platform actually was to train people on new emerging texts\. So it was actually for there were, there were multiple training courses there, but still it wasn't appealing for the government or other entities to actually take this platform\. It was with the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Ministry of Entrepreneurship and yeah, Moody, Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Digital digital skills, Yeah\. And and during this, yeah\. So the platform, it's kind of it was in the testing phase, so it wasn't actually launched and, and the livelihoods builder were seeking our support to revamp and, and recreate this, this platform\. Now what what happened was when we were requested by the RR to do the revamping, we went into research\. So what we did was we actually did our homework\. We went online, we started searching for other like platforms that are kind of similar to the platform that we are kind of trying to nationalize and we found a lot\. So we we found a lot of global platforms that are the same\. We found a lot of regional platforms that are serving the same purpose\. So what we told our colleagues at the livelihood pillar is we don't want to create another LinkedIn or another training kind of platform\. It has to have a new element in it\. So what we did was we said to ourselves, why not create an AI platform and integrate it into the into the platform itself? Yeah\. What we thought about was there was a gap during our research because we did a lot of stuff to come up with this decision\. And one of it was an online survey that was directed to youth in Jordan\. And the we asked people from the age of 18 up to 30, what was the gap in learning and getting jobs\. And one of the the gaps that were actually there was career counseling that we didn't have proper career counseling for youth\. So this is basically the development issue\. Yes, the development issue\. So based on that, we decided to make a chat bot that can be integrated into the platform and and for us to test the viability and the effectiveness of a chat bot\. We said to ourselves, before we go and create a chat bot, let's test if chatting works\. So I created an experiment where I got a real life career counselor as an IC and this career counselor had three types of interviews with youth\. So we wanted to test chatting, career counselling, using chatting and compare it to phone calls and to live interactive kind of consultation\. And it was, to be honest, chatting was really good\. Youth, young people like it because they kind of like chatting using their phones more than more than using, you know, interacting face to face\. Yeah\.

### [[5:18]] Brings me to the next question, which is who was involved in your journey, What was the role and how did you ensure diverse stakeholder perspective?

I mean this R&D journey, I mean for the R&D journey, we didn't have much of A stakeholder\. It was mostly, it was mostly our colleagues at the country office, plus it was mostly our colleagues from the country office and our our expert in career counselling\. So yeah, because we didn't want to approach other stakeholders before we kinda know the ecosystem of what we're working with\.

### [[5:58]] OK, so let's jump to tactics or we want to\. So were there any specific tactics or approaches you used to engage stakeholders build by and or address resistance to your R and DI mean there there wasn't any resistance at least from the country office\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
They were because they are the one who initiated ours or they needed our support to do the research\. And we we didn't want to jump to conclusions in the end\. So we did not go or or or approach external like stakeholders before knowing what is there in the ecosystem\. So, so our research kind of indicated to us in the end, OK, that yes, chatting works, but if we do a platform like this, it does not represent the, the core elements that UNDP should be doing it\. So we, we thought that this can be done by a local small NGO instead of UNDP doing a platform like that or you know, so yeah\. So we, what we did was we wanted to make a we make it to make it bigger\. So we, we started creating an, a concept note\. We met with some colleagues from the, the Japanese embassy and they love the idea\. So we, we wrote a couple of proposals and we're currently kind of waiting for them to, to tell us what's going on\.

### [[7:33]] Yeah, that's good\. That's good\. Let's jump to the skills needed for this idea\. OK, So what skills we needed to identify to effectively identify and understand the challenge or needs that you already work in to address?

[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Empathy]]
[[principles:Well being]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
I think the one of the things that for us as experimenters, we need to have is empathy\. So for you to actually think about a solution, you should put yourself into other people's shoe\. And that's kind of what we did because youth don't really have proper guidance or young people in Jordan that don't have proper guidance on how to approach their career and their future\. So that's, I think for me, the most important aspect\. So placing yourself in the shoes of young people to understand their needs is, is an important thing\. Another, another skill maybe that that that was needed was to think out\-of\-the\-box and don't jump into conclusions because if we went into a conclusion and OK, let's just create the chat bot and put it there, I mean, we wouldn't have approached the Japanese embassy or, you know, try to make it into a bigger framework\.

### [[8:54]] What other skills were essential during other skills?

[[skills:Partnerhsip coordination]]
[[skills:Patnership]]
[[skills:Mediation]]
[[principles:Trust]]
Let me think of some\. I mean, yeah, but partnership, it's kind of early for us to do partnerships For now, I think researching and thinking and overthinking what you're doing maybe, yeah\.I mean, I mean career counselling because I, what I did at the beginning of our, of our journey was I thought about my brothers and sisters because they were kind of lost also\. They didn't know what to do with with their future\. So they kind of gave me this inspiration to do career counseling\. And to be honest as well, my brother was one of the people I interviewed\. So yeah, yeah\.

### [[9:55]] So now let's jump into the reflecting on the journal section where we're going to try to see the impact on the outcomes of this\. What was the outcome of your R&D journey so far?

So far the outcome of the of the journey was kind of the learnings of what we got the learnings\. We are going to document it in a knowledge product once I get back to Aman Chawla\. And then we are still waiting for the Japanese embassy to give us our their their reply and I hope it's going to be good\.

### [[10:31]] And, and how did or will your work in back sustainable development?

I mean, unemployment is one of the biggest issues in Jordan where we have around 50% of young people in the from the age 18 up to 28\. I think it was the number that are unemployed\. So having proper career guidance and career counselling might at least support a fraction of that, which is a huge number by the way, to at least guide them to to get a better future\.

### [[11:08\] OK, yeah\. So now what when we talk about their links, well, what would you do differently if you had to start again,

### Maybe get more young people to get interviewed and no more because our our sample was kind of small\. So I think if we had a bigger sample, more things would emerge\.

### [[11:34\]\]So now in terms of diffusion and catalyzation, what strategies, what approaches did you employ to facilitate the diffusion and adoption if your R&D outwards, if it applies?

[[skills:Pitching skill]]
[[skills:Partnerhsip coordination]]
[[skills:Mediation]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
I mean, we worked on a couple of concept notes that went to the Japanese Embassy for their review\. We had a meeting with Jaika and the Japanese Embassy where we discussed career counselling and how it's going to affect they, because most of the most of the most of the projects that come to Jordan are kind of for entrepreneurship and, and, and fab labs and all the other stuff that are also important\. But career counseling and guidance kind of hits the core of the issue\. And it's that youth don't have proper guidance on what to do, you know, So I, I think that's, that's one of the important aspects where of our work there\.

### [[12:37\]\]\. And, and finally, how did you engage with policymakers, private sectors, communities or other key factors to catalyze broader change going back based on where are in the world?

I mean, I mean, we're still, we're still in the, in the beginning of our journey\. So we are still there\. I hope we, we create better\. I hope we create good partnerships in the future and a better future for the for the young people in my country\. That's what I can say for now\.

### [[13:09]] Yeah, thank you\.

Thank you\.

### [[13:12]] One more question\. If you could just say a couple of lines about embedding within new DP, if that's been happening, if they're adopting ways of working that you've been able to see, like what exactly? Like how are you working with the country office? Are they adopting some of these things? Have you, have you helped their projects, their programs?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:Design]]
Yeah, we've been, yeah\. We've been working with the country office a lot actually during this past year that I joined the lab we created with the with the livelihood\. Yeah, it's with the livelihood program, Yeah, yeah\. But we that we have done, we, we have done and we're still doing a lot with the with the with the program, with other colleagues as well\. So we worked with the central team on the gender net on the gender strategy of the office\. We also worked on different policies for the office\. So we're they're kind of trying or we are kind of integrated in the office in a way, but it's the who's going to cover our salary kind of issue there\.
