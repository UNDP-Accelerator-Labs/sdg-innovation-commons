Who would have thought that such a sweet-smelling flower could
be a menace to society? Move over, Godzilla, because the true
monster has revealed itself in the form of the Honolulu rose. This
deceptively innocent flower might seem like the perfect addition
to your garden, but little do you know, it's plotting world
domination. With its invasive tendencies and a knack for
strangling native plants and crops, the Honolulu rose is like that
one friend who overstays their welcome and takes over your
fridge.
So, if you thought you were about to embark on a romantic
journey through a blossoming paradise, buckle up, because this
rose will leave you questioning Shakespeare's famous words: "A
rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but it might just
take over the world while doing so!"
Biodiversity is vital for the health of our planet, but it is facing unprecedented threats
due to climate change and human activities. To address these challenges, the
Accelerator Lab (AccLab) has embarked on an innovative project to harness collective
intelligence for biodiversity monitoring. In this blog, we delve into the insights and
testing plans developed by AccLab, highlighting the potential of photojournaling and
spatial data collection methods in documenting invasive alien species and promoting
effective action for climate change mitigation.
AccLab's first testing plan revolved around photojournaling as a
means to capture photographic evidence of invasive alien species
and their locations.
The plan included participant selection, training, field testing, data collection, analysis,
evaluation, and documentation.The Samoa community, like other Pacific Island
communities, possesses its own unique qualities. One prominent aspect of Samoa's
culture is the emphasis on 'respect,' which plays a vital role in fostering community
unity. Recognizing the invaluable knowledge held by the local youth, we collaborated
with them to gain insights into their community, as they possess a deep understanding
of its intricacies. With their guidance, we were able to navigate the villages while
adhering to the cultural protocols specific to each location 01.0
The testing phase was an opportunity for the youth participants from the Samoa
National Youth Council to contribute to biodiversity monitoring actively. Through their
photographs, the participants were able to document invasive alien species
encountered in the villages of Lufilufi, Fagaloa, Toamua, Satapuala and Magiagi. The
process involved training the participants in basic photography techniques and
educating them about invasive species identification.
The collected photographs served as valuable evidence of the presence and impacts of
invasive species. By analyzing the photographs and cross-referencing with expert
resources, AccLab validated the identification of invasive alien species. The testing
plan also allowed for participant feedback, enabling AccLab to gather valuable insights
into the effectiveness of photojournaling as a biodiversity monitoring tool.
Through the photojournaling testing plan, the project has
showcased the power of youth engagement in documenting
invasive alien species.
Enhancements in Spatial Data Collection
While photojournaling proved to be a promising method, the insights gained revealed a
limitation: the non-transferability of location tags in the metadata of the photographs.
To overcome this challenge, AccLab developed a second testing plan aimed at
incorporating Google Forms or KoboToolbox for spatial data collection.
The enhanced testing plan focuses on enabling community participants to create GPS
pins to accurately and transferably mark the location of invasive species. By utilizing
these digital platforms, participants will learn to capture location data effectively,
improving the overall accuracy and usability of the collected information. This iterative
approach reflects AccLab's commitment to continuous improvement and ensures the
creation of comprehensive maps of invasive species locations for more effective
climate change mitigation strategies.
AccLab's collective intelligence design studio for biodiversity
monitoring is making remarkable strides in addressing climate
change and its impacts. Through the photojournaling testing plan,
the project has showcased the power of youth engagement in
documenting invasive alien species. The insights and the
subsequent testing plan for spatial data collection highlight
AccLab's commitment to refining and expanding its
methodologies.
Harnessing collective intelligence, AccLab is forging a path
towards more effective action in addressing climate change and
preserving biodiversity. By empowering communities and
integrating innovative tools, we can build a collective effort to
protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future.
Together, let's embrace the power of collective intelligence and
take bold steps to safeguard our natural heritage.
