> Explain what is it about

Nitumeni, which means "Send Me'  is a start-up by a group of young women that seeks to contribute to the reduction in the spread of COVID-19. The initiative operates by encouraging people and business owners to order or deliver their food and non-food items through a courier company being operated by a group of female youths. They hope to reduce footprint in the market places thereby contributing to the reduction on the spread of COVID-19. The team currently uses social media to run errands for clients across Zambia's capital city of Lusaka.

The solution was identified during a solutions safari to identify community response to the COVID-19 challenge. The SME then participated in the Innovation Challenge that AccLab Zambia conducted in 2020 in partnership with partners from the government - National Technology Business Centre (NTBC) and the Zambia Information and Communication Technology Authority (ZICTA)
