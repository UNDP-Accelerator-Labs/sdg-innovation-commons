> Title of the innovation

Food For All. 57 years have passed since Zambia attained it's independence. We boast of being one of the largest copper producing countries in the face of the planet and yet people are still living below the poverty line. It is a surprise that most families I Zambia are unable to afford three meals a day hence the need to help people and families that can't afford these meals by providing them with workable solutions that will help improve their lives for good.That is why as food for all inovations I have come up with the ways of improving people's lives in the simplest way possible so that the food for all project can be achieved in the most economical way possible.

> Brief description of the innovation

I have seen a luck of a constant supply of chicken in my area, there is a great demand for broiler chicken but no one is standing up to the challenge and come up with this profitable project which can improve and change the living standard of people who venture into it within the shortest time possible. 
I would love to venture in chicken rearing  once am impowered because I know the market is readily available for consumption and not only that but also as a form of job creation which will ease the over dependant upon government creating jobs for it's citizens.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This is a direct way of wealth creation, this innovation will be creating its own money once it's at pick because we will be selling chicken to the people for home consumption. And also supplying to the super markets all around the country, now when we do this it means that there will be more competition that will be felt by the big players hence we can be able to see a reduction in prices of chicken sold in super markets whereby even people who couldn't afford to buy can now buy at a more convenient amount. 
The prize amount will help this business to go a long way in the sense that it will give us the basis of where to start from and grow exponentially from the push we will get out of the prize money.

> Technical Feasibility

The whole idea of the food for all innovation project is  is to be able to supply chicken to the ever needing consumers out there, because of the constant demand am positive that this project will stand the test of time which will also give birth to other profitable projects which will come as an expansion of this project. 
The labour market to provide support is readily available which will see this project go on without any problems.
Also the fact that we aim to start with a minimum of 500 birds and later on increas makes it easier for the project to be well managed. 
Another factor is the low time frame in which results of the project are seen, once everything is in place it is expected that results are seen in 4 to 6 months only.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Local people will directly benefit of this project in a number of ways, it will be a project that will create employment and also help in poverty reduction within and out of the community.
It will as well bring competitiveness with other player which will see the reduction of prices of chicken on the market.
