The Accelerator Lab in Guinea-Bissau has been working closely with the Ministry of Justice in a number of areas, including exploration, observation and testing. Through this process we discovered that the head of IT at the MoJ has developed a system to digitalize the data collected by the Notary service. This system is currently in the testing phase. The AccLab will support the MoJ in testing and optimizing this service to accelerate digitalization at the MoJ. The data management dashboard is called SIGDAJ (Integrated Data System of Management for the MoJ).
