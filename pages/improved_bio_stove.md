> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Profile Innovator Mr. Khandira Baruah is from the Sonitpur district of Assam. He is inclined to innovative ideas and technologies from childhood. He also loves to write poems. Purpose In rural areas, firewood is being used as a primary source of fuel for cooking. However, due to ignorance and also by culture, a huge amount of heat energy gets wasted during cooking. Mr. Baruah came up with a new design of stove for the sustainable utilization of heat energy produced from firewood and other bio-resources for heat. Technical details This is a two-chambered innovative stove separated by a metallic circular plate from one chamber to the other. The upper chamber is meant for putting fuel resources in it. A dome-shaped metallic burner with an opening on the top is being placed on the upper fuel chamber which checks the airflow from the outer surroundings. Then the stove is placed above the burner. Above the whole arrangement, a circular metallic plate is being placed which protects the heat release from the firewood.   After the complete set of the tool, the left out or waste biomaterial resources are kept into the upper chamber. With the help of a candle or match stick, the fire is set on the resources. Once the fire sets, other bioresources such as cow dung, unused wood materials, etc. are added into the existing burning fuel. The temperature of the heat can be regulated with the help of a regulator placed just beneath the upper chamber. The regulator is a flat circular plate having holes in it. The lower chamber is meant for collecting ashes released from the burnt biomaterial. The size and shape of the burners vary and can be used according to the need. Benefits It has a regulator that controls the temperature. All types of conventional fuel sources can be used in this stove. The fuel consumption of this stove is also very less.
