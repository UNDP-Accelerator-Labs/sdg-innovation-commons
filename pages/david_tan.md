## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Prototyping and testing a solar dryer that communities can self-assemble, suited to local climate conditions. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

The use of EFTE in conjunction with other locally-sourced materials will  make solar dryers more cost-effective and greener, leading to better business outcomes and food security. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Prototyping and testing

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Energy consumption, community acceptability, time and volume of drying

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Experimental observations, interviews

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.
