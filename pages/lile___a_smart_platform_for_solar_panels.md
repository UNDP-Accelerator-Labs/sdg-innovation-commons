> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

"Lille" (the sun deity in Svan mythology) is a dynamic, intelligent system in the form of a moving platform that automatically ensures that the solar panels are always oriented precisely toward the sun. As a result, the energy performance of the attached solar panel is increased by 25% because it is automatically directed to the highest intensity of sunlight during the day.

At this point, "Lille" is a small-scale working prototype that was created for the purpose of demonstrating the idea at the competition and can also be referred to as a demo-robot. However, if funded, it can be replicated in practice for arbitrarily large solar panels. The only difference will be in the construction and mechanism dimensions, while the basic principles, schematic and technical approaches, sensors, and control program developed within the project are universal.
