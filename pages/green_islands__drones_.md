## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

There is evidence that the use of Drones in reforestation can substantially reduce the time and resources to deliver seeds to reforestation, especially in areas of difficult access like mountains or large extensions of land. The procedure allows for a quick intervention, namely following rains (which are less and less predictable) to take advantage of soil humidity in a timely timeframe, very difficult using traditional resources.   This procedure can help restore natural seed banks where they show greater decay and urgency to receive interventions, diversify the national flora, insert plants to preserve the soil and disseminate seeds for the production of pasture for animal consumption.   From the environment standpoint, the drones can be used to surveil protected areas, disinfect dumps and transport essential (not too heavy goods) to isolated or remote areas. These applications were also valuable in the combat of Covid-19 pandemic, with street disinfections in some villages and light medical equipment’s and medicines transport to remote areas in underserved islands.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We’ve used a flexible framework to conduct the experiments and accommodate different types of drone applications in the process, involving different stakeholders and locations. This allowed us to gather more knowledge regarding these applications and sensibilize authorities and other stakeholders to the benefits of this technology and even discovering with them other possible applications within their scope of work that we did not think of, and that was very useful to them.   In future experiments in this regard, we could go in more detail in some agriculture applications, repeating the process in different locations to generate more insights and standardized information. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

2-3 days field tests performed 6 times over a 1 year period Preparation time for each test: 1-3 months   August 2020 (Santo Antão Island: Reforestation test) September 2020 (Maio Island: Streets Disinfection for Covid-19) November 2020 (Maio Island: Dump Disinfection for Environment) August 2021 (Maio Island: Surveillance for Environment and Protected Areas) November 2021 (Santiago Island: Reforestation test in Serra Malagueta park) November 2021 (Santiago Island: Reforestation test in Achada Leite locality)

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

During the 6 experiments, we assembled 3 drones (2 smaller and 1 larger).   2 Drones - Small: 3.000 USD each (more suitable for disinfection. Weight capacity 5kg) 1 Drone - Large: 10.000 USD (wider application possibilities. Weight capacity 10kg) 3 Robotic seed dispenser / Disinfection dispenser (Pulverization)  (450 USD each) Seeds: 0 USD (provided by FAO, BIOTUR Project) Disinfection material/supplies to pulverize: 300 USD per experiment Supporting personnel: 0 USD (partners, lab team and Érico) Travel and Stays (in different islands): 400 USD + 1000 USD per trip (experiment team) Water mobilization 2.600 USD (pump controller - Achada Leite)

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

This initiative included several phases progressively, in which tests were performed in different locations and with different applications (reforestation and disinfection/environment purposes). We’ve started with a smaller drone to see if the applications works, and then with a larger drone o increase coverage and impact.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes. We are working now in the project “Drone for the Islands : Leaving no island behind”, to scale-up the use of drones on the islands of Cabo Verde and face one of our biggest challenges: severe droughts and its impact in ecosystems.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Land desertification is a problem that has been affecting Cape Verdean archipelago for decades and its harmful effects are increasingly evident and worrying. Erosion, the existence of several tracts of land difficult to access by land, depopulation and shortage of field workers, and lack innovation in processes and methodologies are some factors that have been negatively impacting farming and the preservation of forests throughout the nation.   It is essential to build an ecosystem around agriculture and climate change to address these challenges and introduce innovation, new partners and solutions.   The sense phase was the first step in defining opportunities for intervention in our challenge, previewing contexts in different locations and forging partnerships.   The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (Drones) allows for quickly, timely and efficiently action on reforestation and other interventions. This solution allows for a rapid response in irregular raining seasons, ensuring seed germination and healthy plant growth upon rains. It does also help in human and material resources management, which are often scarce and time consuming in these types of intervention.   In the context of reforestation, drone use can increase agility in interventions to restore natural seed banks in greater need, diversify national flora, insert new plants to preserve the soil, and disseminate seeds for production of pasture for animal consumption.   Drone technology can also be used for sowing, soil fertilization and pesticide spraying, as a new, revolutionary andcost-effective way to assist agriculture and reforestation in the country. In addition, families can benefit from momentary crops such as, corn, beans and other types of cereal, which we know requires minimal water and its favorable to local climate conditions.   Applications in the environment sector are also very promising including dumps disinfection, protected areas and forest surveillance and transport of essential and light goods to isolated or remote areas.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Cabo Verde is an archipelago and the initiative needed to occur in different islands and remote areas. These posed some logistic challenges to prepare the intervention on site and local support. We overcame these challenges with partnerships with local municipalities and other partners (like FAO and the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment), to set up the proper conditions locally.   Very irregular raining seasons was a challenges in order to time well the experiments in the reforestation applications. The seed balls solution was an innovation that we experimented to protect the seeds used and increase lifespan in the sowing.   Some parts of the drones needed to be purchased from abroad, and the procurement process had its challenges!

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

This concept and technology can be adjusted to be applied to many of the internal portfolios, including Environment and Climate Change, Health, Economic growth and Governance. Drone applications like, reforestation, protected areas surveillance and support, medicine transportation, land and touristic locations showcase to investors and tourists, urban management, mosquitos outbreaks and fire spots or garbage accumulation are all possible and can benefit greatly of drone technology in our country.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Institutions, companies and organizations outside UNDP can also greatly benefit from this experiment with drones, as they can see that its possible and feasible to try this technology to their advantage. Ministries of environment and agriculture, Farmers, Municipalities, NGOs in the environmental sector, Private sector companies, etc. All these stakeholders can benefit from the applications we’ve tested and mentioned above, and in many others with just small adjustments in the equipment or adding a camera or other features.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

This initiative included several phases progressively, in which tests were performed in different locations and with different applications (reforestation and disinfection/environment purposes). We’ve started with a smaller drone to see if the application works and then with a larger drone to increase coverage and impact. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Careful pre-experiment phase and planning. Engagement of stakeholders. Empower innovation: Believe that is possible and give confidence to innovators and other stakeholder in the process. Have a plan B (we ran into a problems during the first experiment, that was that the seeds were too light to be released from the sky with the drone with desired precision. At this point the idea to create this “seed balls” evolving the seeds in some fertilizing and soil material came from the team to gave the exact weight we needed and that did also help protect the seeds for the whole process.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes! We have seen many different applications of this drone technology with just small adaptations, to be used in Heath, Environment, Governance, Private Sector and so on. The applications are endless and can impact many different SDGs. Examples like reforestation, protected areas surveillance and support, medicine transportation, land and touristic locations showcase to investors and tourists, urban management, mosquitos outbreaks and fire spots or garbage accumulation are all possible and can benefit greatly from drone technology. Drone technology can also be used for sowing, soil fertilization and pesticide spraying, as a new, revolutionary and cost-effective way to assist agriculture practices in the country.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This initiative begun with solutions mapping, when we “discovered” Érico Pinheiro, this young and very talented young innovator. After analyzing the potential of his solution we explored the potential applications, gathered more information, developed partnerships, interviewed experts, local stakeholders and individuals in selected sites/locations for the experiments. All these sense and explore inputs were vital to successfully carrying out the tests we did and all the phases we went through in this project.

> What surprised you?

It was overwhelming the diversity of application ideas that emerged during the experiments while interacting with stakeholders. During the experiments we always end up trying other things with the drones and documenting other totally different applications with partners, as they start ideating other useful things they could do with a drone in their daily activities, as for example in the Municipality of Maio Island where they spend long time showing investors lands and touristic locations to invest and build hotels, and someone said “Hey! We could use this drone to impactfuly showcase remote and beautiful touristic spots to the many investors we receive here, saving us hours of travel!!”
