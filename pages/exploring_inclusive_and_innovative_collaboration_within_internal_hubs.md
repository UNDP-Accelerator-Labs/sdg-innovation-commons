## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Exploring inclusive and innovative collaboration within internal hubs 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our Challenge is to understand how the existing culture influences what, how and when knowledge is shared in the organization, and what the practical expectations are for how the hubs will interacting internally and with each other for a systemic approach to challenges.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Organizational culture is a collective and common set of values, beliefs, assumptions, and ways of interaction that contribute to the unique social and psychological environment of an organization. It is “the way things are done around here”. As the accelerator lab, we were looking to bring a new way of working that will change “the business as usual” to a more innovative approach to solving development challenges.   Along the same lines, the Country office underwent a reconfiguration of its policy and program management in Q1 of 2021 to remain ‘fit-for-purpose’ as a key development partner and achieve the new CPD (2020-2025) by raising the scale, quality and impact of results achieved and the efficiency with which resources are deployed. Structurally, this is achieved through the creation of hubs/networks around priority areas of the CPD and practically, it is by creating “a much more open, innovative, collaborative, and networked approach” to programmatic work. However, on the day to day level, there is still question on how to achieve this.  One of the ways the lab has been supporting this work is through our learning series that aims to share lab tools and methodologies along with the space to discuss how we can create a more cohesive and leaning organization. At our last learning session on Working Out Loud, we have an in-depth discussion on how we can do better as a CO on knowledge sharing and management. The discussion also brought about an interesting question on how culture in influencing the practice of knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing not just as pushing of knowledge by one party but the entire process of identification, recognition, and usage of the knowledge by others.  Naturally this got us wondering how the existing culture influences what, how and when knowledge is shared in the organization and what is the expectations of the reconfigurations in changing this culture.

As part of the roadmap for the new CPD, the CO has reviewed and calibrated its programme in the lead up to, and as a key input into, the commencement of the new programming process. The objective is to ensure strategic focus whilst improving achievement of results, efficiency and effectiveness, quality of work, accountability, and responsibility as well as a rationalized and well-balanced distribution of work.  Recommendations from Independent Comprehensive Programme Evaluation  UNDP should strengthen the linkages between upstream and downstream interventions in order to enhance the likelihood for transformational change. It should strengthen its strategic focus and ensure integration between thematic areas, to better build synergies and reduce fragmented initiatives.  System map showing of connection between programmatic approaches in Ethiopia.

With the new Configuration, there is a lot of question on how the hubs are exceptive to work together and how projects within the hub are to create links between their areas to make a systemic impact. In our last CO learning session that covered working out loud, the issue of the silo culture was brought up, specifically how it plays a role in restricting open communication. Possible solutions for breaking these barriers and creating an open sharing community was brought up as well. These discussions showed us the interest in building an open collaborative culture but that we need to understand the existing culture, what is working and not working before moving forward with any type of solutions. In addition, we also saw that there is a need for a clear and common understanding of what the expectations are of the new collaborative hubs.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The lab team in collaboration with the hub leaders and portfolio manager plan to sense, explore and co-create through innovative methodologies. This is worth investing because it is related to our aim of accelerating the organization learning and influence knowledge sharing. The lab is seen as a collaborative and innovative hub in the country office already and have been asked to contribute to the reconfiguration at different levels. This gives us a unique position in terms of acceptance but also have somewhat of a coordinators role in bringing together different parties to the table.  

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Acc lab @UNDPEthiopia is looking at stretching internal collaboration and knowledge sharing to enhance transformational changes in #ClimateResilliance, governance and #economic growth.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The lab team in collaboration with the hub leaders and portfolio manager will sense through deep dive to what we collectively mean by “open and innovative, networked and collaborative” and explore how they see them materializing in their hubs beyond the new titles and names. We will also work with the programming staff to understand the knowledge sharing culture in the CO that is a pillar to creating collaboration.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

- What, when and how is knowledge shared currently?  - What type of knowledge and learning is valued in the organization?  - What is “open and innovative, networked and collaborative” and what is it not?   - How do we see going from a need to know (knowledge sharing with in a hierarchy) to a need to share with in the country office after the new a reconfiguration? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The lab team plan to start this challenge through sensemaking, what is the current culture within the organization to work together and how projects internally create links between their areas to make a systemic impact.   We are planning also to scan the organization horizon to select the most effective ideation activity to leverage the organization’s human and financial resources, to source the right number and type of ideas and engage appropriate stakeholders in the ideation process.  Through creating knowledge collectively and co-creating together with the hubs, that lab team plan to generate insight on our learning question “How do we see going from a need to know (knowledge sharing with in a hierarchy) to a need to share with in the country office after the new a reconfiguration?” 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

User journey and behavioral insight we allow us to go beyond the data and understand what is driving individuals to share or not share knowledges. We can also identify if there are subculture within hubs or team that differs from the general culture.  
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The insights, learnings and solutions will be used with in the CO s HUBS and the scaling will be led by the portfolio manager.
