> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The goal of developing these pilot experiences is to visibly state the differences between the merely productive approaches that encourage the construction of mega-dams and the social approaches where the center and purpose of the actions are oriented towards improving the quality of life of the inhabitants.   The aim of the project is to solve the electricity deficit in protected rural areas in a novel way. In its execution, no polluting or toxic elements are used, nor is the forest destroyed nor are electromagnetic fields that pose a health risk created.   Mr. Barney, who is an engineer, together with students from the School of Engineering and local settlers, carried out a pilot experience with a 1 kW test turbine. They used a Michell Banki turbine, model T-12 modified by the Misiones Renewable Energy Group (GERM) and built by a metallurgical workshop in Oberá, Misiones, under the direction of another engineer called Barney. The net jump height used was 5 meters, at a flow rate of 30 liters per second.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Prototype system

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

The power obtained in the test was 1 kW, which meets the forecast, and it indicates that the estimated results will be obtained for the equipment that is planned to be installed. The experience made it possible to refute the performance values that are estimated in the calculations for the determination of the useful power that can be extracted from hydraulic use.   In this sense, the project on the Trigueriño stream could have contributed a total of 12 kW, as discussed in previous paragraphs; however, to avoid using all the natural flow of the water course and because it is a prototype project for educational and demonstration purposes, equipment was installed to obtain 3 kW of power, which will adequately satisfy the demand described.
