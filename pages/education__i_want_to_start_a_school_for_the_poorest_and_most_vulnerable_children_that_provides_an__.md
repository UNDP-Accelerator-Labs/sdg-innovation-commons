> Title of the innovation

Education: I want to start a school for the poorest and most vulnerable children that provides an international standard curriculum but also tailors to the national cultural and traditional methods and histories of Zambia.

> Brief description of the innovation

I believe by reinventing the way children learn and equipping the poorest and most vulnerable children and communities with a high standard of education and skills they will become future innovators and leaders that can lift their community out of poverty and bring development to their nation.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It will equip and empower future generations to secure employment, start businesses and bring improvements to their communities. With a focus on leadership and problem solving skills I believe this style of education will also have an impact on the nation as these children discover solutions and pioneer innovations.

> Technical Feasibility

I would take assessments at the end or beginning of the year to accept the poorest and most vulnerable children from the compound area I currently volunteer in. I would establish the first class and employ a local teacher to train with me in the content and different style I have seen work in the part-time teaching sessions I have already done here. I would aim to locally staff more classes and grades each year.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My idea and curriculum is very different to anything being offered in current schools. It also involves many different teaching styles that would cater to children’s diverse learning types. 
I believe children would complete fewer grades with a higher level of education but also a wide range of extra curricular and work based skills. 
This would make them more employable and provide more life choices for them and their communities.
