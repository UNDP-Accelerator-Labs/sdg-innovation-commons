> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

The Ñacuñán Reserve belongs to the World Program “Man and the Biosphere”, whose main goal is to improve the relationships between human beings and nature. From research projects of the CONICET Mendoza Scientific and Technological Center, contributions were proposed in this regard, which include an experience of solar cookers with the community that lives in the Reserve. This experience of transferring solar cookers made it possible to reduce the community's dependence on firewood, which arises in the absence of electricity and gas. The technology transfer process with the residents of Ñacuñán was conducted through awareness talks on the advantages associated with the use of Renewable Energy, and workshops on the production of solar cookers. In the workshops, the researchers provided the materials for making the equipment that was assembled together with the neighbors to achieve a better understanding of its operation.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

Solar cooking in shelter schools and community centers in isolated areas requires heating large volumes of food, usually in pots of between 20 and 40 liters. In addition, several types of absorbers are optimized to fulfill different functions in a concentrator with an area of 2 m2. These alternatives make it possible to efficiently meet the needs of a communal kitchen and serve up to 30 children for each hub installed.  

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

Although in many cases the technology and knowledge transfer are successful, there is no real adoption as it is only used for a brief period. Therefore, project monitoring and budget allocation become extremely important to ensure the maintenance and monitoring of the technology.
