## Title

Harnessing and Using Big Data to Inform Development Challenges Facing Tanzania
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenges that most of the development programs are currently been designed by using traditional sources of data while missing a significant portion of data which is available through open sources such as websites, satellite, etc  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The review of the past five years development plans indicates that many indicators were not achieved because of data or they were designed with inaccurate data. One of the reasons on why inaccurate data were been used was the lack of capacity to collect, process and interpret big data and link them to development plans. The institutions which were involved in using inaccurate or traditional and outdated data include the national planning departments and private sector as well. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

UNDP in general is the most trusted government partner in the country. Because of that, UNDP is taking the lead in designing long term plans and strategies for the country. The accelerator lab value is to mainstream innovation in development planning and to promote the use of unusual solutions (such as big data) to inform development programs. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

big data, a quick way to analyze and understand the development trends and challenges. Important to build the capacity for both private and public on how to harness and apply big data.
## Challenge classification

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How accurate are big data from unusual data

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Through Design thinking workshops, I will convene all key stakeholders to vision a problem we are causing by using traditional data, then we will do a crowd sourcing exercise to identify different open sources of data, then we will design a prototype software for analyzing the data and presenting the results through data visualization.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The existing gap is that most of the data used in development programming are not real time data, they are outdated traditional data sets. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) regulates the use of data in all angles. In that regard, one has to obtain a permission to use data where for a research or for any thing that informs the public. The NBS will be the primary partner to collaborate with and is already championing the use of big data in the government cycles.
