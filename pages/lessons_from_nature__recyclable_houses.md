In a truly sustainable world, we would build our homes using only recyclable materials, renewable energy, without any waste and without disturbing the habitat. That might seem impossible – and yet that is how the rest of nature operates. ecoPod was created with just this in mind - aligning in harmony with nature.  The first modules were built in the form of a geodesic dome for tourist accommodation but can also be used as an alternative for ecovillages, social housing, mobile offices or garages, for business and in the private sector.
