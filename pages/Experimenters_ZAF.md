# Smart Agri Gardens in Rural South Africa

### [[0:0]] Your name, your title and also the phrase I consent to this recording\.

OK\. I'm Tereska Mudley\. I'm the Head of Experimentation at UNDP South Africa and I consent to this recording\.

### [[0:14]] Perfect\. Over to you for the first question\. Hello, Clariska\. Could you tell us about an R&D activity that you'd like to share? How do you come about and where do you all start?

[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:Data Powered Positive Deviance]]
[[tactics:Finding new alternatives]]
OK, the R&D activity I'd like to share is around our implementation of smart Agri gardens in a rural and Township community in Kwazulu Natal in South Africa\. These smart gardens came about during the time of COVID\-19 early in the pandemic when food insecurity was rife\. Several communities had no access to groceries to simple things like bread and milk, and therefore their health was at risk, particularly with the onset of COVID\-19\. The UNDP and some of our government partners decided that to curb food insecurity, we would install smart Agri gardens that would supplement household food with fruits and vegetables, which is high in nutrient content and could potentially help prevent the spread of COVID\-19\. So this range from pumpkin supply, cabbages, spinach and the like\. So fruits and vegetables that will come into households in that particular community\. The aim was to test two kinds of technology that could serve as agricultural or gardens, household gardens in these communities and look at the quality of the vegetables that are produced, how easy the technology is able to to use, Is it suitable for the elderly and those with disabilities? And on top of improving food security, can it actually help those households earn an income with the excess fruits and vegetables supplied to actually help them during the time of COVID\-19, where even joblessness became rife?

### [[2:07]] OK, interesting\. Who was involved in your journey and what was their role?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[skills:Partnerhsip coordination]]
One of our key partners was the Institute for Natural Resources, the what we call the INR\. They are an NGO that works in the community that we supported\. Their role was particularly to go out into the communities and understand their needs during the time and they had a lot of experience in working in that community and in fact new several leadership positions in that community that eventually served as community champions during this this process\. And they were vital in coming up with the design together with the community\. So definitely part of a Co creation process together with the community\. They produced the designs of the gardens\. They tested the garden designs\. They demoed the garden designs within the the the Champions within the communities households before we started piloting and then installing it in 137 households in the community\.

### [[3:07]] Great\. And could you specifically zoom in on the tools and methods you used to do what you just described? And why did you pick those specific tools and methods?

[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:Working with ecosystems]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
OK\. So we specifically used prototyping and piloting or experimentation, testing within a field setting and testing with the user first and foremost in the picture\. We also use the method of Co creation and collective intelligence\. When it came to designing the the household garden\. We use the practice of focus groups, community consultations, a lot of community participation in coming up with the design so that we don't prescribe a particular design to the community\. We held focus groups where the community gave their inputs based on their already existing experience in agriculture\. So what works in that particular environment and ecosystem? Everything ranging from, you know how difficult it is, the labour involved in planting and harvesting the produce all the way to local animals being \*\*\*\*\*\* and and a hindrance in growing the the vegetable\. So they're really part of every aspect of Co creating the garden and the technology\.

### [[4:25]] OK\. And could you also elaborate on the principles that guided your R&D work? Why were they important? And on top of that, could you also tell us about some ethical considerations of principles that guided your R&D approach?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
I think the principles fundamental to most of our experiments is leaving nobody behind and and also community Co creation definitely during COVID\-19, the principle of food insecurity, so having ensured that there's zero hunger relating to the SDGS within the communities\. So the principal was definitely leaving nobody behind during COVID\-19, given the high levels of joblessness and low levels of income during the time\. Another principle was around not prescribing to communities how they should develop or or plant or and harvest crops, but developing the ideas together\. So I think the principle of of Co creation comes in very strongly\. We also looked at the principle of prototyping for scale, ensuring that the Champions within the community help to prototype the technology 1st and based on their recommendation that scaled out into the the communities\. So from 5 or 6 champions in the community, we scaled it to 137 households\. So I think the the principle there was let's allow community champions to test and then prescribe and use their power of influence to get the rest of the community on board\.

### [[6:00]] And with all this that you were able to do, what was the outcome of your R&D journey?

[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Proof of concept]]
[[tactics:Allies and champions]]
So it was food security for the various households that was the first and foremost and the direct intent of these various experiments\. But we also saw a lot of innovation within the community\. They came up with ways to protect the crops, like I said, from, from pests and other animals within the area\. It's an agricultural space\. So a lot of animal farming as well\. So they took initiative to protect their gardens\. We also saw bartering during the time of COVID\. Like I said, the levels of income was quite low\. So there was bartering\. So if you have extra spinach, you can barter for something else that you needed in your household\. So we saw that kind of sharing\. We also saw people going to local markets and selling\. So we were hoping that income was an output of this experiment, but we also saw there's actually happening in reality that excess fruits and vegetables were sold at local markets\. But I think the most interesting finding was around the the the natural scaling that happened\. So households that were not participants on this particular program saw the benefits of the project\. They saw the improved quality of the fruit and veg\. They saw the ease of use when it came to the gardens\. They saw how we trained communities in recycling Gray water and water access is a problem in the community\. So the fact that you can reuse Gray water was, was significant\. Community saw the benefit of recycling household waste\. So they they saw this as a means of reducing waste in their household, but using it in a meaningful way\. So all of these benefits were evident right from the onset to the community\. And they themselves, without any resources from UNDP or UNDP's partners, started developing these gardens\. We saw gardens coming up in local nurseries in homes for the elderly simply because it could supplement nutrition to these vulnerable groups\. And it was a low cost method of providing a constant supply and a secure supply of food for these these types of facilities\.

### [[8:12]] Yeah, the quite interesting outcomes\. But how do you connect the outcomes that and the work that you did, how do you think it will it will impact sustainable development?

[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
I think if you think about the SDGS and looking at 0 hunger and eliminating poverty, the fact that food security has improved, it speaks directly to the SDG on zero hunger\. Looking at sustainable and responsible consumption, we looked at household waste recycling and grey water recycling\. So we educated these communities in parallel about leveraging waste as a useful tool and a means of income in society\. So I think this is directly related to the SDGS and the fact that income was leveraged\. It talks about, you know, income efficiency for the households and also building trust among the community members\. The fact that bartering was happening, sharing was happening also led to social cohesion within the communities during a time when competition for for goods and services was very rife\. So that was the direct relation to the SDGS\.

### [[9:26]] And if you had to do this all over again and had to start again, what would you do differently?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:How might we]]
If I could do something differently from a technical standpoint, maybe the design of the now that we have learned about what the how good and some of the negative impacts of the actual design of the technology, we could definitely have done a little better in, in facilitating the design of the, of the equipment, I think\. But that's always something you can do\. In hindsight, perhaps we could have had even greater community input on the actual design, perhaps because the timeline we were working under was so strict and it was part of the COVID\-19 relief\. We were in a hurry to get food security, food secure household\. So we had to rush through the experimentation process and the prototyping process\. I think had we had enough time without the pressure of making sure these households had a means of access to food, we could have done better in actually delivering on the the technical design of the equipment\. Because we definitely did see after about a year or two, some of the gardens and the infrastructure wasn't in the best quality and shape as they could have been\. So that's definitely something I would have improved\. Talking about the timeline, just looking at the how quick we had to implement, install, do some monitoring and evaluation, I think the timeline could have been a bit longer so that we could actually have assessed the impact overtime\. In fact, after the experiment was conducted, we did a monitoring and evaluation exercise after around six months, 6 to 8 months\. And it was great to see that many of the households still retain their gardens\. But there were some, I think it was 8085% that retain their gardens, but there were a couple of them that some of you know, some of the infrastructure had failed and there are ways to improve on that\. So that's definitely something that we could have done better\.

### [[11:22]] And, and what strategies or approaches did you employ within your design to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of your R&D outcomes?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Design]]
One of the, the key aspects was on the partnerships\. We right at the onset got involved with the Department of Science and Innovation on the, on the project\. We, we wanted them to see the, the benefits of the program and be taken on the journey\. So that was our way of saying, you know, once the program is implemented and is running successfully, can it be something that can be diffused through government initiatives which which are arrive in the food security and household empowerment space? In terms of diffuse and catalyze, like I say, we saw natural scaling happen\. That was a significant learning for us\. So this was scaling without the support of UNDP or any other external party\. It was where households took initiative themselves and based on the benefits that they saw decided to scale the gardens even further\. So that is something that we refer to as natural scaling\. But we also also saw diffusion of the the the, the championing approach, the approach of getting local champions involved, having these types of prototypes developed, tested and then at a particular champions household where community members would visit the Champions household, view the technology, view the bed, the potential benefits and then having them implemented themselves\. So the power of influence of community champions was a key strategy as part of diffuse and catalyze We also saw as as part of our strategy to diffuse was the culture, the culture of Co creation\. We saw that cut across other programs at the INR that our partner as well as the UNDP\. So the approach of getting participatory methods, community liaisons, community input, collective intelligence, that was all part of the process that worked\. And therefore the approach itself, the process itself actually diffuse and catalyze\. So we saw diffuse and catalyze in various ways\. The technology itself reach different households, so different geographic locations\. We saw the culture, the want, the need and the method of developing these gardens and the want to develop these gardens diffuse in its own particular way\. So that was our take on diffuse and catalyze\.

### [[13:54]] Yes\. Thank you very much, Clarissa, for your time and thank you\.

Yeah\.
