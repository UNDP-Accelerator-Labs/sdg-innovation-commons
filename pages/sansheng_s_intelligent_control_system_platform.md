> Description of the solution

It can collect various environmental and equipment data, such as soil temperature and humidity, EC/PH value, air temperature and humidity, etc., and analyze and apply the data. It can automatically alarm and push notifications, and realize real-time viewing and management of equipment status. After setting parameters, it can automatically start the well pump and valves in sequence to achieve intelligent rotational irrigation. It also has functions such as well pump phase loss protection, water level protection, automatic water replenishment, constant pressure water supply, group control, and linkage control. Additionally, It can automatically replenish water or stop irrigation according to the set upper and lower limits of soil moisture, and can also operate in combination with rainfall forecasts.
