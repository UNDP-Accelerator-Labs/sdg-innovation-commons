> Title of the innovation

Tax Collection on Electronic Applications Online and Other Web Based Platforms Proposal 2021

> Brief description of the innovation

By establishing a more efficient way to collect tax from both willing and unwilling Taxpayers we would be able to facilitate the needed resources to help support Health Projects and the Zambian Current education infrastructure. I strongly believe by cutting out the redundancies through the current revenue collection model we can truly optimize and sustain revenue collection at a more consistent and compliant rate accordingly. The proposal still needs more research but it has proven quite effective from the initial research done after its implementation in more developed countries especially in the Southeast Asian Regions.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I know based on experience and engagements with fellow taxpayers that this innovative approach although somewhat intrusive would yield benefits in terms of lower non-compliance rates and lower instances of fraudulent transactions as the bank accounts would be monitored to a certain degree therefore making each taxpayer with a registered individual TPIN be given the chance to take part in the continual development of our nation Zambia.

> Technical Feasibility

This is feasible as most banks are based off well established digital platforms all the Zambia Revenue Authority would have to do is to link the description of the item purchased online then at the point of purchase the items Value Added Tax is implemented. The Banks currently in Zambia may act as WHVAT agents for all the taxpayers engaging in online business.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The fact that the wealth gap in Zambia grows larger and larger owed to the fact of societal greed and other macroeconomic factors. This innovation would not only limit the amount of imports coming into Zambia but shall also increase national sentiment for local businesses that would be given an incentive to grow due to decreased external business as the public would rather buy Zambian goods as opposed to those being manufactured outside of Zambia.
