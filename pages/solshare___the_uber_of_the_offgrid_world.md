In Bangladesh, an innovative startup called SolShare - has developed a renewable energy solution that connects solar-powered homes to the houses of neighbours who cannot afford a panel themselves, via a process known as swarm electrification. This enables the users of offgrid areas to generate not only electricity but also an income, using the power of the sun.
Here is a documentary on their work: https://www.aljazeera.com/program/earthrise/2021/6/12/power-swarm-a-revolutionary-approach-to-solar-microgrids
