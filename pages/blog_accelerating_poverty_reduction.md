Accelerating Poverty Reduction
MARCH 5, 2020
Despite Viet Nam’s remarkable achievements in poverty reduction at the national level, the poverty rate is still high and chronic in Ethnic Minority (EM) groups and EM areas.
While consisting of 16.9% of the country population, EM people, in 2016, account for 95% of the total Viet Nam’s extreme poor (living with less than US$1.9 per person per day, 2011 PPP) and 51.2% multi-dimensional poor (using national multidimensional poverty line).
The multidimensional poverty rate is extremely high among some EM groups, for example, 78.2% among H’mong group, counts for 96% poor households in Bac Kan and 85% in Dak Nong.
UNDP introduced 4M Accelerator Labs stages: Meet, Match, Mentor, and Move. The 4M initiative aims to enable ethnic minority women to change their mindset and break their isolation, thus changing their position in the markets. This helps change their life by realizing the potentials of their innovation and technological solutions such as e-commerce, e-pay, social media, and multi-stakeholder networks.
