Updated Nationally Determined Contribution in the Framework of the Paris Climate Agreement
OCTOBER 22, 2021
Guinea-Bissau formally adopted its first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) following the signing of the Paris Agreement on April 22, 2016, then its ratification by the Bissau-Guinean parliament on October 22, 2018.
Although the first NDC (called “iNDC”) expresses Guinea-Bissau's commitment to the fight against climate change, it did not present a quantified GHG mitigation objective. Today, Guinea- Bissau is determined to be even more proactive in favor of the climate by adopting a quantified and ambitious target, through the present update of the iNDC, in accordance with the recommendations of the Article 4.3 of the Paris Agreement.
The updated NDC is part of a broader vision of low carbon and climate resilient development. It is also in line with national requirements in terms of economic and social development.
