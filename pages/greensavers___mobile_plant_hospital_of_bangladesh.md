      A pick-up van with a stall-like structure fashioned in the back stands before a signboard which reads: “Plant illness? Come to the Mobile Plant Hospital”. Inside the stall, sit two men wearing white coats just like doctors do. This “mobile tree hospital” going around Dhaka city provides free care for plants. The care includes medicines and treatment, along with the needed love. The service goes door to door providing plants with the care they need. The initiative was taken by Green Savers Association, assisted by Dhaka North City Corporation and Square Pharmaceuticals. The doctors are available from 10:00am till 5:00pm. The stall also includes fun quizzes for young children, all going towards them being educated for a greener future. Since 2013, this initiative has been raising awareness on urban farming, technical support and prescription at the door step of the garden owner. The Mobile Tree Hospital travels various key locations in the city to spread awareness, give out free plant care, free saplings and nutrients to anyone who visits.
