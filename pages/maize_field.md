Maize field

> Brief description of the innovation

Its a 20*10 field of maize which covers about 1accre it has about 400 lines which all are convincing of growing in a good manner.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will generate income in a way that when it reaches the time of harvest I will sell it to the marketeers who sell fresh maize and by doing this am sure I will get something profitable even if it's not that much and the amount of money I will get I Kno it will add value to what I will do next. The value of my innovation to the environment is that the marketeers have something for them to sell at the market which also helps me and the marketeers to have atleast money.

> Technical Feasibility

For the maize to reach at the point of harvest it need fertilizer both d-compound and urea and it also need herbicides which helps in terms of weeding. My innovation is designed on a field  and there is no prototype that is there.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation can improve the life of others in a way that when I take it on the market those people who orders from me they also sell it to consumers where which makes them to have some money also. As at now it's more relevant because at the market right now there is not much business of maize unless during rain season.
