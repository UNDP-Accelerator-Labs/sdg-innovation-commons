## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Community based Waste Recycling and Logistics in Erdenet 2022
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to improve the waste management in Erdenet city through introduction of community based recycling and logistics center

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

There is limited success when it comes to sustainable waste management in Mongolia, and waste is still the main source of air pollution and soil pollution. Despite the implementation of various measures over the past 10 years to address solid waste, no consistent and sustainable results were achieved to date. Even though 50-80% of Mongolia's waste is recyclable, only about 1% is recycled. There are approximately 400 waste disposal sites nationwide, and 97% of them are open sites where waste is smoldered and burned throughout the year. The following issues make the recycling of solid waste challenging:   a. The existing legal framework aimed at recycling, reusing, and reducing waste is not well enforced. b. There are no real economic incentives for recycling, and the financing mechanism is unclear. c. The domestic recycling plants use outdated technologies and have financial difficulties. d. Informal waste pickers have a significant contribution to recycling, but they are inefficient. e. There is no comprehensive data. f. Inadequate infrastructure and management for collection, transportation, and storage for recycling management.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

We conducted a study among Erdenet residents on their waste behaviours, which can be accessed in the following link: SICA_UNDP_Final report_20210930_eng AT.docx (sharepoint.com)

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We would be able to utilize UNDP's convening power to bring many players such as government, CSO, informal waste pickers, citizens to the same table. At this moment, there is no other units and clusters are working on waste management issues and therefore, we would be well suited to conduct small scale experiment on the topic. Climate change and pollution is a pressing issue not only in Mongolia, but worldwide. This experiment would help in identifying whether community approach would work in waste management.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Will the community based recycling and logistical center model work in Erdenet? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioural insights - learn about behaviours of the residents to craft suitable interventions to start sorting at the source
Participatory design - our waste management concept should be based on local realities, therefore, important to involve local residents, as well as local waste management agency.
Pilots - we would start with small pilot to assess the success level
Smart cities - the idea is make improvements and innovations based on the realities of the city, rather than jumping into digital and technology solutions.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

It was very important to address actual needs of residents, to learn about their behaviours and habits with regards to waste. We conducted small ethnographic research on the spot, when we randomly visited households and asked them about their waste behaviors. We could see that households are used to accumulate their waste and through it only when they run out of bags or waste start discharging unpleasant smells. Even placing a waste bin near to their fence did not have any effect. That is why we decided to focus on awareness raising aspect during the latter half of the experiment. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

If this approach works, the amount of waste going into landfill will reduce, contributing to less soil and air pollutions. If this approach works in smaller cities such as Erdenet, it would be possible to expand it to other urban areas.
