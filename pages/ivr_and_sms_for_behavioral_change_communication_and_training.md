## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The purpose of this experiment is to see how we can deliver and impact our beneficiaries through collaboration, community engagement and an unusual way of doing things. Specifically, to prove that behavioral change communication campaign can be enhanced by use of digital technologies like Voice based Information service, targeted mass messaging campaigns, mobile surveys, social media chatbot campaign, and data visualizations. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

- If we conduct continues mobile surveys with Industrial parks then the park management  can plan it business continuity successfully  - If we conduct/push targeted mobile awareness creation campaigns then it will result in quick behavioral change  - Mobile technology (IVR) will make remote training possible in pandemic situations.  

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment
- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

As part of the COVID-19 response plan, the lab team partnered with the Industrial Park Development Corporation and VIAMO, a mobile tech company which excels in providing solutions in areas where technology infrastructure is poor, to develop an awareness creation campaign to empower employees to keep themselves safe and create positive work environment.  VIAMO’s platform allowed us to reach close to 20,000 workers across the country who speak multiple languages and have varying literacy levels. Viamo proved that using a ubiquitous infrastructure like a mobile phone can make data collection simpler for hard-to-reach places.  Before setting out on the camping, we needed to understand what information the workers were interested in having. Given the entrance restrictions to the parks due to the pandemic and the strict working hours, we could not get this information through the traditional means. Instead, we collected this data through mass phone calls with automated messaging. We got the necessary insight to design the type of communication campaign that would be of interest to the workers and addressed the information that they were not getting through other outlets. From a sample of 3,000 employees, we learned that respondents (48%) were interested in knowing more about the causes of COVID-19. 79% of respondents felt it was a personal responsibility to protect themselves from COVID-19. In addition, 35% of respondents said they would stay at home and self-medicate if they or a member of their household got infected with COVID-19 which prompted us to think about effective home care procedures. This supported the majority of responder’s (64%) understanding that COVID-19 symptoms without underlying conditions can be treated safely at home. Then, we developed a customized and targeted SMS and IVR message campaign and behavior change messaging that reached 18,579 workers. We pushed information directly to employees’ phones, but also provided and info line where they could access the information on their own time. The latter approached proved to be more effective as employees could access the information as they need rather than getting phone calls at time that might be inconvenient for them.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

It took almost Acc Labs 4 months full time.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

From our initial assessment, we were able to discern that the work environment itself was a source of stress for workers as they perceived a lack of communication from management on precautions and felt in the dark about the future of their jobs. The training included crisis communication tools that effectively deal with misinformation and communicate risks to employees.  The quiz results from the lessons had a correct rate of at least 70% (8 out of 12 modules) showing that most of the trainees understood what they learned. This controls the pandemic and creates a positive and productive working environment. Though we could see that trainees have acquired new knowledge, the remote nature of this exercise limited our ability to assess the exact impact of the intervention, especially to see if supervisors had started to practice what they had learned. Throughout this process, we were able to disprove prior assumptions that we had that it was impossible to reach industrial park workers due to locked down and the country's low technology experience. Using these technologies made it easier for us to collect, store, analyze, use, and disseminate data. It enabled us to collect information without putting anyone in danger. And because we were using both voice and SMS, we made information accessible to workers with diverse literacy levels. Making sense of the vast amounts of data collected within the industrial park and visualizing it helped to support IPDC revisit its business continuity plans and take some corrective measure.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We initially pushed information directly to industrial park workers phones, but also provided and info line where they could access the information on their own time. The latter approached proved to be more effective as employees could access the information as they need rather than getting phone calls at time that might be inconvenient for them and we amended the approach that way.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

195,000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, Acc lab team in partnership with governance team proposed a similar methodology to be widely implemented by Ministry of Piece for its Volunteer Youth. Concept note prepared and the ministry is considering additional investments

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

This initiative showcased how we delivered and impacted our beneficiaries through collaboration, community engagement and an unusual way of doing things. We proved that behavioral change communication campaign can be enhanced by use of digital technologies like Voice based Information service, targeted mass messaging campaigns, mobile surveys, social media and  chatbot campaign. The success of this initiative is exciting. The platform that we used reached the masses with the right information.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Getting industrial parks mobile phone information due to  data privacy issues and getting quick approval on contents from government was an issues. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Any UNDP projects want to reach many people with quality information via mobile phones

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Any one interested in mobile technology including government.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Customize it to your context and do it. We proved it can work.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, specially it can be applied for piece related issues with providing accurate information to community.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Yes, sense making and explorations works really helped us to refine our mobile intervention, design our messaging contents  dn 

> What surprised you?

The response rate is a bit lower than we expected
