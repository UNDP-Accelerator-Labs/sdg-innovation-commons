Objective: 

Overall goal: 

-Monitor habitat quality of inland aquatic ecosystems with citizen participation. 

Specific goals:  

-Generate a mapping of the habitat state of inland aquatic ecosystems. 

-Recognize the environmental factors that positively and negatively impact freshwater ecosystems. 

-Generate new monitoring tools for these ecosystems. 

-Calibrate existing tools to evaluate them. 

Description of citizen participation: Citizen scientists analyze the state of the habitat in aquatic environments, through the digital app for Android devices or the project website. The data and information collected are sent and centralized in the PreserVamos online database and are then used to generate a real-time, open-access map of the state of the aquatic habitat. 

In addition, citizen scientists can learn about the flora and fauna described near their location, thanks to the linking of the digital app with the ArgentiNat project database (iNaturalist), and learn about the environmental public policies of the municipality to which they belong. 

In turn, the municipalities that wish to participate in the project can request open access for their environmental areas to manage and visualize the data sent by the citizens of their territory. They can also request the project team to add specific environmental indicators to the app that they believe are relevant for the citizens of their environments and download and use project advertising material for events in their territory. 

Time frame: 08/01/2021 - N/A.
