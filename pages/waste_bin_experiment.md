## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Proper waste separation is a critical factor in enabling large-scale recycling. Proper waste separation strategy is still under planning at Ministry of Environment.  2. Proper waste separation requires physical infrastructure as well as awareness raising. Physical infrastructure starting from bin to waste collection truck play interconnected role in separating waste effectively. Cambodia is still lacking important physical infrastructure. 3. National standard for waste bin is required. Current design of waste bin is not standardized or unified. Different color, different size, and different design are seen across public bins. The national standard will cognitively inform citizen of separation type/container in each bin. It also ensures consistency across the country.  4. Color code and signage are required to guide user, a more inclusive and effective way. We interviewed informal waste collectors and general public and learnt that the design of public products usually miss the need from the marginalized group. Not everyone can read especially the poor and not everyone understands sign we use on current bins, let alone different sign on different bins.  5. Waste bin must be adaptive to its surrounding locations. One design for all is not effective given different need of users. Waste bin for tourist destination locations should have a larger compartment for compost waste (food waste and packages tourists bring with) while at  public parks compartment for plastic should be larger given the use of plastic bottle is more desirable in this location.

To be shared later, blog is in progress. 

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

COVID-19 posted a critical impact to the experiment. We cannot deploy full experiment as planned given the lockdown and restriction on people movement and gathering at public places. The national stadium we have a permission to use the space for the experiment was under lockdown and later turned into one of COVID-19 testing stations.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There is limited data addressing the issue of waste separation and no data at all regarding the standard or effectiveness of public bins. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?


## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We've worked with Agile Development Group which is an impact enterprise using human-centered design to create solutions for people with disabilities. Designing a product requires both in-depth knowledge of the issue your product is solving and engineering practicality. Agile Development Group and other engineering experts joined us to offer a session to help guide participants in the design challenge to ensure their crazy ideas for a better waste bin are feasible in term of material, architecture, and manufacturing technique.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We invited a professor from Royal University of Phnom Penh to be part of the judging panel. His work with informal waste picker mapping is vital for us to understand the relationship between waste in general and the role of informal waste picker.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?



> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Environment, National Council for Sustainable Development, Green Economy Department is onboarded and has offered policy and technical support to us since the beginning of this project. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

N/A

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?



> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
