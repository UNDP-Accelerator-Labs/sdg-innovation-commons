Manik BioHAP is a special water filter which uses beads made from hydroxyapatite from tilapia fish scales as its basic material. Hydroxyapatite has a high content of calcium ions, and when infused with water through the water filter for consumption, this can benefit consumers. This is because they would also be drinking water high in calcium and on top of that, clean and filtered water too. In essence, this can be used as a calcium supplement, and a source of filtered water.  Fish scales are the best choice as it also contains another element called beta-tricalcium phosphate which is able to produce even more calcium ions.
