Mapping the Tourism Services, Skills, Assets, and Stories of Madaba Governorate
AUGUST 31, 2023
In 2022, the Accelerator Lab participated in the design of the Country Programme Document (CPD) 2023-2027. From this process, UNDP Jordan learned that tourism was one of the top topics of interest. Not long after, a member of parliament representing Madaba requested the support of UNDP Jordan Country Office (CO) to develop tourism in the municipality and the CO asked the Lab to support this effort. In June 2022, the Lab launched a series of initiatives to understand the challenges, opportunities, and potential local solutions. From this data, one of the main insights was that Madaba and Jordan, in general, could use more stories to bring a human element to the tours and make the experience richer. We also learned that local skills, assets, and services could be better utilized and be part of tourism experiments. Therefore, we decided to map the tourism services, skills, assets, and stories in Madaba governorate in 2023 in a collaborative effort with the German Jordanian University (GJU).
In addition to getting a closer look at Madaba’s tourism potential, developing ideas for tourism experiments inspired by the data, and running an exercise that proved valuable and enjoyable for both the Accelerator Lab and the GJU, we hope that this mapping can serve as a reference for anyone looking to contribute to the development of the tourism sector and industry in Madaba and Jordan.
