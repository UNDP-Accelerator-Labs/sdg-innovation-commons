## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

UNDP Accelerator Lab Libya conducted an experiment with Tripoli Central Municipality and Janzour Municipality to reduce single-use plastic bags in supermarkets. The experiments were conducted in both Al-Mahari supermarket in Dahra area in Tripoli and Janzour Supermarket in Janzour where reusable bags were distributed once every two days to customers at the cashiers for the duration of 2 weeks. The scope of the experiment is to observe the behaviour of acceptance of reusable bags among the customers, and also among the supermarkets for them to start distribute them in the future.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

By placing both free plastic bags with a picture of plastic garbage on the streets and priced cotton bags with a picture of clean streets, some people will use the cotton bags, and the plastic bags utilization will reduce.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Reusable grocery shopping bags (4 weeks) i.      baseline study (1 day):  gather average number of consumed plastic bags per day/week/month   ii.      Week 1 BI intervention (3 days): placing the stands with bags Day 1 (Sunday) Day 2 (Tuesday) Day 3 (Thursday)   iii.      Week 2 BI intervention (3 days): placing the stands with bags Day 1 (Saturday) Day 2 (Monday) Day 3 (Wednesday)   iv.      Post intervention result study (2 weeks): count the number of consumed plastic bags; count number of costumers coming back with reusable bags

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

1) Baseline: average number of consumed plastic bags per day/week/month; 2) number of reusable bags taken during the intervention; 3) number of single-use bags taken during the intervention; 4) number of reusable bags taken after the intervention; 5) number of single-use bags taken after the intervention; 6) observation and interviews with supermarket and customers

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

First, make a basline study of average cunsomption of free to use plastic bags from 2 supermarkets of different locations. Second, start the intervention for 2 weeks by placing reusable bags on a stand next to the cashiers (the stands have images of clean and dirty streets). Third, count the number of free to use consued bags after the 2 weeks of intervention. Last, observe the reaction of customers and cashier tellers during the purchases. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

4 weeks

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Disproven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Initially, the experiment required to sell the reusable bags in order to see if the customers are willing to purchase the bags. However, due to UNDP rules, we could not sell them so the experiment is partially conducted.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

13 months (including pandemic lockdown periods)

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

7000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No next stages were planned. Interestingly enough, some came back with reusable bags, but not with a significant number. And, some were observed using the bags in a nearby bakery as these bags were more convenient in bakeries than in supermarkets to hold and carry freshly baked bread.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Nothing was planned. However, one municipality expressed interest in creating a policy to ban plastic bags in supermarkets if further similar projects were implemented. If the experiment will be replicated in bakeries, then it might have better results and the municipality will consider banning single-use plastic bags at least in bakeries.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The experiment process and results showed that in order to reduce single-use plastic bags in shops, the first target location should have been the bakeries as people are more inclined to use reusable non-plastic materials to hold and carry freshly baked bread. By doing this people will get more familiarized with the bag alternatives and can create a domino effect to replace single-use plastic bags in other shops (mainly grocery shops). Moreover, Accelerator Lab could not sell the bags in order to observe the reactions of customers. A better modality could have been implemented to sell the bags to the customers.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Not selling the bags because of UNDP rules was the main obstacle to not fully observe the reaction of customers on using alternative bags during shopping. Another obstacle was one of the supermarkets was banning people from bringing external bags which might created a mindset of not bringing reusable bags and use the convenient free-to-use plastic bags the supermarkets offer.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The environment programme pillar could have benefited from the results in order to create policies with the ministry of environment regarding reducing or banning single-use plastics. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Some municipalities which suffer from street solid waste could have benefited from the results as they have the authority to ban single-use plastics from distribution.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

The main iteration will be to change modality in order to sell the bags instead of distribute them for free in order to observe the reactions of the customers. Another iteration is to replicate the experiment in the bakeries instead of supermarkets a bakeries are as popular as grocery shops. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

The best advice is to identify a partner (either the government or the shops) who can sell the bags for the experiment purposes without infringe the UNDP rules and regulations.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

This experiment can be replicated to identify and observe rule changes for any consumer goods. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This experiment was based on other countries customs which should have been analyzed better for the Libya context and regulations.

> What surprised you?

Most people (from government, shop owners and customers) are aware of the environmental issues that is caused by single-use plastics, but it is clear from both exploration and experiment that there is no initiation from their parts as most of them rely on others to make the first move. UNDP can play a rule to nudge them to better respond to policy creations and implementations.
