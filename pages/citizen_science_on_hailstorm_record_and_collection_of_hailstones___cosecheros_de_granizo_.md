Overall goal Record hailstorms, collect hailstones and produce severe hailstorm data for forecasting programs. Specific goals • To disseminate scientific information about severe storms in the region and the importance of scientific collaboration of citizens in the study of the phenomenon. • In the app ‘Cosecheros de Granizos Córdoba’ (Hailstone Collectors from Córdoba, Argentina) citizens register the geolocation and time of hailstorms as accurately as possible. They can attach photographs and/or save hailstone samples at home, which will later be collected in an annual hailstone collection campaign. Hailstones should be stored in the freezer inside closed plastic bags with as little air as possible, at a temperature of -13 °C or lower. • Open data: For the general public. (Please, request data from granizoscba@gmail.com).
