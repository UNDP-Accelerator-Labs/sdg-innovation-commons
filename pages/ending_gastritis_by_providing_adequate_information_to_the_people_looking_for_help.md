ENDING GASTRITIS BY PROVIDING ADEQUATE INFORMATION TO THE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR HELP

> Brief description of the innovation

Our innovation strategy team will be looking at the following!

1. How to tell physically by glancing at a person’s face if they are suffering from chronic or acute gastritis 

2. What to do to relieve the pain when someone is under an acute attack

3. How to educate people who are living with gastritis

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Most people in sub Sahara africa and Africa at large including the western world at least 500 out of 100 individuals are living with gastritis 

Our vision is to provide solutions to such conundrum or predicament there by making money in the process 

We’ll create a gastritis free base for all herein to stay.

> Technical Feasibility

We have no prototype yet

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation is a tree and our focus is on how to make the roots of that tree scatter firm on the ground for the benefit of branchs and fruits thereafter
