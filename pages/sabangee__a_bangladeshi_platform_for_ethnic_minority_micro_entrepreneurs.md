Trishila Chakma, a minority youth leader from the hill tracts region of Bangladesh, is connecting indigenous entrepreneurs from Khagrachhari, Rangamati, Bandarban, Dhaka, Sherpur with resources and networks through her grassroots organization, SABANGEE, of which she is a co-founder along with Charchil Chakma. The Chakma word Sabangee means "work partners under the same roof". From traditional Chakma clothes such as "pinon-hadi", Manipuri ensembles such as "fanek-inafi" and sarees, Tripura outfits such as "rinnai-risa", to Garo "satranji" (floor rugs), ethnic silver jewelries, vegetables, spices, and condiments from the Chattogram Hill Tracts and homemade organic products, the group sells a diverse range of products.  Not only that, if a customer from Khagrachari or Rangamati wants a homemade birthday cake or a specific dress for a special occasion, s/he posts it on Sabangee and most of the time, is able to find the desired product. From a simple Facebook page, within around two years, Sabangee became an 18,000 member public group. There are more than 300 entrepreneurs, male and female, along with 20 moderators of the group.
