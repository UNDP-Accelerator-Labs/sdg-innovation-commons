> Title of the innovation

Tourism and Art

> Brief description of the innovation

I'm an artist and l believe art works best with tourism. Which is why lve decided to apply for this program.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I would like to expand my artistic horizon to greater heights and teach the young artists as well in terms of all things art. My target market would be tourist destinations like Livingston which is the tourist capital and some other places of such. This would generate income in a sense that we use recycled materials and artistically turn them into different kinds of attractive objects that people from all sorts of destinations can buy.. thus reducing pollution to the environment as well as generating income and extending the ideas to the younger generation.

> Technical Feasibility

It's depends with the different kinds of raw materials that we recycle side we only deal with recycled materials e.g. plastics, wood, paper etc

> Anticipated Social Impact

It Will help others others learn how to manage waste materials and we sometimes buy those materials hence creating jobs and 
it teaches more about climate change awareness

> Name of the Innovator

Joseph

> Age

- 19-35
