> Brief description of the innovation

The community dip tank will a 17,000 liters capacity, water and septic systems,  crush  and holding panes,  cattle handing clump, cattle scale on the crush pens and water drinking troughs for cattle within the holding panes. A committee consisting of the chairperson, the vice chairperson, the treasurer,  and trustees will be elected annually to run the system. Cattle owners will be paying service fees by cash or in kind in agreed period of time. Part of the income will be used to buy dip chemicals and maintenance of the system while the balance will be profit.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Cattle farmers in the area will pay for the services either by cash or in kind in an agreed period of time. Part of the payment will be used to run the dip tank and buy dip chemicals and the balance will be income. The farmers cattle will stop dying due to tick born diseases and the cattle start multiplying, the income will also be increasing proportionally. The system will minimize pollution of the environment as farmers will stop spraying dip chemicals on cattle in each village hence reduce chemical contamination of the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

The dip tank will be a 17,000 liter capacity. It will have a borehole with a 10,000 liter water tank on 6 meter steel water tank stand. The water will be pumped into the water tank by a solar powered submissive pump. A 40mm polythene pipe will run under ground into the dip tank for replenishing and will have a valve outside the dip tank. A surface water pump will be connected the dip tank for draining dirt water and pump in into a septic tank 100m away. There will be a cattle holding clump and a cattle scale on the crush panes.  The system will have drinking troughs in both entrance and exit holding panes. The prototype is at 90% completion at Mwapula Forest Reserve, in Chisamba.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Cattle rearing is a game changer among smallholder farmers as they can convent low quality grass in meat. However, tick-borne diseases is the main  challenge in increasing the number and quality of cattle. The community dip tank will eradicate tick-borne diseases allowing cattle farmers to increase their heads and quality of cattle hence their income from cattle. Farmers will me able to meet the ever high demand for beef in Zambia and the region hence improve the lives of both farmers and consumers.
