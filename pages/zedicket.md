> Title of the innovation

Zedicket

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is a development of an application that can be used to buy bus tickets around the country to mitigate Covid-19 and reduce personal contact between travellers and bus operators. The platform will be available on mobile app on android and iOS as well as USSD code on all networks in Zambia.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income for me by an interest accumulated via each ticket sold, for example if a ticket from Lusaka to Nakonde costs K340, on the app it will cost K360 and the k20 will be profit for the company and we will also consider negotiating a small discount on the seats sold as commission.
This will cause instant efficiency in the buying of tickets and will help to mitigate the Covid-19 situation by lessening the interactions between the people selling tickets and the travellers.
The challenge prize will help me to meet the monetary requirements for setting up the business

> Technical Feasibility

I do not have a prototype for my innovation. The implementation will be done in conjunction with the respective bus operators

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will improve the lives of consumers by reducing their risk to get Corona virus and offer convenience for them by not having to go to intercity to buy tickets and back to their houses
