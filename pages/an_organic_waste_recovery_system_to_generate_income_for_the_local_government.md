> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Co-creation of waste management solutions



> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

How to improve the collaboration between society and public institutions to increase resilience to climate change



> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How to improve waste management



> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Private Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Waste collectors, waste generators, selling companies and buyers


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to learn if implementing a composting and commercialization system of their products will generate an income for the municipality and will fill blank spaces about composting practices and commercialization. We need to understand what the components are required to commercialize organic waste, from the collection to the storage, processing, sale, and administration. We need to know who needs to be involved, what actions they need to implement, how should be organized. It's important to learn how to implement this system at small scale before scaling up, to facilitate adaptation and reduce risks associated with failure.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If a composting and commercialization system of their products is implemented, then income will be generated for the municipality



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

To implement the composting system

and market its products, the actors involved in its implementation must be

identified (organic waste generators, collectors, processors, sellers, and

buyers). Then an initial logistics must be defined, including the procedures

that each actor involved must follow. The system is put into operation during

the determined period, collecting information on the volume and weight of

organic waste, the income generated, and feedback from each actor participating

on what has gone well and what can be improved. The recommendations made are

assessed and the cycle is repeated. It must be considered that parts of the

cycle can be perfected more frequently, while the decomposition process

requires more time for its first feedbacks. 



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Each time the system for composting and marketing the products is launched.



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Direct observations, focus groups to know the things that worked and those that did not from everyone involved in the process. 



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

4 months



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

 Time to conduct the focus groups and skills to analyze the data from the composting and commercialization system implemented
