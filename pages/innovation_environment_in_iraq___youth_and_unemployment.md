Innovation Environment in Iraq - Youth and Unemployment
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is a limited enabling innovation environment amongst youth in Iraq that is driving tunnel-vision of employment. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The sensing and exploring activities of the UNDP - Accelerator Lab in Iraq during 2020 showed that there is a limited innovation environment in Iraq that is limiting youth from escaping the tunnel-vision of employment. Tunnel-vision of employment defined as the limitation youth put on their education and career options in an attempt to guarantee themselves government jobs influenced by social, economic, and policies pressures.   There are different causes and drivers for the limited innovation environment in Iraq, mainly within the education system, public and private institutions and the overall culture in Iraq. To start with the higher education system in Iraq depends mainly on offline and traditional teaching methods. First, it is based on  memorization of material and not thinking out-side the box and creating something new. Adding to that, students in universities don’t aspire to learn more than what is written in the official textbooks. Third, teachers and professors inside universities have limited access to online tools and innovation tools to support their own personal development and students’ development. Most importantly, the enabling institutional environment to enhance the innovation culture is just forming.  The private sector also helps in escalating this problem. First, the private sector in Iraq is very small, this is because private companies focus on traditional business and don’t consider expanding their operations to include different sectors. Mainly the sector is focused on real estate, car trade, and focus mainly on importing not manufacturing. Hence, limiting the need to innovation and expansion of economic opportunities to benefit wider youth groups.  The public and private institutions structure in Iraq is inherited from the social system, such systems largely focus on creating economic opportunities for all, of course this in theory since now corruption is eliminating this benefit, and they don’t tend to create the environment, policies, and functions that enhance competition and drive innovation.  The accumulated factors resulted in producing individuals who have limited capacities to think out of the box and innovate, and who have low tendency to take risks. Adding to that, the policies don't encourage embeddedness of innovation and the initiation of local startups.  The stakeholders involved in this challenge include youth themselves, the public sector, private sector, universities, I/NGOs and the entrepreneurs. These stakeholders are the main drivers for the innovation ecosystem in Iraq who are directly involved to affect the tunnel vision of employment among the Iraqi youth. The current situation of the innovation environment in Iraq can be analysed and described based on culture, the provision of common spaces, the institutional structure and the access to finance to develop innovative ideas. These factors are detailed below:  First, the culture in Iraq is not innovation and business-oriented in general. This is mainly because of the years of wars that led citizens to be risk-averse, hence starting a business is not a common option for young people, and usually it is not encouraged by the community.  Second, there is a lack of an enabling culture environment to enhance innovation like common spaces, innovation hubs, and accelerators and incubators. Youth around Iraq miss the opportunity to have a common space specialized for young people to meet up, brainstorm and work on their projects. With the presence of limited opportunities for youth to build healthy networks and healthy relationships.  Third, public and private institutions in Iraq do not have clear and communicated vision or policy to empower youth and direct them to innovate especially in the field of business and entrepreneurship. The added value of supporting youth in those fields is not well realized. Which is resulting in poor communication and poor approach (usually institutions adopt charity-based approach dealing with youth). Moreover, there is a lack of capacity among those institutions to utilize the opportunity of working with young people. Youth available capacities are not fully utilized in inactivated fields like agriculture, industry and services sector, considering the high demand in these fields.  Fourth,  there is a limited access to finance to experiment and implement innovative ideas. Youth in Iraq has very limited opportunities when it comes to access to finance; the main source of financial support would be their close family members. While the financial support from the private sector remains very limited and not well organized or visible. On the other hand, bank loans take a very long time and it requires guarantees not obtainable by many young people. In general, banks do not have faith or trust in start-ups especially those led by youth. The limited enabling innovation environment in Iraq affects the wheel of development in the economic, social, environmental, and other aspects, whether in the short and long term, below will explain the undesired effects.   Economic Effects:  First, It will make the country's economy dependent on two sides. The first is dependence on importing foreign products and commodities, and thus it will burden the state on the foreign currency, and cause weakness in supporting local production and developing the private sector, especially the industrial sector. Second, In the long term, these limitations will lead to the de-escalation of the innovation wheel at the level of individuals, institutions, and companies emanating from the stakeholders themselves.  This will lead to solutions that are not sustainable and may not be fit to solve the current problems because they arise from other countries and communities and not the local community. Third, the lack of innovation will decrease establishing new startups which means the  job opportunities will be limited and focusing on the employment in  public sectors and large companies. As we knew, the public sector has already suffered from underemployment and the private sectors suffered from lack of investment.      Social Effects:  First, when people depend on importing solutions and products from other counties and communities without there being innovation from themselves or compatibility with the local reality and the real need of the beneficiaries. This will negatively affect their sense of responsibility towards their place in and the society they live with. the system will be no adaptable to emergency crises and rapid dynamic changes in the world. Second, day by day, the opportunity of the innovation from youth will decrease because of the lack of success stories, which means there are bad effects on the cultural and scientific level of Iraqi society because in this case there will be no incentives to develop skills and develop the capabilities of minds for more inventions. Especially since the current education system in schools and universities depends heavily on spoon feeding. Environment Effects: First, Iraq is an oil country, and its economy depends on oil imports, and as we know that the age of industries dependent on fossil fuels will become extinct because the world is working on the use of renewable energies and focuses on how to reduce environmental pollutants and reduce the phenomenon of climate change. Thus, the lack of innovations in the field of environment, energy, and climate at the local level will cause future environmental problems at a local level. Iraqi government will face an international responsibility to protect the environment globally. Second, in the one side, the Iraqi young people have the brilliant mindsets for innovation and creativity, on the other side, the universities and colleges have the rich theoretical environmental knowledge and inventions but  they don’t have the innovative way of work  to implement these information and solutions fitting with the current needs because  of the limited enabling  innovation environment  and ecosystem  especially  in environment, energy and climate.       

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

First, Iraq is not within top innovator countries neither globally or regionally. Globally, there is a lack of data globally on the innovation status in Iraq. The Global Innovation Index for The Global Economy does not include Iraq; Iraq is not even ranked according to its innovation due to lack of data. https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Iraq/GII_Index/ . Adding to that, regionally Iraq is not amongst the top 10 innovative countries in the MENA:  https://altahreernews.com/2508/  Second, the number of undergraduate students and the graduates from the Iraqi public universities are essential to the innovation environment in Iraq as these youth will be the core and the fresh minds to drive the innovation ecosystem as the near future will rely on their capabilities and motivation:

First, recently, many publications are addressing innovation in Iraq, hence driving the urgency to focus on innovation. First, there is  a publication on Revitalising Science, Technology and Innovation in Iraq http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Iraq/pdf/RevitalisingSTI_inIraq_Roadmap.pdf. Second, there is another publication by Science, technology, and innovation exploring innovation in Iraq and how decades of instability affected the innovation ecosystem in Iraq. https://stiiraqdev.wordpress.com/2013/11/09/innovation-in-iraq-context/ . Also, some magazines are publishing about innovation and how it is essential for entrepreneurs in Iraq, more information can be found here: BusinessLandscapeII_Web.pdf (kapita.iq)  All these publications are aiming to set the ground for innovation in Iraq, mainly focusing on how innovation has a role in creating entrepreneurial opportunities for youth.  Second, also, there have been initiatives focusing on fostering innovation culture in Iraq. One such initiative is Iraqi Innovators, which is aiming at creating a culture for innovation in Iraq, more information on the NGO can be found here: https://iraqtech.io/ . Also, other co-working spaces, innovation hubs, and accelerator labs are focusing on innovation in Iraq : https://the-station.iq/ and https://www.oxfamamerica.org/explore/research-publications/oxfam-innovation-lab/. Third, also, cooperation between the different actors is happening in order to enhance the culture of innovation and expanding entrepreneurial opportunities in this regard: https://www.arabnet.me/english/editorials/events/hubs-iraq-hackathon.  Hence there are some efforts to establish innovation grounds in Iraq and this is the time to build on these innovations and start enhancing the innovation enabling environment in Iraq.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

First, the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will focus on exploring the fundamental reasons for the limited innovation environment in Iraq and work on policy-level changes to embed tools for innovation within Iraqi institutions.  The Accelerator Lab focuses on the local community prioritized challenges to innovation. The AccLab is using innovative and localized ways to sense and explore the reasons for lack of innovation in Iraq and to enhance the innovation culture within youth. The AccLab in Iraq will use localized training material to empower the local community to decide on their most prominent challenges.  Second, The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use unusual sources of data in order to understand the nature of the innovation environment in Iraq. The UNDP-AccLab will work on finding innovative methods to acquire data on innovation in the newly liberated areas.  Third, the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use innovative methodologies to spark thinking in an innovative way with our partners. The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will work on embedding innovative methodologies like future thinking and behavioral insights within the work of government partners on ministry level. Adding to that, the UNDP-AccLab will work on embedding innovative methodologies to the thinking of teachers and students within the higher education system in Iraq. Fourth, The UNDP- AccLab in Iraq will focus on building  several partnerships at various levels and bridges between the beneficiaries in order to share lessons learned, insights, information, and experiences on an ongoing basis, while investing in the local resources available between them. These partnerships  will enhance the connectivity in the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Iraq and embed that in the UNDP. Fifth, mapping, experimenting and scaling new sustainable development local solutions in a portfolio approach to tackle the mentioned challenge. Encouraging the bottom-up approach is one of the main activities of the lab since these local solutions are coming from the heart of the problem by the locals who lived it day in and day out. Mainly the lab is within a huge network from the locals that ease the process of tapping the actual need in the innovation environment in Iraq. Sixth, learning is the main part of the work cycle of the accelerator lab where the lab is capable of scaling the indigenous knowledge and the lab’s insights into a systemic change within a small period of time.

What are the components of the portfolio approach that can strengthen the work of innovation environment enablers in Iraq?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

First, Behavioral Insights:  The UNDP-Acc Lab in Iraq will use BI Approach in order to understand the behaviors and actions that are initiated by entrepreneurs in cooperation with business incubators in Iraq affiliated to the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs. The team will use TESTS Module and COM-B Module with innovative and Human centered Tools to identify the specific behaviors and experiment several interventions with entrepreneurs and incubators’ trainers to scale the positive change that could be made. Second, Human-Centered Design: the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use human-centered design approaches, specifically Design Thinking, in order to support the portfolio approach and embed innovation mentality within the mindset of Iraqi youth. This will also support the portfolio approach through directing youth mentality to find innovative solutions that tackle the existing gaps.  Third, Solutions Mapping: the UNDP-Acclab in Iraq will find out what is already working and do more of that through the process of mapping, experimenting, and scaling the identified local solutions. In terms of the learning question, we will find local solutions that target the innovation environment in Iraq. Precisely, we will conduct a huge call for innovation activity in partnership with Iraq Crisis Response & Resilience Programme (ICRRP) to strengthen the innovation environment in Iraq during the recovery period of COVID-19. The value of the local solutions lies in its structure where it is structured in a way to tackle the actual needs as the locals who come with the solutions are living the problem and know its details. Fourth, System Thinking: The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use systems’ thinking at the start of the sensing, exploring, and experimenting in order to map the system, the active stakeholders, the existing gaps and opportunities. This will enable us to find the critical points for intervention.  Fifth, Future Analysis and Future Thinking: The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq will use future thinking approach, specifically mapping signals of change, within the UNDP-CO in Iraq and also within the innovation environment in Iraq in order to sense and explore the methods and tools that can support the portfolio approach to enhance change within the innovation outlook in Iraq. This will show the critical points of intervention, from a future perspective, and enable us to make sustainable change. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

First, there is a lack of sensor and sensor network data in Iraq, especially data that take a long-term perspective on the most suitable methods, tools, and local solutions that survive sustainable development. Second, it is difficult for decision-makers/ enablers or those working in the field of development institutions to identify accurate and specific gaps and opportunities in entrepreneurship due to the weakness of using innovative analysis tools that depend on users' journeys of key players in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Third, in Iraq data is scarce. There is a lack in both quantitative and qualitative data. In terms of quantitative there is a gap in reporting actual numbers and many different sources have different numbers, hence this hinders access to information. Adding to that, qualitative data that explore the individual psychology and the effect of the culture and.  Fourth, there is a lack of sources of data about the innovation environment in Iraq, especially in newly liberated areas. Hence, there is a need to know who are the active players, the existing efforts and initiatives, and the possible collaborations to enhance the innovation environment. Overall, these new sources of data will be the core insights for the innovation environment enablers in Iraq in order to design programmes and activities that match the targeted segment needs.
## Learning questions
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The benefits from working on enabling the innovation environment in Iraq can be reflected on the educational system in Iraq. The education system in Iraq lacks the innovation factor during the journey in higher education in Iraq (from freshman to senior students). Hence, our work will be directly linked in the future to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MoHESR) as a growth stage of our current  work of enabling the innovation ecosystem among youth. We have more than 995k graduates from Iraqi universities from different fields of study, hence the ministry will be the champion who can adopt our work in the form of creating incubation centers inside the universities to strengthen this innovation ecosystem in Iraq. It is worth mentioning that MoHESR and AccLab started initial discussion about the above growth.
