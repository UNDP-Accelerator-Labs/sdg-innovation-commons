I have a 16 hactare family land where I want to build bans to start growing mushrooms for commercial markets in Lusaka.The land in question is in Chipepo village on the shores of lake kariba.the village is almost connected to Lusaka be tarmac through the bottom road which is part of the Link 8000 project.the village is currently connected to the power grid and has great potential in fish farming on lake kariba.the mushroom farming business would I'm inventorily lead to creation of a factory for fish feed production in the Long run to supply fish farmers with locally produced fish feed with multiplier effects

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project will create job opportunities for the youths in the area.the motivation for the project is to ensure that my daughter Aquina Hakanomba becomes self sufficient since she is a gifted chemical engineer graduate who is currently not employed.The innovation will be the beginning of a family dynasty to encourage children in the village to see the benefit of going to school for tomorrow's children.

> Technical Feasibility

Studies have been conducted and the humidity conditions of the area would support mushroom growing.the valley have extremely conducive weather for this project and the available water resources allows easy diversification to support other supportive projects earlier alluded to.i.e support to fish feed production and fish seed growing to support fish farmers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The social impact of the project is extremely high because of the multiplier effects.the mushroom farming project is climate smart agricultural innovation with a ready market which is accessible by good road network.the locals will benefit from the innovation by cutting down on fish feed costs theirby improvement in disposal incomes for the local citizens.
