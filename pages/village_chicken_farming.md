> Title of the innovation

Village chicken farming

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is based on farming chickens, Looking at the shortage of village chickens at the markets, I came up with a plan to start keeping village chickens on a large scale by visiting villages to buy small chicks.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This business will generate enough money because in the urban here there is a shortage of these chickens. Most of the chickens found on the market are broilers and layers.
This time most people have gained the knowledge of stopping the GMO foods because of some health issues, My business is based on a natural farming unlike the use of chemicals.

> Technical Feasibility

This plan will engage the building of a large chicken run because at the moment the present one can only accommodate about 100 chickens. The design of the run involves chicken wire,wire face, roofing sheets and blocks.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The business has the the great impact on the health on the society bacause people will be buying chicken which will have no GMOs hence will not have any health effects on people. It will as help in the availability of food on the market because like here in my area there are no chickens unless broilers which are grown with chemicals.
