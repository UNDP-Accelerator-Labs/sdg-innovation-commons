Women's socio-economic inclusion is crucial for sustainable development, promoting economic dynamism, social cohesion, and community prosperity. However, in rural and underserved areas, women face significant barriers to participation. Limited economic opportunities and entrenched gender stereotypes confine women to household duties, while men typically engage in income-generating activities, often through labor outmigration. Recognizing these challenges, UNDP has launched the Women Creative Laboratory (WCL) initiative as part of its effort to foster creative economy and provide women in rural areas with opportunities to generate income. The Lab introduced the first women-oriented coworking space, offering a supportive peer environment where residents could receive specialized training, tutoring, and seed funding to develop business ideas in diverse creative industries such as sewing, business, social media management, design, and sales. You can learn more about the Lab in our previous blog.

The concept of the Lab emerged from the AccLab’s exploratory fieldwork activities, which involved engaging activists and grassroots organizations focused on women's empowerment in Kyrgyzstan. Preliminary findings identified two main barriers to women's participation in creative industries: the lack of physical spaces for engagement and the absence of a cohesive community offering peer-to-peer support. Subsequent UNDP’s research on creative skills among youth conducted in 2023 quantitatively validated these conclusions, revealing a strong interest among women in pursuing creative employment. Notably, 69% of women respondents expressed a desire to work in creative industries, either as freelancers or within creative businesses. However, 24% identified the "absence of family support" as a significant barrier to entering the creative economy. Additionally, 59% of women emphasized the importance of establishing secure creative spaces where they can meet, share ideas, support one another, and exchange experiences. The Lab was designed to address these challenges and empower women by monetizing their creative expression, providing them with the necessary resources and support.However, the Laboratory is more than just a physical space. It is a nurturing environment where women and girls can feel comfortable, build self-confidence, develop new skills, discover opportunities, and improve their quality of life. Beyond providing essential skills like financial literacy, the Lab provides psychosocial support and fosters an environment conducive to exchanging information and knowledge on gender equality, legal rights, and even sexual and reproductive health. It is a safe space for exploring issues of concern for women, recognizing that their productive capacities are often contingent on their overall well-being, including physical and emotional health.

The Lab aims to affect a mindset shift by changing attitudes towards traditional roles of women in society among beneficiaries, their family members, and the community at large. By contributing to household incomes, women gain higher status within their families. By empowering themselves economically, women and girls can achieve greater social and political rights within their communities and beyond. They enhance their status within the family as co-earners and gain self-esteem in the community as productive members of society. According to one of the residents in Osh WCL:“At some point in my life, I began to think that my lot was to be at home with the children. My husband is busy earning a living in Russia. I started to lose myself in household chores. But coming to the laboratory, I discovered a new me. Now I am confident that I can become a great programmer and crafts enthusiast without ceasing to be a good mother.”Being with like-minded people, women gain recognition of their potential and the courage to venture beyond household chores. There is power in numbers. According to Social Identity Theory developed by Henri Tajfel and John Turner, individuals derive their identity and self-esteem from the groups they belong to. When people are part of a supportive and like-minded group, they can experience a shift in their feelings and attitudes because the group's norms and values redefine what is considered acceptable or admirable behavior. This can lead to an increase in positive self-conception as individuals align themselves with the group's identity. Within the Women Creative Lab (WCL), women allow each other to gain self-confidence and overcome the societal pressure and self-imposed feeling of shame often associated with “neglecting” household chores. This collective environment normalizes new behaviors and shifts mindsets, enabling women to embrace creativity and personal growth. It empowers women to explore new roles, acquire new skills, and promote the idea that income generation beyond traditional household duties is valuable for family well-being. In doing so, women not only gain permission to pursue their aspirations but also contribute to reshaping societal norms toward greater inclusivity and empowerment.

According to Altynai Abdyshova, resident of the Osh Laboratory: "The laboratory is a community of victorious women. It's a place where new ideas, plans, and dreams are born! It's a circle where you can be heard and accepted regardless of age, social status, field of activity, or nationality."Additionally, by organizing themselves under the umbrella of the Lab, women gain agency in representing their interests when communicating with local authorities. The Collective Efficacy Theory(link is external), developed by sociologist Robert Sampson, underscores how individuals gain confidence and a sense of agency when they belong to a cohesive group with shared beliefs and goals. It suggests that the strength and unity of a community can amplify its members' capacity to achieve desired outcomes and exert influence over their environment. Being part of an organization gives women a sense of belonging and pride in being part of something larger—a force for positive change in their communities. This collective identity empowers them to advocate effectively for their needs and aspirations, fostering a supportive environment where women's voices are heard and respected in local decision-making processes.Working on stereotypes and normative change is crucial because without addressing these underlying beliefs and societal norms, any intervention aimed at empowering women will likely be temporary. Changing mindsets is essential because it influences how behaviors and attitudes are passed down from generation to generation. When stereotypes and norms shift, this cultural change becomes sustainable, ensuring that progress continues beyond individual engagements of Lab residents. We believe that establishing the WCL network across all regions of Kyrgyzstan can sustain and scale the impact of the Labs. In these environments, the ethos of "women supporting women" naturally evolves, enabling women to achieve their aspirations while also reshaping societal roles. This transformation paves the way for a future where women and girls have equal opportunities to realize their potential and contribute meaningfully to their communities.
