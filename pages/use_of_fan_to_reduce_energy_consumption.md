Yes, in Australia

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

This solution applies to cities around the world who use air conditioners to cope with heat and which demand high electricity consumption, dependent on fossil fuels and thus increase emissions. The study found that moving air with electric fans in combination to air conditioning could serve as a sustainable alternative, reducing air conditioner use and associated greenhouse gas emissions without sacrificing thermal comfort.  A simple existing technology that is accessible to millions of people every day can be combined with air conditioning to potentially provide a sustainable low-tech cooling solution.   Results show that the use of fans in combination with air conditioners provides a way of maintaining thermal comfort while reducing greenhouse gas emissions: 76% reduction in energy use (from 5592 GWh to 1344 GWh) and associated greenhouse gas emissions (from 5091 kilotonnes to 1208 kilotonnes).This practice can be extended with a campaign

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- It doesn´t require much training, other than putting in practice, measuring electricity consumption reduction to extend the practice in those countries or cities that rely on air conditioning.

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

Practically 0- the cost of an electric fan

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

It has been tested and results show a 76% of reduction in energy use.

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

Published but dissemination is needed so population adopts this practice.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

76% reduction in energy use (from 5592 GWh to 1344 GWh) and associated greenhouse gas emissions (from 5091 kilotonnes to 1208 kilotonnes).
