I visited Milyanfan village, 20 minutes from Bishkek, capital of Kyrgyzstan. As there is no centralized infrastructure, each family decides on how to heat their house. Because of the high electricity cost, most people  use coal for this purpose which is the  determinant of extremely bad air quality in Bishkek.  In one of the houses I saw an interesting  furnace which is the core of the heating system of the house. It was made by the owner of the house. As he said, they bought this house just a year ago and last year he was notifying that they spent too much on coal, moreover it took a lot of efforts  for him and his family members to look after the furnace and add coal every 40-45 minutes to maintain certain temperature. Moreover, they also had to pick all the ash with their hands, otherwise the furnace might become clogged very shortly. 


So, with his engineer background, he created a new furnace where you can open the top, put coals in three buckets from which the needed amount of coal automatically goes to the fire; it is enough for 12-14 hours, meaning you need to put coal only twice a day, not every 40 minutes. It is very efficient for maintaining the temperature, as if you miss your time to put coal in the traditional furnace, the home temperature goes lower immediately and you need to spend more coal to warm up the system - > more air pollution & more expenses.  Furthermore the ash is also collected in a separate part of the furnace, which they further use as natural fertilizer.


Recently he installed thermostat into the system - so it is already a semiautomated heating system. The inventor also mentioned, that all his neighbors are interested in this approach and ask him either explain the technology or ready to pay him for his help. Thus, he has become a positive deviant in the village (what he does not know yet =) ). Unfortunately, I was not able to take photos of the internal parts as the furnace was on the working mode.
