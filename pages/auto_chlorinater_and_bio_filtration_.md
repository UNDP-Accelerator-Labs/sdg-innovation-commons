> Brief description of the innovation

the innovation is  a engineering product that provide the solution for clean and safe ,it auto chlorinates water and uses a bio filter for filtration  of water.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

the innovation is by jonzib enterprise, providing clean and safe water is a gov't policy but how to provide that clean water is a challenge. good our company as a solution ,the product can be sold to gov't directly or water utility companies. the product is for any industry mines ,schools,banks as long as the institutions needs clean and safe water .regarding the environment it uses a bio filter rather than the sand filters  used by water utility companies .

> Technical Feasibility

- the product is produced using local materials and can be reproduced for increased production  .
- the is new in the water filtration  and chlorination as well as supply.

> Anticipated Social Impact

-the innovation will help in providing clean and safe water
-employment due to increased local production
- sustainable engineering manufacturing [ recycling materials]
- colloraboration with universities  for applied education rather than class education.
-tax paying
-value addition especially copper and steel.
