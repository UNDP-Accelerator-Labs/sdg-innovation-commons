> Title of the innovation

Cut one plant two.

> Brief description of the innovation

With the current global warming effect, we always need to think of a strategic plan to combat global warming. This innovation is to make it mandatory for each land owner/title per Hector of land to have a minimum of 20 pine trees planted. Provided with enough seed in every district, raise nurseries and sale seedlings at an affordable price.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Let's say I get seeds for k500, that is 4500 seeds approximately. It takes approximately 5-6 months from sowing to seedling point of sale. Selling each seedling at k20, the expected income per 4500 seedlings will be K90 000 approximately every year.
This will create employment to many youths.
This will make pine seedlings readily available and accessible to every individual.

> Technical Feasibility

Availability of enough start-up capital. Engaging the forestry departments, the council and lands department. For every plot that is sold by the council, let every buyer buy pine seeds instantly. For every approved architectural plan for a certain plot, let it contain a 'Tree lay out plan'. The forestry departments not to allow unnecessary cutting down of these trees unless with guidance from the department.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Selling at a very affordable price, Individuals can be buying in bulk and selling them at a higher price to make profit out of it.
Accessibility of seedlings on the market.
Effects of cutting down trees to the environment.
