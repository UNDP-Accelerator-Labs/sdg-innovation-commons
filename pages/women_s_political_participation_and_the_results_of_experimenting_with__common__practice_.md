## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- That UNDP's definition of political participation and accordingly its investments in it is too narrow  - Women empowerment branding does not necessarily contribute to the mission, in some cases like in our show it has shown that a non-branded approach can gain wider adoption  - Efforts to break norms need to understand the impact of "common business/ media/ political practices" on what norms are and work to create "common" practices that showcase the value  - More men watched the show than women  - Money spent on Women political participation needs to rally measurable number of women in a pipeline to power

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The effectiveness of women empowerment media and comms in the traditional ways we are used to them at UN agencies. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Online social networks and Traditional media now represent a complementary ecosystem, and for us to address norms we must be able to measure perception as a proxy for readiness of adoption of demographics to the idea of more women on platforms and as political leaders, hence the approach we devised was capable of measuring viewership in a desegregated way which sheds light on how we can target this goal without ambiguity of what works to secure media as leverage. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We presented the work to 60 CSO after in the Lebanese feminist coalition to consult on our next season and to share insights with great success.
