> Description

One of the main barriers for households to formalize their domestic workers so that they can gain access to social insurance is the adminstrative and bureaucratic process of registering themselves as employers and their domestic workers as contributor to social insurance. To overcome this AccLabPY and the Ministry of Labor developed a protocol for one-on-one advising via whatsap and telephone calls. It is a prototype of a public service that could be offered by the Ministry of Labor or the Institute of Social Provision.
