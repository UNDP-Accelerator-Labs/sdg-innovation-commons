> Title of the innovation

Agri-Connect

> Brief description of the innovation

Our innovation(Agri-Connect) is a one-stop Ecommerce Agro website/app that offers solutions to farmers, small retailers, vendors, kiosk owners &amp; other multi-segment customers. The application/site will consist of 2 segments, a B2B food distribution section called “The MarketPlace” and a unit called the “Farmers Hub” where we provide farmers with technical assistance and sell Farm inputs.Through our platforms we aggregate demand from customers looking to purchase agricultural produce and match it with supply aggregated from small and medium-scale farmers.
 AgriConnect will control crop supply, source agricultural produce at pre-agreed prices, ensure crop quality &amp; distribute food at cheaper prices. Users can order fresh fruits, vegetables, dry foods &amp; processed foods which get delivered efficiently &amp; quickly. We aim to “make farming easy” by increasing our suppliers efficiency and ability to grow crops yearlong by promoting irrigation systems, quality inputs, and technical support. In the “farmer’s hub” we will  give farmers real-time responses to  issues they face and also information on their crop yields, approximations on expected rainfall, soil PH testing, etc.The farmers will also be able to purchase a variety of inputs on our platform from different Agro-dealers and have them delivered straight to their farms.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

THE MARKETPLACE
In this unit we will apply a markup revenue model, we will source produce from farmers at low prices, add up expenses, and create markups on units sold. Our focus will be distributing high-velocity foods found on the daily food basket of consumers. The ideal customers are small traders who are high volume, low service customers. We will target traders in high-density neighborhoods with core clientele, to reduce incremental costs to serve. We will use technology to optimize costs of last-mile delivery &amp; keep food waste low through efficient handling and storage.
          THE FARMERS’ HUB
This has two revenue streams, when selling farm inputs we will display various products from agro-dealers and get commissions on all sales made through our platform. Customers will also pay a “delivery charge” for us to deliver inputs.
The other revenue stream for the technical assistance &amp; other value-added services will adopt a hybrid pricing system; various combinations of pricing tactics will occur.
The benefit to the farmers is a predictable rate for their produce, timely payments and release from the hassles of selling produce – which increase post-harvest wastage. 
Vendors are assured of getting  reliable,cheap and quality produce that is traceable.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation (Agri-Connect)  will be accessible on any mobile device via a mobile app, website, and ussd platform to allow the inclusiveness of traders and farmers who aren’t tech-savvy to access the services with ease. A call center and physical sales representatives will also be a mode of collecting orders from traders and placing purchase orders with farmers.
We plan to streamline cashless payments with traders and farmers by incorporating mobile money and other payment gateway solutions to reduce transaction costs of handling cash and recording of transactions in real-time.
Our social media platforms will have AI chatbots to improve and have 24/7 customer care that can respond to customer problems and also facilitate collection of orders.
We will also use AI(Artificial intelligence) to map out customers and organize deliveries for maximum efficiency.
Lastly, our innovation will promote financial inclusion for our suppliers and customers through the recording of transactions into digital ledgers. The data stored will present an opportunity for a third party financial institution to determine the credit worthiness of  our users and give out loans to them.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our Target city Lusaka, like many other African cities, does not have a resilient, dynamic and inclusive food system that offers food and nutritional security for the population in urban areas.
Our aim is to help Smallholder farmers increase food production  which is crucial for a sustainable food system by addressing challenges concerning market infrastructure, middlemen traders/brokers, and limited storage facilities. The app/site will also help farmers access skills, tools &amp; capital to meet modern expectations of food quality and break predominant farming methods by encouraging crop diversification and innovative agro solutions.
Most produce in the informal market comes with little value addition or sorting done at farm or market level, this leaves food vulnerable to contamination, waste &amp; no traceability. We will help cut down post harvest losses &amp; improve traceability.
High inflation rates coupled with a fragmented &amp; inefficient supply chain make food highly expensive for the end consumer. Our platforms will allow vendors and small retailers looking to purchase agricultural produce to save on transportation and logistics costs thereby increasing the productivity and demand for the produce of our farmers.
Lastly, our innovation will create employment opportunities not only  in our organization,but also the ones we will serve.
