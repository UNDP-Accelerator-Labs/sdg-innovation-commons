Description: This system is based on annual contributions from users of water from the Sierra de Las Minas, with differentiated rates depending on the use of each actor. The actors that can be distinguished are large companies, farmers and private users from their homes. It is an excellent success story.  

Interesting feature: Its execution scheme is private-private, which means that the government is not a key actor within the management. It is a good example of autonomy for the conservation of natural assets in Guatemala.
