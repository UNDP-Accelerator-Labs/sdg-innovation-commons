## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) A local youth innovation challenge can be a good point for non-traditional projects. In the training process, 'empathise' remains a crucial step despite the fact that participants are insiders of their communities; many of them talked about air pollution problem as a result of people's lack of care at the beginning of the training workshop. After empathising exercise and field work, they were able to understand other drivers e.g. lack of knowledge on alternative methods, lack of financial incentives, etc.  2) Fostering the relationship between the local youth and local authorities takes various degrees of effort. Some municipalities are very supportive of the initiative while others are not so enthusiastic and require many follow up from UNDP.  3) However, one common concern is if the initiative will require budgetary support from their municipality. Having the initial funding support from UNDP helps to open the door for this youth-government working model.  4) Having a local CSO as the connector/facilitator on the ground is crucial for the capacity-building process as well as connecting with local stakeholders. Their shared understanding/language and continuous presence are not something that UNDP can gain by ourselves over a short time.  5) This type of local youth innovation challenge can help address sources of the issue within the communities but is harder to move beyond e.g. air pollution as a transboundary issue. It will take international/regional organizations to step in to orchestrate a joint initiative between communities from different areas.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Fresh perspectives from local youth

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

They helped us explore the issues from the perspectives of the local communities
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Mae Fah Luang Foundation under Royal Patronage (MFLF) as the co-host/local facilitator, Breathe Council of Northern Provinces as the judge in the pitching event

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

n/a

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Charoen Pokphand Group as the judge in the pitching event

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Chiang Rai Governor's Office as the co-host, and municipalities/subdistrict administrative organizations (SAO) as advisors to youth teams

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

MFLF and municipalities/SAOs are the new partners; they make local implementation possible. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Our innovation methods and engagement with local stakeholders help us expand the frontier of knowledge on how to tackle air pollution issues at the community level, and how local authorities may work more closely with local youth in the development process.
