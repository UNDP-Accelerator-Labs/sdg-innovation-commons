> Title of the innovation

To support each child with basic needs for their education this includes school fees, uniforms, books, school shoes etc. To be their mentor helping them understand the value of a good education.

> Brief description of the innovation

To support intelligent vulnerable children with basic needs for their education. I have noticed a lot of intelligent children drop out of school for lack of basic needs, lack of exposure and mentorship to motivate them. My guardians believed being exposed to key things in the world could be a great motivation and it worked for me. I visited the University of Zambia while in primary school and seeing young ladies moving up and about to and from their lecture rooms filled me with so much admiration. It made me work so hard to achieve the required academic points to qualify for University. I painted classrooms and watered the orchard for my school fees during school holidays. I had a mentor as well, Heinz Muller MHSRIEP who taught me the value of a good education from primary school till the last day in my University. So far I have two pupils I support a boy and girl from GoodHope basic school in Kalomo district. The idea is to increase the number of pupils as God blesses me financially till  University level.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation is a non-profit making, challenge prize will help increase the number of beneficiaries and invest in fixed accounts.
Education forms the basis of everything in today's world including environment. Environmental Education imparts knowledge about the current situation and future prospects of nature. It teaches people to explore all the problems related to environment, and engage in wise ways of preserving it.

> Technical Feasibility

Every new term I budget from my salary to pay the fees and buy the school requirements. I am working with the school administration and that is where the school fees and other items are sent.  They send me back receipts  and pupils end of term academic reports which I archive.

> Anticipated Social Impact

I believe in making a change in the world even if its just one, in this case providing basic education needs which is school fees, uniforms, books, school shoes, pencils, pens and mentorship could ensure one is educated already that is reducing poverty levels and providing quality education. If the circle continues a good number of children who are at risk of dropping out of school drop can be reduced.
