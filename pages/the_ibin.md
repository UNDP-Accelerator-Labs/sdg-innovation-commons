> Title of the innovation

The iBin

> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation involves The iBin, short for the Intelligent bin. It is a bin that brings sanity into the sanitation world, bringing technology to the least of the places expected. It is a bin that is independent, doing everything by itself, cutting out the human dependability, attention and time given to the bins before it, until our turn to do our part of emptying; even then, it still makes our part easier as it assists in its own transportation and eases handling. In the era where everything is calling for hands free to reduce the spread of Corona virus and other contact diseases the iBin could not have come at any better time. 

There is no prototype yet. The design is still on plan/paper - still sourcing for materials.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will benefit many! First of all, just the manufacturing of the The iBin will create employment for many a youth. Secondly, because the iBin is latest and has class, it will be the most liked bin as it will go in tandem with the many malls that are being belt. Many a shop, pick and pay, Shoprite, Hungry Lion etc and other facilities will want to have such a bin, thus, market is rest assured. The major customer will be the councils, they will have quite a number of the iBins and put them in some strategic places like the public utility facilities for example the markets, the Post offices, Clinics, Bus stops and Bus stations etc... 

The iBin will be made in different sizes. There will be sizes for public and private use. Thus, everyone will be a potential customer as there will be sizes good for homesteads.

Thus, at whatever price, The iBin is a win win innovation which wont only help at reducing refuse but also reduce the spread of contact diseases and create a clean environment for all of us while adding immensely to the quality of living....!

> Technical Feasibility

The iBin is designed to be a Hands free bin. There are many bins around but the idea of handling the lid makes the bins less used especially by our women folk and some men who wouldn't want to touch the lid of a bin. With The iBin, the lid opens and closes on its own automatically. When it is full, it will lock itself shut and send a message to the handlers for a pick up. In that very minute it open up two more literal bins to continue being of service while it is full and waiting to be emptied, thus, eliminating the messy scenes created by falling refuse around the bin when they are full. The iBin has pulling and lifting levers and two big wheels which makes handling very easy and simple. The wheels are high and powerful enough to carry heavy loads and get dragged though even in uneven paths.

The iBin will come in different sizes to suit different kinds of users.

The design is still on plan/paper - still sourcing for materials.

> Anticipated Social Impact

1.	First of all the iBin is designed in a more spectacular way to make it an acceptable utensil to work with, thus, making the handlers of the bin to be more comfortable with their work and duties, a key element to development. A shy worker is a negative force to productivity, The iBin eliminates that complex.  
2.	The main key factor to discarding rubbish is the proximity of the rubbish bin to people. The iBin reduces the distance from the masses of people to the bin as it can be placed in close proximity to people. The beautiful cosmetic feature and the ability to stay shut and reduce stench allows it to be the most friendly bin of all time.
3.	Who doesn’t want to be associated with Technology? Everything is going digital, as there is an improve in civilization people are striving to be at pace with technology and would just love to see such technology come into the sanitation parameters especially to the rubbish bin. Most people get encouraged to use technology and just want to be associated with technology. The iBin offers that privilege to the many that have that crave of high life. It encourages people to use it. 
4.	People with and of class know that a clean and litter free environment is cardinal to health life but have a problem in using the common bins because the bins forces them to touch what they hate most, ‘Dirty!’ The iBin is a hands free bin, it reduces or completely eliminates contact, thus, reduce the chances of transmitting communicable disease, thus, making the iBin just the right bin of our time through these harsh time of the virus. 
5.	The feature of remaining closed at all times, and never having to lose the lid at any one moment reduces the probability of being a brooding and breading site for flies, the most common vector of many a disease. 
6.	The bin takes care of not only Environment, climate and sanitation but also Health
7.	It is always a very bad sight to see a full to the brim bin, worse off to see litter all around the bin and the wind having a play at the litter! The iBin has taken care of that problem. Once it is full it will lock itself and alert the owners or handlers that it is full and they must come to empty it. The Ibin knows that people will still need its services thus it provides two more catch up bin to be used in the time lapse between the call and the handlers coming to empty it. Unless the human failure, the iBin doesn’t fail you at all!
8.	Most, if not all the bins I have seen, tapper off at the base, they are either conical or prismatic, the iBin is all size at all places, maximizing not only the load it carries but also the transportation space and load of the transport used thereof.
9.	However heavy the iBin may be, it can be easily handled by one or fewer hands. The four handles, top and bottom, the drag handle and wheels reduces the effort and number of people needed to work on the bin.
10.	The iBin will be made using very light but durable material, making it light weight and durable worth the money.
11.	The most common problems that all bins are facing are being preyed on by Dogs, Crows and mentally disturbed individuals ransack the bins for food. This makes the bin sites very disturbing sights as in most cases they leave the contents of the bin lettered everywhere!. The iBin will eliminate all these fears.
12.	Lastly, but not the least, the iBin will call you! The ability to call and alert the handlers reduces the time, labour and money spent in going round checking on the status of the bin. 

Lastly, but not the least, The iBin is the been to address the lag that has been necessitated by social change whereas the rest of country and world is going digital, the bins in Zambia remained on analog rather manual. The iBin brings relevance and bridges the gap to the way we treated collection of the iBin.
