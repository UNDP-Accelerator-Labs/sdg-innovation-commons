Data Innovation for Development 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge was to design and frame two experiments aimed at testing the use of non-traditional data for development challenges which have not been explored yet by UNDP and National partners. In consultation with the Senior Management and CO Team, it was decided to align experiment with the CO strategic priorities. Specifically: 

1. Disaster Risk Management: in close collaboration with the Ministry of Emergency, UNDP explored open source algorithms and availability of satellite and historical data for landslides prediction. 

2. Misogyny Prevention: UNDP tested the opportunity of using social media data for misogyny prevention The framework of the experiments was designed based on the UNDP DATA INNOVATION GUIDELINE. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

1. AI for landslides prediction: Climate change is causing extreme weather conditions resulting in higher risks for the population. Extreme weather conditions  combined with unplanned  housing might result in more severe damages.  For example, Bishkek suburbs were significantly grown (via seizure of lands) during unstable periods in Kyrgyzstan such as the Kyrgyz revolution in 2010. These areas are lacking from poor infrastructure such as unpaved roads without proper ditches. In addition, the infrastructure of the cities is not well maintained due to lack of resources and possibly governance(instability). Combination of above mentioned reasons highlights the importance of adaptation and alleviation plans to increase the resilience of urban communities in Kyrgyzstan from the natural disasters. Frequency of natural disasters are expected to increase due to global warming. In Kyrgyzstan earthquakes , landslides and floods are the most frequent disasters.  Economic loss due to emergencies is estimated to reach over 700 million som (8.26 million dollars) by the Emergency Ministry. The biggest pie of these expenses are due to natural disasters. The risk assessment of natural disasters might be costly because it requires a  team of specialists. This process is also slow; it might take 6 month to investigate 5000 km square. Small growing municipalities and communities might not have enough resources to allocate to risk assessment.  Satellite and historical data sources about natural disasters can be used to build machine learning models which are capable of hazard identification. These systems provide scalable and cheap solutions for the communities with limited resources.  

2. AI and machine learning for misogyny prevention: Social media provides freedom of speech and expression. However, it comes with drawbacks such as hate speech. People in Kyrgyzstan tend to be more patriarchal due to the culture and religion. This combined with the hate speech result in misogynic comments creating a toxic environment against women. Many organizations including UNDP in the Kyrgyz Republic are fighting against gender-based violence. In order to make our efforts more effective tools for social media analysis such as misogyny identification would be useful. This tool will help to understand the scale of the problem which also could be used to push the agenda to relative government bodies. Also, it will help to target the audience which might be more inclined to misogyny to more effectively deliver messages about gender equality

1. AI for flooding prediction: Geospatial data combined with climate data from satellites not only can provide insights about hazards but are also required to build models to predict it. These models further can be used for different places without or with minor changes. These models are based on machine learning which usually requires significant data to train them. For example, deep learning (more specifically convolutional neural networks) can be used for image segmentation and classification can be used to train models based on geospatial and satellite climate data.  

2. Misogyny prevention: Data is an enabling resource for misogyny identification algorithms. Natural language processing (NLP) is used for automating text processing. NLP provides a scalable solution able to scan through millions of sentences. For example, spam detection in our email uses NLP. The more data, the more advanced approaches can be used and usually ends up with higher accuracy. Most of the advanced NLP solutions are based on deep learning approaches which require plenty of data to train.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Since, AI and non-traditional data have never been previously used by UNDP and/or National Partner in the Kyrgyz Republic, this is a great chance for Accelerator Lab and explore the potential and feasibility of data innovation through exploration without investing significant resources into risky initiatives. Moreover, if tested successfully, both experiments can be scaled within ongoing UNDP projects which ensures their sustainability.
