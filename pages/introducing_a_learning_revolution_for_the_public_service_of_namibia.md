## Title

Digitalising the Pocket Guide for the Public Service of Namibia
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that the public service is not developing institutional capacity, with a big part of this not providing induction and onboarding; and this impacts service delivery.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Office of the Prime Minister is the custodian of training and while there are 350 Learning and Development Officers, they are saddled with doing low value work instead of training.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.
