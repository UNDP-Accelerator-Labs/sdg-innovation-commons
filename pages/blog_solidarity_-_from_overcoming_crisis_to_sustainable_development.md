Solidarity - From Overcoming Crisis to Sustainable Development
MAY 11, 2023
In the year that marks six decades since the devastating Skopje earthquake, which fundamentally changed the lives of its residents and gave a completely new direction to the development and definition of the city, with a key determinant being a city of solidarity, UNDP prepared an extraordinary publication that addresses the topic of solidarity from various aspects. Namely, through the essays of our eminent professors, publicists, but also younger authors, solidarity is analyzed through the prism of economy, democratic processes, the diaspora, climate change, volunteer work, gender solidarity, as well as the mentioned topic, post-earthquake Skopje, built on the foundations of international solidarity.
Taking into account the interest of having your text printed in the publication, i.e. the number of papers received on the call and the quality of the selected papers, it is obvious that the topic of solidarity is always current and encourages creative discussion and opens up space for analyses, observations, discussions.
Quote from the Foreword by
Stevo Pendarovski, President of the Republic of North Macedonia
