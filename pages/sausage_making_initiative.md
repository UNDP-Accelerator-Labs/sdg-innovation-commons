> Title of the innovation

Sausage Making Initiative

> Brief description of the innovation

Well this innovation is a self employed kind of initiative that aims at making a sustainable living and also with proper or availability of resources, extend to commercial production of our sausages and employ others in trying to curb high unemployment levels among young people in the community. The innovation is about creating a self or private dependency environment where need for waiting upon government is to be reduced and further create employment opportunities for other unemployed youths by impacting them and conveying the same skills to other willing Zambians.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Apparently, how income will be generated will be dependent on market which is readily available within the location of the business entity. Supplies of the products to consumers, at affordable prices will attract most of the customers to buy from us, also coming up with an outlet of some sort, putting up two or three refrigerators so as to keep the products in there as cold as possible and prevent wastage. From the sales of the products, income will be generated massively and the profit surplus given as wages to other engaged beings.

> Technical Feasibility

This is an innovation whose plan has been laid and implementation is scheduled beginning early September 2021. Provided all the required resources are made available, as such preparations are underway believing that by next month all the needed resources will be met. Then quickly, business begins. Human resource is readily available as at now. Just waiting for other resources like enough financial resource.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Yes it will improve other people's lives through accessing naturally made products on avoidable prices other than just depending on expensive products from stocks like Zambeef, Shoprite etc. And also by creating employment opportunities for most of the unemployed especially my fellow youths. I really believe this will definitely will impact others in so many ways.
