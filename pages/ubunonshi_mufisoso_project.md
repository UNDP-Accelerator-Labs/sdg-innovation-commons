> Title of the innovation

Ubunonshi Mufisoso Project

> Brief description of the innovation

Many people are negative about waste management because of its nature (dirt). Others however are collecting waste but they have so many challenges ranging form endangered health and difficult in adding value or selling their waste. This innovation proposes to addresses waste collection in a structured way at household level for purposes of reuse, recycling, and reclamation. Other than safeguarding the health of the few Zambians that reclaim value out of waste especially during outbreaks like Covid-19 and the rainy season. The overall objective of this social innovation is to achieve the following:
•	Enhance the waste collection program from residential areas in urban and peri urban areas
•	Remodel scavenging at waste dumps 
•	Reduce the volume of waste at Landfills
This social innovation project will comprise, capacity development on the key players in the innovation particularly, waste pickers, communities generating waste and transporters. Tools and Technological needs for the project would be necessary at the relevant stages, for some simple tools, these will be required in phase 1. During phase 2 of the project, advanced tools would be employed. The target group are women and youths in the waste picking business.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Women and Youths will have the following interested to buy their we improved waste turned into raw material:
1. Plastic Recyclers: A good number of plastic recycling companies have emerged in Zambia. These are well established and buying waste from Waste Pickers. 

2. Metal Recyclers: Dealers in metal recycling have an opportunity to get a formal business transaction with suppliers. This project will give a well projected status on sustainability of the metal recycling industry.

3. Agribusinesses: Agribusiness companies such as Zambeef that are harnessing compost manure form surrounding resources will be motivated to engage in the waste stream supply chain. This innovation brings to the fore potential suppliers of the 

4. Organic manure Traders: Identified traders in organic fertilisers will be engaged in the social innovation to establish well organised business arrangements. This innovation will enhance the provision of inputs for production of compost manure. In this innovation, the needs of organic fertiliser suppliers will be outlined and measures to establish a reliable and firm waste supply chain.

> Technical Feasibility

The pilot project will comprise the following activities:
•	Stakeholder Engagement Meetings: All identified stakeholders will be at this stage engaged to set the ball rolling in phase 1 of the social innovation

•	Recruitment and Training of Facilitators: Each waste dump will require some facilitators to run the programs with the stakeholders

•	Brainstorming and Capacity Building with Communities and Waste pickers: The facilitators will run the stakeholder engagement sessions at different times  by engaging the waste pickers to share ideas and provide training.

•	Introduction of useful Technology: After a successful run of the collection strategy, technologies identified as useful will be implemented. The simple technology will be used to improve waste
•	Waste collection strategy runs: Two runs will be carried out, the first will come immediately after the system has been set. After that a review of the first run will be conducted to determine the areas of improvement.

•	Technological implementation: Useful technology will be suggested and implemented. A review of the technology will also be done during the project forecast. 
The process is expected to start with a Pilot Project for 4 months. Then Implementation takes Phases. Phase 1 in one city, one town and one rural area.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation dubbed Ubunonshi Mufisoso has a lasting economic impact on the players (Women and Youth) that will be involved apart from preventing pollution of the environment. In a nutshell it meets all the three aspects of sustainability namely: empowerment of the society, environmental protection, and economic improvement. A successful run of the project, a country wide permanent program should be considered with tailor made strategies for each of the community in every district of the country. Coordinated efforts from financiers and regulatory authorities will be at the core of the project with forecast monitoring throughout the project cycle. It will identify waste pickers as key players in the waste management cycle and not scavengers as we perceive them in that negative light.
