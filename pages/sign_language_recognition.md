> Title of the innovation

Sign-Language-Recognition

> Brief description of the innovation

Sign-Language-Recognition is a program that automatically recognizes and converts sign language from individuals with disabilities into text or speech. Human-computer interaction interprets people's gestures and attitudes

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This program is designed for those who wish to learn sign language Using this program, users will be able to rapidly become familiar with a wide variety of hand gestures and their meanings

> Technical Feasibility

this system will be based on python technologies . and will use the following
Python 3.6.
•TensorFlow framework, Keras API
•Real time computer vision using OpenCV
•Industrial standard GUI application (PyQT5), Tkinter
•Offline TTS assistance for python (pyttsx3 lib)
the aim is to have ;
.Real-time (detection depending on the user's gesture.)
.Generating custom gestures.
.Creating a continuous stream of sentences.
.TTS has measures in place to help illiterate individuals.

> Anticipated Social Impact

People with speech difficulties can communicate more effectively if their hand signals are translated into something that others can understand. People who are unable to communicate audibly might use such an application to identify pre-defined sign language in real time using hand gestures and save the results in a text file, as well as design their own personalized gesture.
