> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

The Problem: Farmers who use greenhouses are faced with challenges that come with the cold season. Farming in winter is so expensive due to the scarcity and high prices of fuel and the long hour's electricity cuts.

The solutions: Using large amounts of manure as an eco-friendly alternative source of energy to heat the greenhouses. The manure released carbon dioxide and nitrogen which increase the temperature of the greenhouses. 

The design: The solution depends on the fermentation and composting process that produces heat, this heat is then distributed evenly in the greenhouse using hot air passages installed in the greenhouse.
