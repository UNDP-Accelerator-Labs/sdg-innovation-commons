> Brief description of the innovation

Spin-off from  Zambia the start-up has developed an 3 in one stoves powered by LPG gas,electricity and solid fuel on the same product a  technology, which can use all at separate times but can work at the same time with gas and electricity for food preparations .The solution enables has 12 bolts and nuts for Assembling and dismantling purposes can be used indoors and outside for outside doors  and is complemented by a multi-energy mana. 
The solution has already been successfully tested, a proof of concept unit was operated in 2017 for household.  In a phase of Commercialisation,the start-up is in the process to sign a contracts for product deliveries on Alibaba and Amazon  worldwide .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The number of solutions units that we target to sell 5000 within 5 years at $200 for each
solution meaning per month 100 solutions should be sold this would result in a yearly target
of 1000 solutions per year we get 1000 × 5 years .The  stove was built by us but currently we have identified two partners in South Africa and
China that will help us manufacture it for the purpose of demand and supply as it will be
growing, also for the purpose of shipping and expansion to other regions to enable us reach
a wide based on client's as we are in the process of marketing our product on a 2 biggest
worldwide marketing platform Alibaba and Amazon meaning this will require us to mass
produce with quick delivery hence production will be done by our identified manufacturers
in the case get more more orders depending on demands currently our major manufacturer
toption machinery based in china will be able to produce and ship on our behalf to our Assembling plant  in Zambia currently our targets markets are B2C, B2B, Others.
The challenge will help us mass produce and have a constant supply to out clients bevause will be able to keep the stoves in storage for individual clients .
Environment benefits its the energy saving that will be saved per year see below 
Charcoal uses 86 % more energy than electricity. So: 1). Charcoal uses 2.8 kWh + 86 % of 2.8
kWh = 5.21 kWh 2) Our solution stove uses 1 kWh Saving =5.21 -1=4.21 kWh Saving per year
= (4.21 kWh) X (4 hrs/day) X (365 days in a year) = 6,146.6 kwh/year LCA saving = 6,146.6 X 10
years =61,466 kWh Carbon dioxide savings 1). Charcoal produces about 7.86 kgCO2eq/Kwh
2). Our Solution stove is 0.25 kgCO2 eq/kwh (considering the electrical stove) Saving = 7.86 –
0.25 =7.61 kgCO2eq/kwh LCA CO2saving = 467,756.26 kgCO2eq/kwh per year.

> Technical Feasibility

Our product is a tangible asset made of stainless steel sheets of over 304 for this reason our
solution has no chance of being affected by rust which enables it to be durable for a life
span of over 10 to 15 years and beyond. Stainless steel is perhaps best known for its
capacity to resist rust and corrosion, making it a popular choice The stove being a 3 in one
changeover is built in a smart that it has 12 bolts and nuts just that holds it together the
body of the whole stove, those bolts are also special because it gives the solution a very
special features of being assembled and demented using the nuts made from stainless
steel meaning its portable for both use indoors and outdoor purpose one can even carry the
stove for camping without need to go and buy another stove for such a purpose you just use
the one home. The energy sources are all removable its one source of connection to either
gas, pellets and electricity depending on the type of source you want to use at that
particular time this enables the safety of the other components for example when using
pellets you can not connect while electric cables to avoid melting of cables due to heat the
connection can be only done in the case of gas and electricity one at the same time if the
users wishes to do so. 
Dispatch will be on the basis of requirement by either wholesalers, retailers or
our regular customers. Therefore have considered choosing various modes of transport as
via sea, air, road and or rail depending on the destination of requirement, Our plan of having
multiple assembling plants is not only for dispatch and easy accessibility purposes but
rather it is also a way of having well specialized and equipped installers who's job will
respond to any servicing duties if needed at that particular juncture, servicing of the stove
will be regular in order to allow it to survive according to the estimated life span.
Proposed plan is to open and start an Assembling plan in Lusaka Zambia that will enable us to distribute countywide.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Key economic benefit 1: 30% industry boos 3 years of this product will help increase
countries revenue by at least 6% due to demand in the steel industry for there will be more
want for steel inorder for production to occur.
Key economic benefit 2: The impact this will have on multiple sectors is that it will create a
vast increase in job creation of at list 25% of jobs per annum in steel factories as well as
other sectors that use stoves
Key economic benefit 3: The solution when commercialised will improve incomes in
households of workers and their depends together with their residence and businesses as
the purchasing power will grow by 40%.
