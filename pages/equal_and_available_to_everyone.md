> Title of the innovation

Equal and available to everyone

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is about education, gender equality, land issues and energy sector . The main reason why i would like to take my interest in above issues is that,, these issues are affecting almost everyone why i say so,, allow me to talk about education as I'm talking i finished my school long time ago in twenty sixteen and i managed to obtain my certificate which most of the subject i got merits but up to now i never been in any college or university why because i don't have money to do my high education. Gender equality in our country Zambia it's there but not to an extent where by we can have 50 woman representative in parliament.,, Therefore we need to support woman so that they fill up the gap the more women representative in various sectors the more economic growth am saying this because woman we know them our keeper they keep the house in older therefore am sure even if we have more women in various positions the economy will be in good shape. Land issues, in our country for me to have my own land it's something very hard why so because the is very expensive in such a way that only Rich people are affording to earn land therefore we have to look on it. Lastly but not the least energy sector it's a sector that drive our economy for example the copper to be a meltdown we need energy which is electricity the government they should focus more on energy sector so that there will be no load shading because the More power goes the more small business like myself lost our capital therefore we need to look for another alternative to provide more energy in our country example solar system.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

These innovation will improve the economy and growth our small business,, how look like i explained on top if we have young people who are educated the economy of our country will boost example we all know that Young people like myself we have energy and fresh minds therefore if we as Young Man and women are educated the country will be on record of looking after Young people even economy will grow up . Gender equality Can lead our economy in good mood for example like explained earlier if woman giving equal opportunity with men i mean equal when it comes to position in various sectors you'll find that most of young ladies who stops schools due to being down to men they can get up and concert rate to their education therefore we need woman to be on top of things because they know how to make and be strictly to their works and these can boost our economy. When it comes to land issues if we as Young people give a chance to own our own land at least at the cheapest price we can do agriculture on it we can lay chickens and more livestock therefore we need young Zambian to own their land at the availability price. Lastly if government find a alternative on energy sector like solar system these may bring up more Energy into our various industrial and most of our industry in Zambia they are not working because of power problem if they find a good alternative for energy sector the our economy will get boosted and most of the clinic and hospitals are not in good condition when it comes to energy which is electricity

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is well design because the affected the same things i have mentioned in my innovation is the most affected ,,, example most young people are looming the streets because they don't deserve the education that May change their status for example myself and most of my friends are just working on Booth for surviving thus why am equal to talk about education . It's well design on gender equality everyone regardless of tribe skin or back ground matter we all need equal opportunity to education health care energy position in officers ,,, the only requirement is knowledge and wisdom and education therefore the government they should look on merits not on where you come from . On energy am pretty sure my innovation is well design because we all need energy which is electricity to be in there in hospitals clinics schools even in our homes . We need electricity for the X-ray machine to work operation section we need electricity and in industry we need electricity as well therefore my innovation is well design

> Anticipated Social Impact

Yes my innovation can improve the lives of others in main ways for example if am well educated i can help others in my community and encourage them to educate and telling them that education is the key if you want to be equal with other educated people . If we have equal opportunity to everyone either Men or women we'll all enjoying the same thing which is my case education health equal opportunity for position in various government offices,,. And lastly on land issue my innovation is well design we need to own land at the cheaper price and these will reduce hunger in our country because we'll be doing various things on that particular land like farming and other things.
