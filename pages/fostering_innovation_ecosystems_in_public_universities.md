Fostering Innovation Ecosystems in Public Universities for job creation and industrialization
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that Uganda, like other countries in Africa, is facing complex challenges – socially, economically, and

environmentally, which require integrated and innovative solutions. Moreover, the achievement of SDGs requires transformational solutions that go beyond incremental innovation. Uganda's Public universities like Makerere University and Kabale University, conduct alot of research done by students at various levels but they graduate and start looking for jobs instead of nurturing their researched projects to create jobs or contribute to industrialization.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



University education is not only about innovative teaching and learning methodologies, but also about strategically moulding those innovative methodologies to cultivate new ideas, enhance creativity, encourage collaboration, and promote inclusion and diversity in the society. Universities provide a platform to discuss new ideas, incubate businesses, provide expertise, produce knowledge that is used by technology businesses; they provide public space in which people from various overlapping branches of research meet. Universities should also promote the exchange of knowledge internationally through forming high-tech innovation clusters, by collaborating with relevant national and international agencies, industry, and international institutions and by attracting investment from business and international sources.


In this context, Universities in Uganda need to raise their ambitions and act decisively to (i) adopt new mindsets among students and others, (ii) build and trial new development models, and (iii) develop and deploy innovative solutions. Innovation has become an increasingly important opportunity as UNDP continues to provide integrated policy and programme support to the implementation of the National Development Plan III and by extension the implementation of the SDGs.

Uganda is ranked 121st among the 132 economies in the Global Innovation Index 2023, making it one of the lowest in the world.  Uganda ranks 18th among the 28 economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The major bottlenecks that stifling the emergence of new enterprises from the innovation ecosystem include: (i) Limited academia - industry linkages (ii)  Inadequate specialized facilities and human capital to support technology development, product development and commercialization in the various innovation clusters. The impact of this has been the emergence of a weak and uncompetitive private sector that is not producing the desired levels of inclusive growth. The private sector is largely informal Micro, Small, Medium Enterprises close to 80% with a small manufacturing sub-sector which uses basic technology and does not create the quality and quantity of gainful jobs for the youth. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor 2018, Uganda was ranked 1st in the World with the highest entrepreneurial rate, yet the failure rate of its start-ups is over 90%. Uganda’s start-ups and ventures combined continue to face a high failure rate with more than 60% of these businesses not expected to celebrate their second anniversary mainly due to a lack of innovation.


Uganda’s successful structural transformation depends upon the rapid emergence of universities as innovation hubs in terms of multi-disciplinary curriculum, applied and fundamental research studies as well as working closely with the industry through prototype development and commercialization. University education should also be re-oriented towards an “innovation society” to foster not only the engineering and creative production process but also changes in the behaviour and practice of companies and people.

Uganda has one of the youngest populations globally. Each year, up to 800,000 Ugandans join the job market. These comprise an estimated 100,000 fresh graduates from universities and other tertiary institutions.

Unfortunately, the job market only absorbs a small percentage of these - with the rest having to either create their own jobs or remain unemployed. Even worse is the fact that many of those employed lack the necessary real work environment skills, their qualifications notwithstanding.

Experts have largely attributed the growing unemployment of graduates to the static education system and limited practical studies offered by the school syllabus. To address this skills gap UNDP under the Timbuktoo Programme would like to foster innovation ecosystems in public universities by establishing University Innovation Pods (UniPods).

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?







The Innovation space is designed to tap into the innovative and entrepreneurial spirit of young people to promote impact-driven entrepreneurship, foster innovation and leverage business solutions to address youth unemployment. This will be achieved through supporting:

i)  Exposing a broad range of students across disciplines to the concepts of design thinking and product
realization;

ii) Youth and enterprises to pilot innovative ideas, or new ways and markets of delivering products and services
with a commercial imperative;

iii) Providing interested students with both the software for design thinking and the equipment and
materials to enable prototyping;

iv) Deepen and broaden the understanding and skills of engineering students in digital fabrication;

v) The establishment of a functional ecosystem platform to connect young entrepreneurs, Government, Development
Partners, financial institutions and all other relevant actors and;

vi) Encouraging the production of prototypes that have a high chance of being developed into commercially viable
products. These products will facilitate the linkage to industry and private
sector collaborations.

The above will be achieved through the following services
offered at the Mak-UniPod.
