> Descripción de la experiencia

Co-created solution. Acclab  Ecuador, together with our colleagues from the Economic Development Area, DIY Club and its sewing network, we conceived the project “Payment for Training”. Thus arose a strategy to reactivate the livelihoods of a network of seamstress, immigrant and national families. Through theoretical and practical training in the manufacture of protective suits, this network would obtain financial recognition.

From its start, it was clear that this undertaking would not only remain in the manufacture of these equipment, but would also have an emphasis on promoting collaborative, open and horizontal forms of organization. We started a socioeconomic network in which empathy, solidarity and even affection would emerge, putting learning and knowledge exchange as an important asset.
