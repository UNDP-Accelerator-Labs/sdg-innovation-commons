> Type of the Solution

Innovative

> Description of the solution

Designed by Raman and Shanhui Fan. A thin but multilayered film that takes advantage of the way Earth's atmosphere allows heat to escape into space. Their film consista of alternating layers of silica-glass-and hafnium dioxide, a compound used in the optics industry to coat lenses and mirriors. The film conducts heat away from the sun if covering a car.
