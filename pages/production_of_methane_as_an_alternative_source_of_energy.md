> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is about the production of methane through the decomposition of organic waste and fertilizer as a by product. Methane is produced through the processing of various types of organic waste. It is a renewable and environmentally friendly fuel made from 100% local feedstocks that is suitable for a diversity of uses including road vehicle fuel and industrial uses.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will generate income for me and others in a way that i am mainly specialized in building biodigesters (i.e where the decomposition occurs) we can be contracted to build for various people and if invested in it we can finally make a central places for building biodigesters which can supply to homes and be used as an alternative source amidst the challenges hydro power is currently facing. The innovation will improve operations of other existing businesses in a way that if heavily invested in the project we wold make a commercial biodigesters which can supply electricity to mines and other businesses which require electricity for production.

> Technical Feasibility

my innovation is designed in a way that you can produce methane in a small scale all you need is a receptacle which can vary depending on what size you want,  keep it airtight to allow formation of bacteria and a gas outlet pipe. The innovation degrades and converts the organic waste into usable water and gasses in an eco-friendly manner. The generated gas can be utilized for energy/ cooking and water for irrigation purposes. The process involves the bacteria which feed upon the organic waste inside the receptacle, through anaerobic process which finally degrades the matter and releases methane gas that can be used for cooking, along with the treated water.
A detailed implementation plan has been made which is ready

> Anticipated Social Impact

Methane production improve the lives of other in various ways such as the production of methane is through the decomposition of organic waste is a renewable source of energy meaning that the people can use on a long time basis as it is renewable,my innovation is one of the cheapest sources of energy which is environmentally or climate friendly. My innovation is very suitable for the Zambian people because of the poor waste management we have as a country of which the waste is not being put to good use and my innovation would be the best use of organic waste. My innovation will improve the lives of people in a way that during the production of methane there will be a by-product of fertilizer which would be used in agricultural practices, another benefit of my innovation is that it is not dependent on climate and has few requirements .     
My innovation is relevant to the current market in way that am proposing not only a commercial use of the innovation but as well as a small scale use of the innovation.
