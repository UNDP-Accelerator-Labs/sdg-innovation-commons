> Title of the innovation

RFID SALES BRACELET

> Brief description of the innovation

The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has seen an increase in the use of technology in businesses and day-to-day lives so as to have little to no human interaction in order to reduce the risk of spreading the deadly virus. Although, vaccines have been developed and people encouraged to get vaccinated, not every person has and will be vaccinated. And since the main, and accepted mode of transactions is cash, some may end up spreading the virus as a result of coming into contact with money that may be carrying the virus. Health authorities recommend the use of integrated technologies such as mobile banking services and mobile money services to help curb the spread of the virus.
People are constantly carrying out transactions using cash despite the warnings. Events are sometimes held where snacks are sold by vendors for fundraising purposes, and the main mode of transaction is cash.

A proposed solution, in addition to already existing solutions, is the use of a
RFID SALES BRACELET that will be worn on the wrist and be scanned to purchase products and/or services. The RFID SALES BRACELET will make use of an embedded RFID tag, the bracelet will be loaded with money (i.e., money will be “deposited” into the bracelet) from a bank account or a mobile money account. When purchasing products and/or services, the bracelet will be scanned and money will then be transferred to the merchant.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will assist in improving operations of existing businesses by providing an efficient way of keep track of sales records that can easily be retrieved and traced, for easy auditing on the merchants part. This will help reduce the misplacement of  financial documents.

The target market/potential offtakers of the RFID SALES BRACELET includes event organizers who sale products and/or services at their events and desire an easy and convenient way of conducting transactions with event goers, as well as SMEs who wish to reduce or completely do away with conducting business using money in form of paper.

The challenge prize will help the business grow by facilitating the manufacture of RFID SALES BRACELETS that can be customized according to a customers needs(e.g. event organizers).

> Technical Feasibility

The RFID SALES BRACELET will make use of an embedded RFID tag, the bracelet will be loaded with money (i.e., money will be “deposited” into the bracelet) from a bank account or a mobile money account. When purchasing products and/or services, the bracelet will be scanned and money will then be transferred to the merchant.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation is relevant to the current market because it will help merchants easily keep track of transactions and purchases being made on products and services. It will provide convenience and ease of use to customers who wish to purchase certain products and/or services by reducing and/or doing away with need to acquire services and/or products with paper money.
