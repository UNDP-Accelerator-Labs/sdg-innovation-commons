## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection.

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process.
## Overall goal

Research, in a participatory way, about the elaboration of identity, the knowledge of personal history, and the re-establishment of social, family, and affectional bonds among people (grandsons and granddaughters) who were kidnapped by State terrorism in their childhood and who were searched for and found by Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo (human rights association).
## Specific goals

Study the delivery of the “boxes” of the Family Biographical Archive (the only one of its kind) created by Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo to be given to the granddaughters and grandsons found in order to know and understand the uses and meanings they are given in the process of reconstructing their identities and reassembling their histories and their family and social bonds and political ties.
## Description of citizen participation

Activists, workers, grandsons, and granddaughters participate in the elaboration of the project and will be part of each stage of the research.
