Student, Veveonah in rural area climbed up tree for better internet to prepare for her exams, with a mosquito net to protect from mosquito bites. She has documented other traditional knowledge in coping with the lack of infrastructure in her community. The videos she made on the treetop have since garnered attention from government ministries on improving internet infrastructure and connectivity in Sabah.
