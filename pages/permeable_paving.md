> Type of the Solution

Thermal Cooling System

> Description of the solution

A modular pavement system designed to be more permeable and reflective, reducing the heat island effect and improving stormwater management.

> Who lead the solution

Private Sector

> Other Notes

Reduces the urban heat island effect: Traditional pavement surfaces absorb and retain heat, which contributes to the urban heat island effect - a phenomenon where cities are significantly warmer than their surrounding rural areas. Permeable paving surfaces reflect more sunlight and allow water to cool the surface, reducing the urban heat island effect.
