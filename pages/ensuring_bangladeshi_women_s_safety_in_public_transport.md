The Bangladesh Accelerator Lab organized a Women’s Digital Innovation hackathon to promote ICT skills and innovation practices to female students and professionals and find new digital solutions to a wide range of  SDG challenges. One of the solutions that came out of the hackathon is ‘Bhai Thamen’ (colloquial Bengali for "bro, stop") - an AL and ML based mobile application that aims to support women with a digital tool that provides ways to travel safely. An objective of the app is to decrease women’s risk of facing sexual harassment or assault when they are on the move and commuting. Additionally, the application strives to arm women with knowledge that empowers them to take their safety and mobility into their own hands by creating a social media platform to provide information – generated by other fellow women – to help women make better, informed choices about travel safety.
