> Description of the solution

This solution is based on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Sentinel-2 satellite data to improve crop yield estimation. AI techniques like Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are used to analyze high-resolution images from Sentinel-2, which capture information about crop health and growth. This data is then used to predict crop yields with greater accuracy. This approach can help farmers optimize resource use, reduce waste, and increase agricultural productivity.
