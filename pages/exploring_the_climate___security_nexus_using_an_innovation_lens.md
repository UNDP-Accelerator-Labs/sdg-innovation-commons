## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Exploring the climate - security nexus using an innovation lens.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to contribute to the regional portfolio of projects on climate security by applying and collectively learning from the accelerator labs way. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In Mali, between Djenne, Mopti and Timbuktu, there is a vast flood zone: the inland delta of the Niger River. A little more than one million people live in this territory of approximately 35,000 km2. Fishermen, herders and farmers take turns exploiting the water, land and vegetation to consume and export the Delta's resources. A sophisticated social organization ensures that people move from one place to another depending on the height of the flood. But if the environment moves in a cyclical way during the year, it also moves on two more linear axes, intimately linked: that of the degradation of the natural environment due to climatic hazards and to the fact of Man, that of the local, regional and world socio-economic changes. These changes have multiple effects on the Man-Nature balance, changes to which Man must adapt but which he must also limit and manage. In this dynamic, climate change is considered as a "threat multiplier". The complex and interrelated causes and consequences of increasing climate uncertainty and extreme weather events require comprehensive and integrated strategies. Concerted action is needed to mitigate its impacts on people and communities, as well as to protect development gains, peace and stability. In the interior delta that concerns us in the context of this project, it should be noted that with the advent of decentralization, the State has transferred certain competencies to local communities, but those related to natural resource management remain to be carried out. This being said, the capacities of local communities as well as several actors involved in climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction (DRR), natural resource management and intra and inter community conflict management are limited. It is therefore necessary to analyze the link between security and climate in the Inner Delta area and to propose an intervention approach based on the target groups of women and youth. Within the climate-security nexus, the focus is on the interaction between climate change impacts (such as erratic, extreme and/or altered rainfall patterns, temperature increases, storms, altered seasonal patterns and ecosystem degradation) and political, social, economic and demographic factors that can undermine stability, particularly in fragile regions such as the Inner Delta (Mopti and Timbuktu). While the link between climate, natural resources, and conflict is well understood, the idea of integrated action on the climate-security nexus is relatively new, and institutional frameworks for addressing this nexus are therefore less developed. Our project therefore aims to promote integrated approaches to manage and reduce climate-related security risks and build resilience in communities affected by conflict and climate change impacts.

Like the rest of Mali, the Inner Niger Delta has experienced decades of continuous degradation of climatic conditions and natural resources. The increase in human and animal populations has called into question the traditional exploitation of space. These situations have resulted in increasing competition between farmers within the same production system, and between farmers, herders, loggers, fishermen and others within different production systems. This competition has led to conflicts of all kinds in the interior delta, which have implications for the security crisis in Mali in general. Human development indicators in Mali are low (0.434 in 2019) where the incidence of poverty is 67.6% in Mopti and 4.1% in Timbuktu. Understanding the interaction between the various factors related to climate change and security will guide interventions to achieve sustainable peace and mitigate the impacts of climate change while targeting youth and women.

Temperatures in the Sahel are rising faster than the global average. Climate models point towards more erratic and unpredictable patterns in the coming decades while violent activity involving militant religious groups are doubling every year since 2015. Populations of in countries including Mali, Chad and Burkina Faso are increasingly affected by exposure to radicalization, land and water-related conflicts and persistent inter-communal violence leading to displacement and increased humanitarian needs. Roughly 80% of the Sahel's farmland is degraded even as 50 million people in the Sahel who depend on livestock compete for land.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This project intends to draw on the following lessons learned to provide an integrated response to the challenges of climate change as one of the factors reinforcing the security crisis in Mali: (1) the adverse effects of climate change; (2) local and institutional mechanisms for natural resource management; (3) the breakdown of social cohesion and the spread of violent extremism; (4) conflict prevention and management mechanisms related to natural resources and climate change Our value proposition lies in our ability to mobilize actors in the innovation ecosystem and to exploit new sources and methodologies of data analysis.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

How can new sources and methods of analysis of data can enhance our understanding and response to climate change in a context of fragility? That is the question we want answered from this challenge.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We need to have a better understanding using data and visualization of the relationships that exist between climate change and conflicts in the Delta Interieur du Niger.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Data visualization: using a Crisis Risk Dashboard, we plan to visualize the data collected and provide an early-action tool for decision-makers. Pilots: In order to test the effectiveness of the local solutions to be mapped, we would run pilots. Positive deviance: We believe that is important to identify positive deviants in this regions.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Qualitative interviews: Few data are available on climate security in that region. Qualitative interviews will enable us to understand how communities are coping with the changing climate and the conflicts in the region. Satellite data: This source of data is very important in our identification of positive deviants.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The CO and RBA are very interested in our approach of visualizing data and providing an ongoing stream of information for early action.
