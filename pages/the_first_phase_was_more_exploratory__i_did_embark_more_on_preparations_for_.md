## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The first phase was more experimental, although I did spend more time preparing for this task, which included: 1) get an agreement with a technical partner on the assignment's timeline. 2) presenting the idea to the Zanzibar Government; and 3) obtaining additional partnerships/buy-in from the relevant government departments: The following are the main findings: 1. The government partner is keen to investigate the possibilities of new kinds of data in tourism. 2. When you have the appropriate data and a compelling value offer, you may build a downstream with current Country office initiatives. 3. Because web scraped data has never been utilized in Tanzania/by the government, it remains a murky area for them to investigate. 4. Ensure that partners are involved at all stages of the process. 5. Be specific about your value offer and manage expectations.

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
Can web scrapping help us re-imagine the tourism sector? (undp.org)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Because Zanzibar's government was working on revitalizing the tourism industry when the proposal was conceived, it presented a significant obstacle. When it came to tourism, the plans were more concerned with hardware components like rehabilitation of airports and purchasing equipment, thus giving statistics to help understand the problem of visitors returning was a long shot at best.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Web scrapping unlike conventional methods saves time, gives easy access to data, reduces effort to collect d ata and is relatively accurate. Its analysis is computer-based; hence many datasets can be analysed relatively easily, and key information extracted for actions. These kinds of data have never been used before in planning for tourism. the same applies to drone data.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

In order to access, analyse and interpret data from social media platforms/forum and the web in general, those kinds of methods were very essential.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Xsense AI- a non-profit organisation that build Machine Learning and deep learning models which can perform analysis and classification of data in real time these technical partners will held in building the learning model, analysis and later reporting.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Nelson Mandela African Institution for Science and Technology (NMAIST)- they  will provide space and equipment/access to high speed computers.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The commission for Science and Technology, The Zanzibar Commission for Tourism, The Zanzibar State University. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The Zanzibar State University had for the first time agreed/planned to engage with UNDP.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?



> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
