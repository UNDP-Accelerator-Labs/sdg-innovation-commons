## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Connect local micro, small and medium enterprises in the tourism sector for better recovery from the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to create and/or strengthen connections between local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the tourism sector to enhance business and trade opportunities and, hence, allow them to better recover from the resulting socio-economic impacts of COVID-19 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Before the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, travel and tourism had become one of the most important sectors in the world economy, accounting for 10 percent of global GDP and more than 320 million jobs worldwide. (https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2020/12/impact-of-the-pandemic-on-tourism-behsudi.htm). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy of Mauritius was growing steadily at an estimated 3.6% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019. The local tourism sector, the 1st sector of the economy, was contributing more than 9% of the GDP of Mauritius and directly employing about 76,000 persons (approximately 1 in 7 employed person) (The Tourism Satellite Account, 2018 by Statistics Mauritius). This number is much higher if we take into account those indirectly linked to the sector. However lockdown measures and border closures ushered significant challenges — affecting individuals, communities and the economy. Through two periods of lockdown (mid-March to June 2020 and mid-March 2021 up to now) , Mauritius witnessed massive disruptions in the operations of several business actors, especially in the tourism sector as most international flights have been cancelled. There is little certainty on when tourists will come back to Mauritius in substantial numbers. Government institutions have been instrumental in assisting vulnerable groups by implementing several schemes to support employees impacted to cope with the economic shock and mitigate the impact on employment. This support, however, might not be sustainable in the long run... The pandemic has certainly initiated a wake-up call to reflect beyond help provided by the government only. With the new normal, some local enterprises are changing their ways of operating and even re-skilling or up-skilling their workforce. But this is not true for all players in the tourism sector in Mauritius. There is therefore a unique opportunity to devise a roadmap to recovery and resilience-building.

The 2017 SME Report (Local entrepreneurs in Mauritius) by the Mauritius Commercial Bank highlights that the SME sector contributes approximately 40% to the GDP of Mauritius, and employs around 300,000 people in the country (approximately 25% of the population). In the first half of 2020, unemployment rate rose from 2.7% to 4.8% in Seychelles and rose from 7.2% to 10.2% in Mauritius (The Socio-economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 on Mauritius and Seychelles by UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles) The same report indicates a sharper fall in the informal sector employment compared to formal employment, representing a decline of above 59%. The report points out that these informal workers were not typically covered by the government-led Wage Assistance Scheme. Further shocks can only contribute to increased unemployment, poverty and insecurity as well as decreasing food security and social protection. In its COVID-19 and African businesses: Focus on Mauritius report (2020), the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa cited "lack of operational cash flow" as the most pressing challenge for micro-enterprises. As for medium-sized enterprises, a typical concern is related to a "reduction of opportunities to meet new customers." In addition, reliance on international rather than regional suppliers adversely affected businesses in Mauritius. COVID-19 is accelerating digital transformation. There has been rapid adoption of a work from home policy. However, this trend was predominantly seen in large companies (81 % of them adopted the policy) while micro, mid and small enterprises struggled (only 57% could) according to a report by Business Mauritius and Stats Mauritius.

A report entitled COVID-19 puts women working in SIDS tourism industry at risk, written by Simonetta Zarrilli of UNCTAD and Nursel Aydiner-Avsar, Associate Professor, Akdeniz University, states that "many SIDS have introduced, or at least expressed the intention of introducing, fiscal and/or monetary/macro-financial measures to fight the negative economic impacts of the pandemic. Some SIDS have also introduced measures targeting the tourism sector. However, none of them include an explicit gender component." Building on our first learning cycle of 100 days, our Accelerator Lab has been conducting an exploration safari in Rodrigues Island, an autonomous island of the Republic of Mauritius, whereby we met and engaged discussion with numerous stakeholders in the tourism sector. One important insight was the resilience and ability of the islanders to adapt to the repercussions of the difficult times related to the lock-down and pandemic situation. Dealing with difficulties is an inherent characteristic that we do find in most people living on remote island. However, we discovered that there were numerous opportunities of alternative livelihood for the actors in the tourism sector. Through our second action plan, we will further explore and map solutions/ actions we will find during our engagement with the stakeholders and actors. As a result of these findings, the Accelerator Lab can map existing initiatives that MSMEs have adopted to maintain business continuity amid challenges.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our Accelerator Lab is uniquely positioned as it covers three islands of the Indian Ocean, namely Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles, which, until recently had tourism as the first sector of their economy.  Since the pandemic, a large number of people working directly or indirectly in this sector have lost their jobs and pragmatic solutions need to be found for them for the short-, medium- and long-term. Therefore, this Accelerator Lab has some of the elements needed for a fruitful learning cycle. We will embrace the complexity and uncertainty of this development and economic issue and we will make use of collective intelligence. We will also identify and map potential solutions from the grassroot level or from other Accelerator Labs and, eventually, provide portfolios of experiments for a number of stakeholders. Finally, this challenge will also be an opportunity to explore how innovative technologies can be enablers for a better and more sustainable enterprises and individuals in the tourism sector.

AHRIM has been the main professional association of private operators in the hospitality industry in Mauritius. AHRIM represents a major database, representing employers and employees alike. A collaboration with AHRIM will provide the Accelerator Lab will essential data regarding trends that we are currently witnessing with regard to the tourism sector. This association, however, does not represent informal actors (sometimes SMEs by nature) and so data on them might be scant.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the potential socio-economic consequences of the current pandemic on the lives and livelihoods of people directly or indirectly working for MSMEs operating in the tourism sector?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The first round of sensemaking will be designed as a series of conversations with affected communities (SMEs in our case) with the aim to draw out specific information that can inform the scale of the issue. We want to understand what is happening, and what the impact is. A second round of sensemaking can be envisioned with national stakeholders such as the actors listed as "partners".  We plan to conduct a market survey, meet with partners to assess needs and work with the CO team respectively. We will use tools such as Mural and Notion to engage multiple stakeholders when conducting brainstorm and/or engagement activities.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Citizen-generated data will be the most insightful but we have to consider confidentiality, anonymity and other ethical considerations. Open datasets are easily available and accessible for both Mauritius & Seychelles and a good starting point. They add value as they have been collected by reputable and trusted public and private sector organisations. There may still be an issue of bias that we have to be mindful of.  
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Through our challenge oriented towards enhancing the livelihood of MSMEs and unusual actors directly affected by the pandemic period in the tourism sector, we are expecting to learn more about the resilience of people in Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles. We will analyze the solutions adopted by these island nations to cater for the difficult times during the past lockdown period. Our main champions will be the actors of the tourism sector but we will have a particular focus on women in this industry. How women in the tourism sector might have the opportunity to reskill or upskill to sustain their activities and livelihoods? This is a very important lead on which we will work during the next 100 days. Also, our challenge will be an opportunity, through collaboration with AHRIM and Business Mauritius, to learn what were the policies/measures and actions that did not work as expected and how we could assist in formulating more adequate solutions to sustain the tourism sector. We want to adopt an informal approach with our new partners which is often not possible through the Country Office Programmes, especially in terms of time dedicated through system thinking and collective intelligence with different actors of the community. People will be at the center of our challenge, and we aim to adopt a bottom-up approach to obtain the necessary data and their stories throughout our learning cycle. We are looking forward to grow as a network across the SIDS Accelerator labs through establishing discussion groups and working out loud with real time actions being tested/ experimented across the network.
