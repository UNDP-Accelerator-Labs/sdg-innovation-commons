> Title of the innovation

Making pavers using plastic collected from the environment and sieved sand.

> Brief description of the innovation

Pavers made out of plastic litter from the environment

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Human resource will be required pick huge quantities of plastic litter in the environment. We will need human resource to man the heating process and subsequent casting into fabricated moulds called cavities. Target market include road construction sector , hoticulture industry and general land scaping.This innovation scooped 2 nd position at national competition held at kitwe teacher's college in 2019.

> Technical Feasibility

Firstly, we design and fabricate a vessel  called mould using sheet of mold steel.. Different shapes can be designed. Then collected plastic is melted. Mixed in proper proportion with sieved sand, stirred thoroughly while plastic is in molten state then poured in prepared mould. The mixture cool down and solidify and take up the shape of the mould. These pavers and interlocked on flattened land to nice finish.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Job creation at every stage of production. Raw materials consisting of plastic litter in environment will clean the environment. Sand is everywhere. Cheaper than imported pavers. Road construction is happening all times.
