## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Climate-resilient food supply chain in the face of small farmers vulnerability  
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that climate change implications are strongly and negatively affecting agriculture productivity in the low-lying land of Delta. This highly impact the contribution of smallholder farmers into the food supply chain, increasing their economic vulnerability and affecting their livelihood.    

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The Nile Delta is classified in IPCC Fourth Assessment Report as one of the world’s three “extreme” vulnerable hotspots. The Nile Delta accounts for about 20% of the country’s GDP. Multifaceted changes in weather, soil, and water posed pressing negative outcomes on crop quality, crops yield and eventually the economic returns and livelihood of small farmers. Poor access to market, inefficient production, misfunctioning marketing channels, lack of credible technical & marketing support, the diminished role of cooperatives, limited pricing regulations, and policy gaps put smallholders at risk of post-harvest losses and a daunting debt cycle. On the other hand, reliable market linkages require satisfactory crop quality, sustainable crop yields, and progress in the direction of internationally recognized standards. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

Agriculture is a major component of the Egyptian economy, contributing 11.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product. 90% of the farmers are smallholders live off the little they produce in areas of less than 0.4 hectares. The low diversification of the economy and poverty (40%) leads to low resilience of these communities that may not adapt fast enough. With climate change, Egypt's already arid climate is affecting crop production and quality, and eventually farmers' livelihood. Compared to a no-climate change scenario, food crops yields are projected to decline by over 10 percent by 2050 due to climate change implications, including change in seasons, higher temperatures and water stress as well as increased salinity of irrigation water.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

During our field visits farmers were very aware about the deteriorating conditions of their lands, change in weather, and extreme weather conditions. They were hungry for up to date knowledge and practices to adapt and improve their productivity. While they were open for crop diversification, there were no guarantees that this will reflect into improved livelihood, if wouldnt be accompanied with change in food value chain.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We are trying to approach multiple entries for "food to fork" approach simultaneously with the aim of transformative change, collaborating with uncommon partners. While other actors are working either closely with farmers or largely with environment, the Accelerator lab is trying to iteratively zoom in and out, to built a portfolio of potential solutions, tapping into local dynamics, market, and ecosystem.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

we aim to find venues for disrupting food value chains to be more climate resilient in the face of small farmers vulnerability

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can climate resilience be sustainability introduced into high trade commodities supply chain? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

we aim to experiment with climate resilient supply chain through a co-creation model involving private sector engagement. This will involve mapping and advocating for a system level change towards sustainable value chain, not only economically but also socially and environmentally.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

impact measurement and commercial relevance that can be a motive for private sector to engage and invest in more climate adaptive value chains
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Where in the tightly organized agriculture-food systems lies the highest resistance to climate resilient supply chain? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

This question aims to find gaps, patterns, and opportunities in the system to pave the way for more inclusive solutions such as inclusive contract farming. While we were able to identify appetite for the solution, some fundamental requirement in the system is still missing, we aim to learn more on that to draw a picture on how to be solution ready.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

there is gap in market dynamics specially around small communities affected by climate change.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

For on ground solution, our CO environment portfolio can be a great venue to grow specially with a new cpd coming out For system mapping output and sensemaking we are finding interest from ministry of international cooperation to grow learning and replicate methodology in other cross cutting venues
