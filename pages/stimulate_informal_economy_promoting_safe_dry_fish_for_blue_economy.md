## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Ramiz Uddin

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

01/07/2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Blue economy opportunities for informal employment and informal economy in Bangladesh

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

The main frontier challenge is unemployment and the informal economy in Blue Tourism.

Cox's Bazar is one of the largest blue economy locations in Bangladesh in terms of potential Blue Tourism and Dry Fish markets. It has the largest area of dry fish production, and almost 100% of people are involved in this business. Still, most of them use traditional methods to dry, produce, and process dried fish and sell them to the market. However, they don't have technical knowledge regarding safe dry fish production, processing, packaging, and marketing. More people can be engaged in fish processing in this way and thus more jobs in the informal sector can be created. That will ultimately help achieve sustainable development goals by generating local income and contributing to the local informal economy.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

LQ1: How to increase employment in dry fish processing and marketing as a part of the Blue Economy in Cox's Bazar?

LQ2: How to connect the local dry fish market with the national and international markets?

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The specific learning intent is- how to address the dry fish producer's community with a decent income-increasing process, how to strengthen livelihoods support of unemployed through dry fish processing, how to increase demand for new market opportunities created by the entry of a large number of buyers as tourists?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1: IF the dry fish producer group is mobilized, THEN production will be stabilized by creating higher demand for these blue economy products.

H2: IF the dry fish producers and learners are trained on safe dry fish production, processing, packaging, and Marketing with modern techniques, THEN their income will increase.

H3: IF beneficiaries adopt home-based production and locally led income generation options, THEN the whole community will be benefitted as more employment opportunities will occur.

H4: IF Market linkage with local entities and technical experts is developed, THEN it will be effective for increasing profit for beneficiaries.

H5: IF the participatory process of beneficiary selection is ensured, THEN it will help avoid local conflict in project implementation

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes, Proven.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Directly not observations but some inclusive strategical approach incorporation with the methodology chosen for the experiment would make this experimental activity more effective. Considering this, inclusive strategical approach would be considered for better output.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

1,582 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The initiative of this activity is currently functional. Continuation of practice for safe dry fish processing, packaging and levelling should be reflected which should be followed up and learning would be generated to scale up this activity to add values as next steps.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, this experiment is planned to scale as the beneficiary required nursing to work in group approach for business sustainability. Also, market linkage with local entities and technical expert will be effective for increased profit to the beneficiary. This activity has been scaled up with Cox's Bazar Chamber of Commerce, scale up can be promoted through small and medium business entrepreneurs or start up entity as well as with the larger business group or dry fish seller.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

For inclusive growth in blue economy sector, dry fish component has a lot of potentials to be explored. During this experiment, some of the main learnings were following but not limited to exploration and innovation of dry fish processing, packaging and levelling, marketing strategies, ideas generation, adding value in an innovative idea etc. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

1. Selecting only 20 Beneficiary from more than 750 producer family was a challenge.

2. Ensuring beneficiary participation in training was a challenge as most of the beneficiary are day labour.

3. Habituating in group approach business was a potential obstacle.

4. Ensuring Women participation in the dry fish entrepreneurship and training as challenge that had to encounter.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

As this is an experimental activity of UNDP Accelerator Lab, Bangladesh CO, the result will benefit the whole AccLab team under UNDP. More specifically, the Experimentation team as the success of this experimental activity might motivate the team to pursue more such experimentations for accelerating the SDGs in order to carry out inclusive development.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Outside the UNDP, the dry fish producers from Cox's Bazar might benefit from the results of the experiment because this experiment has created a proven strategy for the dry fish producers to build their capacity in producing and marketing quality dry fish. Also, the consumer/customer will be benefitted as they can have hygienic and quality dry fish without the fear of falling sick.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Practically yes, this experiment requires iterations at least more than two. As this experiment was a pilot one, only a few numbers of beneficiaries were selected to participate in the innovation of dry fish processing. If a large number of recipients can be trained on safe dry fish processing, the entire community can be gradually benefitted by the process.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Partnership building with other businesses in the fishery sector is essential to promote the safe dry fish market. So, replicating this experimental activity would require strong partnership with the business and market of fishery sector. It should be reminded that providing training to workers and group leader on basic accounting and financial management is also a crucial part of the systematic approach.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, this experiment can be replicated in another thematic area like informality, youth unemployment, safe street food processing, women empowerment which are relevant to SDGs: 8, 10,12, 14, and 17.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense and explore phase influenced the shaping of full experimentation of the learning cycle. This is a different kind of experiment that was done to improve the processing of dry fish. Sensing the depth of challenges, we have mapped the solution and explored the way out. Then piloted the experiment with a selected number of dry fish producers and trained them on safe dry fish processing and marketing.

> What surprised you?

Conducting regular follow and monitoring of the dry fish production centers ensured compliance with safety and hygiene standards.
