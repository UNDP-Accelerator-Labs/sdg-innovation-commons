Capacities for Social and Public Innovation 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to improve social and public innovation capacities in a "learning by doing" manner, focusing on strengthening public sector innovation capacities through the design and implementation of citizen-centered public policies and services: Part of this challenge is also to develop R&D&I capacities in social organizations and academia, through community-based social innovation challenges that articulate local organizations, communities, academia and other relevant actors at the local level.

 
In addition, through this challenge, we seek to support the development of a new community of people interested in innovation, contributing to the formation of a Paraguayan Network of Public Innovators, generating visibility and building potential alliances with governmental, academic, civil organizations and the private sector.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Public sector innovation is about creating new and better ways to achieve positive public outcomes. The increased complexity of the challenges faced by governments has made it imperative for them to improve their capacities to learn, adapt, and innovate, having a lasting and positive impact in both public policies and services. This overarching goal, however, cannot be achieved without seamlessly integrating the new approaches or solutions into the existing systems. The capacity of the public sector to innovate depends on how much research, development and innovation tools and methods are integrated into government functions, mechanisms, and human capital.

To this day, the Paraguayan government still faces innumerable challenges in putting its key research and innovation strategies and tools into practice. For example, plans for a government-led innovation technology lab (the GobLab), have been in development for several years, but have yet to be officially launched. National R&D programs have a hard time executing their resources fast enough. R&D or innovation units have come and gone in different institutions, without yet achieving lasting sustainability and appropriation. The current situation is really that of a system that is still in a very nascent stage, with a lot of potential and opportunities, but also with the unintended effects of making it difficult for human R&D talent to find enough stability to stay within the system.

For this reason the AccLab has been working closely with the Paraguay’s National Innovation Strategy (ENI), and National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT) as a result of these partnerships, in 2022 and 2023, the AccLab offered technical support for the implementation of the Public Innovators Program, this collaboration aims to (1) strengthen public-sector leadership, and (2) build new alliances with different sectors, such as business, academia, and civil society, with the objective of articulating collaboration for public-policy and public-service innovation challenges. In the second part of the year, UNDP will finance and accompany the implementation of 2 of the 6 proposals submitted: Kuña Arandu (Ministry of Women) and Poranduha (Directorate of Non-Contributive Pensions).

The AccLab has also been promoting spaces for capacity building in social innovation focused on the SDGs in collaboration with the SDG Commission Paraguay (under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), the ENI and the National University of Itapúa (UNI). " Moiru", a Community Challenge for Social Innovation that seeks to transfer methodologies and innovation tools to civil society organizations and academia, has so far had two editions, and is currently in the process of implementing two winning initiatives: Mr. Carrtot and Ta'aro, proposals focused on SDGs 5 and 8.

> 

As reported in a recent study on innovation skills within the Paraguayan public sector, between 20 and 40% of government human capital knows and practices some key innovation skills in their day-to-day life, and around 20% believe they can explain and transfer these abilities to others. When a team dimension is added to the question ("have you and/or your team used an ability"), the percentages range from 6% to 11%. Along with many other data reported by this study, it can be concluded that there is some awareness and knowledge about innovation methods in the Paraguayan innovation sector. However, there is also a gap between this knowledge and its practice in the development of public services. Furthermore, the same study highlights the lack of formal training as a key factor in the low or ineffective implementation of these methods in practice.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

The qualitative evidence on this challenge comes both from the Innovation Skills in the Public Sector Study, as well as from our own solutions mapping, exploration, and experimentation work to design and test potential public policies and services, in collaboration with the National Innovation Strategy. Our learning loops with the National Innovation Strategy (ENI) include two pilots that experimented with innovative solutions: (1) Food for all: a pilot project that experimented with access to nutritious food for families in the city of San Juan Nepomuceno, provided by a local agricultural fair led by women , (2) Flexible Production: a pilot project that tested how technical training and coordinated work between garment workshops could affect the flexibility of the productive processes and t the quality of the final products.


In addition to this, an important source of qualitative information for this challenge is the first edition of the Public Innovators Program, where our experience in both monitoring the program and implementing the solutions generated by the innovators gave us valuable inputs to iterate a new edition of the Public Innovators Program. We have documented some of our observations in a blog, and we have also developed in collaboration with ENI and CONACYT a report on the Public Innovators Program.


In order to document our main learnings on the application of social innovation methodologies and accompanying the territorialization of the SDGs, we developed blogs on the first two editions of Moiru, additionally we also documented through blogs the implementation of the proposals developed by the winning teams (5 initiatives in the first edition and 2 initiatives currently in progress).

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

  The National Innovation Strategy (ENI) was born almost at the same time as the UNDP Acceleration Laboratory in Paraguay. From the beginning of the relationship, we have cooperated with strengthening innovation capabilities of the system through this partnership, proposing and integrating learning methodologies to generate evidence within the practices, initiatives, and processes promoted or organized by ENI. Specifically, during 2023, we hope to collaborate and add value to this initiative by providing:

1) Advice and mentoring of public sector teams in mission-oriented R&D+I innovation processes, with a focus on applied participatory action research methods and tools developed by the Accelerator Labs Network and other partners, to help them define specific challenges and design public policy or service interventions and address them. 2) Advice, mentoring and direct accompaniment to implement the impact evaluations of public-policy and public-service pilot projects. 3) Knowledge transfer from our own local experience, and the accumulated experience of the network, directly to public servants working at institutions of the national government.

Moiru was born from a request for innovative work on the territorialization of the SDGs from the SDG Commission Paraguay (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), this relationship is managed by the Governance portfolio within the country office. In this sense, it represented a strategic opportunity to position new services offered by UNDP with our main counterpart at the country level and also contributed to the strengthening of an internal relationship within the country office. As AccLab gives us the opportunity to collaborate with academic and civil society institutions mainly in the application of methodologies and tools for innovation and learning together.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How to implement and evaluate the impact of an innovation pilot project to improve a specific public service?



How to implement and evaluate the impact of a social innovation pilot project to support awareness and compliance with the SDGs?





> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

In this challenge, we will use sensemaking and collective intelligence to identify the innovation needs of public institutions. Through human-centered design, we will support public innovators to design innovative citizen-centered solutions. Then, the solutions will be prototyped and piloted to see if they respond to the previously identified needs. All of this will produce inputs that will help answer our learning questions.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data generated by this experience will permit us to produce new toolkits and methodological resources to improve the way public institutions integrate innovation skills in their day-to-day work. The experience will strengthen the use of evidence and data for generating and evaluating public policies and services. The experience will contribute to identifying the gap that currently exists between public policy, the use of public and administrative date, and achievement of the SDGs. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This learning cycle will strengthen our relationship with our main partners (ENI, CONACYT, Commission ODS Paraguay and UNI). This can generate more opportunities for collaboration and synergy between AccLab and these institutions, building on this experience and past alliances to develop joint innovation processes.
