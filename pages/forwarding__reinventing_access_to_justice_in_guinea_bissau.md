## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

- The Ministry of Justice was completely open to new changes and learnings to be applied to improve their way of working. The Governance Cluster at UNDP was also highly receptive.

- Digitalization was important to all involved parties, starting with user and ending with service provider for efficiency.

- A test when well conducted led to better service quality and also independent scaling in other areas of the ministry of justice.

- Workflow changes such as customer service and notary training led to new and improved ways of thinking for staff who had never received training and letting go of preconceived notions and stereotypes.

- Data driving for decision making in the Ministry of Justice. 

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Once the Mobile Justice solution was raised and tested, the results were put into a pitch deck which highlighted the impact in a small period of time. This subsequently led to UNICEF and UNDP joining hands to want to conduct this at country level in order to deliver services to the entire country.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Behavioral Insights: This method allowed us to understand through behaviour of users of the Ministry of Justice and House of Justice based on what was available in terms of services being offered and interactions with staff members. 

Co-creation: This method allowed to co-create an ideal space for staff and users of the notary office would work based on a Problem tree analysis workshop. 

Interviews: This method was necessary to understand staff and users to find the bottlenecks of their experiences and identify common ground to propose solutions to overcome those challenges. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collective Intelligence: was engaged in order to conduct a workshop with the notary office, high commissary for covid, police, universidade lusofuna, student association and UNICEF to come together and outline ways in which the services being provided at the ministry could be improved. 

Design thinking: This method enabled for the workflow to be improved by identifying areas which were relevant for improved user experience such as: reception desk, leaflets, price list, floating workers and screens. 

Participatory design: This method was also engaged in the digitalization process, in which tests were conducted to really identify how the process could become more efficient through digitalization.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The methods accelerated the process in its entirety through testing and prototyping we were able to demonstrate quickly how something could work for the better, which led to its quick adoption and scaling by involved partners. Additionally, these methodologies, as they were user centred, they were more sustainable. Furthermore, it led to data availability, as the exploration was so extensive the data collected is relevant for influencing other initiatives which may come in the future.
