> Title of the innovation

Gutit limited

> Brief description of the innovation

Gutit is a globally inclined, privacy-based commerce search engine comprising an encrypted email system, encrypted chat, encrypted browser, and an encrypted e-wallet. The platform revolutionizes the search results ranking method from cost-driven predicates that dilute the quality of search results to simplified, cheaper and consumer-driven (consumer satisfaction and quality) predicates through the implementation of the conference chat and e-wallet that are critical in the keyword-moderation process between consumers and business entities, effectively resulting in partial/no refund/full refund to the consumer and improved search results quality to the end-user. Gutit further revolutionizes global email communication through public key encryption, where the company shall not retain user email records or copy of user' login information (private key).

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Gutit will generate its revenue through keyword sales from business entities that have attained consumer satisfaction thresholds, as well as email monthly subscriptions and advertising as well as modified and customized corporate email subscriptions. The target market are local commerce and e-commerce business entities centered on privacy and reduced search-ranking and advertising cost as their primary need and want, and consumers that place absolute global email communication privacy as their need and want. Business entities with an excellent consumer satisfaction record will see very little need to pay for keywords due to the consumer-driven algorithm that props business entities up or down depending consumer satisfaction. The challenge prize will help with further software development to include audio and video features to the chat, as well as app development of the product. Currently, the product is web-based only.

> Technical Feasibility

The product is designed with a list and map search components, and the encrypted chat and e-wallet for keyword moderation purposes, where keyword moderators in each country will fall under a couple of supervisors. Moderators and agents regardless of their gender and age shall be able to sign up on the platform and work from the comfort of their respective homes on their own computers or smart phones and be paid through the e-wallet based on how much work they do. The other component is a privacy-based browser for secure web-browsing purposes. The product also incorporates an unhackable email system. The road map includes launching within Zambia before launching in big markets such as Nigeria and South Africa and the developed markets through virality and other go-to-market strategies in place

> Anticipated Social Impact

Globally, people from all walks of life, regardless of their age and gender will be able to sign up on the platform and work from the comfort of their homes on their respective computers and smart phones as keyword moderators, agents and supervisors, and be paid according to how much work they do, resulting in millions of jobs being created globally. The innovation leads to improved search results quality to the end-user, and less need for business entities to pay their way up in search results if they are great on consumer satisfaction. With the need for privacy on the rise, especially in the developed markets, the Gutit email system solves the problem of hacking and lack of complete global email communication privacy. Whereas Google, for example, stores users' email login information and users' email records are subject to subpoena by any governmental agency globally, Gutit will retain no user email records nor users' login credentials.
