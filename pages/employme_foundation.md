> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

EmployMe Foundation follows a twofold model in attaining it’s goal:
 Firstly, it seeks to link struggling unemployed youths to employment and paid internship opportunities.
Secondly, it seeks to fund struggling unemployed youths living in poverty with startup funds to set up their own businesses or upscale their already existing businesses. The main aim of this initiate is to subsequently make youths employers in the near future. This initiative uses the principle of revolving funds; that is, a number of youths with feasible businesses apply for funding and later repay with low interest. The profits are then reinvested and given to another set of youths for the purpose of upscaling the program.
