> Brief description of the innovation

Selling medicine to people in need. In this period of corona virus, it is required to sell antibiotics to people in need. Most hospitals have no medicine, so they write prescriptions for people to use as they buy drugs. The drug store or Chemist will help many people to access medicine with easy. It's better to come up with many drug stores in rural areas, so as to help people buy medicine with easy when the clinic or hospital don't have.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

By receiving people from clinics or hospitals with prescriptions, it will help me sell a lot of drugs to people. Especially now that rural areas are hit with shortage of medicine in hospitals, it can help my business to grow fast. I will sell medicine to people in need and the hospital or clinic will assist me by sending people in need to buy.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently am running a building shop structure, where all medicines or drugs are stored and supplied. I would love to grow it to a pharmacy to manage all people in need with easy. A pharmacy is my plan.

> Anticipated Social Impact

By buying drugs, people will have better and good health. There will be no shortage of medicine in the area.
It is important to the current market because it helps people access medication with easy.
