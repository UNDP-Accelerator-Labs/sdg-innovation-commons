> Title of the innovation

sustainable agriculture

> Brief description of the innovation

This farms project  is a mixed farming enterprise promoting livestock farming activities Hatchery (poultry and piggery production) as well as maize, tomatoes, vegetable and soya beans  growing(grain and vegetable).

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project farm has decided that introducing a piggery, hatchery, feed production, a sasso and layer poultry operation and crop growing will meet these requirements. The necessary infrastructure for a successful operation of this nature are already in place and ready for use. 
The poultry meat production, feed production, egg production will not only provide the three requirements to solve the identified  problems of the project farm  but implementing it will ensure the capital investment required will pay for itself when the project comes on stream.
The project farm will buy most of the raw materials from local farmers 
Will embark on a program of transforming and harnessing unskilled and semi-skilled youth in Muchinga Province into a core productive population segment with the requisite skills and know-how to practice commercial agriculture profitably and sustainably.

> Technical Feasibility

the pilot project has started with 1 incubator and infrastructure to accommodate 8000 birds, currently we are hatching 150 birds per month ,our intended target is 1000 birds as our parent stock. At full maturity  by June 2022 our birds will be able to produce an average of 24,000 per month. Our project  will also include incubator making and feed making for self sustainability of the farm.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The problem of massive youth unemployment, who by virtue of their numbers represent a very large idle, but unexploited productive segment of the population. this project will train youth in various skills to enable them run there own successful poultries, we believes that we can make a major impact on the livelihoods of the local population by its engaging in and implementation of sustainable commercial agriculture (SCA) practices., Which can help us alleviate the severe socioeconomic problems Muchinga province has
