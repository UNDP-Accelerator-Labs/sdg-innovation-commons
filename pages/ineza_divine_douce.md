> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

According to Rwanda Energy Group(REG), 80% of Rwandans rely on fire wood which leads to Deforestation and respiratory diseases. As the cost LPG is quite high and not available in small packages, it is complicated for low income earners to afford. This is why NGWINO UREBE GAZ STOVE was made. It transforms any Petroleum Product into LPG.
