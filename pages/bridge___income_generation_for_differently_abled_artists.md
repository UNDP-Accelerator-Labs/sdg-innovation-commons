Bridge acts as a platform for people to respond in practical ways to create opportunities for income generation; to explore opportunities for the deaf and mute artists and to work for sustainable and long-lasting change. Bridge wants to be a platform for the deaf and mute artists not only in Bangladesh but also around the world. BRIDGE Foundation conducts various initiatives such as the project “ARTPreneur for Differently Abled” where they have opportunities to work under the experts through monthly basis workshop and selling their artwork online.
