Plastic Pollution Challenge:

0.73 million tons of plastic waste are released from Vietnam into the ocean each year; Plastics generated in the three districts of Ha Long Bay is estimated to be more than 28,000 tons a year and plastics entering the ocean more than 5,000 tons; Only 10-15% of collected waste in Vietnam is reused or recycled.

Solution:

We use trawl-nets to collect plastics in bodies of water, then recycle these plastics into long lasting construction materials. This solution has an immediate impact and can be conducted in parallel with other actions focused on preventive measures with a  longer term impact.

Innovation: 

A comprehensive solution that, for the first time, combines collection and recycling of plastic waste, with quite some novelty. For collection, we use trawl-nets that have been continuously improved over more than 20 years. They are now manufactured in Indonesia and made of neoprene to be high resistance and long-lasting. For recycling, we use an open-source process from Precious Plastic. Our team has developed a formula to transform mixed plastic waste into durable plastic planks. Introducing recycled-plastic planks to the South East Asian market will expand the possibility of plastic recycling, and encourage more sorting and recycling in the future. It is worth noting that the cost of producing plastic waste will diminish as the production scale increases. Due to its durability, it is suitable for tropical climates.
