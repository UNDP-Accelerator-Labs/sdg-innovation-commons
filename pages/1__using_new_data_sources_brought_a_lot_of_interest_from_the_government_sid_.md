## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) Using new data sources picked the government's interest; these sources had never been used in development planning before, so the government was eager to collaborate.

2) Using AI, particularly Natural Language Processing, was faster, cheaper, and more dependable.

3) There is a need for government training, particularly on the use of new data sources ( collecting, analyzing and visualization)

4) Because using new data sources necessitates funding, resource mobilization for data management is critical.

5) There is a need for assistance in developing capacities for the execution of data agreements ( e.g who owns the data when a third party is involved)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Like in any other African Country, we did face many bottlenecks:

1) While there was a great interest developed, it was a bit hard to legitimatize the data at some  government level; 2) lacking data science capabilities 3) Poor data quality (especially web data, at some point seemed skeptical)

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

AI and GIS as data sources had never been used before in Zanzibar. The existing surveys are outdated and therefore do not portray the actual reality on the ground.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

It was necessary to use AI to enable easy collection and analysis of data from the web, as well as GIS technology to collect geo-points and information about tourist attractions, particularly those that were underutilized.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Open Map Development- A non profit GIS organization that helped with the technical work.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The State University of Zanzibar whose Youth mappers chapter participated in mapping of tourist attractions.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not applicable.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The following organizations were involved:

1. Zanzibar Tourism Commission (provided guidance and authorization to work in Zanzibar)

2. Zanzibar Tour Operators Association (gave intelligence on unfrequented sites and helped in mapping)

3. Zanzibar Tour Operators Association (gave overview of the investment landscape and helped in mapping exercise)

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Open Map Development- this organization is small and new, worked with UNDP for the first time in Zanzibar.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNWTO- Provided insights on Innovation in tourism and agreed to participate in reviewing draft reports and visuals.
