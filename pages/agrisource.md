> Description of the solution

Agrisource is an online, free, and open database dedicated to innovations in agriculture, particularly in the context of climate change. While Agrisource itself does not develop technologies, it serves as a platform to connect and share experiences related to climate-smart agriculture. For instance, it features projects like GreenRice, which tests the alternative wetting and drying system (AWDS) in Europe to save water and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
