> Title of the innovation

Isograft.com

> Brief description of the innovation

Isograft is a website that eases the search for accommodation at university and colleges. By simply going to isograft.com a student can find accommodation options and pick one that suits their needs without the hustle of moving around

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Isograft already generates money, it does this in three ways user subscriptions that is each student pays a monthly fee in order to access isograft services, boarding house commissions, which are commissions received from boarding houses for every student that enters their place through isograft and finally the income generated is then pushed into soft loans that also help students and increase the total income generated.
With regards to improving other businesses, boarding houses in particular would benefit from isograft as they will no longer need to worry about advertising themselves and using our boarding house manager app they can better manage the ins and outside of their homes.
Our target market is student center with boarding house owners being a subgroup. As this market never finishes it is safe to say that we are able to expand especially once proper funding is injected into the business, it will help us do better marketing, orientation, help us create relationships with the schools, student unions and the boarding houses making it easy for our services to work.
They is no direct impact on the environment but it is safe to say that isograft will reduce the number of students moving in search of accommodation and the number of boarding houses sticking posters in search of students.

> Technical Feasibility

Isograft is a web based app and as such is made with common web languages this includes, php, html, CSS and mysql. 
In the next few months and app version will be available which will help in making isograft more accessible.

> Anticipated Social Impact

In the last two years of isograft's existence we have had hundreds of calls asking for our services to be taken to a number of universities, this to us shows us that indeed a service like ours is a necessity. No other company does our we do and it is our uniqueness that makes our service so desirable. The impact on the student population is undeniable, with isograft on moves from taking days to find accommodation to minutes.
