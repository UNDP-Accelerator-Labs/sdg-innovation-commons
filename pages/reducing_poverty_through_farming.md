> Title of the innovation

REDUCING POVERTY THROUGH FARMING

> Brief description of the innovation

Poverty has been a mojor cause of conflict in Africa. ARCWIN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT believes that through farming, pobert levels will drastically reduce in Zambia as well as Africa. This will lead to sustainable development in all sectors of life. From individual to national level. ARCWIN AIMS AT PROVIDING SUSTAINABLE APPROACHES TO FARMING IN ZAMBIA AND REDUCING POVERTY AND HUNGER. THIS WILL LEAD TO SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH EMPLOYMENT OF LOCAL PEOPLE AT THE FARM.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through selling of greasy eggs and meat to local markets, ARCWIN AIMS AT employing local people to work at the farm through poultry and animal husbandry generally. This will give a wage to the employees and also give them a shelter as the company will provide accomodation for all employees. ARCWIN AIMS AT giving not only income but also a piece of mind to the Zambian markets that they will not sleep hungry by the end of the day. Therefore, the prize will not only empower sustainble development but also offer a chance for individual development and gain.

> Technical Feasibility

The proposed implementation plan has to start from a farm which ARCWIN already has. From this farm structure for animal husbandry will be constructed and possibly engage specialist to work as farm managers and employees. ARCWIN WILL engage intenship agricultural to provide skills and knowledge in animal husbandry from inception up to the final stage. There are many prototypes that exists especially in Zambia. For instance,  many farm blocks in Zambia can act as prototypes and ARCWIN will engage with them to gain more knowledge and skills.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will provide not only a wage but also income and shelter. Employees will have a piece of mind and this will lead to improved production at the farm. Hence contributing not only to the company just also to the food basket of Zambia.
