> Other Notes

Barriers of the initiative: (1) Low-income population: Lack of affordable housing is a recognized problem in major cities of Canada. The low-income population is especially vulnerable and needs financial aid to improve the energy performance of their houses and reduce their energy bills. (2) Buildings built during a specific time period: The majority of Canadian buildings were constructed prior to the implementation of new energy-efficient building codes. Furthermore, old buildings that form a part of the cultural heritage have limited opinions in energy upgrades and require special incentives for energy improvement. (3) Aboriginal population: Future sustainability of the aboriginal community in Canada faces economic, social and environmental challenges. Aboriginal people are one of the most marginalized communities in Canada with limited energy resources. (4) The cost of investment for energy upgrades and limited return on investment are major barriers in energy efficiency improvement of rental housing sector. (5) Buildings built to specific building standard/code: Provision of green certification to a building adds additional burdens to the costs of Green Buildings.
