## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Exploring fintech as a driver of innovation and accelerator for achievement of the sustainable development goals. 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to explore the opportunities and potential of the massive fintech ecosystem in Nigeria as a driver of innovation and to accelerate achievement of the SDGs.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The fintech sector has grown massively in Nigeria over the the last 6 years, increasing the range of services offered, and access to financial services. Fintechs have tapped into pent-up demand to the underserved middle class and urban residents. This sector has also seen significant foreign direct investment, about $800m in 2021 and has continued to grow consistently while the larger economy declines. However over half of the adult population is still unbanked and many services are concentrated in urban areas. Areas with limited access to financial services also tend to be areas with multiple high indicators of deprivation. The challenge is to see what opportunities exist to harness the growth and innovation in this sector for wider development.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

It is worth investing in this challenge to promote digital and financial inclusion and expand the range of opportunities available to multiply excluded groups. The Accelerator Lab needs to work on this challenge, because of its familiarity with the innovation ecosystem built through engagements and partnerships.
