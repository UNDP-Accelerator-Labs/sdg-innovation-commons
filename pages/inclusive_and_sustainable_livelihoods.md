## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



1. As for the first learning question: How much waste and what kind does the Plataforma Central 1ero de Mayo generate?

The first finding was the lack of data. There is no available data regarding waste generation for popular markets or other businesses because waste is collected and mixed, and the municipality only has general information on the total amount of waste. Thanks to students` participation, we now have the data:

• 258,33 kg of organic waste is produced weekly from the medicinal herb section

• 51 kg of waste is produced weekly from the prepared food section

• 94 kg weekly comes from the vegetable section

• 63 kg of inorganic waste is produced weekly.

This information confirmed that composting would contribute significantly to waste management as most of this market´s waste is organic.

2. Regarding the second learning question, What does the organizational model look like in practice and prototype for a cooperative chain value of dehydrated plants?

We learned that a decentralized model contributes to joint efforts to work in a network. Recognizing each person´s assets was fundamental to deciding their role. This network has a unique business model based on the group´s assets, possibilities and solidarity.

3. Can using an irrigation system with a hygrometer contribute to saving time and effort and increasing water consumption efficiency?

We tested this with an experiment, and the answer was yes. Even if the results had shown a small increase in water, reducing the physical effort of informal and precarious herbalists is still worth it. Time was reduced to one-third.

II. Bootcamps

4. Alliances are fundamental to guarantee inclusion and social mobility with digital skills. Without the private sector inputs and backbone, achieving meaningful results wouldn't have been possible.

5. Digital training needs combined approaches (in-person and digital) for participants to fully engage with the experience.

6. Involving mentors in the training process is fundamental for them to give advice and get acquainted with potential candidates for upcoming vacancies.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)


- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our private sector partners have expanded our joint work through their own resources in our country or internationally

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



After having done a deep immersion in the realities of the most essential wholesale medicinal plant market in Quito to understand different challenges and provide specific "customized" recommendations in a policy brief, the municipality has taken them into account for policy design.  

The Municipal Environment Secretariat has implemented the recommendations and is issuing a policy to credential plant collectors, which implies their recognition and revaluation. Ecuador´s accelerator lab is providing technical assistance in creating this policy.

II. Bootcamps

The private sector uptake of the BootCamp methodology has meant that companies from the tech sector are investing fresh resources in training new talent (with gender and age focus) for their companies.

Technology job fair: at the end of the training process, participants will access job offers in the technology sector through a job fair developed by UNDP and CITEC. Hence, it generates a virtuous employment cycle for women and young people.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



Collective intelligence and a participatory approach were used because no solution is possible without those concerned.

Finally, the quartering technique is a method that originated in Mexico to characterize solid waste. The technique involves pouring a significant amount of waste sample and then flattening it out into a cake. The cake is then divided into quarters; the two quarters which sit opposite one another are discarded, while the other two are combined and constitute the reduced sample. This sample was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively (weighed and classified). This was done for 8 consecutive days in the market.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



Behavioral change was possible for waste management by firstly anticipating possible resistance to waste separation. Mainly, market vendors are time poor and adding a new task or responsibility could encounter resistance. We interviewed  and used a survey to set an attitude and behaviour baseline and learn about their (legitimate) reason for not wanting to separate waste. Strategies were then customized to these realities, we made the intervention as simple as possible and had an on site- observational training process. Instead of theoretical explanations, training was done stand by stand by observing waste and providing feedback.

Experiments using A/B

testing (quasi-experimental approach) based on control and trials was done to measure the effectiveness of the irrigation system. The before and after intervention allowed us to measure time and water use.

May 1st Central Market has operated since January 15, 1975, bringing together more than 150 traders of which more than 100 are herbalists engaged in the production, collection, and sale of edible and medicinal herbs.

This market is the first link in the distribution of medicinal herbs in the city, as it supplies intermediary traders from other markets in the sector and in the city. However, wholesale does not yield an advantage or higher profit. In fact, more than 85% of these producers earn less than minimum wage. We have a portfolio of interventions with these actors.
