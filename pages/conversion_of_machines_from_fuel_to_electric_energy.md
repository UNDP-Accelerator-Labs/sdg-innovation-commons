## Profiting from existing machinery and structures and modifying their motors to eliminate pollution

MPS is a start-up in Monterrey, Mexico that assists anyone with an old car or a gas or diesel machinery to convert their energy source to electricity. In the case of any vehicle or machinery, they start by eliminating the components that will not be of use: the main engine, the gear, the cooling, and the exhaust system, the fuel tank, and everything related to fuel.

Then they adapt and take advantage of existing parts using the same manual transmission, brake system, and electrical system.

Finally, they install new components. The electric motor, its controller, and the battery are the vital elements of the system. Additionally, other auxiliary and control components are installed.
