About Us

UNDP’s Accelerator Labs were built in 2019 to change the way UNDP does development
by learning what works and what doesn’t in sustainable development to reach the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in time. Because of the speed, dynamics
and complexity of today’s challenges we’re not progressing fast enough, and current
development practices must keep up with the pace of change.

As an agile incubator of ideas and solutions, we are “the fast and the curious” as we
search for local solutions and forge partnerships to make extraordinary breakthroughs
on complex global challenges.

Our Work

The Labs are helping
UNDP reimagine
sustainable development for
the 21st century by accelerating
learning on what works and what
doesn’t when it comes to sustainable
development, testing new ways of working to
address social and environmental challenges, and
creating a new capability for decision-makers to
explore, experiment, and grow portfolios of mutually
reinforcing solutions to tackle today’s challenges.

Accelerator Lab - Barbados and the
Eastern Caribbean

The UNDP Accelerator Lab network is composed of
90 Lab teams covering 115 countries embedded in
UNDP country offices.

In this report, you’ll learn about The Accelerator
Lab - Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean
work throughout the region.

Additionally, the Lab conducted three
(3) studies
focussing on challenges
identified within a country context which
have provided some key insights and
opportunities for future interventions.

The Lab has also captured learning from
the execution of interactive workshops
and visioning exercises
focused on
the blue and digital economies. Using
research and creative storytelling, the Lab
has successfully reached unconventional
audiences and will continue to explore
these results further in 2024.

While some dynamic changes were
achieved through the Lab’s work with
the BE this year, they were also able to
contribute to the development of the
green and orange economies as well.
The team made a holistic push for digital
innovation and took special care to reach
traditionally disadvantaged groups in the
community, for example, Persons with
Disabilities (PWDs), youth and women.
It has been a year of strengthening
partnerships and making new ones, a
year of firsts and a year of continuity.
Overall, in 2023, the Lab celebrated
successes and discovered areas that
needed improvement as it continued to
integrate learning and innovation culture
into development.

Let’s dive into
the Blue

The team partnered with the
British Virgin Islands to support
the government with the creation
of a 2-year action plan to support
the implementation of their Blue
Economy Strategic Road Map.

The Lab continued its drive to support
BE development and was active in the
policy space this year. As such, the team
partnered with the British Virgin Islands
to support the government in the creation
of a 2-year action plan
to implement their Blue
Strategic
Economy
Road Map. The Lab
further supported
the
initiation of a preliminary
Blue Economy Scoping
Study in Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines inclusive of Union
Island. As the Caribbean continues to
explore the BE, it is essential that studies
such as these are conducted to ensure

in partnership with the Government
of Dominica, piloted an underwater
mapping experiment using 360 camera
technology for an on-going coral reef
monitoring exercise in Dominica.

Promoting the BE and positioning it in
a positive light for the public is also an
important aspect of getting communities
inspired and involved. To that end, the Lab
partnered with the Barbados Fisheries
Division
to produce a documentary
on local fisHER Ladies in Barbados -
entitled, “The Barbadian Matriarchy of
Fishing,” which served the dual purpose

of promoting BE activities and telling the
often-unheard stories of women in the
fishing industry. The video garnered over
44.3k views and was featured at the World
Trade Organisation (WTO), showcasing
the importance of women in the fishing
industry in Small Island Developing State
(SIDS). In 2024 the video will be used
as a tool for engaging with youth and
vulnerable women to demonstrate the
importance of the industry and its viability
as an income generator.

From the blue to
the green

In the Caribbean, the BE is closely
connected to the Green Economy and
the Lab is bridging the gap. The team
successfully collaborated with the UNDP
Climate Resilient Agriculture (CRA) project
and the Nature, Climate and Energy (NCE)
cluster on a Blue-Green Digital Innovation
Challenge in Grenada. With a focus on
innovation, the Lab supported the launch
of the Digital Innovation Challenge by

The creative
Economy, like the blue, has untapped
potential in the Caribbean. Exploring the
role of the orange using innovation, the
Lab completed a regional community
challenge geared towards the creative
economy in association with the Barbados
Museum & Historical Society (BMHS). The
“Paint, Sketch, Draw, Photograph, Design
and Create YOUR Sustainable Vision of
the Blue-Green Futures of the Eastern
Caribbean Environment!” campaign was
launched in conjunction with (UN) World
Oceans Day 2023.

The campaign focused on gathering
perspectives of youth, and PWDs,
on sustainable visions of the Eastern
Caribbean environment. Participants
identified, at the community level, views,
thoughts, experiences and visions on the
restoration and regeneration of the Blue

and Green Economies and by extension
the intersection of ocean and climate
action.

Through the art pieces, UNDP and
the BMHS hope to shed light on new,
creative, and sustainable approaches
to safeguarding and stewarding the
future of the environment with potential
identification of
impactful solutions
addressing the effects of climate change
and environmental degradation in the
region.

In addition, the Lab sparked conversation
on the role of the creative industries in
promoting positive action by hosting
a panel discussion on “Art as a Tool for
Change” with thought leaders in arts and
culture.

Development in a
digital world

Promoting digital literacy and exploring
digital solutions drive the work of the Lab
and, this year, the team made great strides
with government partners. One project of
note was the Lab’s role in assisting the
facilitation of the Antigua and Barbuda
Digital Readiness Assessment (DRA) 2023
in collaboration with several UN agencies.
This co-facilitation of a workshop for the
DRA was part of an inter-agency effort
to socialise stakeholders to the DRA and
develop a vision for the country’s digital
transformation goals and initiatives.

In Barbados,
the Lab collaborated
with the Ministry of Youth, Sports and
Community Empowerment on the 3 Days,

of making meaningful contributions to society. As such, the Lab conducted a pilot
of the Work Online Dominica (WOD) programme for PWDs where six (6) persons
with varying disabilities were trained how to create and access online employment
in collaboration with IsraAID in Dominica. The project showed great promise with
helping PWDs find accessible remote work.

In addition to the Dominica project, the team conducted a study in Saint Lucia to
determine feasible learning methods and future skills beneficial to youth with Special
Education Needs (SEN). Several knowledge products were developed and there is
great potential to expand this area by investigating other learning methodologies to
support young people with disabilities in reaching their full potential.
