Fiji's first goat milk soap by woman entrepreneur Beatrice Nast has created employment opportunity for 2 Fijian women who will be making the soaps, as well as provided a means of income for 5 local farms that will be supplying the goats’ milk, and local virgin coconut oil producers. It will serve as a natural and organic product for both local people and international visitors, an ideal option for those with skin sensitivities as it is a natural alternative to soaps made with harsh chemicals.
