Denga Logistics Limited

> Brief description of the innovation

Over 3.4 billion people in the world live in rural and remote areas of developing countries. Low income of the population, long distance to access adequate healthcare services, poor public transport, and in accessible roads which creates barriers for timely provision of healthcare. The Zambian rural population is at 9,989,317 people, health facilities that provide services to this population usually face tremendous challenges in receiving essential medical supplies or sending medical samples for laboratory testing to a district hospital due to poor road infrastructure. This creates a shortage in medical stores thus, delaying the diagnosis and proper management of patients. A barrier is created that prevents community members to access the healthcare they need. 
Denga logistics limited is bridging this gap by leveraging on drone deliveries and technology (Ai powered system) to deliver essential medical commodities such as blood, vaccines, medicines and test kits as well as collect medical samples for laboratory testing. We are developing an Artificial intelligence powered system that will allow clinicians and nurses to schedule or request for a delivery or pick up of medical samples. They will be able to receive the medical results electronically. This system will be able to learn the demands of each Health post. The system will be accessed via mobile/web app, SMS/USSD, and what’s app messenger. 
Our solution reduces the time of delivery by 60% and improves the health status of rural communities

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our customers are institutions with a presence on the ground such as the government, humanitarian agencies, logistics operators, health centers and commercial entities. Our business model is a B2B, we will work with our clients on a subscription/ contract agreement terms and the charge will be based on the distance, type of cargo, quantity and duration of contract. 
This challenge is an opportunity to help us in the development of our system, it will help us hasten the development of our system and easier to use. 
Our innovation is environmentally friendly because the drones we are using use renewable energy (rechargeable batteries) and do not emit any green house gases.

> Technical Feasibility

We are creating an AI system that will allow clinicians and nurses to schedule, request for deliveries of medical commodities and pickups of lab samples. It will be able to learn and understand the demands of each health facility. This system will be accessed via mobile application/ website, USSD/SMS, and what’s app messenger. 
Once the requests are made the drones will be able to make deliveries. 
Our partner Avy Aera, manufactures drones that can be 65% faster than the traditional means of getting to rural communities. The drones can travel for a distance of upto 100Km beyond visual sight with an average speed of 75Km/hr. They have a payload of upto 2Kg with a cooling system conducive to carry vaccines. 
We are currently doing our registration with the Zambia Civil Aviation Authority and we will be the first to receive the operations license in Zambia. 
We are reaching out to stake holders that would need our services so as we can do the pilot program with them.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Zambia has over 1,331 rural health centers with a lot health promotion activities going on across the country. There are over 20 non governmental organizations spearheading public health activities, these humanitarian agencies experience logistics challenges in providing services to their beneficiaries. It delays service provision and limits there potential. 
Our solution makes health posts and dispensaries to function by having having a regular supply of health commodities from the regional and district centers. This robust transportation system will adequately equip health centers to handle emergencies. This will prevent complications, prolonged illness, needless deaths and improve the health status of community members
