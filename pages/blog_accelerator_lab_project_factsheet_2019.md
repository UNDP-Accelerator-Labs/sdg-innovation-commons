ACCELERATOR LAB

The UNDP Accelerator Labs introduce new services and development approaches backed by evidence
and practice. They explore current development challenges and opportunities, and map, test and upscale
local solutions and innovations. The Lab is based on four approaches: expanding locally sourced solutions;
rapid testing to determine what works; combining the best ideas and expertise to generate collective
knowledge; and accelerating and broadening strategic partnerships.

Voices

“Social Innovation is very important, particularly in
regard to the products we consume. Many young
people and children have no desire to consume our
food because the industry is dominated by imported
food. I need to take action to create innovation that is
attractive and to create demand for local nutritious
food. ”
