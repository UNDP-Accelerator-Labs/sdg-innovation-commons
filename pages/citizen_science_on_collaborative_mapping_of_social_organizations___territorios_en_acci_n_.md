Overall goal:  Highlight the participation of civil society organizations in the social development of the different territories in Argentina by means of a collaborative process of building public and open knowledge.  Specific goals:  Create and maintain a web platform of the project, which collects and disseminates information about the actions carried out by the Argentine civil society organizations. - Elaborate an interactive MAP and DATABASE at a national level to be permanently updated with the participation of the organizations in knowledge building as regards their actions throughout the country. - Systematize and analyze the collected data and share the results publicly, openly and through user-friendly formats. - Foster the development of discussions on the role of the Argentine civil society by generating environments of exchange between activists and experts.  

Description of citizen participation: Citizens can participate in the project in two ways: a) voluntary contribution of the civil society organizations (CSO) as regards information about their actions in the territory by completing a form; b) participation of CSO members or experts on the topic in discussions, talks, reporting based on the analysis of the results, and other activities to disseminate their initiatives or by means of the different networks which are part of the mapping.
