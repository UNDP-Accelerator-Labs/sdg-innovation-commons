ReefVitalize helps tourists create their own coral reefs while on vacation. In less than an hour standing on the beach, you can create your own mini coral reef that will stay in the ocean for one year - temporarily helping restore local ecosystems and eventually restoring entire reefs.systems and eventually restoring entire reefs.

Purchase a coral frame to build and fill with corals for you, your partner, your family, or your friends while on vacation. Your reef will stay in the ocean for one year and the coral colonies will eventually be moved to a wild reef.
