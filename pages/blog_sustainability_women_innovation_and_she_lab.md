As the Head of Experimentation within the UNDP Türkiye Accelerator Lab (AccLab), I’ve gained valuable insights not only into conducting experiments to address development challenges but also into thinking creatively and exploring new approaches to project development. Whether we refer to them as experiments or projects, my goal has always been to challenge the status quo and find fresh ways to accomplish what we’ve traditionally done.Private sector partnerships have long been a cornerstone of UNDP's approach. However, the key to success lies in recognizing that corporate social responsibility alone is not enough to tackle the complex development challenges we face. It is crucial that we collaborate with our partners to find deeper, more sustainable solutions.With this in mind, and in collaboration with colleagues at my Country Office, we conceived an idea to educate and empower young women to become leaders in sustainability. This initiative goes beyond promoting gender equality; it’s about encouraging women to take action now and lead the way in the sustainability ecosystem for the future.While our partner in this endeavor is Boyner Group, a well-known textile and retail company in Türkiye, the project is designed to go beyond a traditional private sector partnership. We’re working together to address this challenge in a unique and innovative way.Of course, training is a major component of the program, but the project is structured to allow us to test the methodology in its first year. We aim to assess its effectiveness—whether we meet our goals and create the impact we envision. This will provide valuable insights into whether we’ve found a new approach that can drive lasting change.In today’s rapidly evolving world, the need for sustainable practices has never been more critical. At the same time, there’s a glaring gap in leadership across many sectors, with women often underrepresented in decision-making roles. This imbalance is particularly evident in the sustainability ecosystem. The She Lab project was created to address this issue head-on, focusing on equipping young women with the knowledge, confidence, and network they need to become leaders in sustainability and drive meaningful change.The Vision Behind She LabOur core belief is simple: empowering women to become leaders in sustainability is not only crucial for achieving gender equality but also essential for driving long-term positive change for our planet. Across the public and private sectors, women’s leadership roles are often limited, and sustainability initiatives are no exception. We saw this gap as an opportunity to innovate and create a platform where young women could actively shape the future of sustainability.Through She Lab, we are committed to increasing the number of women leaders who are not only skilled in sustainability practices but also confident in their ability to implement solutions that positively impact the Earth. This project allows women to gain the tools they need to build careers that are aligned with their passions, while also contributing to the global sustainability agenda.An Innovative Approach to EmpowermentShe Lab stands out for its innovation—not just in content, but in delivery, structure, and outcomes. The program is designed as a comprehensive 3-month online training journey, divided into three key stages that guide participants through personal growth, sustainability knowledge, and project idea development.Month 1: Self-DevelopmentThe first month of the program is all about building confidence and self-awareness. Through interactive modules, the participants work on their personal growth and leadership skills. This sets the foundation for them to take ownership of their learning journey and prepares them for the challenges ahead.Month 2: Sustainability KnowledgeThe second month focuses on equipping participants with in-depth knowledge about sustainability. Senior staff from UNDP lead specialized training sessions to raise awareness of the global sustainability agenda, while Boyner executives offer insights into the corporate side of sustainability. This blend of academic and corporate perspectives ensures participants are well-rounded in their understanding of sustainability, preparing them for real-world challenges.Month 3: Idea Generation and Project RealizationIn the final month, participants are encouraged to develop their own sustainability project ideas. Through workshops and mentoring, they learn how to turn their ideas into actionable plans. The best ideas are selected and implemented under Boyner Group companies, giving the participants the unique opportunity to bring their projects to life and contribute directly to the sustainability agenda.The innovative aspect of this program lies not only in its content but also in the collaborative platform it provides. The use of a learning management system (LMS) used by Boyner for staff training, allows participants to access training materials anytime, ensuring no one falls behind. It also serves as a hub for communication, where participants can share ideas, ask questions, and build a supportive network.High Demand and Competitive SelectionThe success and innovation of She Lab have been evident from the overwhelming response we’ve received. In our first cohort, we received 2,600 applications. For the second cohort, 1,600 applications poured in—showing just how much young women are eager to seize the opportunity to be a part of this program. The selection process is highly competitive, with multiple stages including a rigorous multiple-choice exam followed by an AI-powered interview. Only the top 80 to 85 applicants are chosen for each cohort.One of the key goals of She Lab is to graduate 210 participants by the end of the year. As of today, we have 75 active participants in the first cohort, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. In fact, participant satisfaction is exceptional, with an average rating of 4.8 out of 5, highlighting the program’s effectiveness in meeting their expectations and empowering them to take on leadership roles.The network built through She Lab is also a key component of its success. Participants are encouraged to connect with each other, share their experiences, and support one another in their professional journeys. This fosters a sense of sisterhood and ownership, which is essential for long-term engagement and success in the sustainability field.A MovementAs we move forward, we’re excited about the second cohort, with the selection process set to conclude in few weeks. Ultimately, we want to see the young women we’ve trained become trailblazers in the sustainability ecosystem—transforming their communities, workplaces, and industries for the better.By focusing on innovation—whether through the structure of the training, the technology platform, or the integration of sustainability expertise—She Lab is not just a program, but a movement. A movement that’s helping women find their voices, build their leadership potential, and make a real impact on the future of sustainability.
