## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Implementing the Enabling Country Office Programme: Digitalization Innovation and Smart Cities Programme (DISC)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to explore how the Accelerator Lab can be integrated within the Country Office through facilitating the implementation of the CO enabling programme which is DISC.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Digital transformation, innovation and sustainable urbanization are some of key strategic areas for inclusive and green recovery from the COVID-19 related socioeconomic crisis as well as long-term socioeconomic transformation in Uganda. In recent years, the rise of innovative digital technologies and smart cities have been reshaping virtually every sector and aspect of daily life, and changing the way people learn, work, trade, socialize, and access public and private services and information. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated these trends. The rise of digital technologies and the concept of smart cities offer a unique opportunity for a country like Uganda to accelerate socioeconomic and governance transformation in terms of creation of jobs for youth, sustain economic growth, and enhance governance and public service delivery.   But due to challenges such as the ‘digital divide’ and ‘data security and privacy concerns’, the government, businesses, and individuals in Uganda have all yet to fully take advantage of new digital technologies to modernize their operations and improve the efficiency and convenience of accessing public services. In this regard, Uganda’s National Development Plan III has identified several priority programmes including (i) the Digital Transformation Programme which is  aimed at increasing ICT penetration and use of ICT services for social and economic development; ii) the Innovation, Technology Development and Transfer Programme which is aimed at increasing  development, adoption, transfer and commercialization of technologies and innovations through the development of a well-coordinated Science Technology and Innovation (STI) eco-system; and (iii)  the Sustainable Urbanization Programme which is aimed at attaining inclusive, productive and liveable urban areas for socio-economic transformation.   In this context, the proposed Digitalization, Innovation and Smart Cities (DISC) Programme aims to support the efforts of the government of Uganda and UNDP Uganda CO programmes to promote digitalization, innovation, and smart cities to accelerate Uganda’s structural transformation. The programme aims to provide the foundation for the successful launch of integrated digital, innovation and urbanization solutions in government and socioeconomic systems in Uganda leveraging the Accelerator Lab methodologies . This foundation will manifest in frameworks, strategies and mapping that foster the digital transformation, innovation and promote smart cities. Specifically, this programme will provide, technical, technological, and financial support for acceleration of digital transformation, strengthening of the innovation and start-up ecosystem, and promotion of the Smart Cities.

Over the last 10 years attempts have been made by the Government of Uganda, private sector, and Development Partners to invest in the country’s ICT technologies and infrastructure penetration. Despite the huge investments, Uganda still has one of the lowest internet penetration rates in Africa at 25% (NPA, 2020) and low mobile phone penetration rate of 49% of the population. The penetration rate of smartphone devices is at 16%. High costs of devices and internet access, digital illiteracy and limited IT skills, gaps in last mile ICT infrastructure and energy related issues (drivers) have created a huge urban-rural gap for internet use. 70% of Ugandans living in the urban areas have access to the internet compared to only 9% in the rural areas. (Gildwald et al., 2019). The main causes of low levels of internet usage in Uganda are poor ICT infrastructure, energy related issues, high levels of poverty and digital illiteracy. Only 18% of households in Uganda are connected to the main electricity grid. As a result, there is noticeable low proportion of government services online, estimated at 20% (NPA, 2020).

Uganda is ranked 114th amongst 131 countries on innovation (Global Innovation Index 2020), making it one of the lowest in the world.  Uganda ranks 6th among the 16 low-income group economies. Uganda ranks 13th among the 26 economies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The major bottlenecks that stifling the emergence of new enterprises from the innovation ecosystem are (i) Limited linkages between academia and industry due to the fragmentation of the various players and resources in the technology and product development value chain; (ii)  Inadequate specialized facilities and human capital to support technology development, product development and commercialization in the various innovation clusters; (iii) Absence of the necessary regulatory policies to support the growth of clusters of technology development within the ecosystem; (iv) Inadequate private sector participation in the enhancement of the innovation ecosystem; (v) Limited capacity for policy implementation in Uganda’s innovation ecosystem; and (vi) Inequality in distribution of innovation and research opportunities – most are urban based.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We believe that if we deploy the different Accelerator Lab methodologies, like Collective Methodologies, the  Acceleration of Uganda’s Digital Transformation will be achieved IF (a) the enabling environment for digitalization is strengthened to facilitate internet penetration, (b) digital literacy of the population is significantly increased, (c) the level of ICT skilling in both the public and private sectors is raised, and (d) government capacity is enhanced to increase the number of government services that are online and running on integrated digital platform. With these important and complementary foundations laid, THEN the country will begin to experience and accelerated digital revolution characterized by (a) an integrated and inclusive digital economy; (b) improved government efficiency, transparency and accountability; (c) enhanced business competitiveness, (d) increased youth innovation and entrepreneurship in the ICT start-up ecosystem, (e) increased job opportunities and (f) a strengthened the socio-economic sector.

What are the Digital Skills Gap for school going children from the ages of 9years to over 18

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The Accelerator lab will use a combination of these methods to make sense of the problem, analyze the drivers and their effects, harness views from diverse stakeholders including the unusual partners to co-create interventions to the challenge at hand. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Analysis of the Social network/social media data will show us the extent of digital divide in the country and what exact digital skills and infrastructure is missing.
