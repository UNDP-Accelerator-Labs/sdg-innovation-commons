Farm-Preneur

> Brief description of the innovation

Farm-Preneur is a reality show concept that focuses on teaching the youth about farming in an entertaining manner and will run for 4 months.

There will be 25 contestants that will be put in groups of 5. Each group will focus on a different type of farming, namely: horticulture, fish farming, poultry, piggery and dairy.

The underperformers will be eliminated until there are 5 contestants left of which one will be declared winner.

INCOME SOURCES
Our main income sources will be:
     1. Paid Sponsorships
     2. Advertisements
     3. Merchandising
     4. Farm produce
     5. Farm Trainings a la Farm-Preneur

The social impact will be huge as the show will reach the youths of Zambia (18-35 year olds) as well as other citizens interested in farming in an entertaining manner that will teach them about how to start farming whilst taking note of climate change and the local environment.

The prize will help obtain enough funds to get the program off the ground.

The value addition is the immediate reach to a wide population and in teaching them exciting and new ways in sustainable farming.

> Technical Feasibility

In order to kick start the entire season, we are currently fundraising 5000 euros to shoot the pilot of the show. Rotterdam School of Management (Erasmus), Hetty Denen Foundation, and the Chikupi Vocational Training Institution are collaborating with us in order to reach this objective. 

The goal is to have the money fundraised by end of December 2021 and to start shooting the pilot in January of 2022. After that the team will start getting ready to shoot the entire season. No timeline can be set for that yet.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The social impact that this will have on youth as well as other members of society will help the country in diversifying away from the dependency on copper and into creating farm produce for both the local market and for export by exploring untapped markets in agribusiness. 

This is not only a personal goal/agenda of Farm-Preneur but that of Zambia as well. As you well know, the youth take up the majority of Zambia’s population, yet have the lowest job employment rate of any age group. Farm-Preneur aims to give these youths tools to become self employed and positively contribute to increasing Zambia’s GDP
