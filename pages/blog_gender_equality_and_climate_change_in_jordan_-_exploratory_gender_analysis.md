Gender Equality and Climate Change in Jordan - Exploratory Gender Analysis
MARCH 6, 2022
“Climate change is not gender neutral and neither should climate action be”.
Women not only have a role to play in tackling the climate change threats but also their knowledge, experiences and views can better guide the actions adopted. Excluding women from the process and overlooking their needs, interests and creativity isolates fifty percent of the world and marginalize potential innovative solutions that can generate more environmental justice while bridging gender gaps and overcoming gender specific barriers.
The impacts of climate change on Jordan are significant which consequently threatens the livelihoods and health of the vulnerable communities, particularly women and girls. Communities relying on agriculture, food production and livestock farming are at considerable risk of climate displacement as they witness ecosystem and biodiversity degradations. Men and women within vulnerable communities experience climate change differently and have varying coping mechanisms that are restricted by social norms and values, particularly for women and girls.
