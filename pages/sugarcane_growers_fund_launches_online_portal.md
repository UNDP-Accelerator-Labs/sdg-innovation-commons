The Sugarcane Growers Fund (SCGF) has implemented innovative and modern financial solutions to its growers through the launch of the mySCGF App, mySCGF Online Portal Service and SCGF SMS Alert Services for the growers. The move to the new platform, which has online loan approvals, automated documentation and can be operated from the cane fields, is especially crucial during COVID19 pandemic lockdowns and travel restrictions.
