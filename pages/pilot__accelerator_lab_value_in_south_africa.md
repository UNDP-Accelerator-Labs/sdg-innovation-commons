## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Klariska Moodley

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

14 March 2024

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Inclusive Growth

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Food-Water-Energy Nexus

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Given the well established innovation ecosystem in South Africa, with various means of support for ideation, innovative businesses, etc., can the AccLab methods and tools for identifying, testing and scaling innovation offer any unique value. 

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (Trial and erros, prototype, a/b testing)
- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Department of Science and Innovation
## 
****
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Given the AccLab is an experiment at scale, there is a need to experiment on the lab itself within a country. Given the innovation ecosystem is well established and functioning in SA, we needed to demonstrate the lab's value within this setting. Therefore the learning question is: Can the AccLab offer value to the innovation system within South africa?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the AccLab can demonstrate its value, then it will recognized as a partner of choice and a key stakeholder for innovation in South Africa. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Support the identification, testing and scaling of local innovations. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

number of innovations supported

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

1. Experimental and project reports from the various initiatives supported

2. Feedback from partners

3. Feedback from beneficiaries

3. Ecosystem assessment data

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 years

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
