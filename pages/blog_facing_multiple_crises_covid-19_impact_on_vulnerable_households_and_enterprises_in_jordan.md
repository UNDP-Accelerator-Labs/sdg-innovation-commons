Facing Multiple Crises: COVID-19 – Impact on Vulnerable Households and Enterprises in Jordan
FEBRUARY 24, 2021
COVID-19: a magnifying glass for inequalities
The COVID-19 pandemic, whose full impact is still unfolding, has had a significant impact on livelihoods of households and host communities in Jordan. The crisis exacerbates existing vulnerabilities and overlaps with other crises: regional instability, significant refugee inflows, years of low economic growth and the impact of climate change.
In late April/ early May 2020 UNDP conducted a series of rapid impact assessments to determine the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown measures on households across Jordan and, in partnership with the International Labour Organization (ILO) and FAFO Institute for Labour and Social Research, on enterprises in Jordan. Understanding who is affected, where and in what way is important so that response measures can be designed to reach also those furthest behind. This policy note outlines key findings from the first round of rapid impact assessments and highlights impacts that are likely to exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and reverse human development trends and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
