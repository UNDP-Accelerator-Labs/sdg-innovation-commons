> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Accelerator lab work requires management support, which was successfully secured through the joint efforts of the innovation team from both global and regional offices. Without this top-down approach, the senior management may not fully recognize and value the lab's work and contributions.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

We used the UNDP portfolio sensemaking guide
## Partners
