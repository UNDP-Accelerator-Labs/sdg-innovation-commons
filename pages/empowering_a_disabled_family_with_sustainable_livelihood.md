> Title of the innovation

Empowering a disabled family with sustainable livelihood

> Brief description of the innovation

We attended a docars rally under Kamwala district Seventh-day Adventist church in April 2021. During our outreach programs, we came across the Mbayi family with 11 of its family members living with disabilities. Many people were so touched seeing their struggles as a family. My idea for the innovation to assist the family is to look at agricultural programs to raise money to sustain the family. The family has about 3 hectares of land where we can put poultry houses to keep layers and sell eggs, keep broilers and sell chickens, make fish ponds and sell fish as well as growing gardens and plant rain-fed crops like maize and soya beans. We could also use other farms to expand the projects

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The proposed agriculture programs will assist in feeding the Mbayi disabled family, as well as create employment for local people who will be working on the farm and the produce will be sold to community members which will increase food on the market. Eggs, broiler chickens, fish, maize and soya beans are easily sold at local or commercial level so business will not be a problem. Once we raise enough money we can buy more land, put boreholes and do banana plantations which will intern generate enough income. this income will assist this family to sort out a lot of problems including medical check ups at specialized hospitals and procure wheel chairs to aid their movements. The income will also support children for there school fees and requirements.

> Technical Feasibility

DESIGN
Fish farming
Keeping layers 
Keeping broilers
Growing maize and soya beans during the rain season
Lobby with the headman to expand the farm to increase production
Since the dorcas  SDA rally, we as a district are making frequent visits to the family and it will be easy to implement the agriculture projects
IMPLEMENTATION 
Speak to the headman and the district pastor about the project
Procure mechanization equipment like a tractor to make it easy to till the land , sink a borehole for irrigation, dig and construct fish ponds, build poultry houses, hire farm workers and buy a track to move farm produce to the market. Plant rain fed crops. After all the produce are ready, ensure food security at the Mbayi family and sell the extra to generate funds to sustain and extend the project

> Anticipated Social Impact

The family of the differently abled family will be able to improve their lives by being secure with food and will be able to take  their children to school and attend to their medical bills. I will also raise funds for my personal upkeep. There will be improve and increased food production and supply on the market.
