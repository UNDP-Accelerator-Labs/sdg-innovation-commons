Agensi Nuklear Malaysia is using it for a good cause by exposing mushrooms to gamma rays to modify their genes. One of the documented positive results was that shitake mushrooms previously planted only in the highlands have been modified so that they can be planted in the lowlands as well.   Ts. Dr. Azhar Mohamad said they use nuclear energy to alter the genetic material of plants for instance is not at all dangerous. Instead, this method enables different variations of plants to be grown for the benefit of society. This diversity allows the selection and screening of quality mushrooms that are resistant to the changes in the environment and can be grown and harvested in a shorter time.   This new breed is not classified as Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) because no external DNA is inserted into the cells of the mushroom. The mushrooms are grown on suitable substrate such as rice straw and wood dust that has been formed into blocks for easy handling. These materials are ideal to be used as substrate as they are low in cost and easy to prepare   The project makes the process of producing the mushroom blocks from farm waste more efficient by using nuclear energy. The inspiration behind this innovation is Dr Azhar’s goal to go green. His method keeps the cost of production low as there is no need for farmers to purchase an expensive block-making machine   Mushrooms can be collected continuously and can be produced up to 4 times/block/cycle. After a cycle is completed, the waste can be composted for fertigation activities
