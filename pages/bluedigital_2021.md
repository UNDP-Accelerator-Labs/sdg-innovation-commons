## Title

BlueDIGITAL 2021
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that many Micro, Small and Medium - sized Enterprises (MSMEs) in key sectors of the Blue Economy in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean such as fisheries and tourism have not fully adopted digital tools and solutions resulting in low or absent digital transformation within the industry's value chains and among key stakeholders. This challenge has been further realized due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis (hurricanes and ashfall) which has further exacerbated digital divides and resulted in the disruption of physical, informal transactions in the Blue Economy. As such, the BlueDIGITAL pilot experiment will create a digital tool starter kit and dashboard that will apply digital solutions and tools to improve segments of the Blue Economy ecosystem for fisherfolk, government, tourism industry partners and the general public as consumers. It will do so primarily through a proof of concept followed by minimum viable product mobile application and web platform that will bring the Ocean Online through enhancing access to digital solutions for the Blue Economy. This platform contains: 1. BlueFISH : Online Marketplace 2. BlueSEAL: Tourism Sustainability Verification 3. BlueTRACE: Ocean to Plate Story 4. BlueDATA: Data driven decision making.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In 2020, the UNDP Accelerator Lab for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean conducted many stakeholder sessions  as a means of sensing, identifying and analyzing challenges, opportunities and alternative solutions in the Blue Economy. Through this work, one key trend emerged: COVID-19 acted as a catalyst for change among MSMEs, with many stakeholders in the informal sector including small-scale fisherfolk turning to digital tools and solutions such as WhatsApp to support their business practices. As such, the Accelerator Lab narrowed in on a proposed portfolio of mini, interconnected experiments focused on the digital transformation of MSMEs to bolster this weak signal in the interest of increased diversification of skills and opportunities. This was further supported by the UNDP Barbados and Eastern Caribbean Multi-Country Office’s (MCO) Economic Transformation pillar of the COVID – 19 Response Programme 1.0, as well as the COVID-19 2.0 programme on FUT - TOURISM, both of which emphasize digital transformation as one pathway towards resilience. In addition, this portfolio of a digital solutions toolkit is in direct response to unearthed needs, trends and inputs gathered at the grassroots, policy, and private sector levels.  The range of opportunities and increasing potential of the Blue Economy as an approach to diversify the Eastern Caribbean economy while creating jobs, improving livelihoods, and promoting environmental sustainability is at the core of the UNDP “Blue Economy for Green Islands” approach. Through this system lens of integrated development methods, the Lab is also contributing to the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) offer, which is rooted in climate action, the Blue Economy, and digital transformation. At a  global level, this concept aligns with UNDP’s digital strategy to harness potential for development based on digitization and digitalization approaches.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The value add our Accelerator Lab brings to solving this challenge is primarily rooted in applying an innovation learning based approach to development that will allow us to test and pilot new, disruptive concepts and technologies such as traceability, digitalization and the gathering of novel data sources while integrating cultural and historical traditions. Additionally, as our Accelerator Lab has consistently focused on the Blue Economy from the time of its formation, we possess knowledge, capacities and skills in the exploratory sectoral categories of fisheries , waste management and sustainable tourism. The creation of digital transformation toolkits and dashboard focussed on the Blue Economy is a unique value proposition brought by the Accelerator Lab in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean in order to solve many of the challenges faced.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can digital tools and solutions (digital toolkit) support the recovery and resilience of Blue Economy MSMEs in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-Creation: BlueDIGITAL will be co-created and co - designed with a diversity of stakeholders and partners so that it is informed by challenges at a community level and designed with stakeholders to solve for these challenges. This will make use of collective intelligence exercises to gather data on key gaps, needs and trends within the sectors.  Through the use of a portfolio of experiments and pilots, behavoural insights will be used to inform further builds of BlueDIGITAL into a Minimum Viable Product mobile application and web - based platform. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Data gaps: One of the key data gaps that we hope these new sources of data will address is the lack of data in key Blue Economy sectors such as fisheries catch and landings data including location. We are filling the gap of digitalized data accessible to government on sustainable seafood and fish with specific focus on seasonality and species.  In addition, in an effort to create a simple traceability and transparency system to better tell the story of the journey of fish from Ocean to Plate, we hope that the value added will include improving fisherfolk sales as well as both digital and business literacy, as well as enhanced access of fisherfolk direct to market through the participating tourism industry partners. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Fisherfolk within the informal sector of the Blue Economy as well as tourism industry partners (hotels, restaurants) may benefit from this work. In addition, it is hoped that the fisherfolk community led by the umbrella organization could become champions and co - owners of these digital solutions in collaboration with Government (Fisheries Division) and the private sector in the tourism sphere.
