The Government of Kenya has committed to reach universal health coverage (UHC) by 2022. In 2020, according to the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF), (the largest medical insurance scheme in Kenya mandated and operated by the government) - the fund had 9.6 million principal members. Currently, 3.6 million members from the informal sector are voluntarily insured. However, out of the 3.6 million, only 1.9 million are active members, meaning that they have paid their contributions in the last 12 months; a negligible coverage in a context where up to 84 per cent of the Kenyan workforce is active in the informal sector. Worth noting is that only about 504,000 members out of the 1.9 million are up to date, that is, can use their medical card in NHIF accredited facilities. In recent years, NHIF has reviewed its portfolio of activities to expand its services and coverage to workers in the informal economy. Despite having developed a strategic plan for NHIF expansion for 2018-2022, NHIF continues to encounter challenges regarding coverage of the population. Under the UHC dispensation, NHIF is expected to provide health insurance coverage to all Kenyans. The funds are expected to be drawn from informal sector contributions among other sources such as statutory contributions and national and county government sponsorship.   A few months into the COVID-19 pandemic, amidst the dusk to dawn curfew and social distancing measures, the UNDP Accelerator Lab engaged female small-scale traders selling fresh vegetables in Mukuru, one of Nairobi’s largest informal settlements to assess the impact of COVID-19 on their trade, learn about their routines and understand the wider context of their activities in order to shed light on the pressure points that policy and programmatic interventions may help to solve. A lack of social protection was of concern among the small-scale traders. This gave the Accelerator Lab a sense of where we needed to focus our attention taking into consideration the role of social protection in tackling poverty. The pandemic has been devastating for many engaged in the formal sector, yet doubly worse for those in informal work. While those in ‘formal’ employment may receive unemployment insurance and enjoy other forms of protection when faced with income losses, others in the informal economy are hard hit. Regarding social protection coverage, the informal workers, mostly women and youth, constitute the ‘missing middle’. They do not qualify for social assistance not being poor enough; yet, their incomes might be too low or too irregular to take advantage of social insurance schemes. As observed during the COVID-19 crisis, this constitutes a serious impediment to workers’ and their families’ well-being and leaves them ill-prepared to withhold a variety of risks, including shocks at the household level (for example, illness in a family). This necessitated the need to find innovative solutions to ensure social protection outside of the traditional labor markets.   Despite the Millennium Development Goals, Sustainable Development Goals and numerous international agreements enshrining a right to social protection, appropriate social protection remains in many countries an exclusive legal privilege for individuals in the formal sector. And this in places where the majority of workers are in informal and agricultural employment, without any real chance of formalization. Social protection policies are an important part of this wider strategy to tackle poverty and the ‘leave no-one behind’ agenda. A coordinated package of social assistance, social insurance, labor market and care programmes prevent individuals and their families from falling into or further into poverty, promote access to basic services, contribute to economic growth by raising labor productivity and can strengthen social relations. COVID-19 has further highlighted the importance of social health protection for all, considering that infectious diseases do not discriminate and affect the entire population.

According to the NHIF, only 17.6 percent of Kenyans are covered by NHIF while 79,8 percent of citizens do not have an insurance policy. The Government of Kenya has committed to reach universal health coverage (UHC) by 2022. In 2020, according to the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF), the fund had 9.6 million principal members. Currently, 3.6 million members from the informal sector are voluntarily insured. However, out of the 3.6 million, only 1.9 million are active members, meaning that they have paid their contributions in the last 12 months; a negligible coverage in a context where up to 84 per cent of the Kenyan workforce is active in the informal sector.

Quarantines, social distancing measures, restriction of movement and closures of business and economic activity occasioned by the pandemic have disproportionately affected those individuals and families who derive their livelihood from informal activities, in particular women who depend in a greater proportion from it. Last year, the Lab had a chance to engage with  female small scale traders plying their fresh vegetable trade in Mukuru, one of Nairobi’s largest informal settlement to assess the impact of COVID-19 on their trade and learn about their routines, workarounds and understand the wider context (social, cultural, economic, physical environment) of their activities. We discovered an entry point that could potentially solidify socio-economic recovery by putting in place new types of social insurance targeted to the informal sector as too many people in the informal sector lack social protection, the savings or credit to weather an economic downturn. A case in point is Concepta who was struggling to pay her husband’s medical bills while also taking care of the family. “When my husband got sick, we could not afford to take our daughter to a tertiary institution after clearing her secondary education. Since my husband is still recuperating and cannot work, it is my business that is taking care of our household’s basic needs.” With no medical insurance, the medical operation exhausted the family’s meagre savings. Concepta was forced to prioritize payment of the medical bills over higher education for her daughter.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Inclusive short-and long-term social insurance programs, such as health insurance schemes, unemployment insurance savings accounts and long-term savings accounts for pensions are critical instruments to safeguarding communities, especially during crises. By experientially building on innovative approaches to increase enrollment and participation in flexible health insurance schemes, tailored to the needs of informal sector workers, the Lab will contribute to a systemic process that will pave the way for low income informal workers to preserve livelihoods and build resilience against future shocks. Extending social protection to informal economy workers requires a new way of thinking and programming  that cures the chronic under - investment from the perspective of both government policy and on research. The programming will require generation of knowledge, tools, innovations and trial and error tests to identify the right policies, models and practices to meet social protection goals for the informal economy in Africa. Technology and innovation (including social innovation and the upscaling of home-grown solutions) can offer shortcuts and affordable solutions and allow local communities to co-design them. The Lab offers a unique opportunity to experiment, explore and apply home-grown solutions in this regard. As part of our mission, the Lab will produce real-time data on the needs, concerns and innovations stemming from the informal economy. Social protection models for informal economy identified can then be tested, learned from and scaled-up if successful at the Lab, in synergy with national social protection systems. With dwindling sales, loss of businesses, COVID-19 has exacerbated the vulnerability of informal sector workers as they do not have the economic security to take sick leave, get treated if required, or cope with lockdown. Additionally, the proliferation of new business models, such as the platform and gig economy with non-standard employment relationships, also tend to reduce benefits and protection for workers. This has created the risk of growing informality, which underscores the need to redefine social protection sys­tems to guarantee universal coverage of the basic elements associated to decent work. The ILO articulates the need to recognize employment and social protection as mutually reinforcing in shaping people’s lives and a country’s advancement. Both set the foundation for the concept and ambition of realizing decent work.
