[[ai_summary:Mohammed Hanana, Head of Experimentation for Syria, discussed an R&D activity called Rift App, which aimed to support rural entrepreneurs and communities. The project provided seed funds, technical, and business mentoring, but faced challenges in reaching rural youth due to lack of digital literacy and awareness. To address this, the team developed a website with no deadline, used human-centered design, social media, local entrepreneurs, and visualizations. The outcome was over 1,000 applications and training of 300 participants, with 20 still working on their projects. The project's work impacted sustainable development primarily under SDG #8, economic growth and decent work, establishing around 20 new startups and marketing their success stories.]]

# Syria Launches Experiment to Support Rural Entrepreneurs

### [[0:00]] So tell me your name, title and please say I consent to this recording\.

My name is Mohammed Hanana\. I am the Head of Experimentation for Syria and I consent for this meeting, for this interview\.

### [[0:15]] Perfect\. OK, over to you for some R&D questions\.

### [[0:18]] All right\. All right, all right\. So could you tell me about an R&D activity that you would like to share with us today? Of course, this is before being joining the lab\.

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:Working with ecosystems]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Beyond borders]]
I actually tried started experimenting for the joining the lab when I was with the program\. And because I've been only with like a three month illy lab in the lab, I didn't have a complete experiment before joining the lab\. I work in an experiment called Rift App, which is reef from the countryside and up from start\-ups, which is like its main aim is to support rural entrepreneurs and rural communities\. We provided seed funds, we provided technical and business mentoring and monitoring and evaluation for around all for around one year\. This, this project was mainly, we noticed that there's a lot of disengagement from the rural communities with businesses and especially entrepreneurship ecosystem\. And we also noticed based on observation, a lot of data gathered, gathered from UNDP and other UN agencies that most of the youth, especially living in the countryside, they don't have an ownership for their country, for their villages or where they are living and they only striving to migrate to cities\. And we felt that we needed to change that\. So we started with a little bit of research why under youth entrepreneur youth and in the rural areas are not applying for, let's say, entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial competitions and other accelerators and incubator projects that UNDP and other UN agencies are having\. And we noticed that they are not hearing and they didn't hear about them until the applications are closed\. I'm speaking a lot of things at the very first questions\. I'm going to continue, OK\. And also we, they didn't have the digital literacy to apply and some of the competitions and projects the you need to travel to cities to apply and the you, you and the rural communities couldn't afford to travel to city just to, to do an application\. Therefore we started this experiment\. We started with the website\. I know we are speaking about digital literacy, but we used other options other than the website\. But this was the domain and we didn't put a deadline for it\. You can apply with the expenditure was for one year and you can apply whenever you want just to have a, just to have a valid business idea or entrepreneur idea\.

### [[3:13]] And who were the kind of stakeholders involved in this, in this R&D journey? And can you speak about their role?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
Yes, of course\. We have the UNDP climate adaptation staff, the project staff, which is the project managers and two project coordinators\. We also coordinate with the UNDP comms communication teams and the communication associate was working with us all the time\. Also, we needed a third party, 22 third party companies, one to do the website development and the second one for the monitoring and evaluation and then the data analysis\. And of course, and the most important is the field or the field offices which were our, let's say the front office of the project because they were dealing in immediately in a direct contact with the beneficiaries and the youth, rural youth\.

### [[4:07]] That's great\. Can you speak about maybe some of the tools or methods that you're used first?Why did you, I'm sorry, why did you pick those specific ones?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
First of all, we used website, We develop our website for certain reason, because we need of course to beginning to raise the awareness about the digital literacy and because we provided a no deadline for the application, People of rural communities will have the time on how to enter website and how to apply for for an application on a website\.That's the main reason we choose a website\. And because a lot of rural youth are available and want to apply, a website is a good way to attract them\. This is for the website also\. Other tools and method\. We use a human centred design as a method\. We try to study how rural communities apply let's say for a project for UNDP and why like I told you before, they didn't apply for\. We try to start to study all the process and how to engage them and where are the bottlenecks that happened before and how to avoid them in this experiment\. Other things we tried to use social media pages, we tried to work with the local entrepreneurs as a tool, our MSR, let's say our channel and we tried to build some videos to build some awareness and build some visibility for the project\. And we use visualisation for the website, a good web will and well designed website\. And we use very good marketing materials, for example, not only for social media but also we try to put some posters on rural, let's say buildings, not buildings like governmental buildings and other\. And we have UNTP youth centres at the rural areas\. We try try to put some flip charts and and some posters\. And we try to use other UN agencies too\.

### [[6:20]] Good, thank you\. Were there any specific principles that guided your work?

[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:Design]]
I can say, first of all, transparency, that's one of the main principles we use\. We tried to build a very clear selection criteria because rural people are tend to speak about he got it and I didn't why? Why he got accepted and why why me didn't accept it\. Therefore we built a very clear selection criteria and we posted on our website, on our social media channels and we put a clear description of of each condition and how to achieve it\. We have 4 main selection criteria to achieve and we in each one of them we have 5 conditions you need to meet to get the seat funding and the technical mentoring\. And for business mentoring team, this is the first we try to be so inclusive\. So the second principles inclusivity\. We try to have a gender balance between the applicants\. We try to target not only to target male females also because people males in rural areas tend to be more like initiated than females and females tend to be more shy than males\. And also we try to include also the youth and also people with disabilities\. These are 4 principles\. It's transparency and inclusivity\.

### [[7:46]] And I believe this these are great\. What would you say was the outcome of your of your journey?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Focusing on the value added]]
I believe for the Climate Adaptation project, this was the most successful experiment we had\. We reached around more than 1000 application on the website and also we trained because we have like very small trainings and videos we uploaded on the most side on how to fill an application, how to write a business plan\. We trained around 300, finished the trainings and we seed funded around 30\. And right now we have until now last month we checked 20 of them are still working on really functioning\.

### [[8:30]] That's great\. And how would you say your work impacted sustainable development?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
First of all, we most of our work was on SDG \#8 which is like economic growth and and decent work\. That's what we are main work happened and we work also on no poverty and 0 hunger, but the main aim and the main impact habit for the livelihoods which is like related more to SDG 8:00 because of this project like you are establishing an on a national level around 20 new startup that are really functioning\. And we also established maybe for the 17th a partnership for the partnership goal because right now we are trying to marketise their work through success stories and we let their contact info available for the, for anyone who wants to contact for their services and products to be, to be able to contact them, right\.

### [[9:31]] And if there were maybe one or two things that you would do differently if you had to start all over again, what would they be?

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Allies and champions]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Deep listening to map beyond the intangible]]
That's a tough question\. For one thing I would do differently\. I will try to coordinate with the local influencers in rural areas, which we call them in Syria\. Al Mukhtar or a famous farmer who other rural community would listen to\. They have very good influence on them and they would listen\. If they ask them to learn something or do something, they would listen\. Therefore, next time I will surely contact them and put them as stakeholders and important stakeholder for the project\. That's one thing\. Other thing I will try to have like more on more on site training and more engaging for other UN agencies because if you want to scale up this experiment to be a national project, I believe we will need a lot of resources\.

### [[10:34]] All right\. And in terms of diffusion and catalyzation, like what were some strategies or approaches that you employed to facilitate this, this diffusion or the scaling if you want?

[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Actually, we only depends on the social media and the reports\. We tried to build all the all the time success stories about the youth entrepreneurs who got seeded funded\. And we tried to emphasize and engage other like motivate other people who may, who may be interested not as a beneficiaries only, but also as a partner for us to be in the project\. And we tried to get a buy in for the for the scaling up from the senior management\. And we made a very good report about the impact of the project\. We made finally a workshop, a closing folks workshop for this experiment\. And we tried to invite as much as possible for people whom who will may be interested to be a partner or like to have to scaling up or to replicate the project in their agency or NGOs\.

### [[11:42]] All right\. Well, I think that's about it\. Thank you very much for your time\.

Thank you so much, Android\.
