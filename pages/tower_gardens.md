small intensive vegetable production systems that can be grown ‘on your doorstep’. Fundamentally, they involve a vertical, usually cylindrical, structure (constructed, for example, of rocks, wire or shadecloth) into which a growing medium is placed. The centre of the tower has a tubular cavity lined with a filter material into which grey water or potable water can be poured that will slowly infiltrate into the substrate providing a steady supply of water and nutrients for the vegetables. Vegetables are grown at the top of the tower garden as well as on the vertical sides to maximise the planting area and productivity of the system.
