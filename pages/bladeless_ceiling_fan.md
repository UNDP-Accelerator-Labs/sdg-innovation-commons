> Description of the solution

Bladeless ceiling fan uses less energy and the an ultraviolet light kills micro-organisms thorugh a LED lamp in the centre of the fan which provides light in different temperatures of white. Researchers at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) have developed a ceiling fan capable of cooling a small room at twice the speed of a conventional fan, about 100 cubic meters per minute whilst using just over half the enery. The fan creates a controlled vortex by mimicking the motion of a natural tornado, generating a breeze that you can never feel with a traditional ceiling fan. It is eco-friendly, efficient, quiet, and safe.
