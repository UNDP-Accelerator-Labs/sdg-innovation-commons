Description: It is a plastic container filled with sand and gravel, into which water is poured periodically. The biolayer of microorganisms that is created on the surface of the sand filters and removes pathogens from the water, which flows by hydrostatic pressure or siphon to a container of clean water. Sand and gravel are sourced locally.

Interesting features: It is one of the few technified bio sand filters for sale in the market. It also promotes community activation, as some materials must be obtained.
