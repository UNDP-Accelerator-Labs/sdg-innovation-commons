Youth for Climate Jordan is a climate youth movement that seeks to limit the consequences of the climate and biodiversity crisis by uniting as a movement and exerting political pressure while raising awareness in society.

For this, we believe that an immediate system change is absolutely necessary! Therefore, we protest, mobilize youth and organize ourselves as activists. As a movement, we believe that it is highly important to share the same values in order to reach these goals. To limit global warming properly and create a system change, we believe that a better world for everyone should be created, in which these values are incorporated.
