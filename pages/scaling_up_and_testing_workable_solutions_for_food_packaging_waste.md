## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Scaling up and testing workable solutions for food packaging waste
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that household waste has been increasing since the start of the pandemic due to the growing number of home deliveries especially plastic packaging for food and drinks.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

To slow the spread of COVID-19 in the population, the Lao government declared the first national lockdown from late March to early May 2020. During that time, the Accelerator Lab observed an increase in food delivery orders and household waste. In barely three weeks, the popularity of food distribution sky-rocketed. The main food delivery companies in Laos, Go Teddy and Food Panda, reported that the number of online orders increased from 100-200 to 1,200-2,000 a day in less than two months. Moreover, the number of local restaurants and small shops registered on both platforms also increased by three folds, from 50 in January 2020 to 150 in May 2020. The jump in the amount of plastic waste from food delivery packages surely worsened the waste situation. Similar trends were also observed in other ASEAN countries like Singapore and Thailand.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

We get data from the food delivery companies and restaurants on the platforms.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

We spotted social media posts complaining about foam and plastic packaging which concern the health of consumers. There is also a signal that people burn a lot of household waste and food packaging could be of a substantial amount which need to be further explored.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We have been working on waste management issue since September 2019. Open burning study applying Collective Intelligence was part of the learning cycle to understand the issue. In 2020 and 2021, the Lab conducted several experiments through Youth Innovation Challenge on Waste Management, refill station with Unilever, plastic free meeting and eco packaging with a private sector. However, the experimentation with the local food delivery saw the use of new type of data from mobile phones and user experience journey which help us to learn a lot and there are potential to scale the initiative with more partners. In the second phase, the experiment aims to target Food Panda and larger stakeholders to secure partnership and co-financing as well. This is the first step to mobilize resource from private sector which has not been done much at the country office. The ultimate goal is to send the messages to the policy makers to reduce tax on eco-friendly packages or promote the production of such products in the country. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP together with its partners and affiliate businesses aim to reduce plastic waste by introducing the eco-friendly packaging options to more consumers or users. Policy makers, environment practitioners, suppliers and startup will be involved in the upcoming experimental project

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Will plastic be replaced with eco-friendly packaging if the alternatives could be reasonably accessible and there is high customer demand?  Will this be sufficient to influence tax policy on eco-friend products?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Social network analysis and BI will help us understand the issue and behaviors of consumers. Hackathon will help us seek solutions or best alternatives. System thinking and co-creation will help us see the issue in a systemic way and co-design the interventions with the most critical stakeholders as well as the beneficiaries. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Cost of production, CO2 level from production and transportation
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The current actors on Solid Waste Management including the government bodies, GGGI, World Bank, Zero Waste Laos and Green Vientiane could be partners to collaborate for a large impact.
