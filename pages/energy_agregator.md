Here is an energy agregator prepered to face the lack of  constancy and weakness in electricity production. the producer is currently using it to consolidate three lines of national electricity production in input and recover from output the requiered Voltage. the good part of this is that the solution can be calibrate to work with any electronic device in the range of 110 to 300 V.
