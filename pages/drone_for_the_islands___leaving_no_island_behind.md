## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

 Drone for Islands : Leaving no Island Behind 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that: How the introduction of drone on the islands can change the face of one our big challenges: the severe droughts  that are often felt in the archipelago, and which have an impact on ecosystems.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

 One of the major challenges has to do with the severe droughts that are often felt in the archipelago, and which have an impact on ecosystems. The desertification issues in the Cape Verde Islands over the past decades has proven to be a very serious problem that affects the entire archipelago. Among the concrete challenges of the country, however, there is the issue of the survival of the populations, that is, the socio-economic problem: that also has a impact on ecosystem with large amount of people extracts inert in places that are not suitable, such as beaches; the hunting and consumption of turtles or any part of turtles . Another example is the vulnerability to ocean pollution with plastic. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

A few years ago, an "environmental crime" happened in Ilheu Raso.  Thousands of cagarras, an endemic bird in Cape Verde protected by international agreements, were being killed. And the cagarra population began to decline dangerously.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This high tech work is not currently being explored in the Cape Verde islands, mainly due to lack of funds and resources. There no current competitors that provide these types of services to communities and people.  Is quite revolutionary in using different drones to improve agriculture, reforestation but also for environmental protection and mapping,  monitoring vast areas as well for agriculture and reforestation.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

In regard to agriculture and reforestation , Cape Verde is significantly affected with dry climates and limited farmers;  the largest populations of wild, endemic, indigenous and naturalized species of flora and fauna are concentrated in potential protected areas throughout the archipelago. Some of these areas constitute the specific habitats of plant and animal species of relevant socio-economic importance and seriously threatened with extinction.
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The training action in piloting and maintenance of drones will take place in the framework of a partnership between Ministry of Agriculture and Environment and the Accelerator Labs of UNDP- Cape Verde, the MAA will have the advantage that the drones will be adapted with necessary accessories to ensure the implementation of the monitoring plans and training costs as previously mentioned will be supported by the ACCELERATOR Labs of UNDP- Cape Verde.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

There is a need to minimize the impact and effects of global warming and deforestation on the agriculture and the ecosystem (What the revolutionary way to counteract and minimize the impact)… Who is most affected by the impact of dry climate and deforestation on the Ecosystem? Which technologies have the greatest impact on environmental protection?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It’s extremely useful in tackling complex problems that are ill-defined or unknown, by understanding the human needs involved, by re-framing the problem in human-centric ways, by creating many ideas in training sessions, and by adopting a hands-on approach in prototyping and testing.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

They will collect the real situation on the agriculture and deforestation in Cabo Verde, and the real situation of the endangered species in protected areas. 
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can the drone for islands training have a  improve on the deforestation? How the learnings from the training can be put in service of protected areas and endangered species? How long will it take for the use of the drone by technicians of MAA to have a real impact on the ecosystem?

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The technicians of MAA will direct benefit for this challenge and indirectly the agriculture, reforestation and environment ecosystem. The champion is the MAA (Ministry of Agriculture and Environment).
