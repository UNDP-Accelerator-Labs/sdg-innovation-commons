Financial exclusion / lack of access to credit facilities: Most potential entrepreneurs, especially in rural areas are unemployed, financially dependent on other people, have no credit history in the country, or are unbanked, and they reside in becoming financially excluded due to their social status. With the COVID-19 pandemic at play, exchanging frequently touched items, including notes and coins could transmit the virus as well. Inconvenience: People have to leave their comfort zones in order to deposit or withdraw cash to make purchases. Others are very busy to do so, thus limiting the amount of time on spending, in which the government needs for economic growth. 


ePayNet is a technological innovation that aims at: - Empowering woman entrepreneurs by helping them get access to quick or instant loans in order for them to start and operate their own businesses. - Reducing the spread of COVID-19 through the use of FINTECH, limiting the number of people travelling to the most congested areas to deposit or get cash, and to avoid the exchange of notes and coins from one hand to another. - Bringing great convenience to all ePayNet clients. Enabling clients to make transactions at the comfort of their spaces at reasonable charges. In partnership with MTN, Digimage Investments developed a FINTECH driven solution towards financial inclusion. The initiative enhances client experience through an electronic platform to process payments through mobile money or bank cards. It offers interoperability between banks and mobile money for people to transfer funds between the two at the comfort of their spaces. The initiative links clients (including woman entrepreneurs in rural areas, who cannot move around in search of funds due to increased costs and the COVID-19 pandemic) to their SACCOS, stokvels and micro lenders, so they can borrow, repay and save via the platform. Clients also make donations, give offerings, pay school fees, pay to companies and utility bills. The product relies on excessive training of staff (both Digimage and MTN) and clients on how to use product, and robust marketing.
