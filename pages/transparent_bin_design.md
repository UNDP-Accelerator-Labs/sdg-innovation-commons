When we started our solution mapping excercise in Da Nang, we found that both of the piloting wards (Hai Chau 1 and Hoa Cuong Nam) had plastic bottle collection cages at the ward centers. These were supposedly for incoming guests to throw their plastic bottle/trash and also served as models for plastic waste sorting behaviors. However, it seemed that not much plastic was being thrown inside.

AccLab Viet Nam then designed a similar bin to test in local area
