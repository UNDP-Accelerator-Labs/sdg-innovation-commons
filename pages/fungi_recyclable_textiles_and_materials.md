Radial Biomateriales uses fungal biotech to transforms agricultural waste into carbon neutral materials that include uses in packaging, textiles and others; replacing styrofoam, MDF, and animal or plastic leather.

With this technology, the materials they develop may have different characteristics ranging from impact resistance, low density, insulation, high flexibility and even fireproof, all this with the significant difference that are materials grown in laboratories and 100% compostable.
