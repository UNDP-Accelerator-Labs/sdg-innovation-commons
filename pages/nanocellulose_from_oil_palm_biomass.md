The nanocellulose is made from oil palm biomass waste. Nanocellulose is a versatile material and has special characteristics such as high mechanical strength, high specific surface area, renewable and biodegradable. It can be used in various industrial product development. For example, industrial plastic packaging, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, vehicle building material, paper processing and paint. 
The nanocellulose that is made from oil palm biomass has characteristics that are comparable to nanocellulose made from wood in developed countries such as the USA and Canada.
