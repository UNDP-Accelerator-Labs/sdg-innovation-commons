## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Community-led urban public spaces transformation experiment aka "My street, my imagination"
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is in devising a process and tools that could support the inclusive transformation of public spaces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The idea is to help local governments organize interactive public consultations (both onsite and online) so that crowdsourced citizens’ ideas about the renewal and regeneration of public spaces (such as streets, neighbourhoods, parks, squares, decayed sites, etc.) drive the urban planning and development.  We want to contribute to inclusive and sustainable urban transformation in Bosnia and Herzegovina by catalysing urban action, enhancing urban inclusive innovation and implementing a portfolio of small-scale interventions within selected urban zones.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Capitalising on the previous UNDP Country office pilot work in the area of future cities, as well as on low-carbon and sustainable urban development, the Accelerator Lab is supporting a pilot place-based sustainable urban transformation inspired by the theory of the “Urban Rooms of Sarajevo” research, which offers a set of recommendations that help re-imagine urban spaces and transform them from urban voids into people-centred, lively and sustainable urban rooms of Sarajevo, as well as by new global urban planning approaches like the “1-minute city” or the “3 – 30 – 300 urban forestry rule”. Urban transformation is implemented through innovative participatory methods within selected five zones with our institutional partner, the Municipality of Centar - Sarajevo and in partnership with the University of Sarajevo – Faculty of Architecture, and the City of Sarajevo.  In a way, we want to hack the current culture of urban planning and design without the users (citizens) and give them the voice that professionals in urban design will take into account in their work. The experiment we implement supports online and on-site interactive crowdsourcing of citizens’ ideas on renewal and green transformation of several urban “voids” in the Municipality of Centar, Sarajevo. All inputs gathered from residents and businesses through the digital platform developed (https://centar.urbanlab.ba/) and the face-to-face events in the target locations are the basis for people-led planning of interventions for urban green transformation.

Citizens' forums organized in local communities have a light turnout, and the question of urban planning and design is considered a topic for discussion for professionals only. Public spaces are (re)designed through public procurement open competition for conceptual designs modality where citizens are not invited either to provide their preferences or to participate in selecting the best solution.  This experiment is ongoing. Our first interactive digital survey presenting development options for one urban location redesign sparked an interest. The survey, very specific in its structure and content, was delivered through a custom made digital urban transformation platform developed for the municipality of Centar, Sarajevo (centar.urbanlab.ba). Google Analytics shows that out of some 3100 visitors to the platform in the period when citizens were invited to provide their preferences on development options of the site, out of which 2200 came from Sarajevo, 405 registered and submitted their answers to the 13-questions survey. The high conversion rate indicates the genuine interest of the local community to have a say in the future design of urban spaces. The workshop organized on-site and utilizing the same participatory design method was not so well attended.

The site location where we did our first piloting of participative urban public space transformation is a matter of dispute between an informal group of citizens living and working nearby site location and municipal authorities. The municipality of Centar Sarajevo was eager to partner with UNDP, the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Sarajevo and the city administration (the city of Sarajevo is comprised of 4 municipalities). This informal group of citizens gather 4.600+ members on their Facebook group, which indicated a need to use digital tools to collect citizens' voices.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We enable collective and structured citizens' feedback and suggestions for the renewal or development of public urban spaces. Based on the citizens' ideas and suggestions, professionals develop digital scenarios for public spaces' (re)designs (through a typical call for conceptual designs development). Finally, public voting enables citizens to voice their opinion on the best solution among awarded conceptual designs. Conceptual designs are presented using 360-degrees images, a video renders and virtual reality (VR) walkthroughs.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Urban transformation digital platform enables translation of citizens’ ideas and suggestions into renewed and vibrant public spaces, ensuring a community-driven approach to urban development in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we position citizens' participation at the core of urban regeneration policy?  What is the best modality and process to establish a dialogue between decision-makers and the local community as a pre-requisite for sustainable urban development?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The experiment is all about participatory design based on crowdsourcing of citizens' preferences and public voting over visually presented development options.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Citizens' knowledge about the public spaces in their neighbourhoods are the key for their design and revitalization.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We aim to make this approach a new normal in urban planning and design with the urban transformation platform at its core. This platform is developed as a multi-tenant solution. The main site (https://www.urbanlab.ba/en/contests?page=1&rows=9) serves as a repository of all public calls/contests for conceptual design in the country. Individual tenants, such as Centar municipality site (https://centar.urbanlab.ba/), serve municipal urban planning departments to collect citizens' ideas and suggestions informing the public call/contest and afterward collectively selecting one of the awarded solutions.
