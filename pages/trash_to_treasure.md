## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Trash to Treasure: Data-Driven Solutions for a Sustainable La Paz

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

23/07/2024

> What action learning plan is this activity related to?

The "Innovation in the Characterization of Solid Waste" project is related to an action learning plan focused on environmental management and waste characterization. The plan aims to improve waste collection, segregation, and disposal processes in La Paz using advanced data analysis and geospatial tools. The project involves collaboration between Green Datum, the Municipal Government of La Paz, and PNUD, with the goal of optimizing urban waste management practices and increasing citizen participation in sustainability initiatives​

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The activity aims to understand how advanced waste characterization can improve solid waste management in La Paz, focusing on data-driven solutions for optimizing collection, segregation, and disposal. The goal is to enhance urban waste practices while involving citizens in sustainability efforts.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is important because it helps the municipality make informed decisions, leading to more sustainable urban environments, reducing waste-related emissions, and promoting a circular economy through improved resource management​

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF advanced waste characterization techniques are applied, THEN they will improve the efficiency of waste collection, segregation, and disposal, leading to more sustainable urban waste management and greater citizen participation in environmental initiatives.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions to Test the Hypothesis:
Data Collection and Analysis:

Use geospatial tools and waste characterization techniques to analyze solid waste in La Paz, focusing on composition, quantity, and segregation practices.
Collaboration:

Work with Green Datum, the Municipal Government of La Paz, and PNUD to develop data-driven strategies for waste management.
Timeline and Location:

Conduct the experiment in various districts of La Paz over a specified period to gather comprehensive data on urban waste patterns.
Engage Citizens:

Involve the public in waste reduction efforts through awareness campaigns and participation in segregation practices

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The original hypothesis—if advanced waste characterization techniques are applied, then waste management efficiency will improve—was proven. The analysis of solid waste in La Paz led to more efficient collection, segregation, and disposal, and the results showed enhanced urban waste management practices. Additionally, the project demonstrated increased citizen engagement through public participation in sustainability initiatives, supporting the hypothesis that data-driven approaches contribute to a more sustainable urban environment
