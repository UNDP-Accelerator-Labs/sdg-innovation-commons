## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Key words: Vaccines, information, trust, safety, tool. On our collaborative project with Bunge y Born Foundation:  In Argentina, getting vaccinated is a deep-rooted habit to prevent diseases, with the mothers as decision makers. Doctors and health care staff in vaccination centers are the main source of information on dates of immunization campaigns, what disease each vaccine prevents, what to do if a vaccine has side effects in the short term, and how to monitor the progress of the Immunization Schedule.  While in Argentina there’s not a history of anti-vaccination sentiment, there has been a surge in hesitancy around the (at the time of the interviews, possible) Covid-19 vaccine. The source of this hesitancy is rooted in misinformation, lack of knowledge about how vaccines work and the feeling that the vaccine would not be properly tested for safety. Distrust about the effects of a COVID-19 vaccine does not extend to other vaccines.  People get negative information about vaccines through acquaintances when they are suspicious of their effectiveness or afraid of their possible immediate side effects, such is the case with the flu vaccine or a (then potential) COVID-19 vaccine. Famous and showbiz people, and comments on social media are other sources of negative information about vaccines.   The main factors that ease vaccination is being near the health or vaccination center and free vaccines. For young people, being supported and followed up by family members stand out as easy. Adverse weather conditions on the vaccination day, having to go early to request an appointment and the lack of supplies were mentioned as possible complications.  On our collaborative project with Chequeado and Healthy Internet Project  -       One of our key lessons after the implementation of the Healthy Internet Project in Argentina was the importance of choosing an appropriate tool, that is designed considering the Internet browsing habits of the target population – the tool designed was a web browser extension, which was simple to install and to use, but was not available for download in smartphones, that carry a significant portion of the population’s Internet browsing. Another limitation for the extension was the fact that, to protect the privacy of its’ user, their identities were never identified, which hindered the extension’s ability to communicate with the participants, foster community building, provide feedback and give motivation to keep using the tool.

 We will soon be publishing a report alongside a blog post on our findings regarding our work with Bunge and Born Foundation on vaccines, acceess and misinformation. We link an older blog post on our alliance and objectives.  https://bit.ly/3J0kqCZ

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Regarding the Healthy Internet Project, we encountered difficulties in finding a tool that would foster interaction with users while protecting their privacy.  Regarding our line of work with Bunge and Born Foundation, we had to adapt our methodology for the implementation of focus groups due to the Covid-19 pandemic effects on public circulation and gatherings.

## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Vaccines, access and Misinformation 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that Misinformation spread rapidly undermining good practices of self care and the confidence in reliable sources of information and also in public institutions. In particular, mistrust in vaccines (fostered by misinformation) and problems in the access to vaccinations centers from  low income people discourage people to vaccinate 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

There is significant skepticism regarding vaccines among certain segments of the population. For instance, 12% of people without primary education believe vaccines are not effective. This figure is only 4% of those with incomplete tertiary studies. According to the Vaccines confidence and Access index of the Bunge y Born Foundation, mistrust is more generalized within this segment of the population. In sum, we see that the long-lasting inequalities that hamper the access to vaccines due to barriers such as distance or lack of time to go to health facilities are now met by a new trend of emerging mistrust in vaccines.

The only sustainable solution to the COVID-19 crisis is the identification and roll-out of an effective vaccine keeping in mind that the low-income segment of the population is both more vulnerable to COVID-19 and also has more uneven access to health facilities.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Through two qualitative studies and a large survey experiment in partnership with the Bunge y Born Foundation, we aimed to have a better understanding of the Argentine misinformation scenario regarding vaccines and also how it coexists with other barriers to vaccines. The qualitative study complemented the information the Foundation already produced, as  the foundation is responsible for the Argentine chapter of the Vaccines confidence and Access index. They also monitor public discourse on immunization by mapping these issues on social media.  With the results of our qualitative study together with the Foundation, we conducted a survey experiment to test messages effective at countervailing misleading information on immunization. The work complemented the UNDP country office on-going efforts on the health area and the rapid response for the recovery of the crisis of the COVID-19. An important side action was the test of the Pilot of the Healthy internet project. For this action we  allied with Ted International, Chequeado ( a leading fact checking  organization in Argentina) and also TED Rio de la Plata. We focused on building a community that recognizes and flags misinformation or hate speech. Our team acted as a moderator of the flagged content, and developed during the process a series of criteria that would be used to define what is classified as disinformation, hate speech and other relevant categories.  We analyzed the data that we gathered from the flags to see if there were relevant patterns and produced a brief report on it.  For the pilot, we focused on content related with misinformation on vaccines.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Our learning question is: If we work on positive messages that counteract misinformation on vaccines we will increase the confidence in immunization so as to foster the willingness to attend vaccines centers. Our second learning question is if we foster bottom up detection of information pollution we will rise the awareness of the citizenship and have a potential group of people willing to support fact checking actions when it's needed The first learning question originally does not attempt to be reflected in a complete learning cycle of exploration, mapping and experimentation, it does entail experimentation and a small portfolio of actions on vaccines and more generally on misinformation. Having said that, we are open to different scenarios in which this learning question can take the lab.  When working to cancel out the mistrust to secure willingness to get vaccinated we also consider limitations in the access to vaccines. In Argentina, the state provides several vaccines universally and enforces their mandatory use. However: a question arises: do people have ample access to health facilities?  Is there public transportation? Are vaccine centers open during hours that allow working parents to go? Can single mothers leave some children home to take siblings to vaccines centers?  We considered the crucial problem of access and assess limitations in all its dimensions. So in addition to understanding the long-lasting barriers to access, we aimed to identify the scope and sources of mistrust of vaccines in the low-income population, which is the most affected during COVID-19. We also aimed to identify specific contents and sources (social media, WhatsApp, acquaintances, brochures, television, etc) of misconceptions and misinformation on vaccines behind the mistrust of groups in vulnerable situations. To assess the demographics of both mistrust and its behavioral effects, seeing how both are distributed across families and young people regarding vaccination compliance (willingness to get vaccinated by young people and the intention and willingness of mothers to have children vaccinated). A related problem is how proper information is received and if people understand the messages on good practices in health care and immunization. In this regard, another goal was to amplify the influence of credible information sources on vaccines by identifying role models at the neighborhood level. And lastly, to understand and develop messages that potentially can cancel out misinformation and misconceptions behind mistrust of vaccines that can be inputs for the governments' strategies to broaden health care coverage amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Lastly, we tried to align the action on misinformation, the action along with Ted international and the test of the pilot “Healthy Internet Project”, with the UN information Centre of Argentina, particularly with the Verify initiative. We are in close contact with its director, Tamar Hann. We have presented the projects on vaccines and misinformation to the WHO, but they show no interest so far. 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Conducting in-depth interviews provided us with qualitative information that allowed us to better understand the quantitative results obtained from ICAV 2020. In addition, in alliance with the Bunge & Born Foundation, we are close to conducting focus groups with different segments of the population, in which we will test their attitudes, knowledge and predisposition regarding some messages about vaccines. Based on this analysis, we will select  the most effective messages and use them in a nationwide experiment to assess whether the existence of positive messages encourages vaccination intention in the population.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The confidence index closed a gap regarding the unknowns on this topic, while these studies gave us inputs for each goal of the action, broadly  having better understanding  of how people access vaccines and trust them.  The same happened with the Healthy Internet Pilot (whose topic was vaccines), to our best knowledge, was the only participatory initiative to detect and prevent misinformation. Particularly, we focused on vaccines to align this action with our present agenda. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

One of the main challenges of these actions is finding partners in the state learn from their outputs. We are trying to reach with initiative the Direction of Youth Sexual Health of the National Ministry of Health, also we have presented the initiative to the Secretary of Health of the Buenos Aires City. The city showed interest in the project, we had two meetings, although we have not coordinated any actions so far.
