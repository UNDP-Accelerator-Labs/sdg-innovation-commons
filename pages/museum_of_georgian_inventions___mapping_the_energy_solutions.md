## Learnings on your challenge

1. There are generations of amateur and professional inventors working on the topics related to the green affordable energy.
2. There is a high interest among the population to explore energy efficiency for daily activities.
3. There were more applicants working on energy production rather than energy consumption reduction or efficient storage.
4. Such demographic groups as - youth, woman, and elderly - are actively involved into the search for energy efficient technologies.
5. People are still skeptical about public contests, as there is a fear that their IP rights might be violated.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We decided to arrange solution safari in a form of open idea competition to crowdsource the available solutions. We believed it was less time consuming and we could reach wider audience through an intensive online and traditional media communication campaign.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

By using the crowdsourcing method and supporting it with a rigid communication campaign, we reached more than 500 000 people in Georgia, which is 1/8th of the total population and received more than 60 unic application regarding green affordable energy;
