> Title of the innovation

STUDYAFRICA

> Brief description of the innovation

StudyAfrica is a business firm intended to bring change in acquisition of higher and tertiary education. This is done by evolving from the traditional form of application through an integrated single system to a single common application system and as the name suggests, it is intended to unify the applications of all African institutions.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Revenue at StudyAfrica will be obtained by retaining 15% of the application fee from the university. When the website gets enough traffic, less known universities will be able to request placing on the home page, applications made from there will retain 20% of the application fee. 
The business targets students applying to universities, for that reason, StudyAfrica accommodates students from all levels to keep them using the app as early as possible. That results in StudyAfrica storing a students' data, from transcripts to accolades, which helps students have an online back-up for data that is usually lost.
StudyAfrica being a startup will utilize the challenge prize to purchase a server for software development purposes and grow into a self-sustaining business via engagement of stakeholders i.e. universities and students.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Currently, there is no single application system for African universities. In most cases students leaving high school always find themselves in an enigma to find the school that suits their needs,  financial aid for their tuition fees is even more challenging besides having a load of them, which results in a lot of students dropping out amid their studies. We aim to help students in this criteria but this will prove to be beneficial to both universities and students. As it will help market the universities while making the application process for students easier.
