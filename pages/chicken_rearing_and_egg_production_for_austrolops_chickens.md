Chicken rearing and egg production for austrolops chickens

> Brief description of the innovation

Black austrolops chickens are chickens that produces quite a number of eggs in a year and it's meat is yummy, how ever  keeping chickens  goes with quite a number of challenges. Challenges like feed and medicines and my location is also a challenge. The price of feed sir is high and I need to procure quite a number of bags to sustain my more 1000 chickens and if feed is not enough the egg production reduces even to zero for months and most of the chickens die of hunger so what I do when I don't have what to feed I get Gaga at the Hummer meal just to keep them alive, note I did procurement and supplies no job so I do. Sir your help toward my business will be highly appreciated. Thank you

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It will if more sales are made and I will give others employment because I can not manage alone . at the moment am just alone with this business here I believe if more are doing it , it will improve on competition and more ideas will arise. My target mostly is Angola again with closed border it's I challenge so I sell within chavuma, the entire north Western and all parts it's possible I do this. If Price's are reduced and transport reduces and if More shops are opened here it can boost my business buying things locally. We are able to sell eggs to the locals of which it wasn't the case here in chavuma and are black austrolops chickens it's actually for the first time in some people lifes here to eat these chickens they like it. And munure to Farmers we sale . I also plant okra .

> Technical Feasibility

My business is new am still learning about it and to be honest I don't have this prototype yet and our plan is to go beyond Zambia God willing. Thank you

> Anticipated Social Impact

It can provide food and employment to the people around thus reducing hunger and joblessness. It's ok just that people complain of the price  of products been high and it's because things are high. Thanks
