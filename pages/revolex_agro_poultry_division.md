> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We are in the commercial poultry farm and egg production line of business because we want to leverage on the vast opportunities available in the agriculture industry, to contribute our quota in growing the Zambian economy in national food production, and above all to make profit.
I believe that there are a lot of opportunities that are available  as a standard poultry farm and egg Production and cannot be quantified, high demand short supply according to my research is used as a motivation and   there are loads of households, and businesses such as hotels and fast food restaurants that can’t do without daily supply of eggs. We are well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity and as a youth i know this will be an eye open to other youths that they can own and make there dream business a reality.

> Technical Feasibility

RevolEX Agro Poultry Division, is a privately owned and managed commercial poultry farm and egg production business that intends to start small in Lusaka, but hope to grow big in order to compete favorably with leading commercial poultry farms and egg production companies in the industry. currently no prototype exists.
Once the project is implemented, it will help in carrying out an awareness on young African business that came into reality.
-This project will create jobs in the community especially the young people in the community.
-They say an idle mind is the devils workshop, hence by keeping the young people  busy it will help them keep away from things like drugs and alcohol abuse.
-This project will help to improve the output in the agriculture sector by increasing GDP.
-By carrying out workshops that will educate young people in agriculture, it will give them motivation to becoming there young farmers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This project will help answer some of the common problems that are faced in our society such as:
1.The assumption that farming is for old people only- most youth assume farming is for old people only and has nothing to do with young people but this will change there perspective because even a young person can be a farmer besides farming seems to be the next big thing for me.
2.Over reliance on white collar jobs- because poultry farming is a hand job, a number of young people can be hired to help in running the business. 
3.Exaggerated prices of eggs on the market- because there a few suppliers and demand is high, by increasing the number of suppliers will help to reduce the prices so that almost every household can afford to buy eggs.
4.Girl child to be seen as only housewife-As a woman its an opportunity for me to act as a role model to other girls and be there own self employer.
5. In the words of African Development bank CEO-AkinwumiAdesina,“agriculture should Not be taken as a lifestyle,but it should be taken as a business”.Its shouldn’t be taken Just as a subsistence way of life but it should be taken as commercial entity with intent to create value addition to the crops produced. As young people we need to learn to make ends meets and create business of our own instead of dwelling on a subsistence way of living.
