## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. During the sensing phase, large manufacturers showed a keen interest in gaining concrete benefits from taking part in such a scheme. They did not act altruistically, but purely based on potential gains such as recognition, etc. 2. Small-scale/sustainable manufacturers, on the other hand, were keen to take part in the initiative to see how much more they can do to increase their sustainability efforts and the improve their outcomes. 3. Large manufacturers who had excess materials to advertise did not know what price to set for the materials they considered as waste. There clearly is a need for guidance. However, since textile has dozens of types and various combinations, it is very difficult to come up with a standard price list. This is a major barrier to establishing a healthy exchange of materials between manufacturers. 4. We relied on a free platform called Yariyo.com for the experiment. We worked with the developers to create a dedicated tab to textile waste and customized the form slightly to meet our needs. There was no need to use a fancy/expensive platform to carry out the experiment and possibly later on in real life. 5. Although we hoped for at least a few opportunities for exchange, there was none. When we spoke to those involved in the experiment, we found out that the advertised materials did not meet the needs of those seeking to purchase them. There needs to be much more variety.

N/A

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

For a platform like this to work smoothly, large manufacturers with excess materials must be willing to advertise all those materials (some of which have been sat in their warehouses for months) which is time consuming. Most of them agreed to take part in the experiment and spend a few hours creating adverts. But it is clear that in real life this would be a major barrier as they would need to employ extra people to sort to manage the operation. Currently, the excess waste is handled by 3rd parties who come with trucks and collect as the waste and even PAY large manufacturers for their waste.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We collected data from large and small-scale/sustainable textile manufacturers in various ways (through focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and informal conversations) to understand what their unique needs were and how they could be incentivized to take part in the scheme. When the needs and motivations were clear, we worked with a developer to prepare an existing platform which was later on used to monitor the experiment (how many adverts were created, what their content was, etc).

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We used the above methods to create a platform which would satisfy all users taking part in the experiment. It had to be simple enough to use but with relevant data to help with decision making of the parties involved. The platform did not have to be sophisticated, it just needed tweaks which we achieved through prototyping.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

TGSD is the national association representing large textile manufacturers. They facilitated our access to their client pool.
