## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Life Plans for indigenous Peoples

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

24/11/2023

> What action learning plan is this activity related to?

action learning plan focused on integrating Indigenous communities' perspectives into national and local climate adaptation planning. The plan aims to close the gap between traditional Indigenous knowledge and government-led climate strategies by developing Life Plans for Indigenous peoples, ensuring these plans are linked to municipal development (PTDI) and the national climate strategy (NDCs). It emphasizes community empowerment, collective intelligence, and climate resilience

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The activity seeks to learn how to integrate Indigenous Peoples' perspectives into national and local climate adaptation strategies through participatory Life Plans. It aims to understand how collective intelligence and traditional knowledge can enhance climate resilience and contribute to more inclusive planning processes.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is crucial because it bridges the gap between Indigenous knowledge and government strategies, empowering marginalized communities to play an active role in climate action and ensuring that national climate policies are both inclusive and effective​



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF Indigenous Peoples' perspectives are integrated into climate adaptation planning through participatory Life Plans, THEN local communities will be more empowered to take climate action, leading to more effective, inclusive, and resilient climate strategies at the municipal and national levels.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions to Test the Hypothesis:
Collaborative Workshops:

Conduct workshops with Indigenous communities, government officials (Plurinational Authority of Mother Earth), and local representatives in Camiri to co-design Life Plans.
Stakeholder Involvement:

Engage with the Kaami Indigenous community, municipal government, and national stakeholders to incorporate their perspectives into climate adaptation planning.
Timeline and Location:

These actions were carried out during 2023 in the Chaco region, focusing on integrating Life Plans with broader municipal and national strategies.
Technology and Tools:

Use crowdsourcing, surveys, and 3D mapping tools to capture and visualize the communities' climate adaptation priorities

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The original hypothesis—if Indigenous perspectives are integrated into climate adaptation planning, then more inclusive and effective climate strategies will emerge—was proven. The workshops with the Kaami Indigenous community and government stakeholders successfully integrated collective intelligence into the planning process. This led to better alignment between Indigenous Life Plans and broader municipal and national climate strategies, showing how traditional knowledge and official policies can work together for more resilient climate action​

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

Most important learning outcomes:
Greater inclusion: Indigenous communities were empowered to contribute to national and local climate strategies.
Closing knowledge gaps: Combining traditional indigenous knowledge with official data improved climate adaptation plans.
Effective use of collective intelligence: Tools such as 3D maps and surveys enabled deeper engagement and understanding.
Recommended changes:
Improved communication tools: further refine tools to better align indigenous knowledge with official terminology.
Broader participation: engage more indigenous communities to ensure broader impact across regions
Technology: the use of smartphones and applications must be reconsidered in places where the digital divide is extreme
