> Title of the innovation

Understanding financial markets

> Brief description of the innovation

Reflex is start up company founded by Mr mwashya kalamba. We intend to empower Zambian famers, commodity producers and common citizens on the importance of understanding finical markets and how financial markets impact their output and most importantly how they can take advantage  fof inancial instruments such as futures, FX... etc to reduce the risk of ever changing prices. And also realize the importance of investments.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation or movement will enable small business owners like me  get  investments from not just banks but people in the communities, mobilizing funds for renovative projects that will benefit communities. Teaching people on the benefits of investments within communities.

> Technical Feasibility

Simply  educate  people  at a community level on the basics of  investment how it works, dividends shareholding and also risks and benefits. We need to enter an age of investments in Zambia were the public at large understands and is not afraid of participating in the financial markets be it at an international level or community level. Knowledge is power!

> Anticipated Social Impact

I think the impact that such innovations have had in more  developed countries like USA is self explanatory currently the USA stock market is bigger than USA GDP. People are not afraid to invest in renovative projects like electrical cars(Tesla) delivery companies (Alibaba, AMZN)...etc this campaign  not only changes the  lives of the Zambians but it builds our  economy it also enables us to compete at an international level.
