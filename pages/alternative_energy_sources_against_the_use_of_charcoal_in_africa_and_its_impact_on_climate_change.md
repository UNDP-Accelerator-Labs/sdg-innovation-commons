ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES AGAINST THE USE OF CHARCOAL IN AFRICA AND ITS IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE

> Brief description of the innovation

Zambia and Africa in particular has been faced with a huge challenge as regards to deforestation due to the growing population for people relying on the usage of charcoal as a fuel for homes and house holds. This has negatively affected the wildlife and the climate in general. By means of offering many alternatives to the charcoal industry that seems to be growing at a much fast rate will unable the Africa and rest of the globe to be safe from quite a number of things for example;

Deforestation is as a result of cutting down trees and the fact that plants or tress create oxygen the air that we humans breath will be affected causing a significant impact on global warming.

All animals have there natural habitat which is the forests,this simply means they would not survive without the shelter.

Its for this reason that we would like to innovate many alternatives to the use of charcoal from tree cuttings, some of the innovations would include;

The use of banana skins to make charcoal,poop can also be converted into briquettes to make the charcoal, maize combs as well. On a large scale other alternative will of course be the use of gas stoves, gel fuel and electricity.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Alternative sources of energy need to be provided in order for the country or regions across the globe that are relying more on charcoal to refrain. The more we expose people to generate energy sources away from to charcoal of trees to making charcoal through maize combs as an example will benefit every individual.

Tree cutting is an expense on the shelter for animals or the ecosystem. Selling of the charcoal briquettes made out of maize combs and banana skins might be sold across territories offering an exchange in income at the end of the day.

Certain countries across the globe such as desert lands can be supplied these commodities and in return bring income as a way of sustainability.

Maize combs being a readily available to everyone across the rural areas it is easily accessible and readily available . As such generation of charcoal would be made at no cost at all and no effects to environment.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation about alternative charcoal is a simple one but can be looked at with high importance . Involvement of stake holders and government would help to support such kind of innovation by creating an environment to educate the entire charcoal industry in this criteria.

This can be implemented by identifying the target areas within the entire province say Zambia has 9 provinces, this can be communicated through the councils and district co-ordinators,other sensitisation can be done through the chiefs and village headmen for rural areas.

Training centres in educating the people on importance of protecting or rather maintaining our forest by avoiding cutting of trees can be established within the provisions of the law. This can further be broken down into some form of structure at provincial or district level.

The alternative energy sources will be very efficient and readily affordable. It would also be important to set up questionnaires and distribute for input in these areas, taking into considerations the response on how the charcoal industry looks at the whole set up of diverting from tree cutting to alternative energy sources as indicated.

Planting of trees should be encouraged and a number of trees must be planted each year and statistics taken for us to measure ,how climate change will be protected.

Rural Electrification can also help save the environment since its largely dependant on hydro which is generated through water turbines in dams or rivers.

Solar systems should be encouraged as well.

> Anticipated Social Impact

By offering alternatives to the charcoal Industry ,Zambia and Africa would improve the lives of many in  number of ways. Both commercial and non commercial charcoal burners will be offered training through government funded projects on how to make best use of other resource's to make charcoal or fuel . These people will also be made to understand the impact of cutting trees without having to replant or something. Certain trees are used in making medicines or herbs of course through the training or workshops in this area will help spread the knowledge to most charcoal burners and this will facilitate controls through sensitisation. That said if we have to learn how to produce alternative charcoal such as those from banana skins or maize combs,these would be package in some form of packing and exported to countries were deforestation has been extensive and though that an income generation can be achieved as well as protecting the environment for our animals and natural vegetation.
