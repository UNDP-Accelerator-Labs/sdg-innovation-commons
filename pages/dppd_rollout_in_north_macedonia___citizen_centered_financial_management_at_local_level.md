## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. The list of outperformers or positive deviants is dominated by medium-sized municipalities in terms of population size. They appear to have an economically vibrant local environment and sufficient local expenditure to cover own and delegated competences.
2. we were able to broadly categorize the findings in four sub-groups: People, Systems and procedures in place, Tools and methods, and lastly environment(therefore enabling environment) 
3. Weaknesses in this area are: Initial conditions (or the predecessor’s curse), No (certified) internal auditors, Difficulties in intergovernmental coordination, Revenue collection, and planed-budget execution. 
4. Opportunities identified in the study are: Untapped donor opportunities, geographical position that enables access to natural resources, human reources. 
5. Threats identified are: staff turnover, Heavy dependence on a key employee, significant generational change, Diminishing revenue potential, lack of training opportunities. 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
There is one blog that is published for this learning:https://www.undp.org/north-macedonia/blog/positive-deviant-vs-mapped-solution 
The full report is ready, designed and it will be published in the upcoming days. 

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

some of the data was not available in the websites of the local governments, we had to call, and reach out to the officials and gather the data through different channels. On particular period of the study also covered a period where it was Covid-19 pandemics. This was evident in the processes that where undertaken by the municipalities.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The researches so far completed on municipalities look, and analyze data in order to point out the the least performing municipalities. This approached allowed us to look at the positive outliers, analyze and learn what can be replicated in other municipalities in the country.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

we looked at large datasets that were part of the open finance initiative of the government. The treasury transactions are open and these are large amount of information. In order to be able to understand and identify the positive outliers, we used data mining, and we were able to extract the knowledge on the municipalities that are doing well on their financial management. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

At the second part of the study where we worked with the selected positive outliers, we looked on how the local authorities are engaging with civil society, and in some of the cases the interviewed members of the municipal councils belonged to civil society organizations. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In this research, an economics professor worked with us. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

we worked with 81 municipalities at the first stage, and then we looked at the positive deviants ( 7 municipalities) that scored well based on the financial data that was analyzed. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Some of the municipalities have not previously worked with UNDP. However the majority of the partners in the study have already had some experience on working with UNDP. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We were able to identify the positive show cases in the narrative stating that all local municipalities are performing poorly.  showcasing some positive examples will also make it clear to the strugellng municipalities that there are practices in place that work, and are replicable. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
