## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

BlueDIGITAL Pivot
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that we would like to close the BlueDIGITAL learning loop as we know it, and as such, we need to pivot in order to identify and act on opportunities for potential scaling and growth such as through a handover, new owner or expansion into the public sphere.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

This challenge is driven by our recognition that Lab learning and experimentation on BlueDIGITAL is complete and that certain components need to be removed while others can be actioned on. This is driven by the ongoing need for digital transformation in the Blue Economy in Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, particularly among the fisheries and tourism sector. This involves the Lab as well as potentially private sector actors (I.e.: Oceanic Global) whom we are partnering with, the financial sector through the regional innovation and fin-tech ecosystem as well as development partners and IFIs such as the Inter-American Development Bank including the Compete Caribbean partnership and the public sector through the Government of Barbados as well as other UN agencies such as FAO. Currently, the growth phase of BlueDIGITAL is under development as we are exploring the best and most feasible avenues for growth and takeover. One undesired effect it produces is uncertainty as we are starting this cycle with many directions for consideration and will eventually develop a clearer path.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our Lab needs to work on this challenge as it is the final stage of our BlueDIGITAL loop requiring some form of closure and growth. This must come from our team as we are the ones who designed BlueDIGITAL and are most familiar with it. Our added value is in our knowledge of the region's blue ecosystem (partners, emerging opportunities, gaps) which makes us well suited to bring BlueDIGITAL to new stages. It is worth investing resources into this challenge as digital transformation is nascent in the Eastern Caribbean with considerable government support and interest. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The BBD & EC Acc Lab will be exploring the growth of the BlueDIGITAL portfolio with various expansions focused on capacity building, early-stage entrepreneurship and investment in all things blue x digital.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can digital projects in the Blue Economy grow/scale in Barbados?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will be trying to grow/scale/close the BlueDIGITAL MVP according to the fisheries and Blue Economy ecosystem which operates according to systems with various actors. To do so, we will consider the systems that fisherfolk (beneficiaries) operate in. We will also try to make sense of our learnings throughout the project by mapping out insights, findings and signals. All throughout, we will aim to ensure BlueDIGITAL is relevant and consistent with ongoing local developments and signals through horizon scanning. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These new sources of data contribute to deeper understanding of the blue economy ecosystem in Barbados including its actors, solutions, gaps and opportunities.  
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Early stage Blue Economy entrepreneurs, early adopter fisherfolk, Blue Economy MSMEs.
