Could the local African Locust Bean that's packed with nutrition, yet very underutilized, be the next big super-food trend 

Chocaroube is a community-driven innovative and added-value way of looking at the African Locust Bean to make the most of a traditional local snack that went very unpopular. Turning the beans into a cacao-like powder provides a nutritious and inexpensive alternative drink or baking ingredient while preventing micro-nutrient deficiencies in children and women.
