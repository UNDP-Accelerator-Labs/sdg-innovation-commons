> Title of the innovation

College Redemption

> Brief description of the innovation

A college that has been closed for close to a year now due to bad decisions and are in debt. It already has infrastructure and tangible assets. Management needs help on how to resuscitated the institution otherwise, it provided opportunities for vast of the community in Mufulira both academically and economically in terms of education and employment.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

it will generate income using  its students. I intend on extending  the number  of courses involved as currently  its only  limited to teaching. if we implement business, medical and so forth courses we get more students  which  generates more income. with that said we'll be providing so many jobs opportunities for both the youth and the elderly in the community. other than that we intend  on building  a teaching hospital in the area which  will not only  provide jobs but impact lives too, it will also give  easy accessibility for its students. with more expansion we intend  on building both a primary and secondary school. this  improves the operations of existing businesses by providing highly qualified staff within it's own community. The vision  just  doesn't  end  on education,  we intend  on giving  the town entertainment options as to encourage money circulation within  the town itself, them opting  to spend  there money  of town leaves no development for the town itself.

> Technical Feasibility

the college  has  been in existence since 2007, I've seen its capability and its potential and how many  lives its changed over the course of they years but due  to mismanagement and unpredictable future its come down. The implementation plan is to first tackle some the debt. then we could  use some funds as the working  capital. we'd invest  into getting  licenses for three  to four  courses implemented into the institution, then from that we'd invest into marketing. The business might start slow but in due course  we are sure to build our good will. with the income  generated from the new students, we channel it into paying back debt completely and also work  on other expansions.

> Anticipated Social Impact

To start  with, it's an innovation that will create  jobs for more  than 40 employees in just  one institution.  it's a non depreciating project hence forth it will create opportunities for even the next generation. working towards greater goals it could be Mufulira's first university which will also  put  the town on the map as one of the greatest. we have boreholes dug therefore providing free water for people  in close proximity who currently face  huge  challenges with water supply. we will be educating  not only the local community but those outside Mufulira too. the innovation  is relevant because, eventhough the His Excellency the President  has order for free education, the issue  of over congestion in government  institutions can not be denied. with that overflow, where do the citizens get their education from? there wont be as many but there will be a number of individuals that will turn to the private sector. with that in mind we want to be the alternative offering a sustainable and commendable solution at the most affordable prices.
