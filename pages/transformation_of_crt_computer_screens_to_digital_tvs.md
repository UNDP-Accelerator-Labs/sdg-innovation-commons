> Title of the innovation

Transformation of CRT Computer Screens to Digital TVs

> Brief description of the innovation

HISTORY AND EVOLUTION OF THE ICT INDUSTRY IN ZAMBIA.

The first telephone exchange to be placed in Zambia was installed in Livingstone in 1913. The telephone circuit backbone infrastructure was developed in the major Zambian cities along the so called “line of rail”. The ‘line of rail’ spans from Livingstone through Lusaka to Copperbelt provinces.  This lead furthermore to the existence of computing industry in GoZ institutions later 1990 and 2000s whereby those computers sets were composed by CPU, keyboard, PS2 mouse and CRT output screen.
Liberalizing the Zambian economy opened up the telecommunication markets for many players, whereby some CPUs and CRT screen was upgraded to some powerful capabilities and all CRTs were replaced by LED and flat screen outputs, as per as all CRT screen were big and heavy to maintain as ICT tool as it has to be, then it leads to its replacement. 
This lead to the huge and large storing spaces, as per as the physical properties of CRT computer screen was and it is not recyclable like other electronic solid waste, which lead to its storage in big and large spaces in Government stores, waiting its proper recycle accordingly.

It is furthermore a big  challenger for Goz to store a big number of those CRTs whereby its storage space would be used for other public interests, whereby we, as a cooperative of committed youth, we encouraged each other to collaborate with Ministry of general Education to support us for much understanding of the commitment and request to facilitate us to the access of those CRTs everywhere they are, to its recycling system which will be not be burnt of gathered in a large pit, where will even not be decomposed, but to change it from computer output device, to a digital Television set.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The transformation of older usable computer CRT computer display to a digital television set, will be a set of full color working television set like other Cathode Ray Tube TVs, which will be sold to the needy person at cheap price, in order to their access to information GoZ program, not only in Lusaka residents, but also to the (remote) rural areas where there is no access to electrical power, whereby the transformation of that set of TV will be full digital which will use not only electrical power, but also solar power input will be embedded for the facilitation of the use of the remote power areas in Zambia. 
The challenge prize will help to harmonize the access to the information and in some electrical, office, tools and digital procurements for the transformation of the matters.
There will be less residues of devices material which will be remain for recycling, as per as many recyclable devices to be transformed from those CRTs, will be used as tools to be used to teach some new students, there will be non environment friendly materials which will be remained at successful of the final output of transformation.

> Technical Feasibility

The transformation of CRTs computer display to digital TVs is designed as the system of computer reading in order to display information on screen (WYSIWYG) will be re-designed to be a digital terrestrial antenna TV receiver, which will be able to capture all available digital Channel via digital set box receiver.

> Anticipated Social Impact

- The CRTs TV set will be socially benefitted from our innovation, as per as the access and price which will be set will be fair according the other local TV set.
- It will be fully equipped with solar power energy to the remote rural areas.
- The personnel involved in the workshop will be trained in basic electrical and electronics basic knowledge whereby at their will, they can and manage to run their electrical and/or electronics workshop.
- Through electrical and electronics training workshop which will be opened to non employed and those who are juvenile delinquent youth will be gathered and trained for the matter  for their future job creation,...
