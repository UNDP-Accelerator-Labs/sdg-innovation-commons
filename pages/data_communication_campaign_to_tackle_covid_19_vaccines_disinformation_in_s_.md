Data-communication campaign to tackle Covid-19 vaccines disinformation in social networks in Georgia
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that up to 40% of the population in Georgia don’t want to get vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus. Only around 1000 people get vaccinated on a daily basis, while the target is 3000 people a day. The low uptake of the vaccines means a prolonged pandemic related restrictions that negatively affects the wellbeing and prosperity of the citizens. To help the country recover faster, we want to ensure that those who have either positive or neutral attitude towards the vaccines are not affected by the disinformation

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

It is widely accepted that vaccines are the fastest and safest way to end the Covid-19 pandemic and every country is ensuring to vaccinate its population. Georgia started vaccinating medical workers in March 2021 but was not able to ensure the desired level of vaccine uptake. To ensure that the vaccines are not wasted in the fridges, the Government of Georgia decided to modify the national vaccination plan and open vaccination for the elderly (65+) population as well. Despite the extended eligibility criteria, vaccine uptake remains significantly law. The current rate is 1000 shots per day, while 3000 shots/day are planned to vaccinate 65% of the adults in 2021. Currently, the vaccine eligibility age was decreased to 55, however, the uptake remains low. The third wave of the Covid19 pandemic is expected in Georgia, which means stricter rules and lockdown for the country, which means, that most of the business will go bankrupt, the country cannot afford another increase in unemployment.

1.       Monitoring of population’s knowledge, understanding of risks, preventative behavior, and public trust, conducted by WHO and National Center for Disease Control and Public Health in March 2021. 2.       Attitudes and behaviors of medical workers towards Covid-19 Vaccines, conducted by WHO and National Center for Disease Control and Public Health in March 2021. 3.       Public attitudes towards Covid-19 vaccines, conducted by NDI Georgia, March 2021   All studies show that up to 60% of the population is either positive or neutral towards the vaccination, but there is an urgency to improve the communication campaign to primarily maintain this strata and ensure the vaccine uptake.

<div class="group">


> 

The government of Georgia has been talking about the potential need for stricter lockdown measures amid third wave of the pandemic causing the increased number covid infections, therefore the only solution is the vaccination of population, but the uptake of the vaccine is very low. The main signal is the widespread discussions in social media about threats of the vaccines. The recent death of a health worker caused by the allergic reaction after the vaccination reinforced the fears and mistrust.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The focus of the initiative is on data-driven communication campaign to tackle disinformation on Covid vaccination, since the target is social media and its users, the AccLab intends to develop a data scraping tool to better understand conversations behind the skepticism among the target groups. Development of such tools and innovative data gathering approaches does not fall under any project. Additionally, the lab has a capacity to bring the experiences of other AccLabs working on the vaccination issues from the global network.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We want to learn why Georgian citizens are hesitant to get vaccinated against Covid-19. We want to understand what are the sentiments that drive the decisions and how the communication campaign affects the attitudes

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Analyzing social networks with social listening tools will help us track and understand what different groups of people think and how do they feel about the vaccination process. This, in turn, will help us fine tune the communication campaign.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Several existing studies explore the attitudes of the population towards the vaccines, although only a few of them identify the specific barriers related to the disinformation. Most studies use traditional focus group method to identify disinformation. We believe that analyzing the social media posts through data scraping tools will equip us with a real time data to better plan the communication campaign. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The grow scale for this challenge would be to roll out a full-scale communication campaign beyond social media. The first step would be to cooperate with local TV channels and run a TV communication campaign as 80% of Georgians receive their information from TV.
