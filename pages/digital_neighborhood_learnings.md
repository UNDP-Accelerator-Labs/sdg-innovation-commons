## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

-The active listening of the methods used allowed not only to identify the complexities but also gave them the possibility of understanding their problems, their possible solutions, the inclusion and the change of authorities after the experiment that are now 90% women and young people in the directory of the neighborhood. -The surveys made it possible to identify actors with great potential to help the neighborhood that until now had not been taken into account, for example, volunteer teachers for children, computer experts willing to collaborate in the implementation of the neighborhood's internet cafe, a young polyglot who speaks 6 languages and is willing to teach the citizens of the neighborhood. -The process of Collective Intelligence, citizen participation, inclusion, and training led to a renovation of the neighborhoods that now are led by younger people. -The demonstrative effect of this experiment showed that there is a very large information gap between the Mayor's Office and the citizens, for this reason, the Municipality is scaling the experiment throughout the city of La Paz. -The demonstrative effect of the usefulness of the methodologies used, co-creation, Collective Intelligence, has allowed them to use on their own these methodologies to manage their neighborhood problems including the financing of a Community Internet café. Currently, they are identifying the best solutions to achieve sustainable financing of the neighborhood's internet café.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

-Political crisis and municipal elections delayed the experiment that had already been agreed upon with the previous government. -One of the main barriers was the distrust of the citizens of the neighborhood, this barrier was reduced with the continuous weekly work and the fulfillment of weekly commitments. -The lack of internet connection limited participation in activities and training, in order to solve this problem, the connection was facilitated to the participants at no cost.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The youth and women of the neighborhood surveyed socioeconomic information through digital surveys previous training on digital surveys and the importance of having data about their neighborhood to know their needs and be able to make a strategy and co-construction of their demands. The information collected was comprehensive.  The decision of the structure of the questionnaire co-constructed with the neighborhood through the methodology of Collective Intelligence

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The methods of Intelligence and co-construction allow citizen participation and joint and co-responsible decision-making and under the premise of improving social cohesion and the inclusion of men and women
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The board of Directors of San Sebastian is affiliated with the Federation of Neighborhood Councils of the Municipal Autonomous Government of La Paz.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

With the academic training services of the University Franz Tamayo.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

TIGO with technological training services and the provision of low-cost internet.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Municipal Autonomous Government of La Paz was the first partner that supported those activated with the neighborhood, we are currently working on the escalation for 115 neighborhoods identified by the municipality.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

TIGO for being a private company because pandemic began to work with technological education with neighborhoods and citizens. San Sebastian's board of directors, due to its geographical dimension, UNDP Bolivia did not work at the neighbourhood level.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The innovation methods facilitated the visualization of the complexity of the problem of the neighborhood that even the neighbors themselves did not perceive clearly, without the use of these methods it would have been very difficult to participate inclusively and recognize how evidence and citizen participation can help the decision-making of the most efficient and neighborhood. The alliance with actors from national communication companies and academia in a neighborhood allowed us to explore partner relationships with small geographic units such as neighborhoods.
