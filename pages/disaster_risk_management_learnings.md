## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The key insights are listed as follows:

- The importance of identifying and analyzing historical data of disasters to enhance early warning mechanisms

- The urgency to build a prediction model based on historical data

- The importance to have information on the means at our disposal for a post-disaster management

- The potential of AI/ Machine learning in analyzing satellite imagery for better coordination and disaster monitoring

- The necessity of coupling scattered efforts for a better coordination and significant impact

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
-

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The main barrier experienced was the lack of data related to disasters in Mauritania.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The Lab has identified a source of data that provides key information on disaster enabling deep understanding of disaster occurrence frequency by type of disaster and groups as well as information on the affected population (deaths, injuries, homeless, economic losses etc.)

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

This method helps us in understanding the challenge as well as collecting information and data related to the challenge. The solution mapping allowed us to have different solutions and ideas on how to deal with the challenge.
## Partners
****

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We mainly worked with national partners on this challenge

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We mainly worked with national partners on this challenge


> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We mainly worked with national partners on this challenge


> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with the Ministry of Interior ( prevention and controm direction)

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

None of the involved partners was new to UNDP

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNDP Sustainable Develoement Unit
## End
****

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

This combinbation enabled us t ohave a better undrestanding of the challenge from different perspectives and therefore, develop a clear approach to adress the challenge.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
