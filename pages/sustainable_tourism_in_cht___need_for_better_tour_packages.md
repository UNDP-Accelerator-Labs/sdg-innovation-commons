Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT.    One of the challenges identified is that there is a lack of tour packages that provide combined mountain & sea tours, which is an expectation from tourists since CHT is close to Cox Bazar - the largest uninterrupted sea beach in the world. To address this issue, training can be provided to the tour operators to develop tour packages such as 3 days package, 5 days package and 10 days package for areas such as Thanchi, Ruma Cox's Bazar and Bilai chhori, thus covering both mountain and sea.
