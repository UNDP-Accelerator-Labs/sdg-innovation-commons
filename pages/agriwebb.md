2. Hardware Integration: Connects with EID and other hardware, saving time and filling data gaps.
3. Informed Decisions: Allows data-backed real-time choices, such as calculating stocking, optimizing rotations, and identifying underperformers.
4. Reports: Includes reports for better grazing management, such as exact feed on offer, grazing days remaining, pasture growth rate, and stocking rate.
5. Profit Maximization: Helps increase profits by identifying overperformers, filtering by traits, leveraging land, and knowing market readiness.
