## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Agro-library to promote sustainable food production
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to explore whether an ordinary library in a small town can host an agricultural experiment to promote sustainable production of food as well as increase ecological literacy among the locals.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Currently, organizations in Turkey that provide the necessary training, and more importantly, the tools for responsible food production and consumption are extremely rare. Although there are certain food communities, hobby gardens, urban farms, and other small-scale initiatives, there is not a single holistic model that utilizes public spaces (such as local libraries) as food production or ecological training facilities. The existing initiatives have generally been designed as ‘closed’ activities which prevents their mainstreaming. The scale that is needed to achieve sustainable food production in urban environments can only be reached if existing public spaces with appropriate infrastructure are also used for food production and ecological training.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our experiment, if successful, will set an example by creating Turkey’s first agro-library where conventional library services will be combined with organic food production and ecological training especially for youth. One of our Innovation Challenge winners has specifically asked us to run this experiment as no other organization was willing to do support it. Our focus on innovation and sustainable urban development makes us the perfect actor to test this new approach and later work on its scaling. We will transform the existing library into a community space to improve ecological literacy, grow and share produce, and generally promote sustainable living. This hybrid model will hopefully inspire others to pursue similar paths.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Accelerator Lab Turkey, in collaboration with Kutup-Anne Platformu and Banaz Municipality, is creating Turkey’s first agro-library to promote ecological literacy and sustainable food production among library users.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How successful would a hybrid model like an agro-library be in promoting sustainable food production and improve ecological literacy among users?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will be testing out a new hybrid model that we will co-create and if it works, we will work on its scaling.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We don’t know enough about young visitors’ expectations, so need to collect data on that. We also need to analyze data collected from interviews and images taken by the local librarian.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The locals living in Banaz, especially young people, will benefit from this work. If the experiment is successful, we expect to work with other libraries and/or similar public spaces to replicate the results. Various municipalities, ministries, CSOs and CBOs are likely to be very interested in getting involved as well.
