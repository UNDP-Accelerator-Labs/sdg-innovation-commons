> Title of the innovation

Merchi pharmacy/ medical drug store and Merchi wholesale/retail

> Brief description of the innovation

Merchi pharmacy/drug store is an idea intended to supply people of kabompo district with a proper reliable medical drug store to help improve their health as there is currently no reliable one here. People have to travel 7-10 hour distances to have access to medications the hospital is unable to offer.
Merchi wholesale is another business idea intended to provide people of kabompo district, northwestern province both shop owners and individual consumers at large, with a store where they are able to access groceries without having to travel distances to acquire such.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income will be generated from the two business ideas after selling the products brought to the market; medications and groceries. This will as well help provide jobs to others who will be recruited to help run the businesses. Target market is every age group, children, adults, elderly both male and female and a target esmate is about over 10 thousand people to generate over 100 thousand in the initial 2years of business. 
Winning the prize will make me start up this life changing business and help other youths and professionals with practicing licences to take part in changing the lives of people for the better. Starting up the business will give surety of other branches opening in the neighbouring towns; manyinga district, mufumbwe and Zambezi.  From the revenue, other businesses will merge like deliveries company in Solwezi, merchi designs and tailoring accessories as I am also a tailor and others.

> Technical Feasibility

To implement these ideas, Merchi pharmacy will firstly require partnering with a well established pharmacist , learning the how and what from those with experience, acquiring the required documents, identifying good and trusted suppliers and developing strong relations with them, buying and innovating a building/store to suit the conditions required for medical operations and buying and selling the products. 
In the same way, merchi wholesale will require a big well established shop identifying trusted suppliers making orders for them to deliver to us twice within a week. Within 2 years, having other branches within the province and other provinces within 5 years. Also opening an online store to offer the same.
From the income generated as mentioned, a clothing line will be established to offer other countries a taste of what Merchi brand can offer.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Medical drug store will improve the health of people by giving them access to medications as referred from the hospital. It is very relevant in that it takes care of the health of people. 
The wholesale as well takes care of immediate requirements of the people.
There are not a lot of wholesales and medical drug stores if any, in developing districts of Zambia and growing towns  hence it will improve lives and the country at large
