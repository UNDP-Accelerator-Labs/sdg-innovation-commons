The solution has been presented at HackCOVID to solve the issue with blood donors. 


The platform aims at monitoring, coordinating, and raising awareness about blood donors.  Based on the established mechanism, the user who is interested in donating blood can schedule the process and also use a free taxi service to get to the hospital.
