> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Digitalisation

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

The need for the experiment arises from the pressing challenges young Jordanians face in effectively navigating their career pathways. Limited access to quality career guidance resources and the rapid evolution of the job market leaves many young Jordanians uncertain about their future prospects. Young Jordanians risk being left behind in an increasingly competitive and dynamic labour market without adequate support and guidance. Therefore, our experiment seeks to test the viability of using chat applications (WhatsApp) in career counselling.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

What are the comparative effectiveness and user preferences between WhatsApp, phone calls, and in-person sessions for career counselling among young Jordanians? How does the utilization of each method impact engagement, satisfaction, and perceived value in navigating career pathways.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

How do the outcomes of career counselling sessions through WhatsApp compare to in-person sessions and phone calls, particularly regarding accessibility and effectiveness in supporting young Jordanian university students and graduates in navigating their career pathways?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If career counseling is provided through chat, then accessibility to career guidance services will increase, particularly for individuals who may face barriers to accessing traditional in-person counseling.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Before the experiment phase, we created an online survey shared on the UNDP social media platforms to get data and learn more about how youth in Jordan make their career choices and decisions.

One of the findings was the limited reach of career counselling and guidance, which led us to create the experimentation phase.

The experimental phase involved collaborating with a professional career counsellor, who engaged with 16 young individuals comprising of university students and graduates. A range of modalities were employed to validate our hypotheses, including in-person 45-minute sessions, 15-minute calls, and 30-minute chat sessions using the mobile app (WhatsApp). These sessions were structured to collect information on the efficiency of each modality, determine the trends, identify pros and cons, and assess participants' responses to the counselling interventions.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The unit of analysis in this experiment is individual participants, specifically young Jordanian university students and graduates who engaged in career counselling sessions. Data collection and analysis focus on these participants to evaluate the effectiveness and accessibility of different counselling modalities (in-person sessions, phone calls, and chat sessions) and gather insights on their preferences, feedback, and sentiments regarding career counselling services.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The data collection technique proposed in the experiment involves engaging with individual participants through various modalities of career counseling sessions: in-person sessions, phone calls, and chat sessions via WhatsApp.

In-Person Sessions: Participants are scheduled for 45-minute in-person sessions with a professional career counselor. During these sessions, data is collected through direct observation and structured interviews to assess the effectiveness of face-to-face engagement, gather feedback on counseling interventions, and identify any barriers or challenges faced by participants.

Phone Calls: Participants are engaged in 15-minute phone calls with the career counselor. These calls serve as a shorter alternative to in-person sessions, allowing for efficient data collection on counseling outcomes, participant sentiments, and preferences for remote counseling modalities.

Chat Sessions via WhatsApp: Participants interact with the career counselor through 30-minute chat sessions conducted via the WhatsApp messaging platform. Data collection in these sessions involves analyzing chat transcripts to evaluate the effectiveness of chat-based counseling, assess participant engagement and satisfaction, and identify any advantages or limitations compared to traditional counseling methods.

Additionally, post-telephone call interviews are conducted to gather insights and assess participant sentiments regarding the counseling sessions.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The hypothesis was proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Although the most desired type of session was the in-person, most of the participants stated that it would be really useful to use the chat if it was available.

The survey we used prior to the experiment to know more about how youth make their career choices was really useful.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 Months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

3700 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, the findings were used to write a proposal on career counselling and was submitted to Al Ghurair foundation to get funding to create an online career counselling platform equiped with an AI chatbot to support youth make their career decisions.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, we sent the proposal to several donors and we are awaiting their feedback on it.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The experiment yielded affirmative outcomes across all three distinct modalities. signifying their positive impact on participant engagement. Based on our counsellors’ insights, although the chat modality was used for the first time in career counselling in Jordan, it has promising potential. Phone calls, though brief, fostered quality discussions and openness for participants to share their thoughts and feelings.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

scheduling the in-person sessions with the youth, and this is due to their commitment to University and collage classes and exams. which also supports our claim about career counseling accessibility.


> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Climate action and community resilience pillar as this experiment cross cuts with their activities.


> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

If we successfully get our funding to complete and build on our experiment, then the national online platform will be available to all youth in Jordan.


> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

The initial sample size was 21 young individual, but we reduced the number to 16 as the timing of the experiment coincided with exams period at universities. 


> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

1. Check with universities to find out the timing of exams! To encourage young individuals to participate, avoid the exam period.

2. Hire more than one counsellor to have a better view and have more feedback.


> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes! We can use chat to get feedback on different topics related to climate change, elections, and more.


> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

My fellow Explorer supported the experiment really well, but unfortunately we didn't have a solution mapper in the time of this experiment. If we had a solution mapper that would have helped.


> What surprised you?

I was surprised by how young people are motivated to change their country and make a difference.
