Junior achievement training

> Brief description of the innovation

Junior achievement training is a must for our young people, the adolescents,and the young as govt endeavors to tackle the huge problem of unemployment.The young ones have gos,interests, skills that need to be harnessed for them to realize their full potential .Most young ones, unlike is the case today,don't need a degree to make money if only they realized there full potential soon enough,talk less of making ends meet like is the case today for most young ones in Zambia.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This enovation is not a money making venture but rather an initiative to help reduce unemployment among young people.it will make them realise their potential , thereby launching them into self realisation making them able to start own businesses and even employ others hence generating income.This will ultimately change the landscape in Zambia of youths waiting for govt to employ them.Even trained ones waiting for employment can take advantage and make money for themselves.

> Technical Feasibility

These junior achievement centres should be atleast in each province to Accord young ones access.Allow me to distinguish this from skills centres which only have carpentry and tailoring.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This is what we need right now in order to attain the go of better lives for zambians because if most young ones are self sustaining,there will be a trickle down effect on other family members.
