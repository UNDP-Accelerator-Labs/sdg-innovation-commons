> Title of the innovation

The Granular fertilizer Dispenser

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is the Granular fertilizer Dispenser designed to help Small and Emerging Farmers apply the correct fertilizer quantities in a Crop field without bending, having a direct contact with Fertilizer to the Skin. The innovation is designed with  a Calibration mechanism which determines the amount of fertilizer to be applied on a particular crop. The traditional method of applying fertilizer is that of Using hands, Soda bottle tops and tea spoon. These methods have been responsible of lower crop yields of 2metric tons per hector against the upper range of 8metric tons per hector in that different fertilizers are applied on a field affecting the growth of Crop, the process requires bending, bending for a longer period affects one's Spin especially women and the Old who are the the majority small holder Farmers.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We will be able to generate income through sale of our product, after sales service (repair and replacement of broken parts), Farmer Capacity building trainings. Agro-Dealer shops will be able to generate income through resale of implements, Farmers will generate income by using the implements to Maximize on Crop production and sale at a good price, They will also hire out the machine to other farmers at a fee. Farmer Co-operatives Co-operatives will also resale the machine to their farmers.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is made from Stainless Steel which is a good material for Fertilizers this is to avoid corrosion and has  two sections the Fertilizer Carrier or Nap sack  and  the Gun, the Gun has the inlet valve that allows fertilizer to be injected into the fertilizer Chamber  and the outlet valve that is injected to the ground. Pushing the fertilizer Dispenser to be ground ground allows fertilizer into the inlet while lifting it up allows fertilizer out of the machine. The machine can use either a pull spring or Gravity.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Crop production among Small holder and Emerging Farmers will increase from the current 2 Metric tons to 8metric tons per hector improving their income base by 4 and enjoy Social amenities like good health and school for children. Use of this implement will reduce fertilizer losses and purchase of unwanted Fertilizer that occur from the an calibrated system of fertilizer application using hands soda bottle tops and tea spoons. A Farmer will also save time to be used for another farming activities like weeding which is normally date late. With this implement, compliments of Spin pain during prolonged bending will be a thing of the past as the innovation is operated while one is on upright position.
