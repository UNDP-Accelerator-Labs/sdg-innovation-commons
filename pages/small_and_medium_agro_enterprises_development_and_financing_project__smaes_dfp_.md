> Brief description of the innovation

The Small and Medium Agro-Enterprises Development and Financing (SMAEs-DFP) started to be designed in 2017. The main objective of the project is to empower SMAEs in Zambia through a comprehensive package that will offer; business development services, technology adoption, finance sourcing and market linkages all hinging on the Keyman Support Model. Through its experience in the sector, MashMap Consultancy Services, discovered that in order to tackle all the challenges faced by SMAEs from the production, financing, marketing and business development, there is need for the supply- and demand-driven approached to co-exist through modifications to specific sub-sectors and regions. The SMAEs-DFP will adopt the Needs-Driven Approach by the Royal Tropical Institute, Food and Agriculture Organization, and AgriProFocus. This approach implies a different way to organize, support and deliver business services, paying particular importance to accountability, inclusiveness, and sustainability. The backbone of the project is to expose the enterprises to an eco-system that will connect them to knowledge (learning), opportunities (resources), and connections (networks), through the various stakeholders.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Small and Medium Agro-Enterprises Development and Financing (SMAEs-DFP) started to be designed in 2017. The main objective of the project is to empower SMAEs in Zambia through a comprehensive package that will offer; business development services, technology adoption, finance sourcing and market linkages all hinging on the Keyman Support Model. 
The project will aim at being self-sustainable and not solely rely on external financing. As such a number of measures will be taken into account to ensure that there is a constant flow of income to keep the project running for the entire period with or without external financing. Any external financing will be dedicated to up-scaling the project especially to other provinces. These self-sustainability measures will include:
•	A 10 percent share of the financing given by the financial institutions to the beneficiary SMAEs will go to the project for coordination and implementation activities;
•	Non-financial support such as; motor vehicles, office space, training materials, computers etc., will be solicited from support organizations thus reducing the financial needs of the project;
•	Government aid may be solicited through various government grant opportunities; 
•	Bridge financing will be solicited from aid and support organizations especially those that have budgets to support similar projects; and
•	If need be, arrangements will be made for profit contributions from the beneficiary SMAEs to support the sustainability of the project during the project period.
It is expected that at full implementation of the project, with each beneficiary getting financing ranging between ZMW 50, 000 to ZMW 500, 000 on average, the project will bring in an estimated total of ZMW 62, 500, 000, of which 10 percent will represent a ZMW 6, 250, 000 going to project coordination and implementation. With estimated SMAEs beneficiary annual revenue growth each ranging between ZMW 500, 000 and ZMW 2, 000, 000, the project is therefore expected to generate a total contribution of between ZMW 125, 000, 000 to ZMW 500, 000, 000 to national GDP.

> Technical Feasibility

Due to the diversity of the agriculture sector and the limited time period for implementation, the project will narrow its scope to agro-enterprises that are offering products and services that have proven to have high demand locally, these will include:
•	Fast moving agriculture products such as fruits and vegetables;
•	Products with high trade deficit such as fish and dairy;
•	Products with low advances in processing such as cassava and horticulture;
•	Products with organic, health, and environmental benefits such as agroforestry and moringa;
•	Products on high demand in neighbouring countries such as poultry, egg and goat;
•	Products with huge support from government and other support organizations, such as; cashew, fish and cassava; and
•	Services lacking in the sector such as; digitization, financing, breeding, and agriculture mechanization and technology.
Close partnerships with real influence and possibilities to add value will be expected within the project. The project will be short-to-medium term that will take several months, implemented in several phases, using the following approach:
•	Phase One – Capacity Building Training (November 2020 – December 2020);
•	Phase Two – Enterprise Case Study (December 2020);
•	Phase Three – Business Growth Planning and Market Research (January 2021 – February 2021); and
•	Phase Four – Implementation of Business Growth Plans, Linkages and Finance Sourcing (March 2021 – May 2021).

> Anticipated Social Impact

The main objective of the project is to empower small- and medium-scale agro-enterprises in Zambia through a comprehensive package that will offer; business development services, technology adoption, finance sourcing and market linkages, all hinging on the Keyman Support Model.
The specific objectives of the project are:
•	To provide SMAEs in Zambia access to affordable professional BDSS and technology;
•	To provide SMAEs in Zambia access to affordable financing that is tailor-made to their needs;
•	To provide SMAEs access to lucrative markets in Zambia and the region at large; and
•	To increase the revenues of SMAEs in Zambia through a support network.
Other objectives to be achieved include:
•	To provide rural communities in Zambia access to formal markets through partnerships with SMAEs;
•	To get more youths and women involved in agriculture in Zambia;
•	Reduce the agriculture knowledge gap in Zambia;
•	Make agribusiness as a lifestyle for income generation and sustainability for many Zambian households;
•	To link SMAEs to various networks, markets and support organizations that will assist them to grow their agriculture ventures; and
•	Use SMAEs as a major contributor from the agricultural sector to the national GDP.
The outcomes expected from the pilot are listed below.
•	Directly assist 20 SMAEs grow their businesses through increased output, profits and employment;
•	Impart the beneficiaries with agribusiness management and development skills that will result in increased output and revenue;
•	Develop operational systems and financial management systems that the SMAEs will adopt and use in their businesses;
•	Increase the online presence of the SMAEs through websites, social media accounts, and online directory listing;
•	Provide and train the enterprises with business management software such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) software which they will adopt and use;
•	Solicit up to ZMW 1, 000, 000 in financing for the beneficiary SMAEs;
•	Directly benefit 200 people (especially youths and women) through employment and income generation; and
•	Benefit up to 1, 500 people indirectly through better household income, education, health, food and shelter.
