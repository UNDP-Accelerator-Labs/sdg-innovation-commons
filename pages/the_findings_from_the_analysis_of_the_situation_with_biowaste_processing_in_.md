## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The findings from the analysis of the situation with biowaste processing in the national economy, including the private sector, suggest that there are several types of measures that can be implemented to support society in general in its green transition  endeavor: 1.  awareness raising campaigns and display of the success stories and case studies, provision of professional guidance and expertise in establishing the biowaste processing technology,  2. continuous cooperation between companies and academia,  3. financial subsidies for the companies that want to transform their biowaste,  4. provision of continuous professional development programs for companies' technology specialists, 5.  introduction of new occupations related to biowaste processing, etc. By regions, we managed to explore which types of biowaste are found in abundance and that can be easily transformed  The participants from the Tetovo region, in accordance with the discussion at the workshop, activities in the field and cooperation with individual farmers and food producers, highlighted the byproducts obtained from the production of beans and hazelnuts. In the Strumica region, the need for the valorization of the waste generated during the processing of fruits and vegetables such as pomegranate, potatoes, tomatoes, and grapes was emphasized. Although tobacco is not a food, the possibility for the valorization of the waste from the tobacco industry was considered, also, taking in account that in the Republic of Northern Macedonia the average annual production of tobacco is around 22000 tons. In order to produce that quantity, it is necessary to plant 1,588,860 tobacco stalks on about 12222 hectares, that are wasted after harvesting tobacco leaves.  In the Skopje region, the need to valorize the waste generated during the food selling, in the sector of fruits and vegetables, as well as the sector of meat and meat products was emphasized. Also, the possibilities for introducing the pelleting process as a technique for the valorization of biowaste at the national level were reviewed.

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
The intervention was conducted together with the Inclusive Prosperity Portfolio, the blogpost is written with the Head of the Portfolio and project managers of the project "Bridging the Skills Gap to Create New and Better Jobs"; As soon as the blogpost is published we will follow up. 

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The private sector was more than welcoming to the intervention, even naming it one of the most practical series of workshops that they have ever been to. Some of the barriers are systematic meaning that in the classification of workplaces in the country positions such as bio-waste transformation technician, is not listed at all. Another challenge was that food technicians are over burdened with administrative work and rarely focus on what to do with the biowaste;

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We wanted to test and explore the collective intelligence of the private sector when presented with solutions for their bio-waste problems that we have detected.  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We had to prove to prove to the sector that biowaste can be threated as a resource, instead of being disposed at landfills. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We collaborated with the Faculty of Technology and Metallurgy department for waste valorization 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The workshops were attended by representatives of the food sales sector (Ramstore Macedonia and KAM doo Ilinden, 3 participants), food producers (FLEKS POVER DOO Skopje, Rudine MM DOO-Skopje, Evromark foods, TRGOPRODUKT DOO-Strumica, Sloga 88 doо Radovish, Agro-Komerc 92 doo-Strumica, Ekofud-Strumica, Organic Nar-Bogdanci, ECO SHARR-Tetovo, 13 participants), consumers (1 participant)

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Most of the partners were new and unusual partners to UNDP. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We collaborated with the Portfolio for Inclusive prosperity in the creation and implementation of the initiative 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
