Energy Access in Off-Grid areas.

> Qualitative Results of the Innovation

Agri-equipment Financing using Innovative Pay plans:


1. Increased access to irrigation: In many parts of Kenya and Uganda, farmers rely on rainfall to water their crops. However, with unpredictable weather patterns and droughts becoming more frequent, irrigation is becoming increasingly important. Solar-powered irrigation systems provide a sustainable and cost-effective solution. For example, in Kenya, the Solar Water Pumping project has provided 17,000 farmers with access to irrigation, resulting in increased crop yields and incomes.


2. Improved food security: Solar-powered cold storage units have enabled farmers to preserve their crops for longer periods, reducing post-harvest losses and improving food security. In Uganda, for example, the Solar-Powered Milk Cooling project has helped dairy farmers to keep their milk fresh for longer, reducing spoilage and improving the quality of their products.


3. Reduced energy costs: Solar power has enabled farmers to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, which can be expensive and environmentally damaging. By using solar-powered equipment, farmers can save money on energy costs, which can be reinvested into their farms. For example, in Kenya, the Solar Energy for Agriculture and Livelihoods project has enabled farmers to save up to 50% on their energy costs.


4. Improved access to information: Solar-powered mobile phones and tablets have provided farmers with access to information on weather patterns, market prices, and other agricultural data. This has enabled them to make informed decisions about when to plant and harvest their crops, and where to sell them. In Uganda, the Solar-Powered Telecenters project has provided farmers with access to information and communication technologies, improving their connectivity and enabling them to participate in the global marketplace.
