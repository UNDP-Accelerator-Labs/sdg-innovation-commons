From August 10 to 12 we embarked on a transformative journey through starting with a system thinking training with colleagues from the Youth Employment Secretariat – the Secretaria de Estado da Juventude e Emprego (SEJE). This was the second major meeting where PNUD and SEJE came together to tackle the complex issue of youth employment in Mozambique using a systems thinking. It was not Just another workshop; it was an eye-opening experience where we used tools many of us have never encountered before to dissect the issues and challenges, we face.
Analysing the System: A Unique OpportunityWhat made this training unique was the chance to gather all key players from the youth employment team and analyse the system in depth. SEJE, who had never used this type of tool before, brought fresh perspectives to the table, and together, we explored how to take good ideas forward. We visualized the entire youth employment system, mapping out various interventions that are either in place or in progress across Mozambique. Mapping the InterventionsThe Systems Thinking approach brought us to an important realization: individuals with different perspectives can easily develop a shared understanding of a complexity issue such as youth employment once they identify the factors which underpin the system and where they can have the most impact. It provides a visual way of illustrating a problem, and a simplified understanding of a complex problem. We also realized that there’s a critical need to map every youth employment intervention happening in the country. By doing this, we could analyse the system with a FOFA (Strengths, Opportunities, Weaknesses, and Threats) framework and identify areas where we can maximize our impact. This mapping also allowed us to see where new interventions could fill gaps and where existing ones could be scaled or improved. Focusing Our EffortsOne key outcome of the training was the realization that we needed to narrow down our focus. Tackling everything at once would not be productive, but by honing in on specific areas, we could create significant impact. This strategic focus also opened doors for more partners to join our efforts in youth employment, making space for collaboration across sectors to collectively drive change. Through the systems map we developed, we were able to identify both the enabling and inhibiting forces to youth employment and the key themes and their relationship to one another.

Collaboration and Systemic ImpactThis training wasn’t just about analysing data or creating action plans; it was about building a foundation for collaborative work that could reshape youth employment efforts in Mozambique. We recognized that the system is complex, but with each partner like SEJE bringing their own expertise and commitment, we can intervene in ways that generate long-term change. The Steps You Will Never HearThe title, "Xifambo Xa Inaaaa – The Steps You Will Never Hear," reflects the many invisible but critical actions that take place behind the scenes in a project like this. From system mapping to focused discussions and collaboration, these are the steps that shape the most impactful interventions but often go unnoticed. You can’t fully grasp the complexity of the system without being part of it. This journey has shown us that small steps, which often go unheard, make all the difference in shaping the future of youth employment. As we move forward, we are excited by the prospect of continuing this work with SEJE and other partners, knowing that the insights we gained from this Systems Thinking training will guide us toward even more impactful solutions. A Parting ShotSystems thinking requires a shift in mindset. It’s very easy to fall into the trap of thinking about social change as a linear process: Identify a problem, propose a solution to said problem, implement the solution (usually in the form of a project or programme). Sometimes this can be effective, but most of the time the challenges we are trying to solve are a lot messier and more complex than this. Systems thinking requires a shift in mindset, away from linear and towards the bigger picture. A systems thinker uses this mindset to work within and untangle the complexity of social change.
