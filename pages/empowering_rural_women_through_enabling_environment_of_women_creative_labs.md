Women Creative Labs 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



The creative and cultural sector can serve as a powerful means of advocacy, empowerment, and social inclusion, especially for marginalized and vulnerable communities. Several studies have shown that an arts education has a positive effect on the self-esteem of at-risk youth and enhances their resilience. It also enables those struggling with mental health and social issues to build relationships and engage positively with others in their communities. Despite high potential, feasibility and applicability of creative economy’s means toward solving most pressing social issues and driving social transformation, there is no dedicated program in Kyrgyzstan to capacitate local non-profit and civic organizations in using them.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Women Creative Lab (WCL), our experimental project was launched in 2022. The WCL is a women-oriented coworking space that provides residents with access to unique training and mentoring support programmes, as well as seed funding to test or accelerate their business ideas in creative industries. The WCL "Akylzhan" in Osh was the first of its kind, and over 100 women and girls shared their aspirations, dreams, and plans during its first year of operation. WCL is a woman oriented coworking space with extremely enabling and nurturing peer environment. The Lab residents have access to unique training and mentoring support programs as well as to the seed funding sources to test or accelerate their business ideas in creative industries. Due to the successful experiment with WCL in Osh, in 2023 UNDP in collaboration with the grassroot organizations is scaling up the WCL network to Batken and Jalal-Abad regions covering more than 200 rural women to discover their talents, support in finding jobs and create opportunities to generate sustainable income using creative skills. The WCL case allowed UNDP both to unveil the lack of knowledge and low capacity of local NGOs to customize and implement projects using creative economy’s means and recognize high impact they can produce on social transformation engaging most vulnerable.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Women Creative Lab is first in Kyrgyzstan gender-sensitive co-working space and innovative paradigm to empower women especially in rural areas. Conventionally,  women  empowerment is mainstreamed through their engagement into more traditional economic sectors; while creative industries allow to engage into the network women who might have never been employed but still be equipped with  handicraft skills, for example.

Positive deviants - are those residents of the Labs who are becoming role models for other participants and communities in general 

Ethnography is helping to customize the paradigm considering local context, feature of the territories and already successful grassroot solutions.
