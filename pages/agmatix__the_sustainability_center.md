> Description of the solution

The Sustainability Center is a platform that helps farmers and agricultural businesses monitor and analyze regenerative agriculture practices and their impact on sustainability. It uses a framework called RegenIQ to measure both the efforts made towards regenerative agriculture (such as specific farming practices) and the resulting outcomes (like improved soil health, water quality, and biodiversity). By tracking these metrics, the platform provides valuable insights to help farmers make data-driven decisions and achieve sustainable and profitable agriculture.
