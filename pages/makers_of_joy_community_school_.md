> Title of the innovation

MAKERS OF JOY COMMUNITY SCHOOL.

> Brief description of the innovation

WE BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION IS THE LIGHT TO EVERY CHILD FUTURE..WE ENSURE TO PROVIDE QUALITY EDUCATION THOUGH OUR SURROUNDING IS NOT FAVOURABLE. WE WANT TO BRING OUT A DOCTOR, TEACHER ,PILOT ETC IN ORPHANS AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN, WE WORK TO PROMOTE GIRL CHILD EDUCATION.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

SINCE ITS A COMMUNITY SCHOOL MOST OF OUR PUPILS ARE ORPHANS AND VULNERABLE..WE TOOK A STEP OF ENROLLING EVEN CHILDREN WHOSE PARENTS ARE ABLE SO THAT WE BE ABLE TO PAY RENT AND GIVE ALLOWANCES TO VOLUNTEERS. SO IF WE ARE GIVEN THIS CHANCE WE WANT TO UPGRADE THE SCHOOL BY PAINTING IT,PUTTING SWINGS AND A FENCE FOR SECURITY SO THAT WE CAN ENROL MORE KIDS FROM PARENTS WHO ARE FINANCIALLY STABLE.
SINCE WE STARTED THE PROGRAM IN 2007 ALOT OF KIDS HAVE FINISHED THEIR SECONDARY EDUCATION AND THEY BEHAVE WELL THEY ALSO KNOW HOW TO READ AND WRITE .SO I WOULD SAY WE WORK TO WIPE OUT ILLITERACY.

> Technical Feasibility

ITS A BIG HALL AND WE SEPARATE THE LEARNERS BY GRADE. 
-WE PLAN TO PUT IN OUR EFFORTS SO THAT WE MAY PROTECT LEARNERS FROM DRUGS AND EARLY PREGNANCIES.
GIVE THE CHILDREN A BRIGHT FUTURE THROUGH EDUCATION. 
INTRODUCTION OF ADULT EDUCATION SO THAT EVEN PARENTS CAN BE GIVEN A FAIR CHANCE OF LEARNING. 
SPONSORING THESE LEARNERS NOT ON PRIMARY LEVEL BUT SECONDARY LEVEL TOO.SO FAR WE ONLY HAVE ONE CHILD WE ARE SPONSORING IN GRADE EIGHT BECAUSE OF LACK OF FINANCES. 
REDUCES THE RATE OF POVERTY IF THESE CHILDREN BECOMES WHAT THE DESIRE TO BECOME THEN WE WILL HAVE A LOWER RATE OF POVERTY.

> Anticipated Social Impact

IT IS VERY RELEVANT BECAUSE WE ALL NEED EDUCATION TO BECOME DOCTORS, NURSES,TEACHERS, PILOTS, MECHANIC ENGINEERS  AND EVEN A PASTOR NEEDS TO KNOW HOW TO READ THE BIBLE.
