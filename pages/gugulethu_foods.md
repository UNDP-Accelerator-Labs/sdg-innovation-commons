Gugulethu Foods is a specialized food supply, processing and production company, which offers products and services of pure farming produce and freshly prepared meals from our restaurant.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through processing and value addition of our yield from the farm, we will be whole-selling/Retailing our products at an improved price hence generating enough income to remunerate all stakeholders involved. Our target market are supermarkets and local shops, winning the challenge prize, will enable us to produce our products in large quantities, translating into more jobs for people.

> Technical Feasibility

Being a food production, food processing and food supplying company, it is intended for Gugulethu Foods to be able to produce food stuff which we should be able to process in our restaurant and serve as meals to our clients, at the same time process other food stuffs by adding value and supply to supermarkets and local stores for retailing.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We will hire people to carry out the raw production of the food from the Gugulethu Foods farm, this means cultivating and yielding of crops, and a team to be processing the foods for supplying.
While on the restaurant side, we will hire a chef and waiters/waitresses, translating into more jobs for the youths. In-order to reach clients in all areas, our food will have to be delivered, this means we will either partner with a delivery company to make deliveries or will hire delivery people, this would have provided jobs for people making deliveries.
