Recognizing stray animals as residents of the neighborhood, meeting their nutritional, sheltering and health needs, together with the municipality, establishes a common model, language and behavior ground that takes care of the health and effort of veterinarians and animal lovers, improves the order and cleanliness of the neighborhood, and makes life easier and more beautiful. From resource creation to food supply, from recycling to design, it provides multi-layered, concrete and applicable solutions for the culture of living together by connecting with the nature of the city.
