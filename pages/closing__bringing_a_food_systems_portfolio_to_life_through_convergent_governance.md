## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

In crafting a food systems solution, the journeys of the local stakeholders take center stage. Their context shapes the design; thus, it is crucial to meet them where they are. 

Although social innovation methods were utilized during workshops and engagements with stakeholders, there was need to significantly recalibrate or revamp these methods to properly suit the local context. 

It is important to recognize that stakeholders, especially those from government, already have existing mechanisms and mandates. Introducing innovative solutions should take into account. 

While the portfolio serves as the starting point to tackle multiple but equally vital components, it is the stakeholders on the ground who actually move the pieces and enable a space for continuous and collective learning to take place.   

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our work has not yet scaled
- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

 Our work has potential to be presented as a test case for additional investment and for potential expansion. 

The Municipal Government of Malay enacted Executive Order No. 13, Series of 2023 to formally institutionalize the Multi-Stakeholder Group (MSG) for the Malay Food Systems Innovation initiative, with sub-committees on production, linkages, promotion, and research and development. They have also onboarded the MSG Secretariat and dedicated staff to coordinate across the different sub-committees' respective activities. This includes supporting cross-cutting tasks such as monitoring of developments within various components of the portfolio , while facilitating linkages between each. Under the guidance of the MSG platform and in collaboration with UNDP ALab PH, a series of workshops were conducted to formulate the initiative's Theory of Change, success indicators, and monitoring mechanisms alongside the moonshot goal of capturing a portion of Boracay’s demand for the Malay food producers. 

As stakeholders move towards project stewardship, the Municipal Government of Malay has expressed the need for support in project implementation through capacity development, resource mobilization opportunities, and facilitation of stakeholder engagement, among others. The strategies underway to scale up the initiative include engaging bigger markets such as hotels and restaurants to match market demand with the local smallholder farmers’ supply, as well as recruiting more farmers and formalizing them into a cooperative moving forward. Preparations are also being undertaken to conduct a food demand survey and update the local investments and incentive code to attract the private sector’s participation as a market for the farmers’ produce. UNDP ALab PH complemented these with a private sector dialogue to explore different collaboration entry points towards designing financing models that can attract impact investments for sustainable development in Malay.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

One of the challenges encountered is the lack of granular quantitative data specific to the locality. Thus, the initiative maximized the use of qualitative data and methods. These were collected through formal (e.g. workshops, structured interviews, etc.) and informal means (e.g., community exploration). 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Meeting the stakeholders where they are also meant that interactions with stakeholders and the community itself would be source of data and insights. Recognizing that stakeholders already have existing mandates and that there are several existing planning and policymaking councils at the local government level, it is important for stakeholders themselves to define and implement a successful innovation project.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

While the portfolio serves as the starting point to tackle multiple but equally vital components, it is the stakeholders on the ground who actually move the pieces and enable a space for continuous and collective learning to take place. The Municipal Government of Malay, through its established MSG, stewards the project and opens itself to collaborations, and alongside, UNDP Accelerator Lab provides complementary and technical support.

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.

NOTE TO TEAM: For some reason, when I input FUTURE ANALYSIS in the data portion, it includes a long paragraph. Should only be "FUTURE ANALYSIS". Thank you.
