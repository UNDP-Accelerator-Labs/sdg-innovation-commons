> Description of the solution

A monitoring system of the regional agricultural territory of Piemonte utilizing a net of meteorological stations that gather and store the climate history of the territory of over 10-15 years. Over the course of the years, this system has become integral to support the productive processes, currently using 120 stations (63 government-owned). Data is collected into databases through GPSs or GPRSs, and it can be consulted on the website for free (only for up to 30 days prior).
