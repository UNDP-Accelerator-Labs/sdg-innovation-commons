Corporate Governance and Sustainable Economic Recovery
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our Challenge is how to increase the contribution of our local business community and the national private sector in general, characterized by a high incidence of micro, small and medium-sized companies, to sustainable development in this context of post-COVID-19 economic recovery.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the weaknesses of the Cape Verdean economy based on the services sector at around 61.2% of GDP and with a strong dependence on tourism. With the reduction in tourist demand by 75%, the country faced in 2020 a recession of 14.8% of GDP, the second highest in sub-Saharan Africa, with significant losses in tax revenues, increased unemployment and increased poverty and inequalities.

Recognized as an engine of economic growth and a major investor and employer, the private sector is expected to be a leader in creating wealth for sustainable development, but many challenges affect its development capacity. Structural factors including market size, periphery, limited resource base, high context costs, exposure to climate risks and natural disasters impact socio-economic outcomes and their ability to achieve the SDGs.

The Government, after focusing its efforts on controlling the pandemic and mitigating its impacts with the adoption of an economic and social stabilization program, it recently approved an Economic Recovery Plan that defines exit strategies from the exceptional measures to enter a new recovery cycle and acceleration of the economy with a focus on the resilience and diversification of the economy, energy transition, acceleration of the digital economy and innovation and development of human capital, in parallel with the acceleration of reforms to improve competitiveness of the overall economy. 

On the other hand, one of the most significant weaknesses that hinders the development of local businesses and their access to credit and investment in Cape Verde is the economic and financial information prepared and made available by companies, which makes decision-making difficult at various levels, not only for those responsible of these companies, but also to other stakeholders, including financing entities, investors and partners, who are often faced with insufficient information for project evaluation, investment decisions or credit granting, especially MSMEs.

The Government has the challenge of improving business environment to increase private sector investments, with a favorable regulatory framework and a stable macroeconomic context that facilitates the mobilization of other development actors. Companies have the challenge of creating a culture of good governance, accountability, and social and environmental responsibility towards sustainable development.

The national private sector is characterized by a high incidence of micro, small and medium-sized companies. According to National Statistics Institute, in 2020, Cape Verde had 11,115 active and formal companies in the country, 0.5% less when compared to the previous year, which is explained by the effects of COVID 2019 and the consequent drop in GDP. Micro, small and medium-sized companies accounted for 97.6% of the national business ecosystem, that is, around 75% of companies are micro companies, 9.9% are small companies, 13.1% are medium-sized companies and only 2.4% are large companies. Companies with organized accounting accounted for 37.2% of active companies, employed 74% of the staff at the service in private sector, and these grew by 6.5%. On the other hand, about 4.3% of companies without organized accounting disappeared. The former also outperform in terms of turnover.

In 2020, around 175,8447 people were living in absolute poverty, equivalent to 31.7% of the population, equally distributed by both sexes. The incidence of absolute poverty dropped from 35.2% in 2015 to 26.0% in 2019, but the pandemic crisis changed this scenario, increasing poverty levels and further aggravating inequalities. The crisis has reversed progress in poverty reduction achieved since 2015, putting nearly 100,000 people in temporary poverty. The majority (56.4%) of the poor population lives in urban areas, but poverty has a higher incidence in rural areas where 44.9% of the population is poor (compared to about 25.8% of that in urban areas).

In the labor market, around 14.5% of the active population is unemployed, slightly higher among men (14.8%) than among women (14.2%). Unemployment affects around 32.5% of the active young population. Of the approximately 412,000 people aged 15 or over in Cape Verde (about 74% of the population), only about 218,000 (or 53%) constitute the active population. 186,600 are employed, and of these 52% are in informal employment. Inactivity, informality and underemployment predominate and, although the private sector is the main employer (with around 41.0% of employment), the activities that employ the most generate mainly informal employment, thus exposing workers and their respective families to poverty.

The government's economic recovery plan directed to the national private sector with 4 basic guidelines: (1) Restoring the activity of companies affected by the pandemic and accelerating the transition from the informal to the formal economy; (2) Broadening the range of financial and non-financial instruments to promote private sector investment and employment; (3) Commitment to sustainable growth, reducing vulnerabilities to external shocks and strengthening economic resilience, by diversifying and transforming the economy through innovation and digital entrepreneurship; (4) Creation of an institutional framework for dialogue with several stakeholders in the private sector ecosystem, for articulation and monitoring of business promotion policies.

Program to improve national business environment to increase private sector investment with a favorable regulatory framework and a stable macroeconomic context that facilitates the mobilization of development actors and the coordination of initiatives to support entrepreneurship, that eliminates barriers to investment and that accelerates job creation, particularly for young people and women.

In Cape Verde, the approach to ESG (Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance) is almost non-existent. That is public, only part of commercial banks shares corporate governance reports, which is an obligation imposed by the new law for Commercial Companies (2019). National companies do not usually publish their annual reports and accounts. Only energy distribution companies present some type of information regarding their governance model, with a similar situation in the State Companies sector. Recently, the European Union published a new directive, designated as CSRD – Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, in which one of the main objectives of reporting obligations is to place ESG information on a strict equal level with financial information (including in terms of certification/ audit).

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The concept can evolve over time to cover all companies and sectors, and this objective can be achieved in 3 to 5 years. Over time, depending on the evolution of the participating companies, categories may be created, which will also highlight sectors of activity. In the future, companies from the State Business Sector may also be covered. A database with sectorial information can be built, for example, by creating a Sectorial Average Balance Sheet. From here, benchmarks, diagnostics and SWOT analysis can be created.
