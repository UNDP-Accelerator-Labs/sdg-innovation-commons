> Title of the innovation

Young children walking to school

> Brief description of the innovation

I see a lot of young children walking back and forth going to school and quite alright for some it's near but for others it's far and especially in the morning that's when I most feel bad because it's a rush hour time and accidents can happen

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It doesn't really have income for me but I know it will help the environment

Those who walk and reach late if have a provided transport will reach school on time and there less chances of the young ending up in wrong places after school
