Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Foreword

3

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a once-in-a-generation global swell of
home-grown ingenuity. Communities are adapting, improvising, and looking
beyond this unparalleled socio-economic challenge. Their responses have
included everything from a foot-operated handwashing machine invented
by a nine-year old boy in Kenya, to using the power of crowdsourcing to
rapidly produce 3D-printed Personal Protective Equipment, to tracking the
spread of the virus via a mobile app in Cabo Verde. The challenge now is how
to sustain and scale-up this unprecedented innovation surge to accelerate
progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Part of the solution
lies in harnessing the intelligence distributed across local communities and
organisations. That will help us to better understand complex problems
and unlock new solutions to immense global challenges – from tackling our
climate emergency to boosting the protection and restoration of our planet’s
precious ecosystems and biodiversity.

This collective intelligence approach is founded upon the principle that an
enhanced capacity to solve problems is created when people work together
through the mobilization of a wider range of data, ideas, and insights.
And advances in technology and data science hold the potential to tap into
collective intelligence on a larger scale than ever before. In this rapidly
evolving field, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has
teamed-up with Nesta’s Centre for Collective Intelligence Design to generate
a clearer vision of how collective intelligence approaches can speed up
progress on the SDGs. To this end, this new publication series, Collective
Intelligence for Sustainable Development: Getting Smarter Together analyses and
compares the methods and tools employed by over 200 private and public
sector organizations in this discipline. Collective intelligence is a core method
employed by the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network – the world’s largest and
fastest learning network on sustainable development challenges, which now
serves 115 countries. That includes, for instance, utilising real-time data
sources and ethnography to gain new insights into the first-hand experiences
of women and men who live on the frontlines of climate change. The
accompanying report, 13 Stories from the UNDP Accelerator Labs details more
of these pioneering approaches deployed by the Labs – from using big data
to improve waste management in Lao PDR, to combining multiple datasets
to tackle gender-based violence in Mexico.

The hands-on experience of the United Nations in every corner of the world
since the COVID-19 pandemic hit has acutely demonstrated how local
communities possess the bright ideas and capacity to tackle both local and
global, existential challenges. We now need to fully harness the knowledge
of the almost eight billion people on the planet – and disseminate their often-
surprising solutions and innovative approaches. The Collective Intelligence
for Sustainable Development series is more than a mere signpost on our
path to building the future of development. It serves both as an invitation
and a practical guide for local, national, and international development
practitioners to make increased use of real-time knowledge creation,
collective action and evidence-driven decision making. And ultimately,
collective intelligence will serve as a vital tool to help shape a greener, more
inclusive, and more sustainable planet.

Executive
summary

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

This report sets out how governments and
the many organizations involved in global
development are increasingly mobilizing not
just money, but also intelligence to speed up
progress towards the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs).

From citizen insights to innovative grassroots solutions, mobile
phone companies’ data to satellite imagery and AI – new resources
of intelligence are being harnessed by organizations around the
world to understand complex problems, make better decisions
and find new solutions.

We bring together this diverse set of practices under the label
of collective intelligence. At its simplest, collective intelligence
can be understood as the enhanced capacity that is created
when people work together, often with the help of technology,
to mobilize a wider range of information, ideas and insights.
Some of the methods employed are old. But many are new and
require new skills and mindsets to make the most of them.

This analysis is the first attempt to map and understand how
collective intelligence approaches are being used to address the
Sustainable Development Goals. It documents many examples,
and captures patterns in their application and impact.

From our research we find that there are six key clusters of
‘use cases’ – practical ways in which people are using collective
intelligence approaches for development.

We discovered 15 methods that are being used most frequently,
and often in combination. These range from crowdsourcing to
web scraping and remote sensing (see p.16 for the full list),
and we found that AI is also increasingly being used in parallel,
mainly to increase the speed and efficiency of data processing
at scale (see p.28).

What these collective intelligence methods have in common is
the use of technology to mobilize, make sense of, or augment the
observations, insights and ideas of large numbers of people.

The majority of the case studies we analyzed align most closely
with targets related to SDGs 10-16 towards equity, sustainable
cities, climate action and responsible governance, but we found
examples cutting across all aspects of Agenda 2030.

Collective
intelligence and
the SDGs:
six ‘use cases’

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

1. New forms of accountability

and governance

In this use case methods such as eyewitness video
and crowdmapping are being used to document
violence or human rights abuses, with a view to holding
perpetrators to account. This use case also sees how
governments are crowdsourcing ideas and opinions
from citizens during policy making, and how citizens
are generating new forms of data to monitor policy
implementation.
SDGs: 16

2. Anticipating, monitoring and
adapting to systemic risks

A wide range of collective intelligence methods are
helping organizations to improve their capacity for early
warning and monitoring of, and response to, natural
disasters, conflict and epidemics. These include working
with on-the-ground volunteers to provide data about
emerging issues, or with crowdmappers to capture
location information for crisis preparedness. Others
combine datasets, including web scraped social media
data, for real-time public health surveillance, or ask large
groups of people to forecast geopolitical events.
SDGs: 5, 13, 16

3. Real-time monitoring of

the environment

Collective intelligence methods like citizen science and
in-situ or remote sensing methods (such as satellites)
have been gaining traction as complements to existing
ways of monitoring the state of environments – from air
quality to deforestation.1 Web scraping social media and
citizen reporting tools are also being used to generate
information on environmental hazards from people in
affected areas. This use case has the potential to fill data
gaps in environmental monitoring.
SDGs: 11, 14, 15

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

4. Understanding and working

with complex systems

Collective intelligence approaches that combine multiple
data sources are helping policy makers and development
organizations to visualize the dynamics of complex
systems and uncover insights that have previously been
hidden. City leaders are also increasingly turning to
crowdsourcing ideas and opinions of their constituents
to understand the different needs or experiences of
diverse or changing populations.
SDGs: 10, 11, 12

5. Inclusive development

and technologies

The SDGs’ promise to ‘leave no one behind’ brings with
it an imperative to involve marginalized communities in
development initiatives. Collective intelligence methods
like crowdmapping, citizen reporting and mobile phone
surveys can be used to engage people whose voices
are often not counted. Crowdsourcing data from under-
represented groups to train machine learning models is
another growing trend that is important for developing
fairer artificial intelligence (AI) systems.
SDGs: 5, 10

6. Distributed problem solving

To tap into people’s problem solving capabilities,
organizations are: crowdsourcing solutions; convening
peer-to-peer crowdsourcing of knowledge and
experience; using open source repositories to share
solutions for others to adapt and use; and crowd labeling
data to train machine learning models. These collective
intelligence methods have broad application across the
majority of the SDGs, but become especially relevant for
targets such as climate action, where there might be a
lack of established solutions and practices, or when new
and locally-appropriate solutions are in high demand.
SDGs: 2, 3, 13

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Considerations of ethics and
personal privacy must be
taken seriously in the design of
collective intelligence projects.
Collective intelligence depends
on the trust and goodwill of
participants. Organizations
must prioritize people and
purpose over technology – and
ensure their projects promote
data empowerment, not data
extraction.

Funders should support AI
and collective intelligence
experimentation testbeds in
real-world settings. Many have
been slow to appreciate the
vital importance of linking AI to
collective human intelligence. But
there is great scope to combine
them together and in many
fields AI risks being ineffective
if it’s not integrated with human
intelligence. A related priority
should be to build up centers of
expertise, particularly in sub-
Saharan Africa, to counter the
concentration of data and AI
expertise in mainly US firms.

Create a stronger evidence base
around impact and support
collaborative experimentation
in a greater number of
communities. The field will
also develop faster with greater
support for innovators to share
information and knowledge.

Orchestrating and scaling collective
intelligence for the SDGs

As we embark on a ‘decade of action’ for
Agenda 2030, most would agree that to
achieve the global goals and avert climate
catastrophe the world will need to mobilize
power and money as never before.2 But to
use power and money well it will also be
vital that governments, organizations, and
communities become skilled in mobilizing
intelligence of all kinds – data, information
and ideas.

The big challenge for the next few years
will be to orchestrate collective intelligence
more strategically or at scale. We suggest the
following priorities:

Help governments make better
use of collective intelligence.
Local communities are collecting
and sharing data on an
unprecedented scale, while civil
society organizations and social
movements are doing pioneering
work. Yet many governments are
unfamiliar with the new sources
of data available.

Make open source the default.
Open source software and
data such as OpenStreetMap,
Ushahidi, Consul, Landsat
and Sentinel have accelerated
distributed experimentation with
collective intelligence by a wide
range of organizations. These
open infrastructures are critical
for collective intelligence and
are increasingly underpinning
effective action on the SDGs.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Realizing the potential of collective
intelligence for the SDGs will be a collective
task, but will build on work that is already
underway. This report sets out some key roles
that existing institutions could play.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) could help to establish the protocols
and standards that will be needed to underpin the shared
data and knowledge infrastructures that will allow collective
intelligence to be orchestrated more strategically.

The development banks could make it standard for any
investment plan to include a complementary strand on the
organization of intelligence – including the orchestration of
data, science and evidence, as well as grassroots insights and
wisdom.

Universities could help build the skills and experience that
graduates will need to work in a collectively intelligent way.
Many are now using the ‘challenge based’ model where,
alongside their degree, students work on practical problem
solving in teams that draw on multiple disciplines as well as
insights outside of higher education.

Development partners could help grow civil society’s
capacity to mobilize collective intelligence – supporting the
skills needed, as well as speeding up the development of new
methods and tools.

The private sector should make it easier for development
organizations and innovators to access data and cloud
services for SDG-related work.

The key strategic challenge for the UN is how to better
orchestrate a broad range of intelligence relevant to the
SDGs – from science and data, to public policy evidence and
emerging findings from experiments – to help innovators on
the ground work more effectively.

A call to action

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Who is this report for?

The report is aimed at senior officials within national
governments, international agencies and development
organizations who understand the urgency for action and
want to tap into distributed collective intelligence as part
of national strategies towards the SDGs. We also hope this
report will provide a source of inspiration for innovators
within broader development and research communities.

Methodology

This study was carried out from September 2020 to
January 2021. Over 277 case studies covering a wide
range of collective intelligence methods were mapped
and categorized by most relevant SDG. Case studies
were drawn from Nesta’s existing repositories and
publications of collective intelligence case studies, as
well as a rapid review of the academic and grey literature
on the SDGs and related fields, such as citizen science
and digital democracy. Case studies from UNDP Accelerator
Labs were identified using a combination of online
search and semi-structured interviews carried out by a
Nesta researcher.

During our analysis we identified use cases, where we
inferred a common purpose amongst case studies –
particularly looking for use cases that were relevant to
multiple SDGs. For each use case we assigned a number of
SDG targets. These were identified by retrospective analysis
of the focus of the case studies against the SDG targets.

Although few of the case studies explicitly documented links
to a specific SDG target or goal, this retrospective analysis
helps to illustrate how collective intelligence methods could
be used more intentionally for the SDGs in the future.
The limitations of our approach mean that the targets listed
are unlikely to be the only ones that could benefit from
the application of collective intelligence methods. They are,
however, the ones where we found the clearest association –
and may offer the quickest wins for funders, practitioners
and governments.

Introduction

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

When the United Nations High Commissioner

for Refugees (UNHCR) set out to develop a

predictive model to anticipate the movements

of displaced people into border refugee

camps, they faced a difficult challenge.

Understanding which data might be relevant

for a complex issue like migration can be

like looking for a needle in a haystack. It

turned out that goats were the answer. This

answer came not from abstract theory but

rather from conversations with refugees.

When Somali refugees prepare to leave

the country, they sell their goats. Goats

are delicate and struggle to make the long

journeys characteristic of forced migration,

and so refugees have no choice but to sell

them. This simple insight inspired the UNHCR

to include market fluctuations of goat prices

as a parameter in their model, helping them

to better anticipate future refugee crises and

allocate humanitarian resources where most
needed.3

This is one of hundreds of examples of a new

mindset in development circles: seeking out

intelligence of all kinds, and then making it

useful. Many of these examples make full use

of advanced technologies. But they also make

full use of human experience and insight. This

is what we mean by collective intelligence.

Building blocks
of 21st century
collective
intelligence

By bringing together
diverse groups of people,
data and technology, we
can create a collective
intelligence that is greater
than the individual parts
in isolation.

At its simplest, collective
intelligence can be understood
as the enhanced capacity that
is created when people work
together, often with the help
of technology, to mobilize a
wider range of information,
ideas and insights. Collective
intelligence emerges when these
contributions are combined to
become more than the sum of
their parts.

Over centuries, every society has relied on
collective intelligence – sharing knowledge,
culture and tools to better manage crops,
combat diseases, anticipate weather
patterns and much more.

Since the start of the digital age, however,
collective intelligence has really evolved.
There are now thousands of digital tools
helping us to pool ideas in entirely new ways,
and connect people across huge distances.
In the 19th century, it took almost 70 years
to crowdsource the 400,000 words that made
up the complete first edition of the Oxford
English Dictionary. A modern-day equivalent,
the English Wikipedia, receives more than
1.9 edits per second and sees about 200,000
new pages created per month.4

Digital technologies are also enabling us
to generate new sources of data. We can
use satellite imagery or mobile phone data,
for example, to create new intelligence on
our world and societies. Many of these new
data sources are generated through the
‘digital exhaust fumes’ of human activity,
or through the active contribution of
volunteers. Most of this new data is made
useful by the legions of women and men
helping to label the datasets that are used
to train machine models, and the efforts of
people to interpret their meaning.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI)
is being applied in combination with
collective intelligence methods – to
augment and optimise the mobilisation of
human intelligence. This is mainly through
algorithms that increase the speed and
efficiency of data processing at scale. But
there are other emerging uses of AI, such
as modelling and visualization, to push the
boundaries of how groups work together to
understand complex problems such as rapid
urbanisation and the localised impacts of
climate change.

Combining the capabilities of people,
data and digital technologies for solving
problems is the next frontier of 21st century
problem solving.

How this is done, however, matters as
much as what is done. To use collective
intelligence well means being informed by
its fundamental key principles (see Figure 2).5
This includes a recognition of the need to
draw on diverse views and perspectives
to come to better decisions, and the need

to be mindful of biases and power relations.
It also means acknowledging the importance
of data empowerment – enabling people to
use data to advocate for their rights, take
collective action or hold governments to
account. As a practice, collective intelligence
is informed by many of the same values
that have driven the use of participatory
decision making and action research
involving local communities in development
since the Participatory Learning and Action
approaches of the 1990s. It is critical to hold
on to these foundations even as technology
and new data sources change the way
collective intelligence is deployed.

Collective intelligence employs a wide
range of different methods. These range
from deliberation to crowdsourcing and
web scraping (see p.16). Although some of
these methods remain relatively new to the
world of development, their use has been
slowly increasing alongside more traditional
forms of intelligence (from official data to
ethnographic research).

Why does Sustainable
Development need
collective intelligence?

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Converging crises and
increasing uncertainty

Today, the world faces converging crises
and rising uncertainty.6 The COVID-19
pandemic has sent shockwaves around
the world, precipitating an economic crisis
and potentially the worst global recession
in eight decades.7 Meanwhile, risks posed
by the looming climate and environmental
emergency continue to grow.8

Progress is too slow,
and being reversed

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, global
progress towards the SDGs had stalled and,
in some cases, reversed.9 The most recent
High-level Political Forum put it bluntly
saying ‘acceleration is needed in many
areas.’10 The UN now estimates that the
pandemic will turn back the clock on decades
of progress, pushing 71 million people into
extreme poverty in 2020.11

Growing complexity
of challenges

The impact of automation and rapid
urbanization are just some of the complex
issues development policy makers are
grappling with for which no ‘best practice’
solutions exist and views are divided.12

Persistent data gaps

Development policy makers still struggle
to access useful data to inform decision
making. A 2018 UN survey, for example,
found that in Africa and Asia, on average,
data for only 20 per cent of SDG indicators
was available. This gap is likely to widen as
a result of COVID-19, with 97 per cent of
national statistics offices in sub-Saharan
Africa struggling to fulfil international
reporting requirements during the
pandemic.13 Traditional data collection
methods also often fail to keep up with
change – for example, not capturing
recent aspects of urban poverty.14 And
the continued lack of data disaggregated
by gender means that many of the issues
women face go uncounted, undermining
the promise to ‘leave no one behind’.15

Recognition of the need
for new approaches
to development

This combination of increasing complexity
and lagging progress means that the
approaches that have characterized much
development practice (i.e. top-down and
rigidly focused on narrowly-defined goals)
may be particularly unsuitable.16 The OECD
also suggests that rather than following a
singular paradigm or pathway, development
strategies need to be more context-specific,
and more participatory, place-based,
multisectoral and multilateral – with more
focus on experimentation and mutual
learning. It also calls for a rethinking of
international cooperation beyond financial
aid to foster more effective exchanges of
social and human capital.17

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Collective intelligence
can help

The starting point for collective intelligence
for the SDGs is simple: what are the
resources of intelligence that can be brought
together and shared? These resources will
range from localized insights and inventions
from people on the ground, to data of
all kinds (whether gathered by satellites
or mobile phone companies), to scientific
knowledge and evidence.

Collective intelligence can accelerate
progress by tapping into the
collective brainpower of citizens,
drawing on a wider network of
innovators, or seeking and sharing
tested solutions from elsewhere.
By opening up timely and relevant
information for citizens to use,
collective intelligence approaches can
also increase people’s ability to make
decisions and power to act – enabling
citizens to participate in tackling
social problems.

Collective intelligence approaches
can help in complex or uncertain
situations where there is
disagreement about how to proceed,
where the way forward is unclear,
or when the nature of the problem
is contested. Collective intelligence
methods can bring together many
diverse views and perspectives, not
just those of the vocal minority or
the usual experts who may be too
narrowly focused. They can help
stakeholders, experts and affected
communities come to greater
agreement on priorities for action
and make more inclusive decisions.

Collective intelligence approaches
can help us tap into new sources of
data and insight to fill SDG data gaps
and understand emerging problems
more quickly. Being able to mobilize
granular data rapidly (from sensors
to citizen-generated data) can help
generate more comprehensive and
up-to-date insights. Bringing together
different types of insight can also
help reveal new dynamics in complex
systems. This is the starting point for
developing more effective responses.
And by involving marginalized
communities in generating, analyzing
and using data, collective intelligence
offers opportunities to stop replicating
existing prejudices and inequalities.

How is collective
intelligence
being used
for the SDGs?

Collective intelligence is already being

mobilized by organizations around

the world to address the SDGs. In our

rapid review of the academic literature

and case studies, we found practical

examples of collective intelligence

relating to all 17 SDGs.

Six use cases for collective

intelligence for the SDGs

From the analysis of case studies, we

see a clustering of current practice

around six key use cases relating to just

under half of the SDGs – with particular

emphasis on goals 10-16.

These use cases describe the different

ways in which people use collective

intelligence methods to try to achieve

a particular result or create new value

for a community or organization.

Informing each of these use cases is

a diverse range of practical case studies

from around the world, which share

either explicitly-stated or implicitly-

inferred goals.

15 collective
intelligence
methods
commonly used
for the SDGs

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Each use case illustrates how different
collective intelligence methods, sometimes
used in combination, are deployed to achieve a
particular goal. A striking finding of this analysis
is the flexibility that this toolbox offers to achieve
different ends.

Our analysis found these 15 methods are
currently being used most frequently for
SDG-related activity, which we which we
describe below.18

Citizen-generated data

Citizen-generated data is a broad category that includes any
information that can be collected from people either by active
involvement (e.g. videos, reports, ideas – usually using digital
platforms) or passively (e.g. transactions data, call detail records,
wearables).

Citizen science

Citizen science is any process where scientists and (usually
unpaid) volunteers work together to collect or process scientific
data or observations. Citizen science unlocks new resources for
research, experimentation and analysis by opening the process to
anyone.

Combining data sources

Collective intelligence depends on the trust and goodwill of
participants. Organizations must prioritize people and purpose
over technology – and ensure their projects promote data
empowerment, not data extraction.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Computer vision

The ability of a computer to understand, analyze or generate
images and/or videos. Frequently used to help classify drone or
satellite images or user-generated images.

Crowd forecasting

Crowd forecasting is a method that asks small or large groups
to make predictions about the future. Individual predictions are
aggregated using statistics into a consensus crowd forecast. It’s
inspired by research which showed that small crowds of non-
experts can often forecast political events more successfully than
individual experts.

Crowdmapping

Crowdmapping is a type of crowdsourcing which gathers data
from different sources (including social media, text messages or
geographic data) to provide real-time, interactive information
about issues on the ground. Crowdmapping can create detailed
almost real-time data in a way that a top-down, centrally-curated
map may struggle to replicate.

Crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing is an umbrella term for a variety of approaches
that source data, information, opinions or ideas from large
crowds of people, often by issuing open calls for contribution.
It can help bring new ideas to light that hadn’t previously been
considered, or to gather expertise from people who have
specialized knowledge or understanding of an issue.

17

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Microsurveys

Microsurveys are a short, abbreviated form of surveying which
typically take the respondent only a few minutes to complete.
Microsurveys are often delivered by mobile phone, text message
or a digital platform. Benefits include a much faster turnaround,
and higher frequency of results, compared to traditional surveys.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP allows computers to understand, interpret and extract key
information from human language. NLP techniques can be used
to carry out automated analysis of user-generated text from
sources like social media, to better understand what issues
matter to people, translate languages or simulate language.

Open data

Open data is the raw data that is gathered by people or
organizations and published in an electronic format that
machines can read. It’s then shared online and allowed to be re-
used by others instead of keeping it private.

Open source repository

An open source repository is a digital repository where content
(e.g. code, text or DIY designs) can be stored and freely
downloaded with few restrictions on use. Many open source
repositories aid collaboration by providing a space for uploading
documentation, monitoring and version control.

18

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Peer-to-peer exchange

Peer-to-peer exchange refers to the process of sharing
information horizontally to build and maintain a community, to
collect data, connect people or send alerts. Platforms for this
vary, ranging from messaging platforms to online forums or
collaborative platforms. Some rely on the internet but others do
not (e.g. SMS or mesh networks).

Predictive analytics

Predictive analytics encompasses a variety of statistical
techniques that enable a computer to analyze structured data
using numeric and machine-readable data. It typically relies on
algorithms from classical machine learning. It can be used to
make predictions about the future or otherwise unknown events.

Remote or in-situ sensing

Collecting information from satellites or physical sensors
recording actions and physical changes (e.g. traffic cameras,
weather sensors, ambient sensors, wearables or drones). This
data can provide cheap, real-time measurements of anything
from pollution to crop yields.

Web scraping

Web scraping is a method for extracting unstructured data from
across the web, such as company websites or social media. Where
official datasets are costly to gather and infrequently updated,
web scraping can provide more timely insights into social or
economic trends.

Eyewitness video for collective
witnessing of violence and
human rights abuses

Collective witnessing of human rights
abuses on social media using mobile
phone footage is helping to galvanize
and empower social movements around
the world. From the Black Lives Matter
movement in the US, to the residents
of Brazil’s favelas20 and the #EndSARS
campaign in Nigeria,21 2020 has seen
citizens using video evidence to expose
police brutality and force political leaders
into action. Taken together, this footage is
helping researchers and lawyers to identify
patterns of violence, or create a fuller
picture of an incident based on multiple
perspectives. The development of apps like
Tella,22 databases like the Digital Evidence
Vault,23 and the work of organizations like
Witness24 are now helping activists around
the world create timestamped, verifiable
footage with more concrete value for
exposure in the media and, ultimately, as
evidence for legal accountability.

Crowdmapping and/or citizen
reporting of incidents of
violence by citizens

Citizen reporting of violence is continuously
being harnessed through geographic
information system (GIS) mapping tools,
which capture, store and display data
linked to a physical location. The resulting
maps help organizations and people to
more easily see, analyze, and understand
patterns and relationships.25

21

Ushahidi26 is one of the earliest and most
prominent examples of crowdsourcing
geographic data to create maps – a method
known as ‘crowdmapping’. It has had more
than 150,000 deployments, capturing data
via text, email, Twitter, phone app, RSS
feed and custom surveys from millions of
volunteers in 160 countries.27 One of the
organizations using the Ushahidi platform
is the Ceasefire Centre for Civilian Rights,28
which mobilizes communities to map
human rights violations across Iran, Iraq
and Syria – providing an up-to-date and
alternative picture of the current situation
from those on the ground.

Crowdsourcing ideas and
opinions from citizens during
policy making

Around the world there are a growing
number of municipal authorities and
national governments harnessing collective
intelligence tools to promote more inclusive
and participatory decision making. The
most effective approaches combine offline
public engagement with digital platforms

to crowdsource information about problems,
generate ideas for new solutions (often with a
prize as an incentive), or provide opinions on
new proposals.29, 30

A well-known example is vTaiwan – a four
stage online and offline process in which the
Taiwanese government and citizens work
together to collaborate on new legislation. It
uses a tool called Polis to help map opinions
and find areas of consensus. It has been used
for 26 pieces of legislation so far.

Brazil’s e-Democracia portal,31 is another well-
established digital democracy platform, set up
in 2009 by the lower house in Brazil’s National
Congress. It has been used to encourage
public participation on a wide number of draft
bills. Its greatest successes to date include the
Youth Statute Bill, which crowdsourced 30 per
cent of its final text from young people across
the country, and the Internet Civil Rights Bill
which received 374 individual contributions
on the Wikilegis platform – many of which
were adopted into the final bill.32

In the last decade, there has also been more
experimentation by government policy
makers with deliberative democracy methods,
most notably the citizen’s jury/panel. This is
where a small but representative sample of
the population meets, usually face-to-face,
to provide its opinions or recommendations
on specific policy questions. To date, these
initiatives have been largely confined to OECD
countries.33

22

Citizen-generated
data for monitoring the
implementation of
policy and programs

Involving citizens in monitoring the
implementation and outcomes of policy or
legislation is relatively rare, but there are
notable examples.34 Citizen-generated data
(often using GIS systems) to provide ‘ground
truthed’ evidence is key to these initiatives.

The ¿Qué pasa, Riachuelo? is an online
platform supported by Datashift, that
includes an interactive georeferenced map
of all public information about the clean-
up process run by the Matanza-Riachuelo
River Basin Authority. It’s a social monitoring
tool, allowing citizens and NGOs to follow
the execution of the legally mandated
clean-up plan and report breaches or
problems. Although the project succeeded
in encouraging the authority to publish its
data in a more timely and open way, it has
been largely defunct since funding ended.35

A significant limitation for many monitoring
projects is the lack of connection to
legislative authorities or those with the
power to use that knowledge to adapt or
course-correct if needed.

A collaboration between Ground Truth
Initiative, the World Bank and Map Kibera
Trust is a rare example that does. They
developed a digital platform to enable
citizens to map and gather feedback on
projects funded through participatory
budgeting processes. Projects included
everything from new hospital wings to
small dams and classrooms. The mapping
process made it easier to track progress on
the projects and to know where they were
located so that funding could be allocated
most effectively the following year.36

Citizen science to gather new

One benefit of working with distributed
networks of citizens to gather data through
methods like citizen science, is that they can
help to create much needed data about new
and emerging issues. Citizen science can also
be good for encouraging mass participation
and building awareness of an issue.

MetaSUB is a global project to build
microbial portraits of urban transit
systems. A network of volunteers and
scientists takes swabs from trains and
escalators. They identify the pathogens
they find and any markers of antibiotic
resistance.37 The microbial surveillance
carried out by the MetaSUB community
in over 100 cities helped add to research
which found that the longer COVID-19 was
on a surface the less likely it was to make
someone sick. Increasingly AI is being used
to find patterns amongst the mountains of
data generated by this project. In the future,

Another project that harnesses citizen
scientists for disease surveillance is
Mosquito Alert –an app where volunteers
notify scientists of the presence of
mosquitoes, or their breeding sites, by
uploading photos and location information.
Data is validated by scientists and then
published on a publicly-available map. As
well as helping scientists, the data is used
by public health managers from a variety
of Spanish cities to monitor and control
mosquito populations. As of December
2020, the app had over 96,000 registered
citizen scientists taking part in the project.39
And over 13 per cent of the one billion
observations contained in the Global
Biodiversity Information Facility are from
citizen science data generated through
Mosquito Alert’s app.40

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Combining web scraped
and/or existing datasets
for real-time surveillance
of public health threats

Collective intelligence methods like web
scraping and combining different data
sources are making it easier to monitor
public health threats in real-time. The
COVID-19 crisis has seen these methods
applied to the creation of a number of
dashboards, interactive maps and visuals
that track the virus’ spread and its impact.41
The tracker developed by John Hopkins
University has become the primary source
of information for journalists and people
around the world to monitor the spread of
the virus.42

An example predating the COVID-19
pandemic is HealthMap, established in
2008, which utilizes online information for
disease outbreak monitoring and real-time
surveillance of emerging public health
threats. An automated process brings
together disparate data including online
news, eyewitness reports and official reports
to monitor, visualize and disseminate online
information about emerging diseases in
nine languages. Its data is used by the
World Health Organization, the US’ Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, and the
European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control, among others. But unlike
other systems that target only public health
officials, it also has an app that is geared
towards citizens, allowing them to see
outbreaks in their neighborhood.43

Increasingly, however, collective intelligence
initiatives are moving beyond monitoring
epidemics to trying to predict them using
machine learning models. AIME (Artificial
Intelligence in Medical Epidemiology)
is an AI platform to predict mosquito-
borne disease outbreaks. During tests
of its dengue prediction system, it was

25

successful in predicting the next outbreak
of dengue fever up to three months in
advance. To do this, the platform combines
real-time data generated by doctors, who
send in notifications of dengue cases,
with existing datasets of variables that
influence the spread of dengue — from
local terrain and elevation to roofing types
and thunderstorms. From these, the system
then predicts where the next outbreaks will
be within a 400-metre radius, and with 81
per cent accuracy.44 The platform is now
used in Malaysia, Brazil and the Philippines
to help healthcare providers manage and
curb outbreaks.45

Combining web scraped
and/or citizen-generated data
to inform crisis response

The same web scraping methods used for
disease surveillance are also being used
to provide humanitarian agencies and
emergency responders with faster and
more relevant information in the immediate
aftermath of a crisis. Combining existing
datasets with locally-generated contextual
information from citizens helps those
planning emergency responses.

MIND (Managing Information for Natural
Disasters) is a tool developed by UN Global
Pulse to better inform humanitarian
response planning and logistics after natural
disasters.46 It’s built on an automated
data pipeline that analyzes several non-
traditional datasets all in one place. The
tool combines information from Twitter
and Google searches in the affected areas,
as well as information from Wikipedia and
OpenStreetMap about the location, casualty
reports from news sources, and data from
the International Aid Transparency Initiative,
showing details about projects and
organizations in the affected areas.47 MIND
is still a research prototype that is openly
available for user testing.

eBayanihan – a mobile and web-based
participatory disaster management system
which was developed and piloted in the
Philippines during 2014-15 – represents
a different approach. Unlike MIND, it did
not scrape data from social media feeds
of affected citizens, but allowed them to
post reports of damage directly. They could
also provide an initial needs assessment
following incidents and request skills,
resources or volunteers for the response.
Machine learning algorithms helped model
and validate these crowdsourced reports
– categorizing and visualizing them. It
provided real-time notifications to people
managing response clusters. Unfortunately,
it’s unclear to what extent the system
is still in use or how it’s integrated into
government disaster management.48

Crowd forecasting of
epidemics, conflict and
geopolitical events

Triggers for some crises are difficult
to predict in advance due to their rare

occurrence. With new pandemics or
conflict, the lack of historical data can make
statistical predictions or machine learning
models unreliable. To address gaps in these
methods, some organizations are employing
another collective intelligence method
called ‘crowd prediction polling’ or crowd
forecasting. These ‘wisdom of the crowd’
forecasts are calculated by aggregating
many individual judgments about the
likelihood of events. Past research has even
suggested that a non-specialist crowd can
predict geopolitical events more accurately
than individual analysts.49

For example, the Early Warning Project
produces a ranked list of more than 160
countries, based on their likelihood of
experiencing a mass killing, in order
to better target preventative action by
governments and charities. It does this
using a combination of crowd forecasting,
expert ranking and a machine learning
model. During the first phase, experts in
the field take part in an annual comparison
survey where they rank pairs of countries
according to which is more likely to

26

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

experience a mass killing. A machine
learning model also generates estimates
based on more than 30 variables from
historic datasets. Seventeen ‘higher-risk’
countries are then tracked using crowd
forecasting, producing quarterly forecasts
over the course of a year. As forecasters
can regularly update their estimates with
new information, they’re able to pick up and
reflect ‘weak signals’ or sudden changes in
the context missed by the other methods.

One of the best known examples is Peta
Bencana, which is applying collective
intelligence methods to disaster response in
the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. It creates
real-time flood maps by combining reports
from citizens on Twitter with official data
on flooding and sensors from around the
city. It’s used by the local government to
prioritize its flood response and by residents
to make informed decisions about how to
navigate around the city.51

In Tanzania, Ramani Huria helps
communities in informal settlements to
map residential areas, roads, streams,
floodplains and other relevant features –
aiming to bring disaster prevention and
response to areas that were previously
off the map. In 2015, it helped public
authorities respond to an unexpected
outbreak of cholera, providing detailed
information on water points and sanitation
data.52 During the COVID-19 pandemic,
the Taiwanese government made data on
the nationwide stock of masks publicly
available using an open API. This allowed
civic-minded developers to create
interactive maps showing the real-time
distribution and supply of masks. These
were used by citizens queuing for masks
and enabled the government to address
distributional problems.53

There are many other successful
deployments of crowdmapping globally,
even stretching to the Arctic. The SIKU
platform combines satellite imagery with
reports from indigenous communities in
their own languages of weather conditions,
ice hazards and wildlife. It helps document
the impact of climate change, and is used
to share dangerous and changing ice
conditions within Inuit communities.54

The Flu Forecasting Center at Carnegie
Mellon University also taps into a group of
volunteers (both experts and non-experts)
for their annual flu tracking system. Each
week volunteers log into an online system to
review a chart showing the trajectory of past
and current flu seasons. They’re then asked
to complete the current season’s curve,
projecting how many more flu cases there
will be over time. The crowd’s aggregate
forecast is often just as accurate as the
machine learning prediction, trained on over
20 years of data. Over the last few years, the
center has fine-tuned this combination of
human and machine predictions to forecast
the trajectory of the flu with a high degree
of accuracy, beating the attempts of many
other researchers.50

Crowdmapping (sometimes
combined with satellite/
sensor data) for community
preparedness and response

The best collective intelligence initiatives
open up data for use by members of
the public as well as decision makers –
increasing people’s ability to make decisions
and power to act. Crowdmapping and GIS
are the most commonly applied collective
intelligence methods for gathering and
sharing information in this way. Some
initiatives combine this citizen-generated
data with sensor or satellite data for a fuller

How is AI augmenting
collective intelligence
for the SDGs?

Most uses of AI in development today are
based on machine learning algorithms,
which improve their performance based on
extracting patterns from very large training
datasets. This approach is a great fit for
collective intelligence projects, many of
which gather or interpret large amounts of
human-generated content like images and
videos, crowdsourced through smartphone
apps and online platforms.

These are the three main ways AI and
collective intelligence are currently being
used together for the SDGs:

1. Efficiency and scale
of data processing

AI is being effectively incorporated into
collective intelligence projects where timing
is paramount and a key insight is buried
deep within large volumes of unstructured
data. This combination of AI and collective
intelligence is most useful when decision
makers require an early warning to help
them manage risks and distribute public
resources more effectively. For example,
Dataminr’s First Alert system uses pre-
trained machine learning models to sift
through text and images scraped from the
internet, as well as other data streams, such
as audio broadcasts, to isolate early signals
that anticipate emergency events.55

2. Organizing human

knowledge

To make the most of collective intelligence,
it’s important to draw on a diversity of views.
But it’s difficult to synthesize hundreds
of inputs to extract common themes and
priorities, especially when working with
non-traditional citizen-generated data. This
is often the limiting factor in large scale
deliberative or consultation exercises, and
here, AI can help. AI methods like natural
language processing (NLP) can be used
to identify prominent topics and help to
cluster the data by meaning. Popular citizen
participation platforms like CitizenLab and
Decidim are already experimenting with
these AI methods56 and NLP has also been
used to identify SDG priorities in the context
of a social listening project by Pulse Lab
Kampala.57

3. Optimizing and

prioritizing workflows

Finally, we see examples of AI being
deployed alongside volunteers to help them
complete microtasks with more consistency
and accuracy. For this combination of AI
and collective intelligence, the performance
gains may need to be carefully balanced
with how comfortable volunteers feel about
working with AI tools. For example, in 2018
the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team
(HOT) launched the RapiD tool that uses
computer vision to detect roads and terrain
features, to help their volunteers complete
crowdmapping tasks more quickly during
crisis response. The RapiD tool was first
used to support mapping in Kerala, India
during a flooding event but has since been
fully integrated into the HOT platform.
Importantly, HOT offered volunteers the
opportunity to opt out if they preferred
working without AI.58

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development
Use Case 3

Real-time
monitoring of
environmental
conditions

As the scale of environmental issues surpasses

Relevant SDG targets

available monitoring resources, 59 collective

intelligence methods like citizen science and

in-situ or remote sensing methods have been

gaining traction. Groups of volunteers working

By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental

with scientists, sometimes using satellite or

sensor data, can extend the capacity of the

government to gather and share important

data. There are three key collective intelligence

methods that are helping to build a more

granular understanding of on-the-ground

conditions needed for responsive policy

making, interventions and services:

activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution
(14.1)

By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and
sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater
ecosystems and their services, in particular forests,
wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with
obligations under international agreements (15.2)

By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable

management of all types of forests, halt deforestation,
restore degraded forests and substantially increase
afforestation and reforestation globally (15.3)

By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land

and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought
and floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-
neutral world (15.4)

Take urgent and significant action to reduce the

degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity
and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of
threatened species (15.5)

29

Citizen science to monitor
biodiversity and
environmental conditions

Citizen science relies on the enthusiasm
and willingness of ordinary people to help
with tasks ranging from measuring air
or water quality to cataloging flora and
fauna or analyzing satellite photographs
and making maps online after a natural
disaster. This breadth of options means
that individuals can choose how to
contribute based on the time they have
available and their personal interests.

The eBird platform, which was first
developed in the US and is now a global
movement, allows a dispersed volunteer
community of bird watchers to collect vast
amounts of data – with more than 100
million bird sightings contributed annually.60
This is used by researchers and conservation
groups to track population trends, identify
important sites for protection and better

30

design plans to help protect endangered
species. eBird data contributes to hundreds
of conservation decisions and scientific
articles, as well as helping to inform bird
research around the world.61 For example,
eBird Argentina62 is being used to track local
populations of the Torrent Duck, a species
predominantly found in South America
whose global numbers are declining.

Citizen science has broad application across
the SDGs, but particularly so in helping
to monitor air quality and environmental
degradation. In recent years, the number
of initiatives has proliferated. The Marine
Debris Tracker, enables citizens to document
and geolocate marine plastic pollution
using an app.63 OpenLitterMap does the
same for all forms of waste.64 AppEAR
brings together communities in Argentina,
Ecuador and Peru to study freshwater
aquatic environments.65 sensors.Africa is a

like Nairobi and makes that data available
to journalists, civic watchdogs, citizens
and governments to help push for tighter
regulations.66

In 2020, UNDP Argentina, set out to monitor
the street-level fluctuations in air quality in
Buenos Aires through its Accelerator Lab.
The goal was to understand the typical
exposures to pollutants for urban residents,
that official monitors fail to capture.
The team partnered with open-seneca,
a worldwide network of citizen science
projects that measures air quality using
low cost sensors.67 They built the sensors
with 80 local university students and used
an open call to identify 20 local cyclists
who could measure pollutants during
their routes over a seven-week period.
The project has inspired multiple pilots
in other Argentinian cities, and the team
is working with local and national policy
makers to increase the functionality of the
sensors allowing measurements of noise
and temperature to inform urban planning
decisions.

Remote and/or in situ sensing
(and open data) to monitor
changes in the environment

Collective intelligence projects also
frequently draw on Earth Observation
(EO) data from satellites, data from in-situ
sensors or mobile phones to measure
changes in environmental conditions. This
data is sometimes combined with citizen-
generated observation data, or volunteers
are recruited to help analyze or validate
them to make them more usable for
research or policy.

Regen Network is a technology start-up.
It uses satellite, sensors and on-the-
ground observation data to understand
current ecological conditions. Farmers
are incentivized to experiment with new
approaches to improving the ecosystem –

31

like carbon sequestration, cleaning
waterways or increasing biodiversity.
The sensor and observation data helps
farmers to monitor the progress of their
experiments in real-time, and learn what
works best. At present Regen is being
deployed in Ecuador to help cacao farmers
adopt regenerative agriculture practices in
place of monoculture, and in Barbados to
help a former sand quarry which has been
reforested to quantify conservation and land
regeneration outcomes.68

Global Forest Watch and Global Fishing
Watch are two other initiatives that provide
real-time monitoring for the environment.
Global Forest Watch helps conservation
groups and policy makers monitor
deforestation using satellite data and data
from people on the ground. It has been
used by companies like Mars to evaluate
its palm oil suppliers and make decisions
about where to source from. The Amazon
Conservation Association uses it to provide
governments with timely information on
illegal gold mining or logging, enabling
them to take action within 24-48 hours
of receiving an alert.69 A new study has
found that active monitoring of forests in
Central Africa using satellite data reduced
deforestation by 18 per cent.70 Global
Fishing Watch helps to identify illegal
fishing by combining government data on
commercial fishing fleets with data from
automatic identification systems (AIS) that
large ships use to broadcast their position.71
In 2020, the platform was being used by
the US Navy and Ghana Navy to assist
with fishing patrols, and by researchers
to identify illegal ‘dark’ fishing fleets off
the North Korean and Somali coasts. Both
platforms make their data free and available
for researchers, journalists, campaigners
and governments.72

Other examples of this application of
collective intelligence include Rainforest
Connection,73 which uses acoustic
monitoring to detect the sound of

In Ukraine the open burning of waste is
a widespread practice, with deep roots
in its culture and agricultural economy.
To understand the scale and locations
of open burning across the country, the
Accelerator Lab of UNDP Ukraine created
a near real-time map of open burning
across the country. They used novel data
sources including satellite images, GIS,
and citizen-generated reports of fires to
produce an interactive dashboard. They
then worked together with community
groups from across the country and local
policy makers to interpret and discuss the
data over a series of ten online meetings.
They also mapped over 367 individuals and
organizations who were already composting
waste as an alternative to open burning –
demonstrating that local solutions already
existed.77

Haze Gazer, is a crisis analysis and
visualization tool created by UN Global
Pulse Lab Jakarta to provide up-to-date
information on fire and haze hazards
in Indonesia.78 It uses advanced data
analytics and data science to mine open
data, such as fire hotspot information from
satellites (from Global Forest Watch), as
well as citizen-generated data from Twitter,
Instagram and YouTube to understand how
the affected communities are responding.79
The Haze Gazer system is now installed
in the Executive Office of the President
of Indonesia.

chainsaws, logging trucks and gunshots that
could indicate illegal logging activity. Old
mobile phones with an extra microphone
are attached to trees and hidden in the
jungle. They stay charged and listen 24
hours a day, powered by solar cells. The
phones record all sounds in the forest,
process the data and send it to the cloud,
where it’s analyzed in real time. Machine
learning and data analytics help distinguish
sounds like a chainsaw from background
forest noise and identify other patterns that
might otherwise go undetected – including
the presence of endangered species. Text
alerts are automatically sent to authorities
who can determine if the activity is illegal
and then stop it. So far, the Rainforest
Connection has been used in Cameroon,
Ecuador, Peru and Brazil.74

Combining web scraped and/
or citizen-generated data
to monitor environmental
hazards

The people in affected areas are often
the best source of information about
environmental hazards. Their collective
intelligence is increasingly being activated
through bespoke citizen reporting tools, or
by web scraping social media data where
people are already sharing information, to
enable more agile responses.

MOPA (Monitoria Participativa Maputo)
is a World Bank and Make All Voices
Count supported initiative in Maputo,
Mozambique. Citizens report waste-related
issues to the municipal government using
mobile phones. Data visualizations, SMS
alerts and statistics allow city officials to
monitor waste collection service quality
and help waste collection companies locate
problems such as waste dumping and
overflowing bins as they arise.75 MOPA
helped improve waste removal response
time from five days to 14 hours.76

Use Case 4

Working with
complex systems

Our economies, the climate, migration
and urban infrastructures are all examples
of complex systems. What these complex
systems have in common is their nonlinear,
adaptive, networked, and emergent behavior.
As many development policy makers
increasingly recognize, single interventions
in one part of a complex system may not
produce the intended effects – and may
precipitate unintended ones.

Collective intelligence approaches that
combine multiple data sources can help local
governments and development organizations
better understand the complexity and
changing dynamics of systems like cities, as
well as the different needs or experiences
of the people within them. There are three
common applications of collective intelligence
methods to make complex systems
intelligible for better decision making:

How collective intelligence methods are deployed

Combining sensor data and/or citizen-generated

data for ‘intelligent’ networked actions

Combining datasets (and creating open data)

to ‘see’ a complex system

Crowdsourcing ideas and opinions from citizens

to inform decision making

Relevant SDG targets

By 2030, empower and promote the social, economic
and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex,
disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or
other status (10.2)

By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable

urbanization and capacity for participatory, integrated
and sustainable human settlement planning and
management in all countries (11.3)

By 2030, halve per capita global food waste at the retail
and consumer levels and reduce food losses along
production and supply chains, including post-harvest
losses (12.3)

33

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Combining sensor data and/
or citizen-generated data for
‘intelligent’ networked actions

By integrating different types of available
data, collective intelligence can help to
coordinate and influence the activities of
people and organizations in a complex
system in new ways, forming a central
nervous system for cities and communities –
and helping them to operate more effectively.

Breadline is a collective intelligence platform
that enables local food rescue volunteers
from NGOs in Hong Kong to see quantities
of leftover bread at different bakeries across
the city in real time. It allows the volunteers
to choose their own collection routes,
removing bakeries from the list when
volunteers indicate that they intend to pick
up from a particular store. The increased
transparency enables volunteers to act in a
decentralized way that also lets them draw
on their tacit knowledge of the fastest way
to get round the city. It has led to a fourfold
increase in bread collected.80

Waze is a community-driven navigation
app. It combines GPS location data from
mobile phones of drivers with crowdsourced
information on accidents, hazards or speed
traps from its 50 million members. From
this it creates real-time traffic maps and
helps people find the fastest route for their
journey.81,82 Many of its features have been
incorporated into Google Maps, but its
game-like features have enabled it to retain
a strong community user base.

One of the largest scale examples is China’s
City Brain project. It consolidates data
feeds from more than 700 IT systems from
different government agencies. It’s used to
optimize traffic lights, help ambulance and
fire response, and improve waste collection,
parking lot management and health
monitoring. It has now been implemented
in 23 cities across Asia, sometimes as part

34

of the digital component of the Belt and
Road Initiative.83

Combining datasets
(and creating open data) to
‘see’ a complex system

In the last decade, an explosion of initiatives
has made data more accessible or open –
including new models for partnerships like
data trusts and data collaboratives. These
are helping to break down traditional silos
and unlock potential new uses of data to
generate meaningful insights into complex
systems. Being able to see things that were
previously hidden, or only partially visible,
is a core requirement of the kind of systems
transformation called for by the SDGs.

For urban planning and management
challenges, understanding the impacts,
drivers and dynamics of the complex city
system is critical. Bringing together novel
and existing datasets can enable policy
makers and planners to see both long-term
trends at the macroscale and microtrends
at the local level. The Africapolis platform
brings together multiple data sources to
build understanding of long-term urban
dynamics across Africa. Its data is based on
a large inventory of housing and population
censuses, electoral registers and other
official population sources. Satellite and
aerial images are also used to identify the
built-up areas and the precise location
of settlements. Official administrative
boundaries data is used to link population
data to the observed information on the
built-up areas.84

New, and often citizen-generated, data
can help city planners better understand
different needs across the city and provide
a more flexible alternative to cumbersome
traditional master planning processes. In
India, the Bhuvan project creates maps
that help cities with effective land-use
management and responsive planning.85

trade associations to tap into data on day-
to-day transactions and volume of trade
across the country. They also collected
qualitative data about the experiences
of these informal workers who were so
important to the system. Combining
these novel data sources helped to reveal
previously unmapped vulnerabilities in
the system – such as a regular January
fluctuation in market prices. Their methods
are now informing the Zimbabwe Resilience
Building Fund, a long-term development
initiative that aims to improve the resilience
of communities in the face of recurrent
shocks and stresses.88

It uses data taken from satellite imagery on
transport infrastructure, natural features
and land-use, alongside utility data and
information crowdsourced from locals
through the Point of Interest app. These
maps are used to draft master plans
which are published online for review and
feedback by local residents. Today, 121 city
master plans have been published using
Bhuvan and work is underway on
143 more.86

Another example of a complex system
is food production and distribution. This
system becomes even more complex when
a large part of that system is driven by
the informal sector as it is in Zimbabwe.87

there and the trade-offs they’re willing to
accept. A range of collective intelligence
methods known as participatory futures
approaches are increasingly being used to
widen the range of people thinking about
the future, and to connect their views into
policy making.93

In 2016, the Mayor of Mexico City decided to
crowdsource a city-wide constitution from
local residents. He appointed a 28-person
drafting committee made up of Mexico City
residents, supported by technical staff. Local
people’s visions for the city were gathered
through a survey called Imagina tu Ciudad
(Imagine Your City) and student volunteers,
armed with tablets, were deployed to
gather responses from citizens in public
spaces. People could also set up online
petitions for specific articles to be included
in the constitution. The constitution was
formally approved in February 2017 with
crowdsourced components providing an
important influence on policy, including on
LGBTQI rights and the right to mobility – the
first time such a right was ever enshrined in
a city constitution.94

Another practical illustration comes from
Aruba. In 2008, the government initiated a
deliberative exercise to chart a 2025 vision
for the island that would also deal with
the existential challenges it faced – such
as fragile ecosystems and vulnerability to
volatile global energy markets.95 It used a
structured process of appreciative inquiry
to generate positive visions for the future,
and scenario building to create stories about
different futures. More than half the island’s
100,000 residents were involved. The exercise
led to the creation of a national strategy,
which outlasted a change of government due
to the popular support it garnered.

Crowdsourcing ideas and
opinions from citizens to
inform decision making

Experience has shown that imposing large-
scale urban projects on citizens without
their input or involvement is frequently an
invitation to vicious backlash. Cities around
the world are turning to digital platforms
to crowdsource problems and potential
solutions from their residents.

One well-known example is Block by
Block. It uses the Minecraft platform
(an easy-to-learn 3D digital modeling
game) as a community participation tool
for visualization and collaboration to
actively engage neighborhood residents
who do not typically have a voice in
influencing spatial planning and design of
cities. Once project ideas are completed
in Minecraft, stakeholders from local
government, planners and architects listen
to presentations by people who were part
of the design process. In the Gaza Strip,
the program allowed the incorporation of
women’s and girls’ ideas in reconstructing
key public spaces that have since benefited
around 100,000 people.89 So far, Block by
Block has helped the renewal of urban
neighborhoods in more than 30 countries.90

As the COVID-19 crisis continues to send
shockwaves around the world, precipitating
potentially the worst global recession in
eight decades,91 the risks caused by the
looming climate and environmental crises
continue to grow.92 To tackle these complex
systemic issues, today’s leaders will need to
decide on actions now that may only deliver
benefits in the long-term, and possibly even
deliver some pain in the short-term. Not
only will this require new ideas and new

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Box 2

How might AI and collective
intelligence help us get
even better at working with
complex systems?

One significant future opportunity lies in
using AI to augment collective intelligence
to model scale and complexity. For complex
challenges, it can be hard to connect local
issues to global problems, or make the
case for short-term sacrifices that bring
long-term benefits.96 Methods based on
distributed AI97 are emerging to help us
overcome these limits of perception. For
example, agent-based modeling and multi-
agent systems are being used by decision
makers to explore different scenarios and
understand the impacts of interventions
they plan to make,98 while generative AI
models are helping to visualize long-term
impacts99 of systemic problems like climate
change. These emerging AI methods can be
used to explore the complexity at the heart
of the SDGs.

CityMatrix is a good example of what this
looks like in practice. It helps decision
makers test out the impact of urban
planning decisions.100 Using many different
sources of urban data, CityMatrix creates an
interactive simulation of a city environment,
powered by agent-based modeling. The
tool’s visual interface allows participants to
set policy priorities and choose between
different options recommended by an
optimization algorithm. Variants of the
tool have been piloted with a number of
cities, including Paris, Boston and Riyadh,
but it will take time for these types of
models to become a mainstay of collective
decision making. Ultimately, tools like
CityMatrix may be used to bring together
different stakeholder groups across
cultural and social divides to collaboratively
explore complex issues while engaging in
deliberation about competing values, trade-
offs and priorities. There are promising
signs of progress from the development
sector. In 2020, the UN announced that it
was planning to test out a simulation tool
for policy prioritization with governments in
Latin America.101

Use Case 5

Inclusive development

The SDGs’ promise to ‘leave no one behind’

Relevant SDG targets

brings with it an imperative to involve

marginalized individuals and communities in

development initiatives. Collective intelligence

methods like crowdmapping, citizen reporting

harvest of insights, these three key collective

intelligence methods can play an important

role in growing the capacity of citizens and

distributing power:

How collective intelligence methods are deployed

Crowdmapping and/or citizen reporting to document

the issues affecting particular groups

polling/text-based microsurveys

Crowdsourcing data from under-represented groups to

build more inclusive AI systems

38

Crowdmapping and/or
citizen reporting to document
the issues affecting
particular groups

Citizen reporting and crowdmapping are
being used to expose the scale of problems
like sexual violence that affect large
numbers of women globally,102 but often
go undocumented. It’s well known that a
persistent lack of gender disaggregated
data makes women invisible in national
statistics, and means that many of the
issues they face go uncounted and therefore
unaddressed in policy agendas.103 But
this is also true for people living with
disabilities, indigenous communities and
LGBTQI populations. As more development
decision making becomes data-driven, it’s
important that efforts are accelerated to
involve diverse communities in generating
and using data to make decisions and hold
others to account.

HarassMap is a non-profit initiative that
crowdsources reports from women in
Egypt about sexual harassment and abuse
using the Ushahidi platform. They use
the data to challenge stereotypes that
blame the victims of harassment, build
campaigns to convince people to take
action and help create zero-tolerance of
sexual harassment in schools, universities
and workplaces.104 Safecity does the same
in India and Kenya, digging into trends
related to the types of violence or location
to design appropriate interventions.105

Citizen reporting methods are also being
used by young people living with disabilities
in Kenya, Zambia and the Philippines as
part of a partnership between On Our
Radar and Leonard Cheshire. They monitor
progress towards the SDGs by documenting
their experiences on their mobile phones.
The stories are uploaded onto an online
reporting hub. This evidence is then used by
disabled people’s organizations and youth
with disabilities to inform their advocacy for
more inclusive policies.106

39

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

The Geochicas’ Las Calles De Las Mujeres107
uses crowdmapping to discover and
visualize the absence of female figures
in street names in Latin American and
Spanish cities, as well as highlighting
the historic contributions of women. By
bringing together a common technical
and social infrastructure for addressing
gender data gaps, Geochicas has created
a global peer-led community of activists.
As of 2019, the movement had more than
190 crowdmappers from 22 different
countries.108

Crowdsourcing views and
experiences using phone
polling/microsurveys

The high penetration of basic mobile
phones and technologies like radio are
also being used to crowdsource views and
experiences from traditionally overlooked
groups, such as those in conflict zones
or communities affected by poverty
and illiteracy.

To overcome this, UNICEF launched
U-Report, a mobile messaging program, in
2011. It gathers opinions and information
from young people using polls and allows
them to report issues. It operates on
numerous social media, messaging and SMS
channels, and is now active in 68 countries
with 11 million users. The data and insights
are shared back with communities and
communicated to policy makers who make
decisions that affect young people.109
To better understand the perspectives
of people in remote and hard-to-reach
communities, Africa’s Voices, UNICEF
Somalia, and Media INK designed five
interactive radio shows on gender and child
protection issues. The themes included
female genital cutting and child marriage.
Over 40,000 text messages were received

in response to questions posed during
the shows, with over 45 per cent of these
coming from women and girls. The insights
from the responses are now informing
UNICEF’s social norms work and its
messaging around social change.110

Also making use of radio’s wide reach,
in 2015 UN Global Pulse Lab Kampala
designed a prototype AI tool that analyzed
data from call-in shows on Ugandan local
public radio stations. The team developed
three NLP models to convert speech to text
through speech recognition and translation
between English and the regional
languages Luganda and Acholi. The tool
automatically tracked trends in the use of
terms relevant to the SDGs, delivering key
insights on health service issues, the arrival
of refugees and local crises. The project
provided a valuable proof of concept that
citizen-generated audio contains unique
information that is of use to governments
and development organizations. It is now
being scaled to other countries.

Phone polling has also provided important
evidence for journalists investigating land
grabs in South Sudan. To uncover the truth,
journalists Carloyn Thompson and Lagu
Joseph Jackson designed a mobile phone
survey which was distributed through
random dialing on a national network,
and pre-recorded in six local languages.
Respondents could answer by pressing
numbers on their phone, and in some cases
recording a message. The result of the
investigation was published on Al Jazeera
in 2019, and led to discussions in the South
Sudanese community around land rights as
part of the peace agreement.111

Crowdsourcing data from
under-represented groups
to build more inclusive
AI systems

As AI becomes more pervasive, it’s
important to ensure that the technology
does not exacerbate existing inequalities.
Collective intelligence methods are also

40

being used to create an alternative and
more inclusive AI-enabled future.112
Developing training datasets for
machine learning models (see Box 1)
that are more representative of the
diversity of real-world experience is a
vital first step.

Mozilla’s Common Voice project, for
example, uses an accessible online
platform to crowdsource the world’s
largest open dataset of diverse voice
recordings, spanning different languages,
demographic backgrounds and accents.
Common Voice aims to open up the AI
market and stimulate the development
of AI voice assistants that are able
to serve the needs of more diverse
communities.113 Other projects focus on a
smaller subset of languages; for example,
Siminchikkunarayku and Masakhane114
focus on Peruvian and regional African
languages respectively. These projects
recognize that developing AI systems
based on under-represented languages
and voices helps to preserve and increase
the reach of cultural heritage. The
resulting AI systems are also better able
to serve the needs of these groups, who
would otherwise be excluded.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Crowdsourcing solutions/
open innovation

The use of open innovation methods such
as challenge prizes, like XPRIZE or The
Grand Challenges, are now well-established
in the panoply of collective intelligence
approaches. Usually run by an institution,
they work by specifying problems to be
solved and then encouraging, incentivizing
and supporting a much broader range of
innovators to help solve them. They have
been used for a wide range of issues, from
tackling antibiotic resistance to climate
change – and work best with careful
orchestration and problem solvers who
understand the realities on the ground.115

Nesta Challenges’ Data Driven Farming
Prize, sponsored by USAID and Feed
the Future, challenged innovators to
use technology to improve agricultural

productivity and the livelihoods of
smallholders in Nepal. Thirteen finalists,
including six from Nepal, were selected
from 143 entries from 27 countries.
Winning entries included Nepal’s
Db2Map116 for their GeoKrishi program
which integrated satellite, government and
crowdsourced data into actionable advice
for farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs.
Another winner was Spero Analytics117
from Canada, for their wireless solar mesh
network to communicate soil moisture
data to agricultural extension services.
Six months after the prize ended, finalists
had formed at least 22 new partnerships,
including links with government ministries,
and eight new technology products had
entered the market.118

country’s shortage of face masks and other
forms of personal protective equipment
(PPE). The Life Helmets challenge called
for designs for closed full-face shields
to allow citizens to safely return to work
while avoiding infection. The five winning
designs were submitted by a doctor, a
student, a DIY maker and a taxi driver –
demonstrating how collective intelligence
approaches can bring in a diverse and
sometimes unusual range of problem
solvers. Following the completion of the
challenge, the Life Helmets platform was
turned into a marketplace for the winning
designs, where members of the public and
companies can buy face shields for personal
use. UNDP Colombia has since purchased
and distributed more than 27,000 of these
winning Life Helmets across the country,
including in remote locations where
communities have struggled to access PPE.

Peer-to-peer crowdsourcing of
knowledge or solutions

‘Lead-user innovation’ is a term coined
by MIT’s Eric von Hippel in the eighties.
It refers to people who are the creators
of novel solutions to particular problems
or challenges they face.119 The advance
of the internet has led to more and more
collaborations of lead users – who can
now find each other and work together
even though they may be separated
geographically.

Wefarm is a free peer-to-peer service
for small scale farmers in East Africa. It
enables them to ask each other questions
on anything related to agriculture via SMS
and then receive crowdsourced bespoke
content and ideas from other farmers
within minutes. Wefarm’s machine learning
algorithms match each question to the
best suited responders in the community.
Its NLP models can identify three regional
African languages – Kiswahili, Luganda and
Runyankore – in addition to English. More

43

than one million farmers are currently using
it, sharing more than 40,000 questions and
answers daily.120

In Ethiopia and Nigeria, researchers
from Bioversity International have been
working with subsistence farmers who
test different varieties of seeds for climate
resilience and pool their knowledge about
which varieties fare best. This peer-to-peer
crowdsourcing approach has been proven to
find seeds that are much better at surviving
extreme weather conditions than those
recommended on official lists, a critical part
of mitigating the impact of climate change
on food systems.121

PatientsLikeMe is a patient network and
real-time research platform with over
600,000 members. Patients connect with
others who have the same disease or
condition. Together they monitor their
conditions, and share data on their diseases
and treatment strategies. Data from the
platform also forms the basis of more
than 100 publicly accessible peer-reviewed
scientific studies.122

Open source repositories/
project wikis to share solutions

Many networks are facilitating distributed
problem solving by using open source
repositories or project wikis – which enable
anybody to use, study, modify or distribute
an existing project or solution for free.

Public Lab is a non-profit organization
that facilitates collaborative, open source
environmental research. Its volunteer
community develops open source hardware,
software, and other open methodologies to
democratize environmental monitoring. The
community publishes plans and guides for
‘Do It Yourself’ monitoring tools that can be
made at home, making it easier for others
to apply or adapt the methods to their
own situation.123 Field Ready’s designs for

Crowd labeling of data to train
‘AI for good’ models

Collective intelligence is often fundamental
to the latest advances in AI, especially
machine learning approaches that rely on
humans to label the large datasets they use
as their training material.

An example of this is the organization
SpotLab. Their online games include
images of different parasites in digitized
blood samples. By identifying different
parasites in the blood samples, crowds are
contributing to a dataset of labeled images
that will train accurate AI models for the
diagnosis of tropical diseases such as
malaria and leishmania.126

Many of the larger citizen science platforms
have started to engage volunteers in labeling
data to help train AI models for a variety of
tasks. These range from labeling pictures
of placenta samples to help scientists
understand why some placentas fail during
pregnancy complications,127 to labeling plant
and animal species from the data collected
by iNaturalist’s citizen science community.

Cochrane Crowd is another long-running
platform that relies on a network of 37,000
volunteers to help classify and label medical
research on a wide range of issues. At a
time when research output is expanding
exponentially, citizen science can help
to manage the information overload.
Contributors complete a range of microtasks,
for example noting whether the research
is from a randomized trial, or classifying an
article abstract. This enables the identification
and description of health research as
it’s published or produced. It makes the
production of expert synthesis and systematic
reviews much quicker, turning information
from multiple studies into knowledge about
treatment effects.128 In one study, the crowd
was found to have an accuracy of 99 per cent
on the tasks it performed.129

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

Orchestrating and
Scaling Collective
Intelligence for
the SDGs

As the use cases in this report
show, collective intelligence
approaches can work well in
addressing some of the big
21st-century challenges.

Use cases 1, 5 and 6 illustrate how collective
intelligence can help make development
more context specific, more participatory
and more inclusive by harnessing the
intelligence and capacity that exists in all
communities. Use cases 2 and 4 highlight
the value collective intelligence brings to
dealing with uncertainty and complexity
by bringing together new types of insight
to reveal hidden dynamics or understand
emerging problems more quickly. Use cases
2 and 3 point to the vital role collective
intelligence can play in filling data gaps
on the SDGs – enabling more accurate
and detailed knowledge on progress
and more rapid response. And use case
6 demonstrates how progress towards
sustainable development can be accelerated
by harnessing distributed problem solving
and collaboration.

Most would already agree that to achieve
the SDGs and avert climate catastrophe
the world will need to mobilize power
and money as never before.130 But to
use power and money well, it will also
be vital that governments, organizations
and communities become skilled in
mobilizing intelligence of all kinds – data,
information and ideas – from, and with,
many more people. That will mean making
collective intelligence methods much more
mainstream than they are now.

45

In January 2019, UNDP launched a global
Accelerator Lab Network – aiming to do
just that. Starting with 60 teams across 78
countries, the Labs were envisaged as ‘the
world’s largest and fastest learning network’
with a mission to rethink development for
the 21st century. Collective intelligence was
adopted as one of three key approaches to
make progress on the SDGs.131 Through these
Labs, UNDP has already jump-started the
work of using collective intelligence methods
across many of the SDGs, some examples of
which can be found in this report.132

The next step is to orchestrate collective
intelligence more strategically and at scale.
The many excellent initiatives referenced in
this report are often fragmented, hard to
find and usually ad hoc. We will need many
more initiatives that help connect local,
small-scale projects into more of a global
knowledge commons; creating usable and
useful open data, open science and open
innovations that are available to everyone.

A good example of the scale of ambition
needed is the new UNEP-UN-Habitat
partnership to create the ‘world’s largest
air quality platform’ covering 7,000 cities
worldwide. For the first time, it will bring
together air quality data collected by
governments, NGOs, companies and local
community groups and individuals that
was previously either restricted to
individually-run websites or apps, or not
shared publicly.133

Priorities for funders
and development
organizations to scale
collective intelligence
for the SDGs

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

The business world has learned to invest
heavily in data and knowledge – and the
most valuable companies in the world are
largely ones based on sophisticated data,
knowledge and software. A comparable
commitment is needed now for the SDGs, so
that development is much better supported
by shared data, knowledge and software
infrastructures. Here we suggest some of
the roles that key institutions could play in
making that happen.

1. Help governments
to make better use
of collective intelligence

People are collecting, creating and sharing data on an
unprecedented scale – but governments and some
development organizations have been slow to make
the most of new methods. Most of the projects in this
report are being developed and implemented by social
movements, civil society organizations and researchers.
Many governments are unfamiliar with the many
new sources of data now available – from satellite
data to mobile data and citizen-generated data. The
opportunities are immense, but greatly underutilized.
A recent systematic review of the contribution of citizen
science to the SDGs, for example, found that citizen
science methods have the potential to contribute to the
monitoring of all 17 SDGs (at least one indicator per goal).
But it also found that at present citizen science is only
being used by governments to monitor five indicators.134

The biggest leverage will come through helping
governments make the most of the new tools and
collective intelligence methods that are available
and already being harnessed.

3. Trust and values matter in collective

intelligence systems –
and need to be cultivated

All collective intelligence projects depend on trust and
goodwill. When they work well they also contribute
to trust. As they start to underpin even more of the
civic infrastructure it will also become more vital that
considerations of ethics and personal privacy are taken
seriously, and seen to be taken seriously. The recently
abandoned Google Sidewalk Labs project in Toronto135
came under fierce criticism for taking a top-down
‘technology push’ approach that prioritized technology
and data over people and purpose.136 Governments
like Taiwan, however, are demonstrating an alternative:
creating collective intelligence systems that enable
citizens to collaborate in solving problems, allowing
them to access and use data.137 Barcelona’s sensor
network also gives citizens control over how their data
is used.138 These new models of distributed governance
and responsibility are paving the way towards a social
contract that uses collective intelligence to empower
all stakeholders to take action, from governments
and organizations to individuals. As development
organizations and governments seek to make use of
collective intelligence it’s important that the values
and principles that underpin these new approaches
and technologies are paid sufficient attention, and
that benefits outweigh risks.139 A commitment to data
empowerment, not data extraction, must remain central.

2. Open data and open software have

enabled widespread experimentation –
but now need to become the default for
sustainable development

Open source software and data such as OpenStreetMap,
Ushahidi and Consul have greatly accelerated distributed
experimentation with collective intelligence methods by
a wide range of organizations, from city municipalities
to community-based organizations. The free availability
of NASA’s Landsat and, likewise, the European Space
Agency’s Sentinel satellite data has resulted in an
explosion of collective intelligence projects in the last few
years – including the Global Forest Watch platform.

Collective intelligence thrives best when underpinned by
strong infrastructures. The most important of these is
the internet itself. But other infrastructures built on top
of it are also becoming increasingly vital. Open source
collective intelligence platforms such as OpenStreetMap
and Consul receive relatively little core funding but are
used by many projects. Often these depend both on
open standards and open access technology, as well
as the work of many volunteers – a very valuable set of
public goods that are rarely well-supported by traditional
global, national or philanthropic funders.

Open data standards and open access technology are
critical infrastructures for collective intelligence, enabling
faster experimentation and adoption by disparate
communities, scaling across geographies and more rapid
learning about what works. However, these are still not
the default for global development, and many platforms
are still being created that are not open in these ways or
reinvent the wheel, rather than improving and building
on what’s already available.

4. Novel combinations of AI and collective
intelligence could help deliver insight
on the SDGs

The world has seen extraordinary investment in AI over
the last few years, both from government and business.
The big investments in ‘AI for good’ are welcome, after
many decades when far more was spent on military and
commercial applications than in relation to global goals.
Some research suggests that AI could act as an enabler
on 134 targets (79 per cent) across all SDGs.140

But in many fields the full value of AI depends on linking
it to human collective intelligence – and AI funders
have been slow to appreciate this. Most current uses of
AI-enabled collective intelligence for the SDGs focus on
optimizing for speed or making sense of vast quantities
of citizen-generated data. Yet, even these ‘lowest
hanging fruits’ are not always used when they could
be. There is significant scope for experimentation in
more creative uses of AI that help to enhance the reach,
creativity and impact of collective intelligence.

Investing in a dedicated program of innovation, perhaps
through regional or sectoral testbeds (for example
focused on one use case, SDG or region) would allow
for experimentation in real-world settings. A particular
priority is to build up more centers of expertise,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, to counter the
concentration and overdependence on mainly US firms
for AI and data proficiency.

5. Build the field, and develop the methods

further for the SDGs

The field remains relatively young and, as has happened
with other fields (such as the use of big data or new
performance management tools), there is a need to
develop the methods and adapt them to multiple uses.
This can be done through:

Growing evidence
Tools such as crowdmapping and citizen
science have been used for SDG-related
projects for over a decade. Their uptake
could be further aided by creating a stronger
evidence base around impact, as well as
supporting collaborative experimentation
with these tools in a greater number of
communities. This could be achieved by
bolstering civil society organizations, who
are already at the forefront of trying many of
these methods, and leveraging universities
to support in generating more systematic
learning about what works best and why.141

Skills
Training in collective intelligence methods
needs to become part of the default for
anyone involved in development, including
government officials and NGOs.

Connections
The field will also develop faster if
innovators themselves become more of a
collective intelligence, sharing observations,
ideas, experiments, findings and results.
At present, this kind of orchestration is
very ad hoc. Whereas the leading edges
of science and medicine are supported
by strong and well-funded institutions
to maximize the flow of information and
knowledge, there is very limited comparable
support for innovators working around
the SDGs, which means that a lot of work
is less effective than it could be.

Who can make
this happen?

The mainstreaming of collective
intelligence methods into sustainable
development practice will be a collective
task and all major institutions have
a part to play. It can build on much that
is already underway – moving towards
a greater acknowledgement of the role
of data and digital, and how they can be
targeted towards greater empowerment
of citizens.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

OECD

The OECD has played an important role by
helping to set standards and principles for
development cooperation, and monitoring
spending by key partner countries. We suggest
it could play a related role in establishing the
protocols and standards that will be needed
to underpin the shared data and knowledge
infrastructures that would allow collective
intelligence to be orchestrated more strategically.
It could also help to build the evidence base for
collective intelligence methods, and encourage
their uptake by governments.

Regional development banks

The regional development banks are also set to
have a vital role to play. The task for them is to
make it normal for any investment plan to include
a complementary strand on the organization
of intelligence, including the orchestration of
data, evidence and science, and feedback from
grassroots insights and wisdom. This will always
involve some cost, but a well-organized and
shared set of resources can ensure that finance
achieves greater impact. A related priority is
building up capability in data and AI. These
abilities are still highly concentrated in a few
areas with overdependence on mainly US firms.
We hope that funders can work together to build
up centers of expertise, particularly in sub-
Saharan Africa.

World Bank

The World Bank has for many years been
directly involved in better ways of organizing
intelligence, making use of open data and
helping to synthesize knowledge. Here too
we would welcome further engagement with
collective intelligence methods of all kinds so
that they become part of the default, or DNA, of
development work, rather than being seen as
separate. Finance, intelligence and impact should
be thought of as a reinforcing triangle. The

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

World Bank could also expand its support
to governments to build the technical
capacities and infrastructures needed to
engage with new types of data.

Universities

Another important set of players are the
universities, who are well placed to help
curate and grow knowledge relevant to the
SDGs. The bigger task is to ensure a closer
alignment of academic research to SDG
national priorities. In addition, universities
can help students to learn to work in
more collectively intelligent ways. Many
universities are now using ‘challenge based’
models for tens of millions of students,
helping them to earn their degrees while
also working on practical problem solving
in teams that draw on multiple disciplines
and insights outside of academia. This
educational model is being used across the
EU and in other countries including China,
Mexico and South Africa.

Development Assistance
Committee donors and
development funders

Funders have an important role to play in
enabling civil society capacity to mobilize
collective intelligence. They can help
support the skills needed, accelerate the
development of new methods and tools,
and invest in strengthening open collective
intelligence infrastructures as 21st-century
public goods. Funders interested in
accelerating the use of collective intelligence
could seek short- to medium-term wins
through focusing on the use cases identified
in this research with more established
practice and capacity (SDGs 2,3,5 and 10-16)
before taking the approach to less
mature areas.

Private sector

As indicated many times in this report, the
private sector has a significant role to play in
contributing to collective intelligence, often
holding data that is more comprehensive
and up to date than the public sector. The
Global System for Mobile Communications
Association (GSMA) and mobile companies
could be doing more to make it easier
for development organizations and
innovators to get data (and cloud services)
for SDG work. So far progress has been
disappointing in opening up mobile phone
data, given how valuable this can be for
understanding everything from economic
activity and mobility to public health.

Parliaments

Many others have vital roles to play in
advancing and influencing this agenda.
The Inter-Parliamentary Union is an
important influencer, particularly in relation
to strengthening national statistics agencies
and convincing governments to make
better use of citizen-generated, and
other novel, data.

United Nations

Finally, the growing attention being paid
to intelligence of all kinds has implications
for the future organization of the UN.
The strategic challenge for the UN is how
to better orchestrate multiple forms of
intelligence relevant to the SDGs – from
science and data, to public policy evidence
and emerging findings from experiments.
Much is already happening, from the
Humanitarian Data Exchange to the UNEP-
UN-Habitat air quality monitoring platform.
The key is to strike the right balance
between bottom-up, country-led initiatives
and ensuring better provision of some
pooled common resources (knowledge,
software and databases) at global and
regional levels. This combination can make
work on the ground easier for everyone.
