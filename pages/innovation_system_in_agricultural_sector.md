> Title of the innovation

INNOVATION SYSTEM IN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR

> Brief description of the innovation

Managing the ability of agriculture to meet rising global demand and to respond to the changes and opportunities will require good policy,sustained investment and innovation. Investment alone will not elicit innovation at the pace or on scale required by the intensifying and proliferating challenges confronting agriculture. Developing the ability to innovate is often related to collective action, coordination, exchange of knowledge among diverse actors, incentives and resources available to form partnerships and develop business, and conditions that make it possible for farmers or entrepreneurs to use their innovations.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The technology is aimed at identifying, designing and implementing the investment, approaches and complementary intervention that appear most likely to strengthen technological advancement to promote agricultural innovation and equitable growth. That will create employments to the youth and and use of minimum quantities of land.

> Technical Feasibility

Hypothetically, the innovation is to move away from traditional agriculture to modern systems which includes organic farming, hydroponics, agri-apps, and use of drones. At a technological level, precision agriculture which involves big Data, drones, sensors and tailor made farming software is expected to be the next big thing in the arena of agric-tech.

> Anticipated Social Impact

There are five among many innovative agricultural practices and technology that have the potential to be game changers in smart farming. These includes; Urban vertical farming, reimaging utilisation of space, Drones replacing bees as pollinators, genetic editing, farm level automations including driverless tractors, Blockchain-tech powdered agriculture trading platforms. One thing is for sure. The emerging technologies that will soon become part of agricultural practices will change farming and agricultural practices in the near future..
