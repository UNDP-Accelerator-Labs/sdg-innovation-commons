> Title of the innovation

A nucleus farmer outgrower-scheme where we grow lemon grass intercropped with ginger

> Brief description of the innovation

Lemon grass (Cymbopogan flexuosus) is a native aromatic tall sedge (family: Poaceae) which grows in many parts of tropical and sub-tropical Africa.
Lemongrass thrives in full sun, even in hot tropical African locations. The herb requires rich, well-drained soils. Planting holes are composted with manure to improve fertility and this enhances the soil’s ability to hold water. Ginger is a plant with leafy stems and yellowish green flowers. The ginger spice comes from the roots of the plant. Ginger is native to warmer parts of Asia, such as China, Japan, and India, but now is grown in parts of South American and Africa. It is also now grown in the Middle East to use as medicine and with food. 
Summary of the main points:
•	10 hectors of already owned land to be planted on nucleus farm, 40 hectors to be sourced through small holder farmers
•	An estimated 2,000 tons of lemon grass oil to be achieved from nucleus farm annually, 8000 tons to be procured from small holder farmers
•	336,056 Mt of lemon grass leaves and roughly 200,000 Mt of ginger to be harvested/produced per annum from nucleus farm 1,344,224 Mt of lemon grass and roughly 900,000 Mt of ginger to be procured from small holder farmers
•	International quality standards for both product and packaging (mainly for tea products)
•	Local and International markets

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Lemon grass oil
Citral, an ingredient of lemongrass oil, has numerous uses, and can be further processed to possess a violet-like fragrance for perfumery, and as a source of vitamins A and E. lemongrass oil is also used for deodorants, waxes, polishes, detergents and insecticides where its low cost is attractive.
1. Cosmetics
lemongrass oil is used as a fragrance component in soaps, detergents, and cosmetics. it is also used in aromatherapy, and it improves circulation and muscle tone. astringent and toning, a lemongrass facial is administered through steam inhalation, it tightens, refines and firms a sluggish, lacklustre, oily skin. In aromatherapy it is used as tissue toner.
2. Pharmaceutical and therapeutic

5.	Perfumery uses 
Bath salts, soap basis, blends well with extract of rose, rose geranium or palmarosa, citrus, lime and orange.
