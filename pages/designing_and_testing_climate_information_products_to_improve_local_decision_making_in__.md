## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Designing and testing climate products to improve local decision making in response to climate change
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The challenge identified is that although the communities in El Salvador have experienced the impact of climate change, this has not necessarily translated into real knowledge about this phenomenon and its future projections. This lack of knowledge extends to local leaders and land users who are unaware of how to address these impacts in a way that builds long-term resilience, creating barriers to implementing adaptation strategies. The Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) is currently implementing a pilot project in a micro region called so called Ahuachapán Sur, particularly in the municipality of San Francisco Menéndez.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Embedded in the "Strengthening the climate resilience of rural communities in the ecosystems of Ahuachapán-Sur" project and being aware of these climate impacts on local actors and its negative implications for livelihoods and the landscape ecosystem, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) requested UNDP ELSV and its Lab to design, test and implement climate information products focused on the users that are fed with the extensive daily production of data collected by the Directorate of the Observatory on Climate Threats at the MARN. These products will be directed towards local actors, such as community leaders and farmers, which will allow them to identify and interpret key climatic events for the sector and the most productive and safe actions for their production, contribution to the food security and safety of community and their livelihoods, such as the beginning and end of the rainy season, adequate management of working days for planting, irrigation and harvesting, heat indexes for the proper management of livestock, fire risks, adequate time for the application of pesticides and fertilizers, among others.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the average and minimum temperature will vary considerably between the periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100 in all climate scenarios for El Salvador: this represents changes of 1ºC and 3ºC towards the end of the century. Temperature increases of such magnitude will have a direct effect on the temperature of the Pacific Ocean coast. These changes will affect 90% of the national territory.

El Salvador has been identified by IPCC as one of the countries with the highest sensitivity to climate change. According to the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC, the country is characterized by high exposure to geoclimatic threats, due to its location and topography, which aggravates the risk induced by climate change and the vulnerability of human settlements and ecosystems. The Global Climate Risk Index for the period between 1997 and 2016, places El Salvador in 16th place in the world.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Ahuachapán-Sur project includes as part of its components the commitment to develop 5 information climate products.  Since the UNDP Accelerator Lab in El Salvador uses R+D methodologies to develop and test public products and services, this provides a good fit to lead the design, development and testing of these climate information products using a human-centered approach. Gender and ethnic differences will be at the center of these developments, for there will be a product intended specifically for women and other designed specifically for indigenous populations.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The UNDP Accelerator Lab in El Salvador in alliance with MARN @MedioAmbienteSV uses its R+D capacities to design, develop and test climate information products for local leaders, farmers and cattle ranchers, to implement adaptation strategies to climate change.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What does it take for communities, local leaders and farmers to adopt climate information to sustain and adapt and enhance their livelihoods to climate change? What constitutes an effective climate information products? What are the most adequate means for local actors to consume climate information?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The simplest definition of a climate product is climate data + climate knowledge. To design these the climate products it is extremely important to empathize with the communities and local leaders to understand their climate information requirements to continue and enhance their livelihoods. This will be pursued by conducting ethnographic immersions and baseline surveys. These needs will be matched with the information that it is collected by the Observatory and these insights will be used to develop hypotheses to be tested through different forms of experiments, such as prototyping.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The main gap identified so far is not a lack of data per se, but a lack of adequate mechanisms and products to convey practical applications of climate data to communities, local leaders, farmers and ranchers.
