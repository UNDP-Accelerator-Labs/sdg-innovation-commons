## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Understand if this bicentennial generation is different from previous ones. If so, how? Does it express itself differently from previous ones? What motivates them? What outrages them? How do they learn and adapt to change? Who do they see as their role models or leaders? Understand how everyday life looks for the different groups within the bicentennial generation. Understand if this generation can lead a systemic social and political change in the country. How can UNDP support them?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we build bridges and honest relations with young changemakers throughout the country, we will increase youth engagement in social, political, and economic processes.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group
- Don't know

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We analyzed qualitative and quantitative data about youth. We used large quantities of data that enabled us to make more informed generalizations about youth, and understand how their opinions were shaped, their main concerns and how they organize. The interplay of innovation methods and the combination of unusual partners pushed us to constantly question and challenge our own assumptions and networks around changemaker youth, and also allowed us to refine and strengthen our method-game in order to make it replicable in other settings of changemakers youth. In other words, we approached this learning cycle with a growth mindset that focused on the questions and not on the solutions, and as such the solutions became more evident as we kept building on our new methods, data and partners.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

A group of young changemakers 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Our frontier challenge involved understanding the realities and challenges of young changemakers in Peru, which required carrying out in-depth interviews with experts on the topic as well as designing and carrying out a collective intelligence game involving over 300 changemakers. Given the subjectivity and specific experiences of young changemakers in the country, it made sense for the Lab to rely mostly on unstructured data. However, we also complemented this raw data with citizen data and social media data.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
