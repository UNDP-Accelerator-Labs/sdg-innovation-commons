> Brief description of the innovation

Traditional stencil printing was used to make the big 5 print on a fabric measuring 1m X 1m in size. It can be hung in an office, hotel/ lodge, home e.t.c.The artwork can be easily cleaned and very durable.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The artwork can be sold to locally and internationally to people who are lovers the Big 5 animals. In addition, it can be used for decorative  purposes. 
It will further enlighten citizens of this world to preserve the animals in our environment before they become extinct.

> Technical Feasibility

I had assembled discarded X rays into a 1 metre by 1 metre and cut out the design of the Big 5 in order to come up with a stencil.
The prototype is there. 
My proposed plan is to come up with my copies of the Big 5 animal print.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will bring awareness among people on how to co - exist with wildlife. In addition, the local and international people will have something to hung on their walls as an appreciation of the animals and a preserve for the future generations.
