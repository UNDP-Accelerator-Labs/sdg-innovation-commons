## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Willingness of a municipality is not enough for a successful partnership, organizational capacity should be sufficient.  2. People are generally keen to be included in participatory design projects (for public spaces). Local authorities should create a space for residents to take part in design and decision-making processes. Also, residents' understanding of and their capacity for meaningful engagement should be developed so that they fully understand the effects of their involvement in the process. 3. In Turkey, there are CSOs and design collectives who specialize in participatory methods and want to take part in these kinds of projects. They just don't know where to find them, so perhaps an online platform can bring these actors together. 4. Communication challenges arise when international partners are present and not everyone speaks fluent English. It gets worse when there is strong reliance on digital tools for facilitation. Face-to-face interactions are always preferred. Communication, in terms of language barriers between local partners and our Japanese partner has created an information gap since the designers could not directly interact with the stakeholders except UNDP and Urban Strategy (Kentsel Strateji). To overcome this challenge, AccLab had to intervene and act as a knowledge transfer point between the Municipality and our Japanese partner. As a result, building trust and common understanding between partners was challenging and there was a risk of coming up with a design which did not meet the local needs. 5. Sustainability planning is key for a public space's ownership, long-term maintenance, active utilization, etc. This step is usually not well understood and can lead to underutilized public spaces.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Participatory design is not a common practice in Turkey, especially in relatively small and disadvantaged regions. Municipalities usually stick to their multi-year plans (on which they were elected) and see participatory design projects as a burden since they involve extra work and bring in additional risks from their perspective. As a result, municipalities tend to stick to their usual ways of working rather than embrace the diversity and richness involved in participatory design processes. Our core partner (Gokceada Municipality) struggled at times to keep up with the pace and the requirements of the experiment. Their lack of capacity in terms of design, community building, coordination, PR, etc. proved to be a real challenge.    As an ‘optional’ practice, participatory design/planning/implementation is carried out as an ad-hoc activity rather than follow a codified process. As such, neither policy nor local practices allow for organic involvement/participation of citizens in relevant processes. In addition, citizens do not feel comfortable with demanding involvement as their knowledge and experience in this field are limited. A mindset shift is necessary to make sure citizens understand that it is their ‘right’ to get involved.    In terms of methods, due to the geographic distance of the partners and of course the pandemic-induced restrictions, we had to rely on digital tools exclusively. We anticipated some digital activity but certainly did not expect to do the whole thing online. Generally, projects carried out in this field require face-to-face communication, the participants' learning about digital tools used in the workshops and the organization of these workshops by the municipality created serious difficulties at first. This has also shown that participatory workshops can be conducted remotely but a lot more coordination and preparation are involved.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There was no previous experience of participatory design in Gokceada, participatory observation was therefore necessary and was the first method of data collection. We held focus group discussions to understand the expectations of the municipality and later conducted participatory workshops with some residents during which we collected qualitative data through discussions and surveys. In partnership with Urban Strategy Platform (Kentsel Strateji), we reviewed the literature as well to see other examples and establish the gaps and opportunities. Geospatial data were used to provide information to the design team about the site.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The above methods were all necessary since the experiment revolved around participatory urban design.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Marmara Municipalities Union (MMU) was one of our partners with whom we launched an open call to select a municipality. Here, the role of MMU was sharing its network ties and presence in the region and handling coordination with the municipality.  During the design phase, we worked with Urban Strategy (Kentsel Strateji), a consultancy firm founded by an academic, who facilitated most of the workshops with residents. Their role was to translate the data collected during workshops into a design brief that could be used by the Japanese partner Sotonoba.   Our latest partner is Architecture for All (Herkes Icin Mimarlik, an NGO set up by architects who specialize in participatory design methods, who coordinated the building work in September & October. Their involvement was deemed necessary due to the lack of design and implementation capacity at the municipality.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Sotonoba (our Japanese partners) is an urban design firm based in Tokyo. We had to work with them as per the agreement with the JCO (main donor in this project). Sotonoba was selected based on their expertise and experience in participatory public design.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Gokceada Municipality is one of our core partners. They are responsible for providing the site (to be developed), handling necessary planning approvals and coordination of the residents’ participation in the process.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All partners except MMU in this project are new to UNDP Turkey. The CO has worked with municipalities before but never with Gokceada Municipality. Urban Strategy (Kentsel Strateji), Architecture for All (Herkes için Mimarlık) are unusual partners and they were instrumental in the design and building processes, respectively.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We designed this project as a multi-partner learning experience in which each partner played a role in meeting specific needs. Sotonoba (the Japanese partner), Urban Strategy (Kentsel Strateji), and Herkes Icin Mimarlik (Architecture for All) are all unusual partners for UNDP and without their involvement it would have been very difficult to progress this much in a short period.    MMU with its extensive network enabled us to follow a strategy through which we invited interested parties to a new project rather than try to find one by approaching many municipalities directly. This saved us time and ensured that we had a willing and keen partner rather than a municipality that was merely interested but not invested enough. Gokceada Municipality, despite various disadvantages, had a site that met all our needs and a team of people who were enthusiastic.    Gokceada is a place of intense ethnographic diversity and contrasts. During the co-creation process, ethnographic data were used to design the workshops. Listening to the needs of local people from them directly enabled us to form a common language between the parties. Although the municipality had difficulties in promoting the project (and making it visible to the locals), the facilitators of the project (Urban Strategy and Architecture for All) made the process much more manageable for the municipality by using HCD and helping with developing a proof-of-concept which was then introduced to the locals.
