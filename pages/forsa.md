## Forsa App

Forsa is an innovative app aimed at reducing food waste by offering surplus meals from local restaurants at significantly discounted prices. It provides users with an affordable way to enjoy tasty food while supporting sustainability efforts. The platform connects consumers directly with eateries that have excess meals, helping them save money and reduce environmental impact at the same time.
