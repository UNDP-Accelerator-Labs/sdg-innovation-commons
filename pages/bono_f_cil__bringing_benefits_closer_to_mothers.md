What action learning plan is this activity related to?

The "Bono Fácil" experiment relates to an action learning plan focused on improving public service delivery and enhancing social protection mechanisms. The plan involves improving the accessibility and distribution of the Bono Juana Azurduy by utilizing mobile healthcare and financial units, aiming to ensure pregnant women receive both medical attention and financial benefits. The goal is to reduce barriers to access, promote prenatal care, and optimize the efficiency of government support programs for underserved populations

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The experiment aims to explore how mobile units can improve the distribution of the Bono Juana Azurduy, increase prenatal care access, and boost effective benefit collection. The objective is to assess whether decentralized, on-the-ground services make it easier for pregnant women to access healthcare and financial support.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is crucial as it addresses accessibility barriers faced by women in underserved areas. It provides a solution to improve health outcomes, reduce time and costs, and enhance the effectiveness of social protection programs

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF mobile units are deployed to provide healthcare services and facilitate the collection of the Bono Juana Azurduy in underserved areas, THEN it will reduce the time, cost, and logistical barriers for pregnant women, leading to increased access to prenatal care and a higher rate of effective benefit collection.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

he experiment was proposed as a way to demonstrate the benefits of using mobile units for distributing the Bono Juana Azurduy and improving access to prenatal care. However, due to a change in the director, the execution was not carried out, and it remained a proposed experiment rather than being implemented. Data collected prior to execution provided evidence that further experimentation was necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the mobile service model​

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Main Obstacles and Challenges:
Change in Leadership: A shift in the directorate halted the planned execution of the experiment.
Lack of Implementation: Although the proposal was well-documented, the experiment could not move beyond the planning stage.
Demonstration-Only Stage: The project remained a proposal, with data supporting its necessity, but no real-world testing.
Advice for Colleagues:
Secure Leadership Support: Ensure buy-in from key stakeholders early on.
Document Evidence Thoroughly: Use data to advocate for the necessity of the experiment.
Prepare for Transition: Develop continuity plans to ensure the project progresses despite leadership changes.
