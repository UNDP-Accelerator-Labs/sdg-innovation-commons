The ProFoodApp digitizes Namibia’s local and traditional food system flows thereby providing mapping, visualization and monitoring capacity to allow food to be easily located and procured at the local and regional levels and distributed to the end beneficiary in a more transparent and equitable manner.


The App acts as a “one-stop-shop approach” for local small-scale producers (e.g. women cooperatives & single producers) to procurement hubs and partners (e.g. Government, Semi-Government, Food aid programmes; Private sector) to end users (e.g. consumers and distributors of food parcels) and to end clients (e.g. beneficiaries).
