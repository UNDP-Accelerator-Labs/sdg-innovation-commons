> Title of the innovation

Farming enhances the knowledge of competitiveness skills and productivity. Animal farming helps you understand and create new ideas and techniques to make the agriculture business to flourish. Livestock farming help in generating a substantial income especially when you maximize it to its full potential and create a room for diversification

> Brief description of the innovation

The Organization (The big little farm).

Agriculture is key to success and Agriculture plays a critical role in the entire life of a given economy. Agriculture is the backbone of the economic system of a given country. In addition to providing food and raw material, agriculture also provides employment opportunities to a very large percentage of the population. Therefore, this programme is a continuous process which provide people’s needs in their daily lives and it is not an imaginary programme that will disadvantage others but rather a project that will accommodate people from all walks of life. Our mission is to build a successful business livestock foundation that will be able to contribute to the already stressed market and meet the current challenges that the market may be facing. This programme will also help in creating opportunities in the society and expand our business where we will be supplying meat products and also start to supplying agro products. This will motivate young people to develop interest in farming and top high in agriculture programmes.
In as much as we want to take animal farming as our long planned project, we have a 3.4 hectares of land FARM NO:32 which we acquired in 1996 in Kitwe and it was legally surveyed by the ministries of land and agriculture in 2013. We have been provided with the latter of offer. So it is our honor to take advantage of this piece of land. It is on this same land where we intend to keep livestock and we also have an area where we can build fishponds, which could also be used as the main source of water for livestock and other farming activities. We have about 30Goats, 20Pigs and approximately 20 small village chickens. Therefore we need financial support  to prepare the land and move the animals from where there are been kept in southern province. Our current monthly budget cannot meet all the necessary requirements, thus we seek assistance to boost the project that we have started. We are seven (7) in our group and amongst ourselves we have one differently abled male person and we intend to employ more people if we are successful.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Agriculture provides a livelihood for most people than any other industry, increased production in agriculture is an essential tool that can be used to grow rural and urban income. This will reduce the number of youth unemployment in rural and urban population. Livestock is one part of agriculture that contributes massively to the sectoral growth by providing labor, capital investment, revenue and market consumption. Agriculture plays an important role to reducing poverty since the majority poor live in rural areas and are largely dependent on agriculture. Livestock provides a substantial value to the sector and it is on high demand to the population, livestock, particularly poultry meat goat meat and pig meat consumption are growing faster. Since the population is concentrated along the line of rail and big cities, livestock products can be of great market to the consumers. 
When increase production of livestock products, it will make us to be self sufficient and be able to save money. Livestock also contribute to rural livelihood and employment as well as poverty reduction. For the majority poor, livestock provides them with a reserve against risks. And to some it a special role in traditional culture and this can be a capital assets. 
Our organization (the big little farm) we are trying to rebuild and rebrand the market from being market importers to market exporters. Livestock enterprise is on high demand, therefore, there is need to increase livestock production. 
Livestock farming will improve rural poor and also supplement to the already existing livestock businesses especially in the area along the line of rail and oh cities. 
With this market available, livestock products will grow to new heights and allow the business to flourish in terms of value addition. We intend to Harvest the livestock manure to feed the soil so as to grow vegetables and feed the fish.

> Technical Feasibility

We have designed our innovation in three (3) phases to expand on our capacity and operate on the strong foundation. 

Phase 1. To build the infrastructure on the farm 
Phase 2. (a).To move the livestock from where they are being kept to our permanent farm,  
                (b).Knowledge acquisition relating to livestock keeping and 
Phase 3. Increase on livestock productivity and also improve our skills.
                 
Under phase 1; We intend to build the infrastructure since we have land already and also to secure the title deeds while the infrastructure development is under way. We plan to build about a 1*40m piggery as well as 2*40m poultry and secure a 50*50sq m grazing land and to fence the whole farm. 
   
             (a). We plan to construct fishponds which will act as water reservoir for livestock and other farm activities, 
              (b). We also plan to build a concrete water tank that will provide safe drinking water.

Under phase 2; We want to move our animals from where they are being kept in southern province to where our land is in Kitwe. We also intend to acquire knowledge in livestock keeping and accommodate new skills and ideas. 

Under phase 3; With the vast knowledge acquired in phase 2, we want to apply the knowledge acquired  on the livestock so as to contribute to the challenges the market is currently facing and expand on influence and to making sure the image is established. Furthermore this will allow us to create more employment once we have a platform to conduct our business activities smoothly. 

This innovation will run from 3-5 years of its implementation and we are calling it THINK DIFFERENT

> Anticipated Social Impact

Livestock can improve the lives of the people in poverty alleviation, also the money that is generated from livestock products can also be used to service basic needs educational services healthcare services and many others. 
Livestock is relevant to current market, we therefore need to close the gap to current market in order to meet the livestock products deficits which the market may be facing, as well as to overturn the current business trends from being importers to the net exporters of the market.
