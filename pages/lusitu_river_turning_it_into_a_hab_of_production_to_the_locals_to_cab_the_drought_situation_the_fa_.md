> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation is to create three dams just right on the river. It should be built in a water fall like. Having three darms and name them  123. The reason for this innovation is that for a long time people in this earlier move long distance to fetch water both to drink and for cattle use.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The value additional for this facility.
1.It will reduce drought the local they are facing in the sense that they will have water through out.
2.They will no longer move long distance to the Zambezi River fetch water.
3.The late at which cattle die due to no water it will be a thing of the past.
4.Gardens that are done in small areas they will expand and grow more farm produce by doing so. They will be selling and growing through the year. Hence by doing so they will support there lives.sponcoring there children to schools.

> Technical Feasibility

My prototype is built in a such a way that water will be flowing in a water fall like to enhance continuity of water flowing. This is because water is wasted just like that direct into the Zambezi River minus being used for production.

> Anticipated Social Impact

1.It will reduce drought the local they are facing in the sense that they will have water through out.
2.They will no longer move long distance to the Zambezi River fetch water.
