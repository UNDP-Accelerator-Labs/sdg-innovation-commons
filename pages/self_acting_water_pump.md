Access to water is a challenge in rural areas, due to access to energy to supply water from the sources. Such pumping device has been used for nearly a century in rural indigenous community for lifting water to certain height, which is useful application for water pumping and supply to a community. This pump is powered by wind.

Constraint: From the pump, a particular hydram works under a particular range of drive flow and of drive height. If the drive height or drive flow is too low, the water has not enough energy to create a water hammer effect. If the drive height or the drive flow is too high, the energy of the water causes too much stress on the pump and reduces its life time.
