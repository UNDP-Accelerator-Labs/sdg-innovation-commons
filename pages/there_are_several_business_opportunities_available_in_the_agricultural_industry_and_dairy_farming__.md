> Title of the innovation

There are several business opportunities available in the agricultural industry and dairy farming is one of them. One good thing about the agriculture industry is that there is market for all the produce from the industry. A dairy farm is of course a thriving and profitable business because of usefulness of beef and milk. People eat beef, drink their milk, and use their fur and skin. With cattle milk, cheese can be made, along with other dairy products

> Brief description of the innovation

The Vision and aspiration is to come up with a diary ranch beginning with an initial 20 in calf dairy animals for supply of milk. There are several business opportunities available in the agricultural industry and dairy farming is one of them. One good thing about the agriculture industry is that there is market for all the produce from the industry. A dairy farm is of course a thriving and profitable business because of usefulness of beef and milk. People eat beef, drink their milk, and use their fur and skin. With cattle milk, cheese can be made, along with other dairy products .As an aspiring entrepreneur who is looking towards leveraging on the agriculture industry to generate huge income, one of my best bet is to start dairy farms business. Dairy farms business is all about mass – breeding of cattle (cows, oxen, bulls, bullocks, steers, heifers and calf et al) for the sole aim of generating raw milk in commercial quantities and of cause making profits. Market research and feasibility studies on dairy farming indicate that I am  likely going to struggle to sell my raw milk and other dairy products because there are loads of people out there who eat beef, drink milk and industries that make use of byproducts from cattle in manufacturing their products. Lastly, there are few barriers to entry into the dairy farms industry. Usually, all inputs are readily available.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our Vision is to become one of the leading dairy farms business brands not just in Mumbwa – Central Province, Zambia. Our mission is to sell our raw milk and other dairy farms products in commercial quantities locally and nationally. We want to build a dairy farms business that can favorably compete with other leading dairy farms brands in  Zambia. Our Business Grille Dairy Farms, is a dairy farms company that intend starting small in Mumbwa, Big Concession, but hope to grow big in order to compete favorably with leading dairy farms in the industry both in Mumbwa and Central Province of Zambia. We are aware of the importance of building a solid business structure that can support the picture of the kind of world class business we want to own. 
We will ensure that we hire people that are qualified, hardworking, dedicated, customer centric and are ready to work to help us build a prosperous business that will benefit all the stake holders (the owners, workforce, and customers).

As a matter of fact, profit-sharing arrangement will be made available to all our senior management staff and it will be based on their performance for a period of five years or more as agreed by the management of the dairy farms

> Technical Feasibility

Currently this innovation is on an  80hactare farm with 30heifers for beef but plans to invest more in dairy in calf cattle. Plan is to nurture dairy animals Friesian type that can produce 20 liters of milk each per day . translating into 400 litres for 20 animals in a day and this milk will be sold on a daily basis to Mumbwa Parmalat which is about 20kilometres from the farm. The expected revenue  daily flow will be ZMW10 by 400litres =ZMW4,000 and monthly revenue of  4000 x 30 =ZMW120,000. Part of this money will be used to pay workers  buy fuel , feed for the animals and medicines.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Development of this dairy farm will help create jobs for rural citizens in Mumbwa
