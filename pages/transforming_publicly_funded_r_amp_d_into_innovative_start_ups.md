Transforming publicly funded R&amp;D into innovative start-ups
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that the government invests significantly in research and development at science councils, universities, etc., however very little of this R&amp;D converts into innovative enterprises capable to creating jobs and growing the economy, thereby offering government a return on this investment. As valuable as the research is, it ends up lying on shelves and has little impact on improving the lives of people and the planet. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Efforts to market the innovations produced by publicly-funded universities are practiced in most advanced economies. They are seen as key vehicles to create sustainable jobs and advance emerging economies. However, many innovations are not patented or commercialized and this is certainly true for South African universities. Four main challenges to commercialization were identified: commercialization was not regarded as a high priority by senior university management; there is only a limited entrepreneurial culture within universities which meant, among other things, that research was not undertaken with commercialization in mind and therefore lacked market focus; funding for commercialization is lacking; and university-industry links are weak. 



Converting research results into innovations requires specialised skills. For many factors, most research never reaches commercialisation or success as a new product. It may be due to: A lack of human resources and skills; the time or environment may be inappropriate; and the infrastructure to do the conversion doesn’t exist. In Africa, for example, there is often a lack of funding to develop spin-off companies.

An important part of this growth of innovation requires the establishment of enabling environments within universities that will attract entrepreneurs and investors. While allowing researchers to do their work, it is often the entrepreneur who is not too closely involved in the research to see the opportunities — and often the investors — that can make research commercially viable and to bring it to market. That means, in effect, that the university needs to become an enabling pipeline from research to commercialisation. When the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Act was implemented, there was a suggestion that all universities should establish Technology Transfer Offices. There is also a strong network of hubs for entrepreneurs and academics to interact. However the conversion of R&amp;D into innovation commercialisation is still lacking. 

Patenting is not the only way to convert research into impact. If the engaged university is to work it needs to shift towards adding value to society. Commercialisation is an important step to ensure that society gets the full benefit of research and achieves impact. However, research is a process and can take several years to reach impact. Hubs (the conducive environment) and entrepreneurs are critical for impact. There is a need to focus on demand-led innovations (applied research). The university must use commercialisation for the benefit of society.

he Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has launched an enterprise unit to drive all aspects of its technology commercialisation. CSIR C3, pronounced as CSIR C-Cubed, aims to accelerate the pace and increase the scale of the commercialisation of the organisation’s technologies and intellectual property (IP). https://www.itweb.co.za/article/csir-sets-up-special-purpose-tech-entity/raYAyqorZBeMJ38N

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



As the Accelerator Lab we have, over the last 4 years, and in our previous careers, dealt closely with researchers, innovators, and potential investors. We understand the challenges and opportunities, and have the networks to bring these parties together for mutual benefit. AccLabbers are also innovators themselves, so they know first hand what the challenges are to commercialise IP, and ideas around potential solutions.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?





What are the hurdles in transforming Publicly funded R&amp;D into commercial entities for youth entrepreneurs, and what innovative mechanisms are needed to overcome them. 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



These methods will be used to ascertain from public researchers and public institutions, what hurdles exist to commercialising IP. This may take the form of focus groups, surveys, dialogues, behavioral studies, examples of success and failure, etc.  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



These data sources will help us understand what the hurdles are in IP commercialization (from publicly funded research), and potential solutions that could address them. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



We are already working with the Dept of Science and Innovation, who oversees all public funded research in the country. We will also be working closely with the beneficiaries - emerging innovators - to help solve the various challenges.
