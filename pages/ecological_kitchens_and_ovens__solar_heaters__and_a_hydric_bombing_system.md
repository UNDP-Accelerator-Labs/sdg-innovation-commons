The Puna region is an area of the altiplano with multiple agroecological characteristics and usage capabilities. The main energy source for its inhabitants is plant-based fuel. They collect the scarce firewood available to cook and keep their houses warm. This, along with excessive animal grazing, has a toll on the environment, contributing to damaged and deforested areas that are increasingly exposed to wind and water erosion. In terms of heating, the traditional firewood kitchen is highly inefficient and dangerous.  Another consequence of the harsh conditions in the region is water scarcity. Due to the lack of superficial sources, community members resort to manual extraction techniques to access underground water. The constant need for water, not only for domestic use but also for the animal herds, makes the physical labor of it even more considerable. This project seeks to address these problems by embracing the indigenous knowledge latent in their communities and implementing adequate technologies that can improve these families’ well-being and the overall environmental balance.   To achieve this, the project entails: the development of hydric infrastructure projects that can provide water to the community through a bombing system to extract, conduct and store underground water; the construction of cost-efficient kitchens that will allow to evacuate smoke, save time and distance collecting fire-wood, and minimize deforestation; and the installation of 2 solar heaters to provide hot water to families for domestic use.   Finally, this initiative also will provide training and technical assistance to meet the objective of promoting sustainable, culturally adapted practices and recovering ancestral techniques.
