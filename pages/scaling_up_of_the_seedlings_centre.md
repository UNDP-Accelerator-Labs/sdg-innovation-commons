> Brief description of the innovation

Yeathu is currently operating a micro seedings centre, it is anticipated that with support from UNDP, Yeathu would partner with a local supplier of good quality vegetable seeds to scale up production of seedlings . The seedling centre will distribute seedlings to women and youth farmers in the proposed districts of chongwe and Lusaka as a form of out grower scheme. Yeathu anticipates having a constant supply of high value crops via a coordinated and scheduled planting system by engaging farmers.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Yeathu is already in production and sales of seedlings and demand for the products is on the  rise as the quality of seedlings is outstanding. It is for this reason that we seek to expand production base with support from the challenge prize and will further add on services at a fee to farmers within chongwe and Lusaka. Yeathu will provide on farm incorporated technical services with focus on smart agriculture practices in the vegetable production process. Yeathu will offer the following technical services: 
a)	Create awareness on the health and environmental hazards associated with the use of pesticides and promote the use of environmentally friendly bio-pesticides;
b)	Promote good agricultural practices;
c)	Different irrigation methods including access to irrigation equipment; and
d)	Provide trainings on how to make farm enterprises run as a business.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently utilizing a backyard seedling structure of 50,000 production capacity per month translating into K25,000 per month. With more funding support to meet the increased demand production capacity can be increased to 200,000 seedlings per month translating into K100,000 per month. The plan is to engage local workmanship to put up a greenhouse with larger dimensions

> Anticipated Social Impact

Improved livelihoods from farmers incorporating good agriculture practices from the agriculture trainings that will be offered by yeathu. Time spent in accessing inputs and seedlings will also be reduced translating into more time spent on the farm and increased productivity leading to more sales and income.
