Eradicate poverty in rural and urban areas through agriculture and livestock rearing

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Agriculture is the cultivation of land in preparation for planting crops and the rearing of livestock.our innovation focuses on ending poverty in rural areas . With agriculture we can sell our produce in exchange for what we need (oil,soap). With agriculture everyone (young/old) are kept busy because every crop has a season therefore less crimes and less hunger.With agriculture we can make our own animal feeds.Our target market is general marketeers, restaurant and shopping complexes. With the prize we will accomplish our plan and aim to end poverty.And our value addition is that we do not cut trees unnecessarily but instead plant crops and stock a variety of crops.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation plan work is done by ourselves by organising ourselves in groups.We prepare the field for plantation,buy the seeds (vegetable seeds,maize, sunflower,soya beans),then plant the seeds and maintaining the crops till harvest thereafter selling the produce and sharing the profit .We intend to have a small chicken run of 50 village chickens,buy feed and later sell the eggs they have laid

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our agricultural and livestock rearing innovation promotes good health because the produce is locally grown and it leads to food security in the country and also leads to the continuous supply of produce on the market. Our innovation stops youth loittering and keeps them occupied and promotes local grown products and brands and through livestock rearing ,local butchers are well supplied.
