## 

Women´s movements have conquered rights and transformed the lives of women and girls; however, aging process has been left almost unquestioned.
While we participate in an endless number of activities, when aging, we´re left with little choices other than private solutions: either payed residences or care services, or family based caregiving.


The House of Elder Artists, or Thea, a cooperative of women writers, artists, community activists have organized an unretirement home. It is a nonprofit residence and cultural center in Manhattan with 100 rental apartments, many reserved for people of low to modest means. It has a partenership with the Women's Housing and  Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to  women's housing issues.
