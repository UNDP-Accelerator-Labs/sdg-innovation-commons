> Brief description of the innovation

Chuuma is a mobile and USSD micro-savings platform targeted at Zambian millennials. Chuuma democratized access to premium financial investment products and an understanding of how to use. We leverage technology and investment management to re-imagine how financial planning, savings, and investment products are delivered to the masses.
Chuuma allows individuals to save little amounts of money periodically. It takes away the stress by combining simplicity, discipling, convenience, and flexibility. It brings investment opportunities to the retail investor that doesn't have access to the best that the financial system in Zambia has to offer.
Chuuma gives retail investors an easy way to grow their money by investing in fixed deposits, unit trusts, treasury bills, and government bonds.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Chuuma will generate returns for investors and savers primarily through investments in Zambian government securities, such as bonds and treasury bills. The revenue will be generated through asset management and from the float that will be generated by the balances through the partner banks.
A rising number of yound Zambians have accesss to mobile phones and internet services. However they lack accesss to financial planing and savings products and an understanding of how to use them. Current solutions service a niche populations in the country, leaving room for a huge market that is currently underserved. Chuuma hopes to fill this gap.
To assure investors that Chuuma will not become another Ponzi scheme, we will be regulated and authorized by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hence our need for the challenge prize.

> Technical Feasibility

Chuuma works in the following way:
1. Users sign up in less that 3 minutes on the Tisunge Mobile App or USSD
2. Users go through an assessment to determine knowledge and risk appetite.
3. Users are presented with fit-for-purpose savings and investment plans as well as various fixed deposits to choose from.
4. Based on their selection, automated savings and investment plans are created and linked to savings goals.
5. Users monitor their plans and returns in real-time and continue saving and investing.

> Anticipated Social Impact

In an emerging market country like Zambia where economic volatility is a way of life, there aren’t a lot of relatively safe options for members of the burgeoning middle class to park their money. Chuuma will give Zambian investors a safe and convenient way to save their money on financial instruments with returns high enough to absorb and still provide a healthy return for investors.
