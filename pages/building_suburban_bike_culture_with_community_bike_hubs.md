> Description of the solution

There is significant untapped potential for cycling in suburban neighborhoods. The Center for Active Transportation (TCAT) uses an innovative, evidence-based approach to incubating cycling in suburban communities through community bike hubs. Community bike hubs are spaces where people can learn more about cycling, meet other people who cycle, and go cycling together. They offer bike loans, bike mentorships, earn-your-bike programs, and guided rides, to encourage people to adopt cycling in areas where few people cycle. By addressing significant barriers in suburbs outside of infrastructure, the approach can accelerate cycling adoption and grow a cycling community. TCAT‚Äôs community bike hub approach is based on a four-step approach that other suburban communities can replicate: 1) find the neighborhood, 2) identify local barriers, 3) remove barriers and start cycling, and 4) keep cycling. In total, they have launched six community bike hubs in four jurisdictions (Peel Region, Scarborough, Markham, and Newmarket), each with positive results.
