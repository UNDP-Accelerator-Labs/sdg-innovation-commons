> Type of the Solution

Policy/Regulation

> Affected Sector

Transportation

> Description of the solution

A stricter variation of the Low-Emission Zone (LEZ), the Ultra-Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) enforces even more stringent emission standards for vehicles entering the designated urban area. This aims to significantly reduce air pollution from vehicle traffic.

> Socio-economic effects

Significant improvement in air quality, potential reduction in respiratory illnesses, discourages high-polluting vehicles, may require short-term economic adjustments for businesses/individuals

> Type of Measure

- 3. mitigation measures

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- local government

> Timescale of implementation

- long-term (5 and above)

> Other Notes

ULEZ operates within the broader LEZ zone in London. Specific emission standards and enforcement details may vary.
