> Title of the innovation

Sunflower cooking oil / Cosmetic shop

> Brief description of the innovation

Sunflower cooking oil. I buy sunflower seeds from farmers in Kalomo, 50kg bug which gives me a 10 litres of sunflower oil. 
My good plan is to buy 50kgs in bulk so it can manage my area and even start selling on a large scale. 
Secondly, if I can have my own chigayo for making oil I can even open my own small company, buy empty bottles and label them my company name and start selling on a large scale.

For Cosmetic and beauty shop, I want to have a one stop shop for cosmetic and beauty shop for everyone in town.  In our town we only have few cosmetic shops.
