In order to secure the livelihoods of traders in the informal sector, the CO, through its Accelerator Lab, launched an e-commerce pilot project in May 2020 to connect informal traders with consumers, especially given the break in supply chains during the lockdown implemented to curb the spread of the coronavirus. (www.tambula.com). The pilot aimed to assess how market vendors whose only clients were walk-ins, could reach a wider range of customers via an online shopping platform. 


After a three month pilot in the central region (Khomas  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khomas_Region), the digital solution is expanding to a second region (Erongo  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erongo_Region). 


Given the success of the pilot to date, UNDP and the project counterpart has negotiated with an additional 15 vendors who have signed up in the Erongo region to participate in the expanded pilot.
