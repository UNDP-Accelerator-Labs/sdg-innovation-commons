The aim is not sticking to the same formula but come up with more formulas due to the huge capacity and quality of the machinery, rendering expansion support firms, farmers that supply ingredients such as maize grain. The challenge prize will help the firm secure the transportation of product in order to supply the product around the country, secure our stock among others.

> Technical Feasibility

Production may be costy, although with the little resources we have we request that you send observers to view the machinery and the manufacturing process, in order for us to come up with a sample product. We are highly confident that we can deliver the product with less challenges. Our past dealings documention with Zra and zabs may speak on our behalf.
