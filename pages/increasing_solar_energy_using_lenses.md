> Title of the innovation

Increasing Solar Energy Using Lenses

> Brief description of the innovation

Solar power works by converting light from the sun into electricity. More sunlight means the batteries connected to the solar will charge at a faster rate.
A lens is a transmissive optical device that focuses a light beam by means of refraction.
Using the information above, we can use lenses to increase the the amount of sunlight (photons) at falls onto the solar panels hence we may increase the rate at which batteries get fully charged by solar. 
Since solar panels are expensive to manufacture, they cost a lot of money to buy hence my country or the world at large has failed to mostly depend on solar even though solar energy is renewable energy and it doesn't affect the environment (climate change).
Using Lenses to focus more light on the solar panels means that we can make more energy with fewer solar energies to generate electricity.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We could be able to generate an income in the same way other power companies generate income. This is by this is by charging certain amounts of money to all the households and industries using our electricity. The amount of money being collected should depend on how much electricity someone used.
We may also charge a certain amount of money to anyone (company or Government) who wants to use our method to generate electricity.

> Technical Feasibility

The instruments or apparatuses needed needed for this project are lenses, solar panels, inventers and batteries.
The lenses should be pressed above the solar panels at a distance were maximum light could be refracted and focused on the lenses.
Solar panels to convert sunlight energy to electrical energy (electricity).
Inventer. The electricity invented by solar panels from the sun is DC electricity. The inverter changes or converts the DC energy to AC energy which may be used in our household.
Batteries. To store electric energy.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Seeing that we recently had continuous blackouts in my country (2019-2020) because of low water levels at Kariba dum, our country needs new innovative methods to generate electricity hence this project is what the country needs to generate electricity more efficiently and we as a country may taken a stand in fighting climate change.
Using this method will make our country never to face blackouts in the way that we did in 2019 and 2020. People need electricity all around the world hence this project may take a very big lead to making electricity available and more efficient to everyone. 
Seeing that solar energy is one of the safest and clean generation of electricity in the world, this method may take improve our lives and that of nuaure since it fights climate change. 
This is a renewable source of energy hence it will be affordable and clean energy to the people.
