## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Exploring local solutions and innovations to inform experiments for scaling and national development under the SIDS offer - Regenerative Tourism, Blue Economy and Digital Transformation.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that local solutions or innovations are not being leveraged to inform and influence national economic growth to offset the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic and post pandemic recovery.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic to national priorities has created  economic hardships and inequalities that existing programmes and/or government support is not fully addressing. For example: ·       The closing of international borders has heavily impacted international tourism and for Samoa’s case (where up to 25% of GDP was generated from tourism)  saw a rapid decrease of unemployment and the hospitality industry dry up. ·       The general elections that took place in April 2021 – divide in Samoa with regards to political and social structures – misinformation and misuse of democratic processes became apparent thus impacting community trust towards government institutions. The unforeseen consequence of this is the lack of community ownership towards development progress of national priorities ·       The reintroduction of the Regional Seasonal Employment (RSE) scheme between Australia and New Zealand with Samoa has created a labour drain for Samoa – informal sector is severely hindered from growing   Shrinking economy and loss of livelihood has forced people to be more creative around the use of natural resources especially sea resources. Exodus of skilled and unskilled workers are pushing businesses to look for alternate sources of talent development and retention. In this developing scenario, the Accelerator Lab will take a lead at charting local solutions and/or innovations that  are already playing a role in post pandemic covid recovery. The intention is to map these local solutions so that connections and an innovation network can be created and built to: 1)    Align within the SIDS offer as well as UNDP’s comparative advantages for better funding matching; and 2)    For the Accelerator Lab to design and test experiments that can be successfully scaled at the national level with the support of the government.

Samoa’s Ministry of Finance in its quarterly review has noted a significant rise in prices, no income from tourism arrivals and a 0.2% decrease in formal employment. The year on year inflation reached 5.4% in August 2021. The import component was up 8.7% (the highest number since 2010), while the local component was up by 2%. The main contributors: imported food (especially chicken), medicine (amoxicillin tablets), and fuel (petrol, diesel and kerosene).   The 2017 Labour Force Survey conducted by the Samoa Bureau of Statistics recorded the national unemployment rate at 14.5%. Women are more affected by unemployment at 21.3% and men at the rate of 10.1%. Covid has seen a decrease in formal employment that also correlates with the RSE scheme.   The tourism industry before the closure of all international borders was thriving on a year by year basis with the highest number of tourists from New Zealand and Australia. Most common reasons for tourists from New Zealand and Australia to visit Samoa has been to visit friends and family. Over the past years, the Samoan diaspora has proven to be the most lucrative tourist to Samoa.

Since the rise of inflation, there has been a gradual pass-through to the local inflation from the high import inflation as well as from the impact of high shipping rates in the next few months. We are seeing a weak local economy, with limited income/growth opportunity (from the prolonged impact of the COVID crisis) and higher prices. That means smaller real disposable income, lower consumption/production/investment, lower growth, and lower revenue for a government facing an increasingly smaller fiscal space for development financing.  In addition to the abovementioned, the private sector is struggling with the following challenges: §  Negotiating with suppliers and freight companies for cost effective shipping pricing. Covid-19 has shifted the negotiating power to international shipping companies. In addition, government of the day is not as supportive and well versed in the issues, further causing inflation household groceries – companies and retailers in Samoa are pushing the extra costs of supply and shipping towards the public. §  Formal employment has decreased due in part to Covid-19 in the tourism industry but also major retail businesses, where the reinitiating of the RSE scheme has seen a rise in a labour drain not only from the communities but also from the private sector. As a result, majority of those left behind are the young and the old and women; §  Since the elections, trust in government institutions has changed locally and public perception and interaction with the government has also seen a disconnect between citizens and its government. This is more so in the public sector or civil servants. As a consequence, the general public are less trustful of government institutions making communities less open to working partnerships with donor/development partners in implementing sustainable programmes for economic and social growth.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The nature of the setup of the Accelerator Lab is what this challenge requires. The ability for the lab to carry out mapping, design, and experiment sprints both independently and within the innovation space can be a key feature in developing much needed clarity and new points of entry for economic recovery. We can engage directly with the relevant stakeholders to understand and develop local resources and talent that not only boosts the economy and skills development but also make Samoa shock proof in the future and adapt to external threats and challenges such as the impact of Covid-19, climate change, global price fluctuations and so forth.   However, currently the national priorities and investment has mostly been focused on developing partnerships and agreements for e.g., the RSE scheme, that while it has boosted and maintained the rate of remittances received, it has hindered national development in Samoa's primary industries such as agriculture, regenerative and innovative tourism including growing of its private sector. In the absence of the traditional work force, employers (for e.g. Digicel and Hotel operators within Samoa) are exploring new sources of labor. We are already seeing a strong signal around this across all industries.   Investing in this challenge means that the Accelerator Lab will be able to scope out and test new approaches, solutions, and avenues for growth, scalability of skills and employment, which can be pitched to relevant Government Ministries for national scaling. This also creates an opportunity to create more robust and inclusive partnerships with the private sector, which is in spite of creating significant employment, is not involved in the policy level decision making

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

1. How can we leverage small scale and/or micro innovations to influence positive growth and implementation of national priorities under the SIDs offer? 2. How can we enhance and foster the local markets (tourist, entrepreneurs etc) to boost the growth of the local economy? 3. Where and how can we identify and engage with the skills and knowledge in the informal sector to inform national growth in its priorities?  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will be undertaking a national solutions mapping exercise to identify and tag potential solutions or innovations that have real potential and where relevant can be made into examples of positive deviance to inform economic growth as well as informing national policy areas in relevant priorities. In the process of conducting our solutions safari, we intend to utilize ethnography in particular the use of a time-use survey, micro narratives incorporated into consistent horizon scans to pull the relevant qualitative data and information. The intention is to also bring together the mapped solutions and its innovators under one roof and to connect them to the appropriate private sector, civil sector and donor funding opportunities.  In the absence of the traditional work force, many employers are looking at women who are currently out of the workforce to engage them. Currently Samoa does not have a care support system, which means women bare the lion’s share in taking responsibility of care for young and elderly. However, when the programs to upskill, empower or enterprise women are made, they ignore the most crucial resource – Time that these women have, There is no data available in the pacific on this aspect.   AccLab will work on the first of its kind, to understand time availability and therefore inform on means to engage women in the workforce. Solutions Safari – It is our way of mapping out the micro-innovations already happening on the island and develop insights on leveraging them for informing national policies. Solutions platform – To present the micro-solutions and insights to the national government, private sector and development partners for growth and scaling. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data currently available showcases the impact of Covid-19 and other political issues on the economy of Samoa. What it does not provide are potential solutions at the local level that can be prototyped and tested for scaling to counter some of the impacts of Covid-19. Emphasis at the government and development partner level is focused on providing solutions from the top down rather than the process being inclusive to allow for community level interventions and influence to inform decision making on enhancing economic growth.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The direct beneficiaries of the this challenge would be the private sector in particular the tourism industry. Significant collaborators on this challenge would be the relevant government ministries as the results of this learning would inform new ways of moving forward in terms of decision making and policy frameworks.

Samoa AccLab has explored several areas to gain clarity on how local solutions and innovation can be leveraged to inform potential experiments under the SIDS offer. These include but are not limited to the (i) Rapid time use pilot study, (ii) Samsung Solve for Tomorrow Innovation Challenge, (iii) 100% Fish Use project and the (iv) Collective Intelligence Design Studio for Biodiversity. To date, Samoa AccLab has completed its rapid time use pilot study. The rapid time-use appraisal is one of the first of its study to be conducted in the Pacific and in particular Samoa. The study will serve as a baseline framework of the importance of carrying out time-use studies to provide insights and recommendations to leverage and accelerate gender specific outcomes particularly within the area of economic intervention programmes. In addition, insights gained from the study will not only be used to develop a framework for rapid time-use in Samoa and the Pacific, but it will also be used to inform development programmes
