## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.      Frugal entrepreneurship has many potentials to accelerate the efforts towards sustainable development. Among many, it contributes to the creation of an inclusive market for the underserved, the advancement towards a circular economy, food security, and increasing community development and resilience. 2.      Community composting is successful in Syria because of the high need that is a result of the 11 years crisis. Although the materials were available before the crises, Framers preferred to use chemical fertilizers because of their accessibility and affordability.   3.      One way to ensure the sustainability of a community composting project is for an NGO to adopt it as an extra-revenue generator. This way we ensure that the compost will be available and affordable for community farmers and the income generated from selling is used to support the NGO service provision. 4.      Farmers in Syria are turning to green alternatives to compensate for the scarcity of Agri-inputs. Therefrom, there is a great opportunity to encourage farmers to adopt environmentally-friendly farming and regenerative agriculture methods. Farmers are now more open and aware of the benefits of using organic and regenerative agriculture inputs. If the opportunity is not seized there is a great risk that farmers will go back to using chemical fertilizers and chemical Agri-inputs once they become available and affordable again. 5.      A very interesting finding is that farmers were using digital platforms to learn about new methods of farming and alternatives for Agri-inputs. This confirms the importance of digital inclusion for socio-economic development. Digital inclusion is the topic of our next challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Frugal entrepreneurship is a new concept, it was challenging at first to demonstrate what distinguishes frugal entrepreneurship from other types of entrepreneurship.  Another barrier we faced is the hard-to-reach areas. It was challenging for us to be there with farmers on site. That is why we trained 8 local mentors to guide and provide technical support to targeted farmers.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Each type of the data used complemented or closed the gap that the other types had

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

1. Co-creation was important for us to involve various community members to ensure that the solutions adopted are harmonious with their actual needs. 2. Mentors supported frugal entrepreneurs in identifying their MVP to ensure sustainability f their frugal businesses.  3. The first thing we did was to look for the positive deviant farmers who later helped in making the scares agri-inputs available in their community. Moreover, these positive deviants inspired other farmers to act and find solutions to their challenges.  4. To understand the scale of the need and how the community is interacting with it we did a solutions mapping safaris during different phases of the learning cycle. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

A grassroot organization in the coastal area. They were our partners in implementing the community composting. They were trained on how to make liquid and dry compost and how  manage composting sites. They started selling the compost to farmers in need with affordable prices. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Agriculture engineering university, although not directly but we trained 8 graduates on frugal entrepreneurship and they later mentored farmers (who are frugal entrepreneurs) and provided technical consultations. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Agriculture ministry , they provided us with technical consultations and approvals needed to publish our community composting guide. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The students and the farmers themselves.  Also, although working with NGOs is not new to UNDP but this time the approach was different. This time the NGO was a partner not only in implementation but also in design. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

we are still trying to share our findings and guide with FAO 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

It enabled iterative learning, with each phase, each new method and each new partner we learned something new that allowed to move forward
