## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Working on the development of green criteria for procurement of paper (for printing and photocopying), electric energy from sustainable sources and computers, monitors, tablets and mobile/smartphones, we learned that addressing the critical environmental impacts results in no or minimal additional cost increases. For complex products, such as IT equipment, more comprehensive green criteria options are available, for which the market in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not ready. Product lifetime extension, management of hazardous substances, equipment end-of-life management etc., requires systemic support to the private sector to fulfil such procurement requirements. 2. The online event on presenting "Recommendations for inclusion of green requirements in public procurement in Bosnia and Herzegovina" report, which captured learnings from this experiment, was surprisingly attended by some 170 public procurement specialists throughout the country. Such an interest of the public sector on this voluntary procurement mechanism, and results of the pool during the event on the public procurement specialists' level of knowledge on green procurement (0% very knowledgable, 14% significant knowledge, all remaining some to no knowledge) indicates a strong need for capacity building. There is a need to design and deliver basic/introductory and advanced training programmes in green public procurement and expand the pool of experts who can provide such training. There is also a need to explore options for providing help desk services to contracting authorities in preparing tender documentation with green criteria included.  3. We witnessed great interest of companies participating in the public procurement processes in possible changes towards utilization of green criteria. There is a need to create networking opportunities to foster information exchange, peer-to-peer interaction and capacity building of public servants, civil society organizations and the private sector in this area. It is of utmost importance to consult and have dialogues with suppliers openly and transparently so that green criteria are not unrealistic for the current and future market. 4. Building on this initial research (which included the EU work on GPP) and considering the inputs from main institutional partners, there is a need to comprehensively analyze, develop a roadmap and facilitate transposition of priority legal and policy frameworks to the local legislation. 5. The learning process was backed by the Directorate for Public Procurement of the Republic of Slovenia. The exchanges between public procurement specialists from Bosnia and Herzegovina with the director-general of Slovenian Public Procurement Directorate demonstrated a clear need to facilitate further knowledge exchange among procurement institutions from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the neighbouring European Union member states (Slovenia and Croatia).

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The general public and private companies have little confidence in the public procurement system in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Public procurement is considered the primary mechanism for corruptive practices and irresponsible spending of public funds. That's why our institutional partner was very reluctant in including new green criteria in their procurement processes - especially for qualifications criteria, which might be found as "discriminatory on purpose" to prefer a specific bidder.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The stakeholders in the public procurement system in Bosnia and Herzegovina are some 2.700+ contracting authorities (public institutions, organizations and companies) and 25.000+ economic operators participating as bidders. We wanted to find out the interest on the topic on both sides, the experience with green procurement practices, which stems from secondary legislation (e.g. laws that stipulate energy-efficiency measures), knowledge and capacities in this area. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The extensive body of knowledge on EU Green Public Procurement exists but applies to legislation and practice of member states according to their market and public sector maturity. We examined the green public procurement systems in neighbouring EU member states, their challenges, and their solutions to promote green procurement; to understand the prospects for its advancements options in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Several public and private companies participated in a learning event on green public procurement; our Energy and Environment sector and Accelerator Lab organized to unveil the "Recommendations for inclusion of green requirements in public procurement in Bosnia and Herzegovina." It was the opportunity to listen to how companies perceive green procurement and what problems they foresee when advancing green criteria utilization. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Our leading partner was the Office for Common Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina state institutions. Due to the nature of their work, this Office has a significant and diverse procurement portfolio. We overviewed products and services the Office regularly procured and analyzed their greening potential. We developed recommendations for green procurement criteria for all products and services groups identified, including the options for alternative greening approaches (e.g. how to minimize procurement of paper with some procedural measures). The final result was creating a standard tender dossier with green criteria (the tender qualification and award criteria and technical specifications) for three products and services identified as priority ones: printing and photocopying paper, electrical energy and IT equipment.     We also collaborated with the Slovenian Directorate for Public Procurement to exchange their experiences, impediments, and solutions for green procurement with procurement specialists from Bosnia and Herzegovina. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

None.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The process was fully co-implemented with our Energy and Environment sector team, which is now taking the lead in scaling up this pilot.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The pilot was a learning-by-doing exercise that helped us quickly validate our assumptions. We managed to identify how to conduct green public procurement within the current legislative framework (which doesn't recognize green procurement) and unlock it without going through the complete policy cycle. We identified the policy agenda for a systemic shift in this area.
