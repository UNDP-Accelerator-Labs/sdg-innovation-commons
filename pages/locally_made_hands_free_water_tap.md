A community in Thyolo have developed a low cost hands free solution for washing hands as a general hygiene and COVID 19 preventative measure.  Each household or community meeting space has a bucket of water, a plastic bottle with holes underneath and a long wire handle perched on a piece of wood nailed in the ground. Anyone who wants to wash their holds the bottle by the wire handle, dips it in water and hooks the wire on the wood to create a free flowing water tap
