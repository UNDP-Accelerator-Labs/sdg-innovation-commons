## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The objective of this experiment is to investigate the energy savings potential of heat leaks and loss in households, test participatory energy audit models’ effectiveness in increasing willingness of households to act for investing/repairing beyond awareness and figure out ways and methods to close the knowledge-action gap in residential energy efficiency. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H-1: If minor heat leaks beyond major wall insulation can be detected by thermal audits, then it would verify more scalable solutions conducted by DEEE H-2: If households have lower income/socio-economic standing, then they would have more heat leaks and loss due to lower quality of materials/poor design used in construction of windows, doors, and heating systems H-3: If energy efficiency audits (with hand-held thermal cameras) coupled with simple, affordable, individual efficiency enhancement recommendations are executed in a participatory manner, then they would enable further awareness and trigger more action for investing in energy efficiency in households as opposed to traditional awareness-raising tools (brochures, audio-visual materials, TV spots etc.) H-4: If the main reasons for knowledge-action gap in residential energy efficiency can be identified, then we can put forth an objective finding in/validating the general market perceptions relating to knowledge-action gap

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Applications will be collected through JOTFORM from interested households to schedule audit visits. In parallel, DEEE will kick-off audits at the households in their existing network. Thermal Camera Audits for heat leaks and loss at households will be carried out in a participatory manner with residents and an online Household Energy Efficiency Survey (JOTFORM) will be conducted with household respondents to collect demographic, socio-economic, and energy efficiency data as well as pre-post tests on the level of awareness and willingness for investment. Upon analysis of the collected data, identification of correlations and relationships between units of data, results will be assessed to in/validate the hypotheses. After a period of time, there will be a Follow-up Call/Survey to investigate the effectiveness of the audit recommendations on repairs.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

H-1: Number of minor heat leaks per household, User-friendliness of thermal cameras, Effectiveness of thermal cameras in detection of heat leaks, Duration of audits per household (m2/minutes)  H-2: Rate of heat leaks in high income households/low-income households  H-3: % of meaningful difference between the results of baseline survey &amp; experiment post-audit survey and follow-up calls  H-4: Correlation between households’ motivations in investing and reluctance in investing in EE even after audits. Additional aspects to be analysed: *EE saving potentials in different household groups (families, students, shared flats, individuals). *Correlations between income level/educational status/occupations and level of EE awareness/willingness to act. *Difference between pre-post survey results regarding level of EE awareness/willingness to act. *Major types of household heat leaks/loss, type of heating systems, household sizes. *Major heat leak/breach types including but not limited to on external air vents/walls/windows/doors.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

A combination of online JOTFORM survey and thermal camera devices will be utilized for data collection. Data on heat leaks/breaches and loss will be visualized through the thermal camera device compatible with mobile phones to produce images of heat leaks/loss on doors, windows, walls and air vents. JOTFORM survey will be instrumental to figure out the level of EE awareness and willingness to repair/invest through pre-post tests and collect data on socio-economic, demographic, educational and housing background of the participating households as well as producing solid efficiency improvement recommendations for households visited by auditors. Follow-up e-mails and calls will be employed to track repairs/investments in residential heat saving.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

BACKGROUND

-       Under the collaboration of UNDP Türkiye Accelerator Lab and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MoENR), the “Experiment on Participatory Handheld Thermal Camera Audits and Energy Efficiency Surveys in Households” was implemented in Ankara metropolitan area with the participation of 222 households with different socio-economic backgrounds. This experiment aimed to investigate the knowledge-action gap in energy efficiency in households and test the effectiveness of participatory awareness raising activities in triggering behavioral change.

-       Walk-through heat audits were conducted with the participation of household residents by using handheld thermal cameras plugged in mobile phones. Pre-post audit surveys and a follow-up survey were conducted with the participants. All hypotheses are proven.

 

WALK-THROUGH AUDITS AND HANDHELD THERMAL CAMERAS

-       Mobile thermal cameras plugged in mobile smartphones are proven to be easy-to-use, effective, and time-efficient in conducting walk-through heat audits at households. 87% of experts recommended the use of mobile thermal cameras in walk-through audits due to its ease-of use and effectiveness. This awareness raising modality proved effective to be replicable in other settings with expansion of geographical scope and different target groups such as universities, public buildings, industrial enterprises etc. (Hypothesis-1)

 

HEAT LOSSES AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS

-     There is a meaningful reverse correlation between the level of per capita income and the number of heat leakage locations in households. In other words, households with higher per capita income generally have fewer heat leakage locations. This reverse correlation is to a certain extent similar in the energy saving potential as well. The lower per capita household income is, the higher energy saving potential becomes, except for the highest per capita income households where saving potential again increases to the level of lowest income households. Most energy saving potential is observed in households with lowest and highest income levels. (30% of households did not disclose income information but their saving potential is consistent with the heat leakage locations) (Hypothesis-2)

-     Energy saving potential from heat leakages at households ranges from 11% to 21% in line with the income level. Average number of heat leakages is around 14 whereas average energy saving potential is at 18% per household.

-       No meaningful linkage or correlation was identified between the total number of heat leakages per household and the education level in the household residents.

-       There is a meaningful correlation between the size of the household, the number of rooms and the number of heat leakage locations which was expected to be so.

-       Households heated by central heating systems are more energy-efficient than households heated by individual heaters. The energy saving potential for centrally heated households is at 17% while it is at 20% for individually heated households. Consistently, individually heated households also have more heat leakages than centrally heated ones.

-       692 residents live in the 222 households that participated in the experiment. Labor force participation rate is at 45.95% which is consistent with the country’s 2023 May rate of 48.5%. Sample of this experiment is consistent with the overall Türkiye population in this sense. However, the education level of this experiment’s sample was higher than Türkiye average with 46.6% undergraduate/graduate degree-holders while it is at around 17.6% at the country level.

-     Majority of heat leakages are detected on windows and doors due to absence of or faulty frame joints and/or gaskets. Some heat leakages are observed on the walls due to lack of proper plastering and on the windows due to the inefficient frames/casements. Another reason for inefficient heating was found to be due to overheating exacerbated by lack of thermostatic valve or smart thermostat.

 

KNOWLEDGE-ACTION GAP AND AWARENESS

-   Participatory walk-through heat audits effectively increased awareness of households on residential energy efficiency. As a result of the on-the-spot post-audit survey, 99.5% of participants declared that the audit increased their awareness on energy efficiency at varying levels. 66% declared their awareness was significantly increased or totally created by the audit whereas 33% reported a slight increase in their awareness.

-       114 out of 222 households responded to follow-up survey on investment behaviors. Therefore, the assessment on the effectiveness of the audits on triggering behavioral change was based on these 114 respondents. However, when examined, education and income levels of the remaining 108 unresponsive participants are consistent with the overall distribution. Therefore, the ratio of those who reported behavioral change is believed to be similar in the unresponsive group.

-     As a result of the post-audit follow-up survey, 78% of households reported that they either planned or already invested in repairs/improvements for energy efficiency.  (31% with plans and 42% with solid investments) 22% neither planned nor intended to invest in energy efficiency. Those who planned but were not able to invest reported reasons including mostly financial incapability, seasonality, and presence of other priorities. Majority of 22% did not plan to invest basically due to being tenants in their households or having moved to another address. A portion of these did not plan investments since no heat leakages were detected at their households. (Hypothesis-4)

-    MoENR’s study in 2021 put forward an average 55.3% knowledge-action ratio in households for heating/cooling efficiency based on passive awareness raising methods such as brochures, video spots, social media posts etc. Participatory awareness raising method this experiment employed through handheld thermal cameras for walk-through heat audits at households resulted in 78% knowledge-action ratio in heat efficiency. This proves that active participation of target groups in evidence-based energy audits with high visual components are more effective not only in creating awareness but also in triggering behavioral change and action. (Hypothesis-3)

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

In the pre-surveys, the question on income level was deliberately left optional to answer to ensure no one abstains from participating the experiment due to disclosure of income level. However, almost half of participants did not disclose this information which constituted extra burden on data analysis. This question could have been kept mandatory to answer.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

12 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

19,422.99

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

There is no next stage planned, but a follow up with MoENR will be made which is explained in detail in the next question.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

MoENR will expand the geographical coverage and diversify target groups to include public buildings, universities and municipalities in different provinces to increase awareness through participatory heat audits. AccLab will follow up with the MoENR to track replication studies and their impact. Also, a dissertation study on energy efficiency utilized the data collected within the MoENR whose findings will also be shared with AccLab. Also, UNDP CCE Portfolio is informed about the outcomes for upcoming programmatic design for household energy efficiency.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1) We know now that there is a considerable amount of energy saving potential in households by investing small amounts in heat loss prevention. Energy saving potential from heat leakages at households ranges from 11% to 21% in line with the income level. Average number of heat losses is around 14 whereas average energy saving potential is at 18% per household. According to Turkish Statistical Institute's 2021 data, households' share in final energy consumption is around 30.4% with almost half (47.1%) of their consumption based on heating/cooling. As per 2021 data, an 18% average energy saving potential in households within Turkiye's 123.859 mtoe final energy consumption means that 3.192 mtoe can be saved annually which would save around 1.8 billion USD per year in the country. Roughly 80% of this heating/cooling comes from GHG emitting hydrocarbon sources such as natural gas and coal which highlights a potential 6.562 mtCO2 GHG removal from the atmosphere per year.

2) We know now that active participation of target groups in evidence-based energy audits with high visual components are more effective not only in creating awareness but also in triggering behavioral change and action. MoENR’s study in 2021 put forward an average 55.3% knowledge-action ratio in households for heating/cooling efficiency based on passive awareness raising methods such as brochures, video spots, social media posts etc. Participatory awareness raising method this experiment employed through handheld thermal cameras for walk-through heat audits at households resulted in 78% knowledge-action ratio in heat efficiency.

3) We know now that lower income households live under less energy efficient conditions and need greater financial assistance in going green. There is a meaningful reverse correlation between the level of per capita income and the number of heat leakage locations in households. In other words, households with higher per capita income generally have fewer heat leakage locations. This reverse correlation is to a certain extent similar in the energy saving potential as well. The lower per capita household income is, the higher energy saving potential becomes, except for the highest per capita income households where saving potential again increases to the level of lowest income households. Most energy saving potential is observed in households with lowest and highest income levels. (30% of households did not disclose income information but their saving potential is consistent with the heat leakage locations)

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

1) Collection of income data is hard as participants do not wish to disclose their income due to concerns over taxation

2) Reaching out to the those left furthest behind was a challenge as MoENR's network did not include lowest income groups and the groups in deep poverty do not have access to the means to apply for a heat audit

3) Devastating earthquakes that hit the 11 southeastern provinces slowed down progress in conduction of follow up surveys and data analysis due to shifting priorities of the partner and UNDP for EQ response

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Climate Change and Environment Portfolio has a cluster of projects on energy sector, particularly on renewable energy and energy efficiency. CCE Portfolio might incorporate households as beneficiaries of an upcoming energy efficiency financial assistance project.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

MoENR as the main policymaker and financial support actor in energy sector and households in need of financial assistance might benefit from the results of this experiment. Also the industrial organizations, businesses, public buildings and universities may also become potential beneficiaries for heat loss prevention assistance.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

This experiment designed pre-post surveys and a follow-up survey from the beginning and ran test trials with the MoENR colleagues. MoENR organized a training session to its personnel for the use of handheld thermal cameras, implementation of surveys and walk-through audits. Then, the applications were collected and MoENR personnel conducted household visits to implement walk-through heat audits. All error detections and improvements to the surveys and methodology were made at the testing stage.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

As proven by this experiment, building partnership with technically competent and willing partner institutions (be it a Ministry or a CSO) is crucial in implementing household visits and heat audits for data collection. Public partners are more reliable in the eyes of the households. Also, reaching out to the groups that are left furthest behind is challenging and requires additional resources and time. Lastly, use of digital handheld thermal cameras proved to be effective so long as they are supported with digital surveys such as JOTFORM in this experiment.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

This experiment can be replicated in all settings where heat losses are an important factor for energy efficiency and GHG emission reduction, be it industrial organizations, businesses, public buildings, schools, hospitals, universities etc. Also, thermal cameras can be used for detecting water and other fluid leakages as well. In this sense, such an experiment can be replicated for water loss or hazardous chemical spillage settings, too. This way, it can additionally serve SDGs 6 and 9 on top of SDGs 7, 11 and 13.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The idea of using handheld thermal cameras in walk-through heat audits at households came from the MoENR through a solution mapping liaison. In collaboration with the Explorer and Solution Mapper, alternative technologies were investigated to find the most suitable one that can be applicable in the experiment. However, if time and resources allowed, in collaboration with the Explorer and the Solution Mapper, lowest income groups can be reached through partnering with civil society channels to be included in the experiment. Time constraints in budget utilization prevented further research for preparatory work.

> What surprised you?

The average energy saving potential per household came far above our expectations given that the insulation and window/door framing and heating technologies have improved significantly in the last decades. Also, the energy saving potential in highest income group came as great as those of the lowest income group households. Lowest and highest income groups have either poor insulation or care for energy efficiency.
