> Brief description of the innovation

Our plan has been to produce meat, milk, vegetables and fruits. 
Different breads of pigs are already at the farm and most of it has helped us as we have sold to sustain the farm. We would like to increase the meat section by raring chickens and cattle, goats, ducks and breeding fish.
On a small scale cabbages,  tomatoes, onions, lettuce has been grown and returned a good yeild that keeps developing the farm and sustaining the actives. 
We have a small orchard with lemons, oranges, guavas, bananas and natches. We would love to grow it and possibly go an extra mile by trying to grow fruits that are scarce in Zambia

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We have currently employed 4 youth (20-30 year olds) with whom we are doing most of the work manually. We are able to sale pigs on 5months basis to individuals. We would like to grow the production to supply on a large scale. Chicken and other meat products are in plan as this will increase stock on market and increase on human resource. 
Crops like maize and soya beans are grown at about 3 acres which supplement for feed for the animals and some sold to the Miller's for the processing of the staple meal. Vegetables are also grown and sold to nearby communities. 
We desire to educate our workers and empower them with the skills regarding farming, which will benefit both parties involved. 
The issues of technology are being considered to increase productivity and modernising the agricultural industry. 
When these activities are fully fledged, with sufficient capital, human resource, natural resources such as water,  we will be able to increase pay for our workers, employ more youths, improve on imports for agricultural products,  supply fresh commodities to the public.  
The CEO has taken keen interest to study agriculture such that we can also offer services of consultations, trainings and other services that will help the entire industry.

> Technical Feasibility

The four employed youths have been assigned roles they are responsible for. This was drawn from seeing their strengths and weaknesses.  Its from this that we desire to give them some form of training to strengthen their capacities or capabilities.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Already four families are being empowered through the little we are giving the gentle men. From this they are able to take care of themselves  and their families. At least to meet the basic needs of life.
Food is a right for humanity. Thus being very relevant. We want to make it affordable and available for easy access and consumption.  We want healthy products that will not harm the health system of the consumers.  Good health and nutrition is key is sustaining development, economic growth and economic development. Good health gives access or opportunity to fight poverty and crime
