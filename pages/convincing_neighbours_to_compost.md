There are not so many people in Ukraine who already compost their garden residue. However, when we talked to those who were composting, they seem to belong to one of two groups: solitary composters and clusters of many composters. Those in clusters seemed to have one thing in common: sociable, friendly neighborhoods where practices can be shared and those, who still burn their leaves and other organic waste, will have a social pressure against them. 



Following is the video filmed by one of UNDP's friends: Lisa Tokarenko from Druzhkivka, Donetsk oblast, who inherited composting practice from her grandma and convinced many neighbors to compost instead of burning. Once one resident starts to compost and promote the practice - others will follow.
