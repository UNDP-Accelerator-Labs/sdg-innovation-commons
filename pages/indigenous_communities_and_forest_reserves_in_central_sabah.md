Forever Sabah serves a collaborative social movement by building programs through engaging communities, government agencies, private sector and NGOs in supporting the state’s transition to a diversified and circular economy.  Their project, Indigenous Communities and Forest Reserves in Central Sabah: Livelihood Transformation in the Context of Shared Forest Governance and Jurisdictional Certification of Oil Palm smallholders adopting sustainable agricultural practices focuses on solutions for oil palms at forest reserves in Telupid and Tongod districts. The solutions and activities carried out include: Facilitate land-use agreement. Agronomic planning and exposure visit. Launch and implement transition by sourcing seedling and planting in designated zones. Communities are to be part of the supply chain in the long-term.  Discuss and decide on specific crops for transition with communities.
