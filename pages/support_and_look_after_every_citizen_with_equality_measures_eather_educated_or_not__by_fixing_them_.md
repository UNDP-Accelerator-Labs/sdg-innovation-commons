> Title of the innovation

Support and look after every citizen with equality measures eather educated or not, by fixing them in suitable depertments according to their level of education for the betterment of the youths and the voiceless poor people in the community and rural areas across our country Zambia 🇿🇲

> Brief description of the innovation

Let every youth of Zambia 🇿🇲 participate and benefit from our own motherland country Zambia.
Teach them how to make use of money to end poverty in our country Zambia 🇿🇲 
Educate every Zambian youth on how to run different types of businesses in our country Zambia 🇿🇲
Unity every Zambian youth and start a new life together coz we are one Zambia one Nation 🙏

I personally do understand the meaning of being a Zambian youth and I do understand that no one will bring food on my table but my cry is to see other people failing to feed and clothe themselves with better clothes and I take it as luck of education on how to make it here in Zambia even when  someone is not educated .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Atleast we put our fellow youths in practice with different skills eg building, carpentry and other skills jobs coz by so doing we can create enough room for every Zambian youth with less needs.
And by so doing, many youths will be able to be self  dependants giving  out less cries to the government .

> Technical Feasibility

Educate
Engage 
Empower

> Anticipated Social Impact

Construction can improve almost every Zambian youth hence let's support and encourage construction to our fellow youths.
