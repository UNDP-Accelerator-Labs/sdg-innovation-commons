The solution aims at extracting freshwater from seawater through alternative energy. The construction contains of 2connected resourvoirs and one solar panel. One resorvoir are put under the sea water, and another one on the shore. While the resourvoir under is filling in the solar panel boils the water and the steam of the drinking water are collected in the resourvoir on the surface. Real-time data can be tracked in the app Photo 1 shows how it might look in real life; photo 2 is the prototype model; photo 3 is the interface of the app.
