## 

Citizen science used to catalogue fauna and flora in the Galápagos.
This project is led by Universidad San Francisco de Quito and has a 750.000 USD funding from: UK Research &amp; Innovation (UKRI) del Reino Unido, Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) y Newton Fund.


The project is starting by training 50 people who live in the Galápagos, who before the pandemic, had economic activities in tourism and fishing. This project helps reactivate their economy while contributing to conservation. These local people have been trained to use barcoding sytem, which consists on using DNA sequences and comparing that information to global databases.
The limitation of this solution is that the project has a one year duration; however, sustainability is expected with new capacities acquired by local people who can continue with science and conservation.
Data should be updated to identify endangered species, however, the project contributes to create an exhaustive catalogue. <br>
