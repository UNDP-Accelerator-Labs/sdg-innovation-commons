A project which consists in using a product resulting from the manufacture of butter, which is (buttermilk), it is considered as a waste rejected by dairy factories in Algeria and which is one of the most important causes of pollution of the water in the country. Its use is very wide, either in food (cheeses, creams, juices, etc.) or in cosmetics. The solution: by taking it up in many factories and combining it with the oil produced by recycling poultry products, Aya will make a natural soap that is useful for the skin and even the hair.
