## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Digital Baskets: The role of connectivity, capacities, and enablers in the digital and financial inclusion of women business owners.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is identifying the most relevant barriers and enablers for women to adopt digital behaviors, as well as accessible, scalable digital goods and services that allow for the reduction of the digital gap in informal and formal micro and small enterprises.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Choosing to work on this challenge responds to the El Salvador’s CO portfolio on inclusive digitization. This learning cycle will be attached to the implementation of the Digi-Chiquihuites project, an RFF initiative to support the recovery of two of the sectors most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (Tourism and Health Services). The learning cycle, however, will focus on the tourism component. The Digi-Chiquihuites Project will apply the Accelerator Lab’s methodology to design custom “digital baskets” (Chiquihuites is the nahuat word for basket) for micro and small enterprises in the National Parks System of ISTU. The baskets will include elements of access (mobile devices, computers, internet connectivity); capacities (training in soft and hard skills for digital proficiency); and enablers (updated parks regulations and policies to support the digitalization of the parks). Lessons learned from Digi-chiquihuites will feed into new funding opportunities, reason for which, the learning cycle from the Accelerator Lab will be of crucial relevance.

El Salvador promoted economic development with a national modernization strategy to overcome its low economic growth rate (GDP annual growth rate of 2.3%), but due to disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Amanda & Cristobal, 60,000 jobs were lost in the first half of 2020 alone and a 7.9% negative growth rate predicted from El Salvador General Directorate of Statistics and Census (DIGESTYC), PDNA-CRNA El Salvador (Post Disaster Needs Assessment) 2020. According to El Salvador General Directorate of Statistics and Census (DIGESTYC), small businesses (MSEs) account for 31% of the recipient country's economy MYPE Survey 2017. Devastating impact of COVID-19 was more severe towards MSEs, it is necessary to contribute to economic reconstruction as a basis for livelihoods and economic activities. Furthermore, narrowing down digital gap could assist MSEs more sustainable and competatitive in the market. UNDP's report “Learning from the crisis: ten ideas to protect MSEs and recover livelihoods” highlighted that most MSEs do not have access to the internet (71.6% in 2017) (2020). Digital inclusion, if not addressed incorporating a gender lens, can exacerbate preexisting inequalities that put women in a disadvantageous position to have financial security and increase their vulnerability to poverty and even violence. For example, the diagnosis for the creation of the National Digital Agenda 2020-2030, developed by the Government of El Salvador estimated that only 47% of Salvadoran women had access to internet, vs. 60% of men. Additionally, the Post-Disaster National Assessment (PDNA) carried out after the tropical storms Amanda and Cristobal and during the highest of the COVID-19 pandemic, showed that of self-employed women, only 20% had access to the internet and less than 40% have access to financial services. These numbers reveal the urgency for entities like CONAMYPE to strengthen the capabilities of Salvadoran businesses, particularly the ones ran by women, to enter the digital world but considering their barriers to access, capacities and a nurturing ecosystem.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Some qualitative evidence are the many anecdotes around business creating new channels to promote, sell and communicate with their clients in the midst of the pandemic. Many businesses even changed their business models to adapt to the crisis and many more started digital-first and have remained that way until now.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab is spearheading the digital agenda of the CO, serving as liaisons between UNDP’s Digital Office and the CO. This liaising led by our Head of Exploration already resulted in the implementation of a country-wide Digital Readiness Assessment (with an emphasis on key UNDP government partners in El Salvador) with the support of the CDO as part of the Digi-Chiquihuites project. This learning cycle will help the Digi-Chiquihuites team systematize the project’s lessons and best practices for upcoming funding opportunities such as a 6.6m KOICA project to support innovation and digitization of MSEs in El Salvador.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The ES AccLab is working on testing different elements (access, capabilities and enablers) to design  “Digital Baskets” of goods and services that can reduce the gender gap for an inclusive digitization of micro and small businesses in El Salvador.
