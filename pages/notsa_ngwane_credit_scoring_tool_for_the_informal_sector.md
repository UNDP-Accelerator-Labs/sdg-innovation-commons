Notsa Ngwane Credit Scoring Model is a 100% proudly Swati model which generates a credit score and offers a maximum loan amount from the monthly income and expenditure for informal traders including non-banked hawkers, farmers, etc. The model factors in mobile wallets and Stokvel (informal savings groups) financial position together with various variables which are all written in SiSwati. it was developed following quick surveys to identify the gap between urban and MSME which informed us that there were more MSMEs in the Rural areas.
