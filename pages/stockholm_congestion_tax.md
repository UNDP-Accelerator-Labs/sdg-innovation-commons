> Description of the solution

The congestion tax is charged during fixed hours for vehicles driving into and out of Stockholm city center. The amount varies, depending on the time when the vehicle passes the toll station. The purpose of the congestion tax is to reduce congestion and improve accessibility. Due to the reduced traffic, the measure also results in health benefits of reduced air pollution.

On finance: the green tax can be a significant source of income for the state to be used for further reducing air pollution. It should not be relied on as a source of income long-term as the goal is to reduce emissions and hence the tax revenue.
