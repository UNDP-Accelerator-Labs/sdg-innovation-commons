## 

Public transportation plays a fundamental role in a city's mobility. Ensuring the efficiency, safety and punctuality of transportation systems is essential to improve the quality of life of citizens. In this sense, we propose the implementation of a transport route control and monitoring system based on IoT technologies and databases, with the objective of optimizing vehicle management and operation, and providing valuable information to both operators and users.

This project was carried out to help users to be able to use public transportation in a more optimal way as well as to help drivers to check the time they arrive at certain points so that the user can verify that their transportation is about to arrive or know if they can take the same or another one, besides it was seen as a problem because then one walks without knowing for sure how long it will take, as in some places it takes 20 min. to pass. A central database will be established that will store relevant information such as vehicle license plates, locations, estimated times and arrival records. This database will act as the main data store for the system.
