Ma’an Youth Society for Environmental Conservation contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by recycling food waste and leftovers to produce compost, which provides the nutritional minerals needed by agricultural land to increase yields. Recycling organic waste and converting it into high-value and useful organic products (fertilizer, soil and compost) is important and profitable. It also plays an important role in protecting the environment. Safe fertilizers also ensure the production of healthy crops of vegetables and fruits by meeting farmers’ needs, a clean environment, savings on water consumption. Ma’an’s factory produces many important organic products, namely: 

Solid organic fertilizers
Organic potting soil
Organic compost production
