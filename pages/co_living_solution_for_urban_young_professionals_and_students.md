## What is the challenge?

Socio is solving an urban living crisis that young professionals and students in Bangladesh face. Young unmarried people are some of the least favored tenants, are price-sensitive, and are often new or alone in big cities. They find it difficult to access amenities and managed accommodation in most cities and urban hubs in Bangladesh. This creates various living and safety challenges for these young people.
 
While Hostels and PGs (Messes) have long existed in Bangladesh, the living experience for young students and professionals in urban areas is broken. Young people living in PGs suffer a lot as they don’t have access to essential services like on time meals or laundry.  Lack of meaningful social interactions create various psychological and mental health challenges. No solution in the market exists for a seamless living experience in cities for these young people. 

In 2030, 50% of Bangladesh’s 190 million people will be living in urban areas. The median age of Bangladesh is 27.6 years and according to the UN, the youth population is estimated to make up 47.6% of Bangladesh. According to BBS, Dhaka and Chittagong have been adding 3.37%~ &amp; 2.4%~ to its population each year respectively, a staggering rate of urbanization. Most of these internal migrants are university students or working professionals. As cities keep adding more and more people, Bangladesh will be hotspots for alternative living-related service spaces due to growing urban living problems.
