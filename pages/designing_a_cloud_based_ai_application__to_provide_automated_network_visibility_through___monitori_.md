> Title of the innovation

Designing a cloud-based AI application, to provide automated Network visibility through   monitoring of data against cyber security threats as a pay as you go Software as a service.

> Brief description of the innovation

Creek Lotus Technologies has a service focus on helping SMBs mitigate cyber security threats that safeguard their information technology assets.

Our solution is a cloud-based, Artificial intelligence application that will help: classify organizational data, managing access rights, encrypting, putting governance policies in place, monitoring capabilities, authentication, and synchronization of data between remote hosts, endpoint protection, detection and prevention of cyber threats.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

CLT as a business will generate income through monthly/quarterly charges collected from customers (SMBs) who will be subscribing to this service (Software as a Service-Paas).

Our target clients are SMBs (Small to Medium-Sized businesses) across varying industries but particularly the Micro financial institutions.

The Prize money will make it possible for our team to fully develop our proposed Cloud application, test it, and launch it successfully. Additionally, this would help raise the necessary awareness for who we are and what we do at a large scale subsequently help SMBs grow as well.

We believe that one of the major challenges faced by our targeted market which is SMBs is a lack of access to quality Cyber Security and Information Technology Services.  Creek Lotus Technologies offer access to IT infrastructure at a minimal cost bringing down the cost of doing business in a secure environment for SMBs. We avoid the need to hire IT specialists for different IT services for SMBs which reduces the impact on capital base. We further contribute by training Staff members about cyber security and the associated risks. This helps SMBs grow in a safe technological environment and access IT solutions required to transact safely on a global scale.
The recent pandemic has been a catalyst for the increased need for dependence on online transacting and we have seen an increase in online data transfer and storage. It is critical that we provide SMEs with the necessary infrastructure and information to meet the technology requirements of the current market. This will allow SMEs to continue to grow in a safe cyber environment regardless of the current pandemic restrictions globally and reduce the risk of job losses in SMBs.

> Technical Feasibility

Our solution is a Software as a service (SaaS), Artificial Intelligent cloud-based software delivery model, where our customers access this service via the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. Our solution primary provides threat detection and prevention from cyber threats by providing network visibility through monitoring of data on a network intelligently, while classifying organizational data, managing access rights, encrypting, authentication and synchronization of data between remote hosts, endpoint protection.

We as Creek Lotus Technologies Limited manages all the hardware and traditional software, including middleware, application software, and security. So that our pay-as-you-go customers can dramatically lower costs; deploy, scale, and upgrade business solutions more quickly than maintaining on-premises systems and software; and predict the total cost of ownership with greater accuracy but most notably reduce their level of exposure to threats.

Prototype doesn’t exist yet

Implementation Plan.
1)	Application Prototype designing- 3 months
2)	MVP product launch - 3 months
3)	Conducting Market Surveys (Pricing) -3months
4)   Application Market testing - 3 months. 
5)   Final Product Launch

All other cyber security and technology support services will continue and will be available during the proposed time frame. This will also allow our existing customers to benefit from this technology.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The dramatic shift towards remote ways of working may be the single biggest consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic for businesses. Despite being forced upon us, we are seeing the benefits: businesses embracing remote working are seeing productivity gains and cost savings, while employees are enjoying a flexible work-life balance, and most are not missing the daily commute. But making such a seismic shift in working patterns and behaviours over such a short period brings risks and the sudden shift online has provided fertile ground for opportunistic cybercriminals. It is critical that we provide SMBs with the necessary infrastructure and information to meet the technical requirements of the current market. This will allow SMBs to continue to grow in a safe cyber environment regardless of the current pandemic restrictions globally and reduce the risk of job losses in SMBs.
