> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Everyone should have access to clean, affordable electricity and be able to cook food without damaging the health of their family and the environment. Yet in rural areas of Bangladesh, many families still have to cut down trees to use as fuel for heating and cooking. It’s a challenge the NGO Practical Action is tackling head on with tried and tested solutions and powerful collaborations. It is working with the Household Energy Platform, a national programme, to put a country-wide action plan in place that will distribute clean cook stoves to those who need them most. They are also supporting entrepreneurs, many of them women, to set up new businesses that support their projects. These include making and selling clean cook stoves and clean fuel briquettes. Practical Action is helping these entrepreneurs get hold of funding to kick-start their new businesses and giving them training in basic business skills, such as budgeting and marketing.  The organization is also conducting action research on the potential for electric cooking in Bangladesh.
