I'm a young agribusiness graduate of the Natural Resources Development College (NRDC), After school I thought of start keeping chicken at a small scale due to enough capital.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My business can generate good income for me, stakeholders and my workers if the business happen to grow big (Expanded).
Hence improving the above stated beneficiaries if my business grows.
If my business happens to grow big I and my workers can be able to supply chickens to the supermarkets and households as usual.
The challenges that we're facing are: 
1. Lack of enough capital. 
2. Lack of enough poultries. 
3. Lack of transportation means (Vehicles). 
4. Lack of Chicks supply. 
5. Expensive Chicks and feeds.
My business has great value to the environment such that it creates jobs for nearby residents and business for those who order grown chicken from us.

> Technical Feasibility

If the gvt or any organization happens to empower my business, I'd love to build more poultries to expand output so that we can have enough income, and that can allow us to deploy more workers.

If our innovation was to be empowered, it can allow us to pay our workers enough salaries which can also help them grow themselves, in terms of good standard of living, able to pay their bills, also able to pay for their children school feels.
