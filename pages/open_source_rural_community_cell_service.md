It is the first indigenous social concession of telecommunication services in Mexico.



Telecomunicaciones Indígenas Comunitarias (TIC A.C.) is a civil association of indigenous and rural communities in Mexico and an operational team that accompanies people and communities seeking to build, manage and operate their own communication networks. In July 2016, together with 16 indigenous communities from Oaxaca, TIC A.C., they strengthened the first Social Indigenous concession in the history of Mexico to manage and operate autonomous telecommunications and radio broadcasting networks, including cellular telephony. The indigenous social concession is granted to 5 States of the Mexican Republic: Oaxaca, Guerrero, Puebla, Chiapas, and Veracruz.
