[[ai_summary:Seth Akumani, Head of Exploration for UNDP Ganas Accelerator Lab, is working on designing a digital gateway for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Ghana. The country faces significant challenges with MSMEs, including limited access to capital and markets, largely due to informal business practices. To address this issue, the digital gateway aims to provide information on formalization processes, funding opportunities, and market expansion, ultimately improving MSMEs' competitiveness.

Akumani collaborated with the Ghana Enterprise Agency and other stakeholders, including private sector partners and government agencies, to develop the platform. The design process involved research, ethnographic approaches, focus group discussions, and co-creation with key stakeholders.

The initiative recognizes that MSMEs need digital skills training to effectively utilize the platform's resources. To address this challenge, a holistic approach has been developed, incorporating capacity building for micro, small and medium enterprises.

Akumani expressed gratitude for the joint SDG fund’s catalytic funding of $3 million in July this year, which will support a new holistic approach for the project.]]

# Ghana's Digital Gateway for MSMEs: Enhancing Inclusive Business Growth

### [[0:09]] So my man, how are you?

I'm good\.

### [[0:12]] OK, nice to run this with you\. So tell me about your name and your role within UNDP\.

Thank you\. I'm Seth Akumani, Head of Exploration for UNDP Ganas Accelerator Lab\.

### [[0:29]] So thank you\. So could you tell me about an R&D activity you would like to share with us? How did it come about? What did you start? And if it's still going on, tell us more about it?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
Thank you\. Yes, indeed\. One of the interesting digital initiatives that the country is working on is the design of a digital gateway for Msmes\. But let me take you back to why we're doing this\. So micro, small and medium enterprises contribute 70% to Ghana's GDP as is the case in other developing countries\. Now most of these are informal businesses or in the informal economy\. And two of the key issues they face is access to capital and access to markets\. But for you, for any business to be able to cross these challenges, they first need to have some formalization\. Unfortunately in Ghana we don't have a centralized portal that provides information on how to register, how to access these, you know, opportunities for funding and for market expansion\. So two years ago we started working with the Ghana Enterprise Agency to Co design a digital gateway for MSME's that would help address this challenge\. So this is how this R&D activity came about and we're currently in the testing phase for for the gateway\.

### [[2:10]] OK, thank you for this\. I think you step in the next question which was about what was the development issue that you were addressing, but maybe we can talk about it a bit and then also answer to the question related to the stakeholders, who were you working with, what was their role and then also how? Let me go with that and then we continue\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[skills:Business development skill]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
OK, OK, thank you\. So the development issue here is the challenges that businesses in the informal economy phase when they particularly with respect to assessing funding, you know, accessing new markets and also being able to to attract various forms of resources that the business needs to be able to scale\. Now, this is important because if we look at, you know, the SDGS and I think 8:00 and 9:00, industry innovation, infrastructure, for us as a country to be able to move forward, we need to provide the right infrastructure and resources to support business in an informal economy\. Oftentimes even when there are opportunities, For example, recently during COVID, there were COVID relief funds, but many of the business in the informal sector didn't either even hear about it or did not have the necessary skills to assess it\. So this is the challenge\. We really want to be able to create an environment where we can provide targeted support for businesses in\.

### [[3:55]] And what about the stakeholders that you work with?

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
Yes, so first, the Ghana Enterprise Agency is, is the country's government agency that has a mandate for supporting MSMS\. So they are the central partner that UNDP is working with, but we're also working with a quasi government agency to support the development process\. So that Kofi Annan, ICT center at this level, these are the key stakeholders that we're working with\. But looking ahead, we've started also engaging with a broad cross section of partners within the ecosystem\. So the platform is intended not only to provide access to information on information hub and access to funding resources, access to business service providers, but also information on product certification, standardization, how businesses can access the new One Africa market\. And to do that, we're also talking to private sector, so financial service providers, we're talking to Ghana Export Promotion Agency that would also be able to support the businesses with their export\.

### [[5:16]] Cool, that's nice\. So now what about the tools and methods that you use, especially let's focus on the R&D perspective of the work\. So which tools have you used in methods? It could be around even tactics that we put in place for you to be able to run this wonderful work you just described\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
OK, 1st to start with and to understand the death of the problem, the country office did some work which we started building on as a lab and and in fact this work is is a joint effort between the lab and the country office\. So first we build on work or research, bottom up research that we conducted in six districts across the country\. During this time we interviewed over 900 micro, small and medium enterprises to understand the key issues that they face\. So there was a lot of ethnographic approaches in this\. We also did you know, a lot of focus group discussions to validate the insights that came out of these initial situation analysis and then we codify these into key challenge areas which informed, you know the design and the content of the gateway\. So that's the pre design process that we followed\. Then before we commence the design, we engaged with the key government stakeholders and then during the design phase itself, we continued to Co create with them\. So there's also a lot of Co creation during the design of the gateway\. There's a lot of iteration and we make particular efforts to emphasize on how intuitive or human centric the platform should be\. Of course working with the third party provider, you know, to support that\. We wanted to make sure that, you know, for any business, even with the most basic of digital skills, this platform should be intuitive enough for them to be able to access them\. So there's a lot of humans in that design thinking also embedded in in the process\.

### [[7:39]] And then in terms of engaging with stakeholders, do you have any tactic that you could share with us that facilitate the work that you were doing?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
I think the main thing is that UNDP has been playing much of A convenient role throughout the process\. We, we recognize from the start that you know, government Ghana Enterprise Agency has the mandate and so we made it clear that look ideally they should have the hope for it\. So we've we've been playing that facilitatory role steering, you know, Gea, the other key partners that are working in this\. So I think that's been the key thing recognizing and being clear with with the role that we intend to play within this process and going forward\. Another tactic is, you know, we've we've deployed so far is looking ahead to see how best, you know, to scale this effort\. And we've taken the holistic approach because whilst yes, the gateway is intended to provide the most important information that businesses need, we realize that there are two sides to this issue\. There's there's the supply side, which is providing the information\. There's also the demand side is do the businesses have the skills, the digital skills and sometimes even the literacy, business acumen and literacy skills to be able to effectively utilize the information on the platform\. So with that in mind, we have together with other partners are now Co designed a more holistic approach to to the project that would also involve providing some digital capacity building for micro, small and medium enterprises\.

### [[9:31]] Then thank you\. Let's not talk about the principle\. Do you think that there were any adequate consideration or principle of inclusivity or equity, even sustainability that guided you up your R&D approach while working with them?Can you talk about some of them?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
Maybe it is too indeed\. Indeed we were really guided by an inclusive whole of government and we like to what we like to see whole of ecosystem approach\. So I mentioned earlier on that during the early phase we selected six 60s in some of the most remotest part of the country and and engage them to get the feedback\. And this was important because we know that this initiative is intended to serve the whole of the country\. So we use that approach to make sure that in the end the solution that we're Co design will be as inclusive and you know, useful to all the businesses as possible\. I think one of the one of the principles we've also embedded in the work is, is really rapid testing from the beginning\. As I mentioned, this is something we've been working on for over a year, but we've done a lot of iterations of the platform\. So to make sure that at any point in time we're testing and, and you know, and making sure that it's usable and it's intuitive for, for the end users\. So I would say that these are some of the two key principles\. And you know, the third would be really just continuing to persevere through this process\. We've had a number of challenges during this design development phase\. Key amongst them has been, you know, you know, turned over with the government provider turned over of key technical personnel, which has somehow slowed the process\. But we we believe in in the vision and, and being able to continuously support the process\. So we're deploying alternative measures to not only build the capacity of the government provider for those who address some of these issues going forward\.

### [[11:59]] So then in terms of skills, can you share some of the skills that we use or that face that considering the challenges you face in the RNG?

[[tools:Design thinking]]
[[tools:Futures and Foresight]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
[[principles:Time management and adaptability]]
Those kids were determinant for the work\. I think this has been one of the most exciting projects I've worked on\. Coming from a tech background\. One of the key skills that I have used throughout this process is, you know, knowledge of the design thinking process and the software development process\. It has been critical because we've used that process to first try and be empathetic about the end user, understand their needs to thorough needs assessment in the beginning and then design very light versions of the platform, you know, go back, get feedback\. I trade through and, and that design thinking approach has really helped with with the development of the gateway\. But also, I think, you know, being able to also design and, and you know, conceptualize the pro project itself also has been key to engaging with partners, communicating the value proposition and also bringing others on board to convene multi stakeholder engagements to validate what we are doing\. So all those, all those skills have been key\.

### [[13:33]] So don't think let's move to the reflection on the journey\. Probably, I think up to now maybe we cannot talk about impact, but do you, can you there's is there anything you can share related to that considering what you've done so far or any outcome that you can share?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:How might we]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
Absolutely, absolutely\. I'm like, like, I'm excited that this, this project has given us an opportunity together with the country office to be able to raise catalytic funding from the joint SDG fund\. We're expecting in July this this year a $3,000,000 funding to invest in this new holistic approach for the project\. And, and that's a testament to the, the value of the work we've done before, because this is, this is mature funding from the joint SDG fund\. So it shows that we've, we've done something credible up until now, which we can build on going forward\. So I think this investment's really going to help us to support particularly the desire of the Gilkwood, but also the provision of, you know, key resources to the government partner and the support for the business advisory centers to be able to also go out and provide business advisory services, digital skills training and e\-commerce support for the businesses we are targeting\. The end goal is that these micro, small and medium enterprises will not only be able to go digital, but also be able to use e\-commerce tools and other digital tools to improve their productivity\.

### [[15:28]] And what about the learnings? What have you? If you have to do it again, what will you do differently?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
For instance, there's been a number of challenges we face throughout the process\. I think what one of my key takeaways would be if, if we had to do this again would be to probably involve maybe more private sector partners from the beginning\. I think we focused a lot on working with the agents who were the mandate to make sure that we could design and make sure in the end the product is something that fits in with their also overall organizational strategy\. But I think engaging more broadly, even though would have taken more time, would have also given us some really valuable insights\. And I think really planning to be able to address potential turnover issues when working with partners is something that's critical\. Oftentimes with government, you know, there's there's been a significant lack in in in the availability of technical capacity, just technical skills to be able to implement a digital initiative like this\. And I think planning ahead and having contingency plans for replacing such personnel if the need arises, it's something that we would have done differently\.

### [[17:01]] Cool\. Then I think now it's time to talk about diffuse and catalyze\. So what strategies approach do you apply now to diffuse and because we will not talk about it in the past because the project is still going on, so it has to be diffused and adopt of your R&D outcome, what strategies will you use for for that?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
Great\. I think, I think first is making sure that this project is is embedded in the country office and I'm glad to see that from the onset\. This is an initiative that builds on you know their work from the country office\. So we have that support which is fantastic\. And because we've been working with a government partner, they have accepted that this is going to be a key part of the work that their business business advice, GES Business Advisory Centers will be working on\. And and from that perspective, our ability to scale nationwide is also to a large extent quite secure\. And I think where we need to do a bit more work or where we are planning to do a bit more work is an engagement with the private sector and also the innovation ecosystem\. Our plan is to work with a selected a select number of innovation hubs with targeting 20 that have already been implementing digital initiatives with micro, small and medium enterprises\. And so we're bringing them also into the fold so that whatever we do has that whole of ecosystem approach to diffuse across the country\.

### [[18:44]] You mentioned private sector, so probably with private sector policy makers and as you mentioned the rest of the ecosystem, I think it's important also to to catalyze so that they'll be able to create impacts based on your R&D work\. So if you have any like advice to share with us, what would that be?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
Engage broadly, engage broadly, stay in touch with the ecosystem even throughout the design process\. We've we've been attending, you know, other workshops, meetings in, in and also stayed in touch with other initiatives, MSME digitalization initiatives or initiatives that are also designed to support businesses in the informal sector\. And doing that has enabled us to continuously refine our concept, but also to make sure that what we're doing is going to deliver distinct value for the businesses so that we're not duplicating efforts that are already existing in the market\. So I'd say that continuous engagement helps to refine, continuously refine our value proposition and what we are offering to the market\.

### [[20:07]] Thank you very much\.

Thank you\.
