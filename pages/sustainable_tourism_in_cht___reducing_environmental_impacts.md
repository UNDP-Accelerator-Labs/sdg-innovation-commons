Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT.  Tourists visiting the CHT region are often not mindful of the impact of their activities on the environment and litter indiscriminately. To address this issue, preventive measures can be taken such as sending text messages about waste disposal, setting up billboards with such messages and providing bins for tourists. There can also be a website developed with the relevant information and some videos made to raise awareness of waste disposal and management. A digital platform can be developed under the district office and all content can be made available under that. Tourist guides should always mention the waste disposal issue at the beginning of the tour and some messages against littering could be made available at the tourist spots.
