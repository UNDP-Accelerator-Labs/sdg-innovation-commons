Young Government Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

This is a platform that was created or rather formed by MALAMBA LUKONDE, popularly known as OBAMA.  It was created to empower and equip young people on leadership skill, governance issues, social and economic stability. This platform was established in the year of 2020.
The main reason for its existence, is that Zambia being a great Nation has more bosses and politicians than leaders and that is leading to the poor ruling of people in authority.  And also, not showing a good example to the coming generation.  This platform deals with Democracy, Dictatorship, Governance, empowerment of young people, Social and economic issues, Women leadership and Leadership itself.
We wish to take part in matter of the nation and be part of decision making, we speak for youths mind on national issue. With respect to the Senior Government we help in adding suggestions and opinion to what we feel can be considered.
We believe in action of implementation to develop our nation.
