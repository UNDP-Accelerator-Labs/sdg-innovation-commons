## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

This frontier challenge was terminated early, limiting generation of insights into the specific challenge. We did, however, generate a number of foresight scenarios on health reform, which explored local outcomes for health in three scenarios: (1) global instability impacting government fiscal space; (2) climate change, climate migration, and aging societies; (3) digitalization of health data and issues of data ownership and security. 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
N/A

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

We had to cut short this frontier challenge due to instructions from CO Management, when it looked like this engagement would not generate a major ask on foresight for health in the immediate future.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These data were used in developing foresight scenarios to explore the future of health in Malaysia, to open up conversations feeding into the health reform White Paper. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The end-goal of the frontier challenge was to develop a foresight offer to the Ministry of Health. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Health. We: (1) wrote an introduction to foresight and anticipatory governance, which was incorporated into their health policy and systems research training manual; (2) carried out a 3-day systems and foresight workshop, applying the tools to their research project on lack of local community uptake on a dental healthcare programme.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

N/A

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

United Nations University International Institute for Global Health. We ran a horizon scanning exercise with them on emerging health trends, which were used in expert stakeholder engagement used to generate inputs into the Ministry of Health White Paper. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Insights were limited due to early termination of the work. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
