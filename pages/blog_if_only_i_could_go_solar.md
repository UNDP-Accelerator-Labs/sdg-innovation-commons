Every year, UNDP’s crowdfunding academy supports individual giving campaigns in Africa, Arab States, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Launching a crowdfunding campaign is about telling a story that connects with the public. During 2024, we encountered with a campaign focusing on the world’s coldest capital city, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Affected by the consequences of climate change, this is the story of a resilient community looking to tackle one of its most pressing challenges, air pollution, with a move into solar energy. At the frontline of climate change In the heart of Ulaanbaatar, a ninth grader named Ulzii is fighting for survival. His story, portrayed in the Cannes Film Festival Official Selection "If Only I Could Hibernate(link is external)," is a testament to the resilience and perseverance of the 220,000 residents of the city's Ger District - the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.Forced by the advancing harsh climate to move to a city ill-prepared to accommodate them, Ger District residents are left to fend for themselves. Unconnected to centralized heating systems, they burn coal briquettes to survive the minus 45C degree winters, exposing themselves and their children to harmful chemicals and noxious gases.Mongolia's heavy reliance on coal has created a suffocating reality—severe winter air pollution, increased risk of respiratory disease, and lung cancer. But amidst this bleak landscape, there is a glimmer of hope.With an average of 250 sunny days per year, Mongolia has tremendous untapped potential for solar energy. UNDP Mongolia's Accelerator Lab (A-Lab) is seizing this opportunity with a groundbreaking crowdfunding campaign: "If Only I Could Go Solar."(link is external) The goal is to raise funds for the transition from coal to solar power in the Ger District by installing solar panels to power electric heaters in 20 households. With this campaign we can empower pioneers like Ulzii to break free from the chokehold of coal. This technology has the potential to be not just sustainable, but life changing. It could spark a larger behavioural shift among the community and policymakers, paving the way for a just energy transition.But the impact doesn't stop there. By reducing the carbon footprint of private households, this initiative could unlock new opportunities in the carbon credit market, creating further incentives to switch away from coal.In 2024, UNDP Mongolia and the Mongolian and French governments are implementing the Coal-to-Solar solution for 100 households in the Ger District. But to truly unleash the power of the sun and equal opportunities, we need your help.

"This polluted air we are breathing is actually us breathing the poverty of our brothers and sisters. And that to get to the core of the problem, we need a common strategy." - Zoljargal Purevdash (Director of "If Only I Could Hibernate”

Our "If Only I Could Go Solar" crowdfunding campaign aims to onboard 20 more households, empowering them to become pioneers of change. Your contribution, no matter the size, will help provide clean air, improved health, and economic freedom to families like Ulzii's.Ger district households who received solar heating systems in early 2024 as part of the UNDP project look forward to spending the winter in cleaner and safer homes, free from indoor coal soot and regular electricity outages. Solar energy provides a cost-effective renewable energy solution as they can cook more efficiently and expect substantial reductions in their electricity bills during summer month.

Naran Myal, a pensioner who lives with her daughter and grandson, found out about the project through a Facebook group chat managed by her community coordinator. She was ecstatic to learn that she had been selected, and informed that many residents have since gained a better understanding on solar heating and are keen to follow her lead in transitioning from coal to solar. Solar energy is more than just a solution to environmental challenges. It's a pathway to a brighter future, where children can focus on education, families can pursue fulfillment, and communities can thrive.Donate today(link is external) and help us turn the sun's rays into rays of hope for Mongolia's Ger District. Together, we can ensure that stories like Ulzii's are not just tales of survival, but testimonies of transformation.
