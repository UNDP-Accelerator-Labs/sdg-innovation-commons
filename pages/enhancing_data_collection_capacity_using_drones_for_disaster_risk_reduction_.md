## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Enhancing data collection capacity using drones for Disaster Risk Reduction in Dominican Republic
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to gather data on post-disaster impacts in rural communities to reduce vulnerabilities and increase resilience to climate shocks.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In the Dominican Republic, vulnerability to natural disasters, particularly tropical storms and hurricanes, is a reality that disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating existing inequalities.

Following Hurricane Fiona (Sep 2022), at the request of the Ministry of Housing, Habitat and Buildings (MIVHED), UNDP and a wide network of partners worked together to conduct a damage assessment of more than 2,500 tin-roofed houses. This assessment was carried out using UNDP's global Household and Building Damage Assessment (HBDA) tool, which allowed for rapid identification of damage caused by Fiona and the socio-economic situation of affected households.

To collect data reliably and accurately, we began with an aerial mapping of the area. For this, we had the assistance and experience of UNDP Colombia's Acceleration Laboratory, which helped us to georeference the area with drones. This allowed us to have updated images of the municipality with the damage caused by Hurricane Fiona, and the shots can be updated over time, in order to visualize the progress in recovery.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

The passage of Hurricane Fiona, Category 1, showed that there are still a large number of households living in precarious housing located in vulnerable areas. We also tested the use of drones to collect data reliably and accurately through aerial mapping of the area. For this, we have the assistance and experience of the Acceleration Laboratory of UNDP Colombia, now we want to prepare this capacity in the data analysis team of the country office, looking for open source alternatives, and protocols to share data with the national emergency system.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Provide a new source of data for the office. Seek integration with the WFP agency.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



1- Drones are revolutionizing post-disaster assistance in the Dominican Republic, offering a bird's-eye view for precise damage assessment, aiding in swift, eco-conscious rebuilding efforts, and enhancing community resilience. #TechForGood #EnvironmentalCare #CommunityStrength

> What sector does our partner belong to?



</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.



The WFP team is experienced in the use of drones at the time of a disaster, UNDP goes into post-disaster assistance working on livelihoods, resilience. Therefore, leveraging the experience and pursuing the development of open data for disaster management is an objective of interest to the Acceleration Lab.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



What are the regulatory aspects to take into account for mapping with drones?

Can we achieve the results with open source systems?

Can we have a data space with the network of institutions at risk and disaster?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The area images are used to gather information about the state of the area. The use of open-software, and the definition of protocols for the data will allow to share and use the information.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



UNDP's Crisis Bureau currently has the international methodology for Home and Building Damage Assessment (HBDA). The use of drone data adds value to the assessment of damage information.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Ministry of Housing, Habitat and Buildings (MIVHED), the National Office of Seismic Evaluation and Vulnerability of Infrastructure and Buildings (ONESVIE), and the UN system (WFP).
