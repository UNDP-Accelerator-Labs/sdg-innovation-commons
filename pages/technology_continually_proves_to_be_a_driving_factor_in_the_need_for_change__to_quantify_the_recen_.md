> Title of the innovation

Technology continually proves to be a driving factor in the need for change. To quantify the recent impact, look at the facts:  90 percent of the world’s data has been created in the last couple of years. More than 570 new websites are created every minute. 8 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020. These changes have led to a new age of innovation across business models and industries, allowing new businesses to enter the market and disrupt incumbents in serious ways. In fact, executives today believe 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies will be wiped out in the coming decade due to this level of digital disruption. Just as a start-up often innovates in order to break into an industry, established organizations need to innovate in order to fend off competition and remain relevant in this changing environment.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

At the core, innovation is about doing something differently from everyone else operating in your space. If your organization is using innovation on its products, for example, then the goal is to develop or update the products until there is nothing else on the market like it. If your organization is using innovation on its processes, it’s because doing so will save you time, money, or other resources, and give you a competitive advantage over other companies stuck in their systems. In either scenario, your organization is taking the time to try something new because sticking to the status quo simply isn’t working.

While the natural success that this brings can be reward enough for many companies, it would be a mistake to overlook another key advantage: innovation helps an organization differentiate itself and its products from the competition, which can be particularly powerful in an oversaturated industry or market. 

While delivering value to your customers should always be a company’s main focus, doing so in a way that is memorable and different from everyone else can become a standout element of your brand identity and business strategy, as well.

> Technical Feasibility

As the market continues to become more saturated, your team needs to figure out how your brand is going to stand out to consumers or clients. Your unique selling proposition is essentially what makes your product or service special. It's the reason someone would buy from your brand as opposed to one of your competitors. Consider what gap in the market your offerings are going to fill or what consumer needs they're going to meet.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Work with your team to figure out any challenges or barriers you may experience throughout your production process. Plan ways you would overcome these obstacles if they were to occur. For instance, you might consider what would happen if you run short on a certain material. Likewise, have a backup plan if a vendor could not deliver on their expectations. By planning ahead, you can ensure you're meeting customers' expectations and delivering your product to market on time.
