## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Carbon offsetting in citizens' hands
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that carbon markets and “cap-and-trade” systems are limited to the developed world and a mystery to citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina in general, and simple, inspiring and convenient ways to approach climate action on a wider scale are missing in our region.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Greenhouse gas emissions from the Western Balkans are projected to increase. Climate change impacts are expected to become stronger, as the Mediterranean is one of the areas of the world most impacted by changing weather patterns. Cities around the Western Balkans experience some of the highest concentrations of health-damaging ambient fine particulate air pollution in Europe. People living in this region are breathing more toxic air than their neighbors in Western Europe, especially in urban areas and during the winter months when heating – especially residential heating – emerges as the most important source of air pollution. With the current policy framework, air pollution is not expected to decline markedly as the burning of dirty fuels for heating and cooking will continue at high levels. Long-term exposure to air pollution has been linked to an increased risk of dying from COVID-19. This provides extra motivation for combining ambitious policies to reduce air pollution and GHG with measures to control the transmission of COVID-19. Individual and corporate climate action in the country remain at very low levels due to different factors, and there is very little effort to combine those with human stories of improving their own environment, self-organising around the same cause and stirring grassroots activism toward better air quality and climate safety. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Bosnia and Herzegovina's Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement is less than ambitious, and plans for the future use of fossil fuels for electricity production. Further on, although the country is one of Europe's most afforested areas, the rate of forest destruction is higher than that of forest revitalization. Air pollution in our cities, that are often home to outdated industrial plants or tens of thousands of coal-heated individual households, is among highest on the continent and the government action in this regard has been particularly slow. There is a rising environmental movement in the country trying to address these challenges, but a comprehensive climate action that will lead to multiple environmental and social benefits, is yet to happen.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

In the past 10 years, the country was faced with three major floods and four long drought period. This is quite a novelty for our generally moderate continental climate. The effects on livelihoods, environment and social dynamic of these natural disasters have been immense. Further on, the death rate connected to COVID-19 infections in our country is among highest in the world, and that can be partly contributed to population's exposure to particularly high levels of air pollution over long periods of time. 


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab is building the first systemic solution to contribute to reduction of air pollution and reduce climate change by offsetting. Other UNDP actors are focused on international and national strategic processes and other stakeholders are generally showing a low interest in making climate action a national movement. We believe that technology, behavioral insights and a right outreach approach can uncover a huge potential for individual and corporate climate action that has not yet been tackled in our country and we are are investing in a web-based solution to connect the people with the invesment opportunities.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The carbon offsetting platform will offer citizens and companies in BiH to directly offset their carbon footprint online by investing their time or money in climate friendly activities such as tree planting or volunteering actions and promote digitalisation of plant nurseries.   
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

Public enterprises that have the mandate to plant trees AND operate their own nurseries.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Is climate action at scale possible in the current volatile social environment? What does it take to successfully connect a large number of  climate friendly service providers with the general public and the corporate world online to significantly increase investments of time and money in carbon offsetting and air quality improvements? And finally, how to attract a traditionally inert public companies toward e-commerce and modernisation of their services?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The design of the carbon offsetting platform is primarily based on solutions mapping done for the challenge and crowdsourcing of ideas on how to approach the challenge. We are testing different design and outreach solutions through human centered design and piloting of solutions before growing them, and are engaged in the system thinking with the country office to connect our climate and economic development  portfolios through this exercise.  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are struggling with defining the best user journey for this process and are using both socioeconomic data and surveys to crack the issue of the best way to engage both the vendors and the general public in our platform. We are also using a lot of spatial data to target the ecosystems most in need of afforestation as critical for our tree planting campaigns through the platform.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are still exploring the leads to grow - as already mentioned, we are looking into some institutional partners that could take over this work but also explore the platform's place in different UNDP CO's portfolios. We are already working with a number of "champions" to attract vendors and buyers to our offsetting platform but will need a particularly complex outreach campaign to really achieve significant carbon reductions from this activity.
