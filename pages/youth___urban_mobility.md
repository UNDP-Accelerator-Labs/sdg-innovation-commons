## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Youth and  Urban mobility
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that Malawi  sees a sharp increase in the number of accidents involving motorcycles, including the lightweight variety of motorcycle known as motorbikes. The drivers of these two-wheelers typically have no training, no license and no vehicle registration. In addition they often do not wear helmets or protective clothing.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

For 2020 alone , motorcycle taxis, locally known as kabaza, have killed 860 people in accidents, according to data from Ministry of Homeland Security . Concerned with the rising number of traffic accidents linked to this popular mode of transport, government says it is engaging motorcycle taxi operators to acquire formal driving training and also help them follow road safety regulations.  Much as there is recognition of the risk , the engagement the government planned has not had any effect as there has not been any changes. Surprisingly,  the Ministry of Finance is planning to reduce or take-off import duty tax on motorbike imports which will likely increase the number of the players on the market and in turn heighten the risk of life.  Additionally the majority of the owners and drivers of the motor bikes are the youth who operate in an informal way and their passengers have limited options so are forced to still use them.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

1.     Ability to bring diverse stakeholders together (including existing linkages with UNICEF, Plan, Min of Youth, etc) 2.     Collective Intelligence, sense-making and innovation methods to understand the challenge and seek solutions 3.     No other entity is looking holistically or systematically at the challenges, the lab will add value to have a systemic view of the issue and prototype solutions 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Following reports of an increase in motorcycle-related deaths, UNDPMalawi’s #AcceleratorLab is exploring strategies for improving safety of motorcycle taxis for operators and customers
