In Bangladesh, approximately 73 million individuals still lack access to safe water within their own homes. Merely 2% of rural households have the privilege of obtaining water through a piped water supply, meaning that an overwhelming 98% of rural households in Bangladesh are deprived of this convenience. The arduous task of collecting water falls on women and girls, who spend up to two hours each day engaged in this chore. Moreover, majority of households rely on potentially hazardous tube wells. Consequently, rural families, particularly children, face a heightened risk of diarrhoea, malnutrition, and stunted growth.

As a solution to this pressing issue, Max TapWater develops and operates mini grids for the provision of piped water supply, aiming to bring easy, safe, and affordable water to rural households in Bangladesh. By availing

this water supply services, households gain access to a continuous 24/7 water supply directly from their taps, with a minimum allocation of 80-100 litres per person per day across three water points within their homes (kitchen, toilet, and bathroom). Regular water quality testing is conducted to ensure the water's safety. The construction of these grids is not technically complex and relies on locally sourced materials. The innovation lies in the entrepreneurial model employed, which operates within small clusters of households and involves local entrepreneurs who can co-invest. 

Max TapWater was a grant recipient of the Youth Co:Lab Bangladesh's Springboard programme 4.0, a collaborative initiative by the UNDP and Citi Foundation.
