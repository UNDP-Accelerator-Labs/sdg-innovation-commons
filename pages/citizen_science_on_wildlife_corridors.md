Overall goal: Restore and reconnect wildlife corridors in Escobar district to give food and shelter to pollinators. 

Specific goals: Create wildlife corridors in all the towns of the Escobar district and add the community’s gardens with native plants in an online collaborative map with georeferencing, photos, and descriptions - Improve large spaces of biodiversity and pollinators’ capacity to pollinate the big municipal agroecological vegetable gardens of the district. 

Description of citizen participation: Citizen participation consists of many tasks. Citizens receive training every month on topics related to wildlife corridors, native species, and environmental restoration. Citizen participation also consists of seed collection and exchange among neighbors for the creation of seedlings in different garden centers of native species around Escobar. In the same way, butterfly gardens and tiny native forests are created in the public squares of the district, the port of Escobar on the Paraná Delta, and every sidewalk where there are urban trees. By taking part in these activities organized by the municipality, citizens can take the following things to their homes: seedlings they made from native plants, butterfly shelters with native plants, native trees, seeds for agroecological gardening, aromatic plants for insects, compost made with pruning waste done at the municipality, pots made with processed ecobricks, or plantable pencils, that is, everything allowing citizens to grow and take care of species at their gardens at home. Thus, another instance of citizen participation involves identifying and georeferencing native species at private home gardens, contributing to the creation of a collaborative map on which urban wildlife corridors are rebuilt.
