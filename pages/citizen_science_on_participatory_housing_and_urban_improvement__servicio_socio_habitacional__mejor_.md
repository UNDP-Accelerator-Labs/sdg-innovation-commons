## Overall goal

Collaboratively identify the housing and urban conditions with which the communities of low-income settlements in Córdoba live to jointly build improvement solutions following sustainability parameters. 
## Specific goals

Carry out precise and comprehensive urban housing analyses to learn about the housing, urban, and environmental conditions present in the low-income settlements of the city of Córdoba and the zone of influence.  

Collaboratively propose improvement solutions for these conditions and the implementation of bioclimatic design and energy efficiency strategies, based on the perceptions, knowledge, resources, and abilities of the community present in the territories. 

Develop awareness, training, and appropriate technical support strategies to promote community consolidation and the improvement of environmental quality and life in settlements. 

Identify guidelines that can be used in the design and management of housing integration policies. 
## Description of citizen participation

The communities of the low-income neighborhoods actively participate in the entire process along with students, teachers, and researchers involved. Participants work together in planning activities to be implemented per semester in the survey and analysis of the existing socio-urban, environmental, and housing conditions. They also work in the subsequent instances of reflection on the findings and possible solutions, the activities for the monitoring and assessment of the agreed work plans, and the processes of self-construction and social production of the habitat to carry out the improvements and presentation of results. At the same time, citizens have influence over different community activities, such as training workshops, technological training, and design/improvement. Finally, they provide their own (economic, material, organizational, human, etc.) resources to achieve the agreed tasks. 
## Time Frame
