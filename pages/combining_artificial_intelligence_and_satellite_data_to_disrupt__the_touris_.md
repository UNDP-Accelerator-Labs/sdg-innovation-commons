## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Combining Artificial Intelligence and satellite Data to disrupt  the Tourism Industry 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is a lower rate of returning tourists after first visit to the islands of Unguja and Pemba in Zanzibar.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Zanzibar is an autonomous part of the United Republic of Tanzania, consisting of two main islands, Unguja and Pemba as well as several smaller islets with a total area of 2,654 sq. km. The population of Zanzibar as recorded in the 2012 Tanzania Population and Housing Census (2012 TPHC), was 1,303,569 with a growth rate of 2.8 percent per annum. Zanzibar has achieved high and stable economic growth over the last five years (2014-2018), at an average GDP growth of 6.6 per cent per annum with a peak of 7.7 per cent recorded in 2017. The key drivers of Zanzibar’s economy include: services sector, with tourism and hospitality sector emerging as one of the priority sectors with the potential to be a major contributor to socioeconomic development of Zanzibar. Tourism, accounts  for about 27% of Zanzibar’s GDP and attracts  more than $400 Million in foreign exchange annually. The sector also offers employment to a high proportion of women and poor communities, particularly low skilled laborers. According to various reports,  80% of first time visitors do not return to the islands, this challenge is ascribed to less diverse attractions, poor service quality, security .etc, this situation leads to a low volume of visitors in a year and eventually. This in turn affects the government’s ability to provide basic social services. The pandemic has also had an adverse impact on jobs security and reduced economic activities in the tourism value chain, resulting in increased poverty and inequalities affecting the vulnerable communities, including women and youth the most.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We propose Using Artificial Intelligence to conduct web scrapping on popular tourists’ websites (booking websites with feedback contents) e.g., Trip advisor; the process will involve; •                  

Further to AI, we will employ Satellite Imagery/Drone to survey the Zanzibar Landscape and propose possible attraction Sites; The process will involve; 1) Creation of a task on a  platform to divide study area into several squares for mapping; 2) Use of open imagery sources 3) Review and validate mapped images by a GIS expert; 4) Upload data on specific platform 5) analysis and reporting.  

Can we discover the pathways used by locals to- Schools/Markets (Non-Tar Roads)? Unconventional activities to discover Zanzibar (Tourism for all)? Re-imagining tourism beyond beach activities, nature, history etc. (as post COVID attractions)? 

This will lead to sprouting of new local economy. This project has a down stream to an existing Integrated Tourism Recovery and resilience Project at Country office. Use of AI/Satellite imagery brings new innovative capabilities in the process of addressing various challenges facing the Sector in Zanzibar. In this case the AccLab will involve an outside partner related expertise.   

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

Xsense AI seeks to test various AI models in addressing development challenges facing diffrent sectors in Tanzania. The Acc lab provides a platform for testing and prototyping various solutions that brings novel data sets and information that can be used to help Government have a better understanding of existing challenges. The Acc lab collaborated with the same partner last year to address online misinformation related to COVID 19 pandemic.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

1. How can web scrapped data help inform tourism sector programming? 2. How can Satellite data unveil new tourist attractions ?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

By Using Web-scrapping method we will 1) Identifying the URL of the targeted sites 2)Preparing scrapping environment in python by import the necessary libraries3)    Define a function for getting website content by making a HTTP GET request 4) Define another function for downloading a page specified by a URL and return a list of strings (posts) and the associated comments 5)  Scrapping the location of the person who posted the content and those who commented on the post. ( This has been tested on TripAdvisor before) 6)   The functions return all the content from the websites that satisfy our search criteria as raw data7)  Data cleaning and later analysis and visualisation

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Currently, such data has never been used in programming or policy formulation.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Zanzibar Commision for Tourism will be the first agency to utilise the data and hence it is expected that the experiment will have trickle down effect to other agencies and the Government systems at large.
