> Title of the innovation

Prototype fir development in Organic Farming for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)

> Brief description of the innovation

Disability is closely associated with poverty globally. In Zambia particularly, the environment is a major contributor to disability. Through The Tuso International Foundation (TIF), a prototype of organic farming is being developed that will consider access for PWDs in their state of physical disability. With a population of over 2million people living with disabilities in Zambia, this will provide an avenue for such persons to get out of the dependency cycle and be inclusive in the socio-economic sector. The prototype will provide education and practical skills to the participants. Based on their preferred interests, aspects of the prototype will be replicated in the locale of the benefitting participants through funding sources by TIF.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The prototype is registered with PACRA as a commercial enterprise. Therefore, produce from the project will be sold to market directly and through crop agents. Training of participants with disabilities will be funded through TIF for those in the disadvantaged bracket, and other participants will pay training fees. The centre will also be open to able-bodied women and youths who are the interested and drivers of the SME sector. Primarily, PWDs are the main beneficiaries whose objective to exit the poverty cycle is paramount.

> Technical Feasibility

The prototype is being constructed on a 2-hectarage plot in the Chief Liteta area of Chibombo. As a PWD, a house is under construction that's purposefully designed to provide easy access, reduced obstacles, and provide independence. This will reduce constant dependency of another for mobility.  The hectarage is being designed to have easy access to the crop fields that as a PWD will seek relatively no requirement to seek assistance. In this regard, in tandem with the school of engineering at UNZA, a prototype of an off-road wheelchair is being designed to withstand the local terrain. Depending on the type of disability one has whether on crutches, wheelchair or skateboard, crop will be planted at different levels of elevations. Hence, the suited crop and elevation is what will be replicated at the participant's locale.

> Anticipated Social Impact

With most PWDs living in poverty, this innovation will give them a sense of self-worth, inclusion, self-reliant, financial independence, and generate employment. Through the training provided, participants can be consultants in organic agriculture, financial management, and marketing. Therefore, the training will provide different skills to different people with a berth of opportunities ordinarily not available to PWDs. The market is alive to organic products with more people being health conscious in this generation. Hence, relevance is there which meets the SDG3 on the quest for wellness. Furthermore, organic farming meets environmental SDG with the lesser use of chemicals and pesticides. This nit only protects the environment, but it also protects PWDs that already have compromised health from further health complications from pesticides and herbicides.
