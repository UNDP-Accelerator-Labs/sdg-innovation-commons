# Accelerating Climate Action in Mexico: Leveraging Mass Consultations and Social Networks

### [[0:00]] Yes, good morning, good morning\. So what's your name and where are you from?

My name is Jorge Munguia\. I am Head of solution mapping and the accelerator lab at the Mexico country office\.

### [[0:12]] Perfect\. And in one sentence, how you can describe your experience with the accelerator Lab Mexico so far?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
I would say that being in the accelerator lab has been kind of like a mind blowing experience in multiple senses\. But, and just being around like so many people and the diversity of actors that we have to engage with continuously, not only with communities, because the role of solution mapping is very much kind of like ground level research, but also with like colleagues at the country office with such vast experience, like colleagues in different countries and continents, when we can share different methodologies and tools and questions and concerns\. And also even like our engagement with government officials at different levels and NGOs and activists and researchers\. Like it seems that at the Accelerator Lab we can very fluidly or maybe in this role as well very fluidly move and even have the mandate to move across all of these different peoples and and try to make sense of how we can better support development\.

### [[1:30]] Interesting\. So you mentioned you will have worked with different actors rather than only the community with the government and different actors\. You have any story that you can share with us when you practice the R&D function in it as the expert allowed?

[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
Yeah, actually I'm thinking a lot about like how to create waves of our work\. And so I'm going to tell two stories\. The first one had to do in the middle of COVID when in Mexico has many parts of the world, we were confined to be at our homes\. We had no instruction to leave our house\. We wanted to make sense of how can society support each other during a moment of crisis\. And there's theories of how social capital societies with higher social capital indexes can overcome better situation of difficulty\. So we wanted to kind of like map who's doing what, but we couldn't leave our house\. So I reached out to government officials who were in charge of youth support and, and the youth departments\. And they have already a network of young people\. And it was trying to understand like where they were at, what they were their concerns in this moment and how we could build together, experiment where we could reach out to all of these young people and them without leaving their homes\. As well\. Could feed into how a society around them and what they learn through their own networks and WhatsApp channels and friends and family members to learn how people were thinking to support others during this moment of crisis\. What was really nice is that everyone kind of got very motivated in a moment where there was a little bit of uncertainty, ambiguity and stress and wanted to reach out, wanted to map this ideas\. And we learnt multiple things that we didn't have data because the databases that we had available and the directories of NGOs, foundations, people were organized to work with things normally look at a span of, of bigger time\. And the results were mostly like over half of the results were emerging collectives or initiatives that had no previous background in doing anything for society and that had no digital trace\. But by this I mean that they didn't have like a website, they didn't have a name, but they were coming up with very unusual approaches\. Another interesting finding from this mapping that we did with all these young people and that were distributed geographically everywhere was that of the existing organizations, 95% of them shifted whatever they were doing\. Like kind of like stopped cold and started working on what this new situation was, working in a very agile and yeah, kind of unexpected way, like addressing their communities, doing their own needs, assessments of what their surroundings were demanding and supporting that\. And some of the findings of this story supported us to engage with ministries of risk management and crisis attention to kind of like shift a little bit the approach of rather the government being the one in charge of addressing crisis and keeping society safe and away\. And like trying to identify giving the agility, the strength, the capacity of society\. How can we bridge that into a programmatic approach and rethink the department itself into a much more collaborative platform with society? So that's one story\.

### [[5:59]] Yeah\. So I have like a follow up\. Yeah\. A follow up question, though\. It's perfect that you are at that time\. We know that it's hard to communicate with others\. We are staying at our homes amid COVID\-19\. And you mentioned that you were the hope for these people and start to work with them and giving some energy to start having their roles in the society\. I saw that from your story that there is a lot of communication between different actors and between the youth\. So I'm wondering about what the communication skills that you developed or you had or methods of communication that you used to connect these together and come up with these great insights\.

[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
So I think like a good starting point is first learning about the other, whoever that other is, asking questions, trying to better understand how the world looks from their perspective\. And from that starting point, no matter if it's a government official or an NGO or young students, you can relate that story to yourself and start sharing yourself as well and find like common ground\. It's like, how did you feel about that specific outcome? How, what was the decision you were making? And like, where do you aim to achieve? Like where do you aim to go with, with those questions? And then like I could share also that would give me prompts to share something that is relevant to them\. Not to me, but like, and start building trust and, and rapport\.

### [[7:37]] Yeah\. And how you took further this insight or learning that you just explained on other level, like what you did with them\.

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[tools:Personas]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
So one of the beautiful things of how this was set up is that there was like, I mean, we're all learning at all times from each other\. So there were no asymmetries of, of power or voices\. Like everyone had different experiences\. Every single experience was relevant to inform a different perspective\. So the bonds that were being built was just kind of like very free of like, I'm a student\. I should address these people with like a different title or something\. And no, like it kind of changed\. Like it was just like, I see this this way\.

### [[8:35]] Oh, how interesting\.

I see it this other way\. So curiosity kind of started merging engagement like everyone wanted to talk because since what became relevant was the diversity of experience, then it gave voice for everyone to be like, oh, I have something to say or like my experience could support a better understanding of the problem or the situation\.

### [[9:00]] Perfect\. So what I can understand that you gave voices to people and at that time and you start working together on this specific topic\. So I want like, I'm curious to know the other story that you have\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
So the other story is also about the power of voices\. But this was a very different situation\. After Stockholm 1972 agreement reached 50 years, there was an initiative to do national consultations and how we could accelerate climate action\. So what we did is kind of like massify this consultation through different approaches\. One was specific dialogues with marginalized communities or not visiblized communities or some very specific communities like private sector women, young people, indigenous groups\. Then we had at the same time like using different technologies, kind of like engagement tools like bots or whatever to have conversations with people through AQR code\. And this was diffused through public transport and whatever\. And we were asking 2 main questions like what is like how are you living climate change and what are your concerns regarding this for your life? And the other one was, do you have any idea or are you implementing any solution collectively to accelerate climate action? And the collective acts aspect was important because we wanted to know more about like the negotiations and the binding efforts between people\. And then we mapped all of these voices into an interactive map where people could look at what everyone was saying through video, audio or text\. And not only the public officials, but also the community that participated\. So they could learn from each other and that was a way of giving back and kind of like informing a larger group\. But what was really interesting out of this map is that without us planning it that way, it helped policy makers kind of have a better understand of the diversity and the dispersity of so many people trying to take action that it was used as a supporting contribution to make a policy change and change a law in Mexico to accelerate climate action\.

### [[11:39]] Well, perfect\. So I'm curious to know about your method to analyze these outputs that you get from this interactive mapping\. Any specific methods, tools maybe?

Yeah, mapping, visualizing systems approaches, how to include diversity of perspectives and voices, always giving back\. Think which ways are the best mediums to return to everyone a piece of information that could become actionable and related to their interests\. Deep listening, journey mapping, like trying to understand like how people, what people need to go through in order to achieve and solve the issues that they're facing\. I don't know, we can go on and on\.

### [[12:34]] Perfect\. So from like finally, from these two interesting studies that you mentioned, if you'll do it again, what's the things that you will not do or things that you will add in order to get benefit for the upcoming R&D practices?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
[[skills:Pitching skill]]
So one concern that I always have is even if the idea is good, the ideas can become much more powerful when it is implemented by many or more\. And that is not only kind of like creating a collective, but also kind of engaging with existing movements\. So for this particular given examples, maybe there wasn't so much that opportunity given the time frames and kept like the need to accelerate things\. But I would like participate more with all of the people who are already working already in existing initiatives and try to weave them together into doing action faster\.

### [[13:40]] Perfect, Sir\. Good luck with your next journey\.

Thank you\.
