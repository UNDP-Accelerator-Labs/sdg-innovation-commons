> Brief description of the innovation

Potatoes are one of the most consumed starches in Zambia. The price however due to low supply makes them a luxury food. Those with very low income and the poor cannot afford it. The aim of my project is to produce potatoes on a large scale so as to increase the amount of potatoes produced per year. Having a lot of potatoes on the market will help the price go down and be affordable for everyone. The other way of increasing the amount produced per year is to train people on how to grow them in their backyard garden therefore adding them to the food basket of many homes in Zambia.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will generate income through sales. I will sell the potatoes to marketeers at a cheaper price so that they are able to resale and make a living for themselves and have an income for their families.The potatoes will also be supplied to supermarkets and this will help with raising profits for the business and continuity. Apart from marketeers and supermarkets, employment will be created for those working on the farming project, thereby creating an income for them.
The challenge prize will help me be able to grow the potatoes on a large scale and be able to get the product to my target market. The process of growing the potatoes will not use chemical fertilizers which harm the soil but will acquire organic fertilizers which will only bring nutrition to the soil.

> Technical Feasibility

I grew some potatoes in ground beds and in bags to test which method produces best in terms of size and amount. The potatoes in the pictures I uploaded above were harvested from my test garden.
I intend to use the methods learned and used in my test garden on a larger piece of land.
The implementation plan involves acquiring a bigger piece of land, then start with growing on a one hectare portion and increase as the model and method is improved and product improves. Seed will be acquired from a reliable source as quality of seed affects quality of product.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve the lives of others in the sense that it will become a source of income to many. It will provide employment to the workers on the farm. It will bring income to transporters who will transport it to the target markets. And the marketeer will have a source of income through selling this product to their customers while acquiring it at a cheaper price. The potato will also contribute to food security by being easily accessible to everyone at a reasonable price. 
Zambia has not been able to produce enough potatoes to supply the whole market. The supermarket chains have been importing from other countries in order to add to the short supply. This is why when the government asked them to stop importing and allow Zambians to supply, there was a shortage on the market because we are not growing enough for the nation to be well supplied. The relevance of this innovation is to increase supply from within the country without needing to import thereby improving the economy and also making it accessible to every Zambian even the poor.
