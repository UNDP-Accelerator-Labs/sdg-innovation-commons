## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Informality Patterns in Bangladesh
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenges is what are the effective strategies to make informal sectors productive and secure in Bangladesh.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

This is a vulnerable sector, where most unskilled and low educated employees are engaged. Also, there is a lack of effective monitoring from GoB level. Though a significant portion of employees in this sector is female, but they have low negotiation power. And there is a huge wage gap between male and female employees. Self- employed/entrepreneurs often face the challenge of financial support to set up their business/organizations and there is a lack of financial support from formal organizations such as Bank. Since the employees engaged here are not under any formal pattern, there is a lack of access to social sucurity benefits and other allowances.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

- Bangladesh Labor Force data available regular basis with National Statistics Office (NSO). Some of the findings are as follows: - Out of the labor force people in Bangladesh is 38.9 million (40%) among the working age (15-64) people; among them not in school 30.2 million (79%). -  The trend of informal sector is growing (86.2%). -  Males are more in the informal sector compared to females; and higher portion is also found in the rural area.  - Three major informal sectors are in Bangladesh are agriculture, industry and service; all three sectors are growing.  - Gender wage gap is huge.

- Important sector but lack of qualitative data/evidence, need to do more studies - Lack of comprehensive disaggregation of data based on gender, age, ethnicity, disability etc.                  - Though the contribution to economy is very high (87%) but there is a lack of analytical platform on insecurity from        labor market attachment, rotation around various economic activities etc.
