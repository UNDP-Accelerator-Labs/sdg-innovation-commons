Curating a space for Innovation, Entrepreneurship & Leadership: Radio Jovem Collaboration 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The state There is clear evidence of multiple bodies, institutions, groups and initiatives focusing on the area of innovation, entrepreneurship and leadership, however there is a lack of connection and communication to create a homogenous body where all have in common. The challenge is to create a shared physical and virtual space where these stakeholders can come together and create an atmosphere for youth and entrepreneurship development. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Entrepreneurship is a widely used tool for economic development and growth. Governments in developing and developed countries have included it on their agendas, and startup incubators have become widely spread worldwide. The need for combining the social and environmental agendas to the business world is also gaining a lot of traction in the past 10 years. In fragile states, lack of education and formal training are the main barriers for economic development and growth, and are the highest contributors to youth unemployment and migration. Entrepreneurship training is a powerful tool to combat unemployment and support economic growth. Around the globe, SMEs are the leading employers and main drivers of innovation. If locally-driven infrastructure and capacity building programs are developed, entrepreneurs and SMEs would receive the support needed to develop new services, local economies and create jobs. In addition, SMEs would be better equipped and connected to attract capital. With new services and products, local economies become more productive and competitive. Our Frontier Challenge "Lack of basic services" mean that people are not able to access information and networks which can support them in exploring and creating something which falls within the area of entrepreneurship. Furthermore, there are no platforms physical or virtual to encourage entrepreneurship. Financial or investing opportunities to develop these skills are not existing.  Actors involved: state and population, Ianda Guine, Djemberem, ANEJ, the Leadership Academy.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The added value of the AccLab being involved in solving this challenge is that these entrepreneurs can support in the facilitation of basic quality services which falls under the frontier challenge. Given that they come from the communities, they understand the challenges and are more likely to develop responses that suit the community and their needs, being from the context.
