## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Digital transformation of Justice sector through human-centered design
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to understand if a human-centered design can help to create an easy-to-adopt digital transformation in the Justice sector O

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The justice sector in the DRC is poorly digitized with severe consequences on the performance and accessibility of justice to all sections of the population. Not to mention that the manipulation of papers fuels many fraud and corruption challenges within jurisdictions and offices. The UNDP has undertaken to support the sector by providing them with digital management tools in order to address these issues and trigger the digital transformation of justice. During the design process of the tools, the lab convinced the project team to engage in a participatory design process accompanied by experimentation to test their effectiveness and facilitate their adoption in a possible future scale-up

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

The justice administration and operation suffer severe judicial slowness, poor distribution of judicial infrastructure and a lack of human and financial resources for its optimal functioning. Above all this, there is also the lack of management and information tools adapted to facilitate the administration of justice alongside outdated physical archiving.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

 The Accelerator Lab brings in the value of coconstruction in the design and finetuning of the tools by the users as well as experimentation in pilot phases.  The lab convinced the justice project team by demonstrating the value of an experimental approach to quickly learn and apply the necessary changes before deploying the said tools at the scale. We have pitched the methodology of human-centered design and experimentation framework around the tools and got the green light to carry on with the approach. This learning cycle is worth it to align the country office with UNPD digital strategy in the portfolio and trigger change within the mothership with regard to adopting innovative methods in the programming 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

DRC Acclab is working with the superior council of the judiciaty to use human-centered design to maximize the adoption of digital tools in the Justice sector. Through tests and feedback loops, the experiment intends to strengthen the design and efficiency before scaling up
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

1)Conseil Supérieur de la magistrature (Superior Counsel of Judiciary through its secretary office):  The higher justice authority responsible for managing magistrates' careers, disciplinary power, and the functioning of the judiciary.  

2) Ministry of Justice: Responsible for the overall justice policy management at the government level. All prisons are under the management of the ministry and the tools are designed to address prison management in a link with courts.

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

-CSM is the entry point for any initiative in the justice system therefore they will be responsible for supporting the phases of the experiment with dedicated HR resources in all phases. This is leverage from an already established relationship with UNDP 

-The Ministry of Justice will play a key role and should be involved to ensure the adoption of the process at the government level and also unlock potential national budget funding for scaling up and support for upcoming phases of the initiative.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

In what ways might we maximize qualitative input in the design process of the tools?

In what ways might we capture issues around tools adoption?

In what ways might we ensure durability of the usage?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

-Human-centered design will be used to involve the end users throughout the tools development and testing process to ensure the product meets the needs and capabilities of the user. The following activities will be articulated : (1) Specify the user and the context of use with CSM ; (2) Specify the user requirements with ICT; (3) Produce design solutions; and (4) Evaluate designs against requirements.

-Participatory Design: this will be done through regular feedback loops for each test period to incorporate changes in the software

-Pilots: This method will be used to implement a test period and capture throughout the feedback of user experience before projecting what will the scale up look like. Clerks, magistrates, judges, prosecutors, and senior counselors will be the main contributors so that the design and pilots capture operational reality to mold into the software. We believe the combination of the 3 methods shall sharpen the tools with evidence to back up the possible scale up

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

As we progress in the tool design it is advised to get regular and accurate feedback from users to gauge user friendliness and capture areas where change needs to be done. Therefore, the 3 data sources combine will help the ICT team to finetune the tools based on user experience.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

the Conseil Superieur de la Magistrature (Superior Council of Judiciary) is the principal beneficiary. It is part of the projected exit plan to carry out all activities with the CSM-designated focal points (to be screened and recruited together) throughout the process.

This learning cycle is an experiment part of a broad program devoted to supporting justice reforms. The lab will work closely with the project team to secure funding in a projected scale-up phase expanding the pilots to other provinces.
