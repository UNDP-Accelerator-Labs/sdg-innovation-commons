## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. There is a huge potential for green mobility in Kathmandu due to rising pressure or Air Pollution in metropolitan cities of Nepal. 2. Qualitative research proved very effective in terms of getting insights from the target segment. 3. Incentivizing people for using green alternatives might not be a permanent fix for decreasing people's carbon footprint. 4. The government and the private sector needs to jointly develop sustainable green mobility plans.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

 Lack of fundamental knowledge about green mobility and its potential needs to be imparted to both public and the private sector in a manner that is palatable to them. Technical terms and green jargons proved to be ineffective when promoting green mobility and climate awareness.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Series of interactive sessions helped us in developing the MVP of green mobility. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These methods helped us in designing and experimenting trials in a controlled environment and analyze the hit as well as misses of the approach. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We partnered with Green coins and Aloi for designing the digital portal and the marketing plan of green mobility products.
