## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



VR Pilot for MSME Caribbean Tourism Experience, Promotion and Mental Health for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that MSMEs and Persons with disabilities cannot easily access and showcase nature attractions regionally. We need to be inclusive and ensure MSMEs have the visibility needed to survive in the Caribbean. PWDs as it relates to mental health should be given the opportunity to experience attractions and benefit from nature experiences .

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Lack of availability of platforms such as augmented reality and virtual reality as well as nature experiences in the Caribbean are not captured digitally.

PWDs are unable to access some areas due to the accessibility of terrain and therefore they are excluded from many of these experiences.

MSMEs receive a reduced level of traffic because larger companies (commercial enterprises) are the ones advertised. MSMEs need to be able to compete by showing their authentic experiences to survive.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The lab is creating a POC which can be used as a model to showcase MSMEs to tourist virtually using Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Additionally, the footage will also be used to give PWDs the virtual experience which they would not have had the opportunity to experience. 

This is a connector with some of the outputs our labs would have done previously such as capturing 360 content for analyzing coral reef as well as 360 footage we captured of the Kalinago territory in Dominica. This would be seen as a quick win with impact on MSMEs and PWDs.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?
