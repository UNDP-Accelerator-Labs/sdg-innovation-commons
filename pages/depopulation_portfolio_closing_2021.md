## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

DATA CHALLENGE: The potential of alternative data sources for gaining new close to real time insights about depopulation is huge. With continued use and optimization, these datasets provide an avenue for better identification of the drivers of change in migration dynamics, i.e., pandemics, economic disturbances, wars, environmental changes etc. The Serbian National Statistical Office has already expressed interest in utilizing one of the Depopulation Data Challenge projects as a supplement to their official statistics for future migration estimates. Advanced methods of statistical analysis of mobile traffic have made it possible to identify differences in the level of activity between municipalities and determine the degree of their interconnectedness. Calculated correlations between indicators derived from mobile data analysis and official demographic statistics, based on machine learning models, served to formulate the main finding - the weaker communication a municipality has with other municipalities, the greater the risk of depopulation. The web platform of this mobile analysis solution provides users with an extremely rich set of over 150 detailed mobile traffic indicators, which open the possibility for further analyses and demographic interpretations. The potential for recognizing patterns of daily migration and internal migration through the analysis of mobility data is particularly pronounced, which is a contribution of the solution that has just been hinted at, and could be of great importance for understanding these processes.    https://pop-insight.biosense.rs/ CIRCULAR MIGRATION & RETURNING POINT: Increased demand for the "Returning Point's" products and services among the Serbian diaspora and potential returnees as a result of effective promotional activities (implemented through various communication channels such as a Viber chat group, a podcast featuring return stories, etc. ), a high rate of successfully closed cases, and the team's dedication (two-way communication, availability, quick response, etc.).  Additionally, through our work with "Returning Point," we learned that additional work on better understanding the Serbian diaspora is necessary in order to continue developing relevant products and services, delivering tailored messages that meet the diaspora's expectations, and building a solid knowledge base of relevant content that will serve as the foundation for all future activities. — MOBILITY & ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN NON-URBAN AREAS:  Covid brought new opportunities: media reports indicate a doubling in the number of purchased “weekend homes” in 2020, with significant spikes in the cost of both homes and land, even in more remote areas.  This new interest creates an opportunity space for segments of the population who are more mobile - we are interested in exploring these locations and testing them out. Over time they may add up to a real demand that would bring in the broader range of services needed.  Even before COVID, some signals of this emerging demand were visible: Mokrin, Vrmdza - co-working, co-living hubs for international and local remote workers and digital professionals.  Government’s grant schemes to help secure affordable housing in rural areas are a good start, but not enough.  Our research shows that connectedness is among the key indicators for lowering the risk of depopulation. This includes physical infrastructure, and roads are already an important focus for the Government. But it also includes social connectivity.  Example: UNDP research showed that mobile phone data can be used as a proxy for depopulation risk: the intensity of mobile call traffic that one municipality has with other municipalities is a very good predictor of depopulation.  One of the key “missing ingredients” for people to come to rural areas is other people.  There is also a lack of infrastructure, digital skills and services. For example, while major government expenditures in rural broadband are undoubtedly required, they will not on their own result in more e-business or a digital rural workforce. People need to be digitally literate to know how to use new technologies.  Additionally, if we wish to revitalize economic activities in rural areas we need to have accompanying services in place, to supplement digital connectivity, such as more accessible delivery, transportation, banking and other services.  An opportunity for revitalization of rural areas, and related to mobility - is the work with digital nomads and with emerging internal or ‘lifestyle’ migration- people from urban areas moving to the countryside. UNDP is already working in this space, and we identified 3 types of these ‘inbetweeners’ as we call them: Traditional digital nomads coming to Serbia for a good and affordable lifestyle, Serbian professionals who are able to work from home and choosing to do so from rural locations, as a lifestyle change, Serbian diaspora who have returned to their hometowns during COVID and are able to continue to work for foreing companies based elsewhere. While the “lifestyle” and circular internal migration trend is not yet strong in Serbia, it may increase in the near future, with upper-middle class migration out of urban centers into more environmentally friendly areas. This migration is likely to be temporary/circular, i.e. in the form of “secondary homes” in environmentally attractive areas, in addition to primary homes located mostly in the urban centres. Examples - Fruska Gora, Kosmaj, Zlatibor mountain areas. Talking about the future of work and digital nomads: The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated location independence, particularly for knowledge workers. Furthermore, WFH and remote work became more widely accepted by both employers and clients. While digital nomads are mainly an urban phenomenon, we are exploring how such migration can help infuse rural areas with new life and vitality. UNDP is working on helping attract this new kind of migration, and supporting the ‘inbetweeners’, because these new work models may lead to more investment in local services in rural areas, thus contributing to the local development. For example, while a tourist would likely not get a haircut in a rural area, local or international ‘temporary’ visitors staying longer - may do so.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

It was extremely difficult to coordinate between the Telco operator and the implementing partner (The Biosense institute). It took much longer than planned to prepare data on the side of the mobile operator. Circular migration and internal mobility among foreign digital professionals - Measures such as the closure of co-working spaces and other places for digital professionals across Serbia, reduced mobility due to lockdowns and other travel restrictions, all had an effect on the country's ability to attract digital labour.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Migration dynamics (internal and external migrations)

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

This approach allowed us to have close-to-real time insights that complement the official statistics.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

MIGRATION WORK: “Belgrade Gets Digital” began as a grass-roots initiative supported by the UNDP Accelerator Lab and has grown into a standalone consortium of various local organizations concerned with the work of digital nomads/professionals and the future of work. Similar to "Belgrade Gets Digital" in 2021, "Returning Point" has evolved into a stand-alone civil society organization following its incubation phase as a UNDP project.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Biosense institute

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

DEPOPULATION DATA CHALLENGE: Telekom Srbija - mts CIRCULAR MIGRATION: When it comes to direct collaboration and partnership with the private secotr, we developed a job matching platform in collaboration with Returning Point and Infostud Serbia (the largest job platform in Serbia) to assist our diaspora and potential returns in locating job opportunities in Serbia while considering or returning to the country. Returning Point's website includes a listing of all available job postings that require international experience.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

DEPOPULATION DATA CHALLENGE: Line ministry (the Cabinet of the Minister without Portfolio in charge of Demography and Population Policies) and the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia representatives were in the Jury of the Depopulation Data Challenge. CIRCULAR MIGRATION: The work of "Returning Point" has been endorsed and supported by the Prime Minister's Office from the start. In addition, the relevant ministries and other institutions are also involved in their work.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All 4 winning teams of the data challenge were new partners for UNDP, two of them are leading private sector companies and the other two are from academia.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNFPA was the co-organiser of the Depopulation Data Challenge, they helped with the teams evaluation and mentoring process. GIZ supported the challenge financially.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The mix of methods, new partners and data helped us engage in questioning, observing, and associational thinking (connected seemingly unconnected ideas) together with storytelling
