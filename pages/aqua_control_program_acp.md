> Title of the innovation

AQUA CONTROL PROGRAM ACP

> Brief description of the innovation

Safe and readily available water is important for public health, whether it is used for drinking, domestic use, food production or recreational purposes. Improved water supply and sanitation, and better management of water resources, can boost countries’ economic growth and can contribute greatly to public health and proper human development.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My organization will order, market and make sales of the said brands/products that enhance proper healthy, clean water elements around the country. 
It will consist of a group of employees in the service to do the work by considering all communities being entitled to safe and clean drinking water by way of educating people in those areas. 
This innovation's goal is to reduce infections, sicknesses that are caused by the intake of poor water purification and sanitation. Thus, it will be valuable at all stages of it's implementation.

> Technical Feasibility

This structure will account health agencies and other water and sanitation institutions working hand in hand through providing necessary elements communities can use to have access to clean safe and water. For example my innovation is focused on supplying "chlorine" to both local and rural areas around the country. Like mentioned before, involving other agencies that deal with health water elements will be priority.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Water filters have a direct impact on social and economic development. A simple water purification system would not only improve health conditions within local communities, but a proper storage of any excess water would reduce the time and energy expenditures necessary for water collection.
