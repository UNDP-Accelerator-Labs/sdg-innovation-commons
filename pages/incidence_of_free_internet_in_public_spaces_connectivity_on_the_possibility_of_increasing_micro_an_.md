## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Víctor A. Tablas

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

25/07/2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Free access to wifi in public spaces - Inclusive digitalization

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

The learning opportunities around this frontier challenge are many, so for this portfolio of experiments, 4 specific areas will be emphasized about public access to the internet: (1) revitalization of public spaces, (2) opportunities for MSMEs, (3) efficiencies for users and (4) social cohesion. This portfolio of experiments tests a total of 10 hypotheses about these areas and this experiment falls in the second area mentioned.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

In addition to having helped connect Balboa Park to a high-speed Wi-Fi network, UNDP's Digi-Chiquihuites project enabled micro and small businesses to access not only a mobile device, but also an 8-week training program which taught them about: (a) digital tools, (b) financial tools, (c) digital marketing, and (d) soft skills.  The baseline of the project and exchanges with the people who run the park's businesses showed that this fixed-type Wi-Fi connection was a need and aspiration of the commercial business tenants of Balboa Park and Puerta del Diablo. In Cobonaglu &amp; Nusair (2012) it is suggested that providing Wi-Fi service in restaurants is positively correlated with a customer's intention to return to the place. We are interested in exploring if this is still a reality and if it applies to businesses that operate in public spaces.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The objective of the experiment is to causally test whether making the free Wi-Fi network available in this public space affects the possibilities for the generation of income for micro and small businesses, recommendations from businesses and the Park.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Hypothesis 1: If consumers in micro and small businesses are informed about the existence and access to a Wi-Fi network, then they stay longer in business. Hypothesis 2: If consumers in micro and small businesses are informed about the existence of Wi-Fi, then they present higher average business spending. Hypothesis 3: If consumers in micro and small businesses are informed about the existence and access to a Wi-Fi network, then they are more likely to recommend visiting the business. Hypothesis 4: If consumers in micro and small businesses are informed about the existence and access to a Wi-Fi network, then they are more likely to recommend visiting the park.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The objective of the experiment is to causally test whether making the free Wi-Fi network available in this public space affects the possibilities for the generation of income for micro and small businesses, recommendations from businesses and the Park. The experiment design is a clustered randomized controlled trial (cRCT), where each business unit represents a cluster and consumers are the treatment units. To test these hypotheses

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Consumers within micro and small business a total of 224 consumers, who visit 8 business units (4 in treatment and 4 in control) in the northwest area of ​​Balboa Park will be observed and interviewed from wednesday to sunday of a regular week.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Observation and survey collection

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity has a low risk
