> Title of the innovation

The title of innovation is the world of Wi-Fi. We are a group of 3 people who are perusing computer systems engineering at northern technical college. This course has brought ideas in our minds and we have a project of setting up Wi-Fi in different areas in order to reduce the movement of people and increase job opportunities in the country.

> Brief description of the innovation

This project is a very effective and efficient project which may advance the economy. The project system is a simple task to handle which any person can perform, But it requires intelligence to make it be productive and efficient. We are looking forward to set up Wi-Fi system in the entire country but we want to be fine with  Ndola, and has the project gets effective and efficient we will proceedingly put Wi-Fi system in the entire country so that citizen's may easily use our Wi-Fi system where ever they will be. This business will not only benefits our company but also citizens, we will provide job opportunities has the company grows in order to reduce poverty in our country and it will also attract citizens from other countries to come and see how the set of Wi-Fi is done so it will benefit the country as well. Apart from this our project will promote technology system in zambia and big companies from different continents will partner with zambia.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our company will benefit both citizens and the country, to the citizens it will provide job opportunities and to country it will provide tourism, tourists will come to see how the Wi-Fi system is set up and also big companies from different continents will partner with Zambia which will also be a benefit.

> Technical Feasibility

Our plan is to set up Wi-Fi systems across the country by starting in Ndola and going to the rest of the country.

> Anticipated Social Impact

To others it will drive a lot of people out of poverty and to the country it will put the country on top of the international level.
