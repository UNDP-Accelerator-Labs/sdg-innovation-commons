## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

LNOB: accessibility assessment for PWD
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to improve building accessibility for people with disabilities in Nur-Sultan by assessing key parameters of the urban environment and using a 2GIS virtual geomap to provide accessibility data to all citizens.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In 2006, the United Nations Headquarters in New York adopted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional Protocol (A/RES/61/106), which entered into force in May 2008. The Convention clarifies and specifies how all categories apply to persons with disabilities and identifies areas where adjustments should be made so that persons with disabilities can exercise their rights effectively and areas where their rights have been violated, and the protection of rights must be strengthened.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

The Government of Kazakhstan is implementing the National Plan to guarantee the rights and improve the quality of life of people with disabilities until 2025. The National Plan includes 64 measures in 7 areas, including barrier-free environmental targets. According to the Social Protection Information Portal, 696,000 people with various types of disabilities currently live in Kazakhstan, including more than 29,000 in the city of Nur-Sultan, the country's capital. Accessibility is a precondition for the inclusion of people with disabilities in society. If buildings, goods and services are not accessible, people with disabilities cannot live independently or participate fully and equally in society. Accessibility is relevant in many contexts, from the physical environment to public goods, transport, amenities, services, information, and communication.

Here is a story of Zhaslan Suleimenov, disability rights activist, who launched the Equal Access project with a $6,000 grant awarded by USAID's Central Asia Media Program in June 2019.  With this support, he was able to purchase basic camera equipment and hire an assistant to help him document his daily life on Nur-Sultan's public transportation and accessing public buildings. He then shared photos and videos of his challenges with his followers on Facebook(link is external), YouTube(link is external) and Instagram(link is external). Zhaslan then complained to local authorities about the inaccessibility of public services and published their official responses on his social networks. In just two months after launching the project, Zhaslan's Facebook and Instagram followers doubled. Zhaslan's content was picked up by other media, including RFE-RL's Current Time Asia(link is external), a daily online news program (68,338 views on Facebook(link is external) and YouTube), and Channel One Eurasia(link is external), an affiliate of Russia's main TV channel (107,906 views on YouTube(link is external) plus TV audience). Authorities responded quickly to two of his complaints about an inadequate ramp in the mayor's administrative building and a defective elevator in one of the main public service centers in Nur-Sultan, where the activist had an accident. Nur-Sultan's Labor, Social Security and Migration Committee fined the municipality and ordered the construction of a new ramp that meets international standards. In the meantime, local law enforcement authorities initiated a criminal case against the public service center with the defective elevator. The case was confirmed by law enforcement authorities and picked up by the media. It will ensure that the rights of people with disabilities are taken seriously both in the public sector and in society at large. Nevertheless, the problem remains topical at the city and country levels. Zhaslan and many other activists continue to publish examples of poor urban planning and building design that create barriers to access to services.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

There are two online maps of accessibility in Kazakhstan: https://inva.gov.kz/ru/map/321 and https://doskaz.kz/. Both maps classify the accessibility of facilities and services into three levels: accessible, partially accessible, and inaccessible, based on a large number of signs. Several interviews with people with disabilities have shown that these maps are difficult to navigate and search for information. Therefore, they do not help users plan their routes and daily activities. In addition, many people are not even aware of these maps. The goal of the Accelerator Lab experiment is not to duplicate existing tools, but to test new forms of data visualization with improved usability and effectiveness. It will give everyone the opportunity to have access to an easy-to-use digital tool that includes relevant accessibility data and has a convenient user interface. One of the options is to adapt the 2GIS mobile application, the country's most popular virtual map

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the key accessibility parameters and criteria for different PWD groups? What are the main barriers and opportunities to create an accessible environment?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Methodology development: collective intelligence methods will be used to dive deep into the problem together with the focus group participants. Semi-structured discussions and observations will be conducted to understand the root causes and behavioral patterns of PWD. This information will form the basis for the development of the methodology. Virtual GIS map: we will collect the ideas for better structuring and visualization of accessibility data using the digital platform.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There are data gaps in building accessibility information. This data will be collected by volunteers and citizens during the experiment and linked to geospatial data in the 2GIS app.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection may benefit from the results of the experiment.
