## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

First, the CO and the UNDP social protection support project are playing an important role in the implementation of this initiative. Colleagues with extensive professional knowledge of inclusion and accessibility provided expert advice and guidance. They shared information about the ecosystem, which includes civil society and other organizations working on behalf of the advancement of PWDs.

Building a partnership with a private company that owns the IT product contributes to the sustainability of this initiative. To keep accessibility information up to date, an entire city-wide accessibility assessment must be carried out at least once a year. This experiment will allow building a methodology and integrating primary data, but only a systematic approach will allow this practice to continue to exist. The 2GIS management company has the resources and intentions to make “availability” one of the mandatory criteria displayed in the application in all branches.

It is important to evaluate the entrance facilities first, since access to elevators, bathrooms and other premises is possible only if a person can get inside. Building codes prescribe the parameters of ramps and handrails, their dimensions and heights. However, in practice, we encountered other impediments that prevent free entry. The most common is the presence of objects preventing movement (urns, posters, decorative items), a steep doorstep at the entrance to the building itself, the presence of narrow doors, the slippery surfaces of ramps or closed or steep ramps.

Some accessibility elements are just for show. A good example is a call button located on the facade of a building. This button is important if a person with a disability needs help, for example, to climb stairs. However, in practice, these buttons are either absent or do not work. It is also common to find a ramp designed at an angle of 30-45 degrees, which is not suitable and even dangerous to use.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

To monitor compliance with accessibility requirements, interactive maps have been created in web platforms that display information about the availability of social and transport infrastructure facilities and level of service availability.

Nevertheless, the general public has no ready access to information on the availability of facilities. The accessibility maps mentioned above do not solve this problem, as they mostly contain information about government buildings and limited data about private organizations. In Kazakhstan, as in many market economies, the private sector provides most services. Therefore, it is very important to audit the accessibility of all buildings nationally and provide a user-friendly tool for information access.
