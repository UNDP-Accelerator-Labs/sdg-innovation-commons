## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Lao Startup Ecosystem Exploration &amp; Mapping
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that Lao startups are not visible on the web and a lot is unknown in the Lao context.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The startup ecosystem in Lao PDR is nescient but growing. There are more and more startups providing innovative services and disrupting the conventional businesses and creating add-values and jobs. However, only few people locally and regionally know about Lao startup. When search on the web, little information is given about Lao startup. Therefore, we are exploring and mapping the Lao startup Ecosystem, to better understand the current startup established and their development, and to provide recommendation the Government of Lao PDR in prioritizing the promotion and support to Lao startup.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator lab is outlining 3 components of the startup ecosystem mapping: identifying all Lao startups, interviewing and mapping Lao startup and sharing an assessment report with recommendation to the Government of Lao PDR. As of today, no assessment of Lao startup ecosystem has been shared to public since 2016, while there is growing interest in entrepreurship and startup. If the assessment can support to leverage promotion and support to startups and aspiring entrepreneurs, it will be worth the investment, as it will foster innovation, new services and positive changes for the socio-economic development of Lao PDR
