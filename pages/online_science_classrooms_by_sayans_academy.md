Sayans Academy covers the gap between learning sciences and its real world application.
We are a providing digital STEM learning platform for secondary schools. This is an online classroom where students undergo tailored training, create collaborations, ask, share and access mentors/experts in given fields.


Who we are

Sayans is a not for profit organization focused on transforming science and technology in Africa through education. It is started and managed by individuals experienced in the application of science, technology and business development.

Sayans supports students in African rural secondary schools experiment with and apply science to real life. We set up spaces within the network schools where students are engaged in hands-on workshops, nurture their creativity and problem solving skills by using science and technology to solve real life challenges and above all have FUN.

Sayans was established in 2016 initially supporting teachers embrace Project Based Learning in their classes. With previous learning, Sayans iterated since 2018 with a focus on working directly with students and supplementing the teachers through a Flipped Classroom Learning model.

Where we are 

Sayans is currently setting up in Mpigi, Uganda with a goal to grow exponentially to add more countries in Africa.

Schools 10+

Students impacted 1000+. Sayans is finalizing a partnership agreement with Ministry of Education, Science, Technology and Sports to have scaled implementation in all secondary schools in the country.

Why Join Us

Our promise is based on our core values. And every school and student who joins gets just that;

Fun
Experiential
Resources for Do It Yourself projects
Co-creation & collaboration
Tailored support
Our workshops span all STEM areas, basic ICT, including coding and programming and we got the right people and partnerships to make each workshop leave a wow moment in each student.

Our program is designed to supplement what teachers teach through a Flipped Classroom Model – students learn outside the class and class-time is used for discussions and review. This model is tested to leave great results both academic and outside the class.

Our people, Our strength

We have a database of over 100 innovative teachers, engineers, doctors… both locally and internationally who are more than willing to share their knowledge with the students. These professionals use innovative analogies to create deeper and engraved understandings of science concepts.
Each Sayans center within a school is run by a Sayans fellow, a university science graduate who is well equipped to guide, empower and mentor each student.
Our team provides valuable information to support the decision and career choice making of the students. We have the right people in the right fields to give the right guidance.
