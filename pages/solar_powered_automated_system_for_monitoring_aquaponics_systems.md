Aquaponics systems have been proposed as a solution to food security challenges since it uses 75% less energy and 95% less water than traditional approaches2. However, there are risk areas in the management and maintenance of aquaponics systems such as high pH and ammonia levels. To ensure these levels remain optimal daily or sometimes more frequent testing and monitoring of the system is required. In addition to high pH and ammonia levels, oxygen is critical to the system for both the fish as well as the plants. Therefore, the pumping system is critical and should always be functioning optimally and should therefore be monitored constantly to reduce the loss of fish and plants. Performing these tests can be challenging for some citizens and therefore the required testing and monitoring can become a barrier to the widespread use of aquaponics systems.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Can a low-cost model be developed which fully automates the testing required for the optimal operation of a solar powered aquaponics system?”

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Experimental (RCTs, etc.)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Private Sector

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To determine if a low cost model can be developed to fully automate the testing required for the optimal operation of a solar powered aquaponics system

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

if a low const monitoring system can be developed to manage the risk of aquaponics systems then the average household would be able to have a system increasing the production of food by home owners.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Previous research will be examined for similar systems.

Based on this a model will be designed.

The model using low-cost sensors will be deployed and tested.

The results from the automated system will be compared with manual testing.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Comparing pH and EC using an automated approach and manual approach.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The results from the automated system will be compared with manual testing.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 weeks of data was collected and compared.

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
