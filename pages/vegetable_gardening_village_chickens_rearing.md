> Title of the innovation

Vegetable gardening/ village chickens rearing

> Brief description of the innovation

Am growing vegetables and tomatoes using crop rotation system, I want to upgrade this project and grow different vegetables on a higher scale and include village chicken rearing in my project.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

By growing vegetables on a large scale,it will enable me to generate income for myself and people who will be working with me in the project. Also if I employee more people,the operations will grow.my target markets are,the immediate community where I stay, big markets e.g Soweto and in restaurants. Also potentially in schools especially boarding schools.
The prize money will help in growing more vegetables and divert in other ventures like chicken rearing (village chickens) especially.
The methods I want to be using in growing vegetables is clean and environmental friendly.because I ll be using organic manure which will have no negative effect on the environment.gardens also make environments beautiful.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is designed in a way that,I want to grow vegetables through out the year, using the same crop rotation system, I'll start by preparing land, fortunately there is already a virgin land in place,what's remaining are the tools to use on the land,buy seeds and start the project.

> Anticipated Social Impact

People who are roaming around without jobs can be helped by getting involved in this project, because at the end,they  will receive salaries for their input. The current market is not producing enough vegetables to satisfy the growing population, therefore this innovation will be very relevant to Carter for the short fall.for example, egg plants are scarce during this season.my innovation will help reduce the scarecity of such commodities.
