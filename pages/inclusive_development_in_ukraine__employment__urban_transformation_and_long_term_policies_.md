## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Employment of people with disabilities: the biggest opportunity for system transformation is seen in business-to-business exchange on inclusive employment practices. This helps to overcome hidden/unspoken barriers 2. Just Transition: is not about changing a coal mine to a new factory. Transition to "what"?  - a visionary discussions on the quality of life in the city is missing in the #justtransition discourse 3. Just Transition: Usual focus on attracting external investors, underlook internal and more sustainable community development potential. Central planning does not allow to see fantastic local opportunities: role of church in one city, robotics school in another and so on . 4. Just Transition: Local mental models - metanarratives matter! if people do not believe change is possible - UNDP projects will be useless - unless addressing this metanarrative first 5. Long-term policies: there is a sustained and growing interest within public sector to applying long term policymaking (foresight) to address complex social issues. The center of long term policymaking can be in Parliament.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. Employment: business representatives are generally interested and willing to move towards more inclusive employment practices, however they are concerned to "make a mistake" in communication, policy and receive negative feedback 2. Just Transition: Portfolio of the initiatives is a fantastic tool for transformation of the city BUT implementation, management and financing of the portfolio seem reeeeeeeeally difficult!!! 3. Just transition: Hackaton is a great tool to energize community and co-develop their transformation ideas BUT further support is needed e.g. in the form of acceleration and incubation for the teams.  4. Long term policies: collaborative foresight exercises are perceived to be "less serious", decision makers would rather rely on qualitative prognosis, however this limits foresight impact and quality.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Combination of these data types allowed to view the ecosystems from various perspective. To address such frontier challenges, it is necessary to rely on insights that are people-centered. Real barriers for system transformation could not be identified by only analysing statistical data. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

By regularly feeding back the results of system mapping back to the stakeholders, it allowed to navigate further exploration and solution mapping in an agile way.
## Partners
