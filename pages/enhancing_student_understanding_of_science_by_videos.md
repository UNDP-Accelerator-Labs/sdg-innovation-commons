## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Enhancing student understanding of science by videos
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to provide videos that illustrate the fonctionality of the different systems thought at primary and seconday school

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The various scientific systems thought are illustrated in forms of sketchs. it does not provide clear understanding and does not allow for a visualization of different part of the sytems. The existing approach of drawing sketchs does not provide à complete picture of the various systems studied ( e.g. circulatory, respiratory, digestive systems, ...) There is no yet introduction of digitalization into the education systems, there i a need to improve the quality of the education,.. Ministry of education, the students, the teachers, the parents, the videos industry are stakeholders

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

There is no yet data found on the challenge


</div>


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

The sucess rate in the science field is low at the secondary level The number of student in the science is very few compare to other fields The registration rate of university student in science is very low


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The lab want to surplement the existing teaching methods with videos as visual aids; put together the different stakeholders to work on improving education; increase the student interest into the field of science and increase the sucess rate There is a need to test the new approach at a small scale, be convinced of the sucessfulness of the method before scaling it

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Videos to improve interest and learning capacity of the students in science field at primary and scondary level

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What is the effective way to interest primary and secondary students to the field of science?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

solution mapping: identify the existing solution in use in the informal basic ; cocreation: develop videos with the contribution of all stakeholders particularly the ministry, the video industry, the teachers... prototyping: the solution does not yet existe so there is a need to design a sample videos to validate the assumptions

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

At national level there are data of various exams but it does not provide inside into the gaps that exists in the various results and why only a few number of students who embrass the science field, why there is a lack of interest for that field compare to others.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

will the use of well designed videos tutorial improve the learning capacity at the primary and secondary level? How to introduce digital at primary and secondary school? How would be the teachers adopt the videos as complementary to the teaching methods?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioral insights :  to understand the eventual obstacles of adoption of the solution Collective intelligence: Put together different stakeholders in order to reach the right objectives that is improve interest for science field at primary and secondary school Gamification: to encourage to use of the solution

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is no data on the different reasons justifying the lack interest for the science field. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The ministry of primary and secondary school
