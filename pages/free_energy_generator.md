> Title of the innovation

Free Energy Generator

> Brief description of the innovation

This project seems very impossible to do. But energy or electricity can be generated without the use of fuel this is possible by the use of batteries and mechanical rotations that will be able to make again of the output voltage and current in reference to the input voltage. Even though people say that it's against the law that energy cannot be created or destroyed. But look at this what happens when you are cycling and bicycle climbing a mountain you use less energy because of the mechanical rotation that is used in order to gain more output energy than the energy used by a person. The electrical circuit and the mechanical rotation helps to gain the output voltage and current.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It's a generator that will be sold to clients (people) and more labour will be required to manufacture the generators.

> Technical Feasibility

Even though people say that it's against the law that energy cannot be created or destroyed. This invocation is not against that law. To gain a clear picture of this Look at this what happens when you are cycling and bicycle climbing a mountain you use less energy because of the mechanical rotation that is used in order to gain more output energy than the energy used by a person. The electrical circuit and the mechanical rotation helps to gain the output voltage and current. 
The prototype is currently under construction. But please note that others think this is impossible to achieve

> Anticipated Social Impact

The load that zesco carries will be up lifted to a great extent and will benefit otherwise in rural areas.
