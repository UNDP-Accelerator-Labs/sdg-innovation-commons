## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Alab Mongolia is working with the second-largest city in Mongolia, Erdenet to improve the waste recycling process. Existing informal neighborhoods don't have centralized waste bins, instead, they collect their waste in their plot of land to be picked up by waste management agencies every 3-4 months. In order to create more efficiency, we tested 2 types of waste bins to compare efficiency and possibility. Testing improved waste collection, sorting, and transportation in selected ger districts of Erdenet city.  • Activity 1: Design, develop, and install 2 types of solid waste collection bins in 2 ger district locations to implement and experiment with improved waste collection process.  • Activity 2: Design, implement, and experiment with selected 2 types of bin waste transportation process.  • Activity 3: Provide recycling bins for the 2 locations and provide necessary training and information to experiment on waste recycling behaviors of the households. A-lab will work closely with STP on the development of the information materials on recycling. • Activity 4: Improve and respond to any risks and issues during the project period and evaluate the learnings and lessons. STP will work closely with A-lab to assess the project.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If designed and tested 2 types of bins, we will be able to identify better waste collection options and understand community behavior

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We selected 2 areas in an informal residential neighborhood to test 2 types of waste bin prototypes. We will provide and disseminate information to the community. Over 1 months of collection, we will be able to see which version performs better and meets the community needs.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Waste bin collection frequency, cost

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Waste collection process, camera

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time allocation and coordination efforts from the team
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The original hypothesis was not proven as waste bins alone would not create much improvement in the collection process. Both bins were getting full very fast and very frequently because households beyond selected areas were dumping large-amount of waste at once. Selected households also didn't throw their waste frequently, but resorted to collecting in their plots and then dumping large amounts. This resulted in bins being completely overfilling frequently and making the environment trashy. The behavior of the residents need to accounted for more effective collection process.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

As part of the Smart Erdenet initiative, we tested 2 types of waste bins in the semi-informal settlements in Erdenet, Mongolia for 45 days to see whether we can have efficiency. The centralized waste bins were for 100 households in each location and had 4m3 waste capacity, recycling bins, cameras, street lighting, and an information board.   1). Waste collection could be more economically efficient with one of the designs, but waste collection requires various groups to be in harmony for effectiveness.   2). Community waste disposal behavior affects the collection significantly.  3). Behavior depends on previous ways of disposal, location of the bin, visibility of the bin, and cleanliness of the bin area. Surprisingly, recycling behavior was easier to acquire for the people. We believe previous campaigns helped people but didn't provide any outlets.  4). Experiment boundary was challenging to enforce as people outside would dispose of their waste.   5). The behavior of the disposal will directly affect how frequent the bins are filled and it is extremely irregular as households would collect their waste in their plots in large amounts and dispose every 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

2 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

USD 19,950

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

It doesn't, but we will provide official learning report to the waste management agency as they're planning similar approach.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Coordinated with Waste Management Agency of Erdenet
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The experiment is located in Erdenet city, which makes it challenging for Alab to stay in control. Additionally, the implementing agency is not very understanding of the experimental nature of the intervention.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Other regional Waste Management Agencies might benefit from the results

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Consider residents' behavior, current waste management capacity in-depth before replication

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

No, this is a very specific experiment

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

During the sense and explore phase, we learned that a number of local waste agencies are considering collective waste bins in informal areas. But there were also a number of opposing arguments to this approach. Hence, we decided to formulate and test this idea.
