> Title of the innovation

Village chicken production

> Brief description of the innovation

Village chickens are a source whose full potential is yet to be realized. Although broilers are a good source of protein and take a few weeks to grow, the current supply of day old chicks does not meet the demands of the producers. Village chicken rearing is fairly self sustaining enterprise and highly nutritius.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Chickens will be sold locally as well as to our neighbors at Kasumbalesa market as meat at a competitive price and earned income will be reinvested in the business so as to make it grow. Due to high demand of village chickens on the market, challenges of marketing will not be a problem. Droppings of chickens will be used as manure in the garden hence protecting the environment from pollution. Biosecurity will be provided to limit movement of the chickens.

> Technical Feasibility

The proposed implementation plan will be 6 months from the development stage of chicks to full market weight

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation will create some jobs for the youths and women within the community and due to the demand of village chickens on the market, definitely it will be relevant.
