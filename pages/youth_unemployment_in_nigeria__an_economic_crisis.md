Youth unemployment in Nigeria: An economic crisis
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Nigeria has an unemployment crisis at hand. Over the past 4 years (2014-2018) unemployment has risen four fold among the youth. Our challenge is to address the gaps that contribute to the rising rate of unemployed and underemployed youth in the country.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Nigeria has a massive young population with youth ranging from the ages of 15-35 years old, making up over a third of the total population. However, 43% of Nigeria's youth are under or unemployed. Specifically, 21M are unemployed and 18M are underemployed. There are not enough jobs to engage the youth and a notable disconnect between skills and employment opportunities.                             

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

The net labour market entrants in Nigeria are approximately 11 times the net jobs created (NESG), this means there are not enough jobs in the market for employable youth. In 2014, there were about 4,000 roles to be filled within the Nigerian immigration services, however, 6.5M people applied which resulted to a stampede at several stadia used as recruiting centers for these roles. In four years, between 2014-2018, the youth unemployment rate increased by over 4X from 3.04 Million to 13 Million youth.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also fueled youth unemployment in Africa’s largest economy, prompting the government to launch various work schemes, including the Special Works Program, although laudable they are a drop in the bucket with regards to the magnitude of unemployment at hand. Increase in crime across the country, including petty crimes, theft, kidnapping and fraud due to youth unemployment.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

There are possible gaps in the design of current programs that address youth unemployment in the country across skills and job creation. For example, there are other sectors to consider such as agriculture specifically to youth unemployment and innovation within vocational training to combat the challenge. Also exploring the future of work in Nigeria and expanding the possibilities for employment that are not currently traditionally thought of as employment or not currently within the market but will be in a couple of years considering new trends due to COVID-19.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the needs in the local economy?, What are the challenges for unemployed /underemployed youth in Nigeria to advance their careers?, What is the future of work/employment in Nigeria?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Horizon scanning will be used to identify new trends and signals on the national work scene, it would also be used to identify the challenges for underemployed/ unemployed youth. Foresight will be used to explore possible futures in the work/employment space in Nigeria. Human-centered design and co-creation methods will be used throughout the process to ensure that the initiatives are created for and with the community in mind (underemployed/ unemployed youth, employers, facilitators & educators). Solutions mapping will be used to recognize multiple innovative solutions to combat the unemployment challenge. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Direct interviews/surveys/focus groups/ will provide us with first hand knowledge and insight to the challenges and needs of the community. Social media will provide us with insights and trends on job creation that will inform the future of work/employment in Nigeria. Socioeconomic data as well as citizens data will provide us with an understanding of wether there is a skills gap and/or the suitability of academic trainings, white collar work, to ensure that the trainings are fit for purpose.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Nigerian youth will benefit in terms of gaining meaningful employment, the informal sector (traders, farmers, market women etc) and the employers which will all in turn benefit the Nigerian economy.
