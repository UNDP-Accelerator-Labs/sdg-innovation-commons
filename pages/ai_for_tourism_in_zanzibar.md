AI for Tourism in Zanzibar Leveraging the Power of Data to drive an Inclusive Economic Growth 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Low return rates for tourists in Zanzibar threatening resilience and competitiveness in the tourism sector.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Zanzibar is a semiautonomous province of Tanzania, consisting of two major islands, Pemba and Unguja, with a population of about 1.8 million people, (National Bureau of Statistics, 2022). For many years Zanzibar’s economy has been heavily dependent on agriculture which contributes about 28% of its GDP and is mostly subsistent, characterized by low productivity. In recent years Zanzibar’s economy has seen a major shift towards services, focusing on tourism, which contributes about 27% of its GDP (The World Bank, 2022) and employs majority of the Zanzibaris. According to the World Bank, most of the businesses in the tourism sector in Zanzibar are MSMEs, and women make 72% of the workers, signaling the sector’s potential to unlock an inclusive growth. Despite its vital role in driving an inclusive economy, the tourism sector is yet to make a significant turnaround in the lives of the Zanzibaris and accelerate poverty reduction. Further, external shocks akin to those spawned by COVID-19, have also been impeding growth, necessitating future-proof measures to ensure resilience.

Zanzibar has one of the highest population growth rates in the world (World Bank), explaining the remaining high number of poor people in the island despite the declining poverty rates observed in recent years. The National Bureau of Statistics in Tanzania, projects the population of Zanzibar to double by 2050, indicating the need for measures to ensure this growth is in tandem with economic conditions and incomes of the people. Further, rural extreme poverty rates in Zanzibar have remained considerably high, necessitating an urgent response to steer inclusive prosperity.

The tourism sector in Zanzibar is already employing over 60,000 Zanzibaris, which is relatively appreciable but not sufficient to alleviate prevailing extreme poverty. Despite being endowed with beautiful crystal blue beaches, Zanzibar is yet to make the most of these assets, with only about 20% of tourists returning the island after their first visit. This calls for concrete, forward-looking policies to drive productivity, diversification, bolster the sector’s competitiveness, build resilience for businesses, and deliver last-mile value to those highly dependent on the sector.

Post-covid, there has been an upsurge in the number of tourists visiting Zanzibar, and the trend is expected to remain so due to various measures the government is putting in place to stimulate recovery from the effects of Covid-19.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab had initially conducted an experiment for Zanzibar, running Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to analyze quantitative and qualitative data from popular tourist websites and gauge sentiments. This initial experiment laid the groundwork and revealed how data could support both the government and businesses in the sector to proactively develop strategies and policies that are market driven.

The current phase of the project focuses on developing an AI model to garner tourists’ sentiments by scraping data from various travel sites and produce data dashboards with analyses for various critical stakeholders, including the Zanzibar Commission for Tourism, to support evidence-based decision-making. This initiative is also well aligned with Zanzibar national priorities, including Pillar I of the strategic plan, “Economic Transformation” which advocates for “a structural transformation of Zanzibar’s productive capabilities through economic modernization and diversification with a focus on export-oriented and technology-driven development, translating national comparative advantage to competitive advantage.”

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.



The accelerator lab has been working with Zanzibar Commission for Tourism to experiments on Natural Language Processing models to gauge tourists' sentiments. Building on the experimentation phase of the project, this phase will focus on building the AI model, and generate insight to support decisions of the commission and the ministry at large. The Lab has been engaging the Commission in all phases of the project to collect feedback and inputs for the solution.

The Lab will also, from time to time engage the ministry of Tourism and Heritage to provide ongoing training on the AI model and how to make use of the platform.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



We want to observe how AI and data can influence evidence-based policymaking to build competitiveness in the tourism sector by leveraging timely insights that respond to market needs.

We also want to observe how AI can facilitate capturing of critical signals that could shape trends and specific demands in sectors like tourism.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



For the AI Model, machine learning algorithms will be deployed encompassing a large volume of data from various tourist sites to perform sentiment analysis on tourists' feedback. 

Bi-weekly design sprints will be conducted with stakeholders comprising of end-users, and technical partners to ensure user feedback and requirements are captured throughout the project timeline. 

Data dashboards incorporating visualizations will be developed to present the analyses of the data for decision making. 

Agile methodology: the project will be designed and managed following the agile principles, broken into different phases, and continuously working with stakeholders to finetune the design. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



User Reviews: Currently, there is no structured repository for tourists' reviews segregated based on specific attributes to form actionable insights. 

AI-Powered web scraping: data will be collected from different tourists' sites by running periodic scrapers, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify extracted data based on sentiments. Currently, there is no such tool that the policy makers can make use of. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The Ministry for Tourism and Heritage and Zanzibar Commision for Tourism are the partners we will be working with, but we are also looking into involving the e-Government department to ensure a smooth takeoff of the solution. We are also considering engaging the AI community in Tanzania, for knowledge sharing.

The next phase for this project could be adding new data sources to the model to incorporate social media data. Likewise, modifying the user interface to accommodate other user categories such as businesses could be beneficial. The solution will largely benefit the government by providing critical data and visibility on sectorial developments. Similarly, the challenge could also benefit MSMEs in the tourism sector, allowing them to stay competitive and develop products and services that resonate with customer needs.
