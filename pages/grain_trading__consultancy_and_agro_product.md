> Title of the innovation

Grain trading, Consultancy and Agro Product

> Brief description of the innovation

We provide consultancy and quality products to small  scale farmers on farming in order to improve they yields and also provide market linkage to reduce the cost for farmers on transporting the commodities to the market. This has helped the farmers maximise profit and take farming as business.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our business focuses on helping the farmer get quality products and services at a low cost, and also our business tries to aggregate main farmers and buy them products at a competitive price and we look for a buyer after buying from they. We run Agro business were we refer farmers to find cheap and quality products and services to help generate income from for instance we sale Tomato seedlings (Newton hybrid) and other Agro products. On environment we encourage farmers to grow Soy beans and educate them on smart climate agricultural practices such as no burning of farming residue and the surrounding environment. We also educate farmers the need to practice crop rotation and the planting for fruit tree at they places.

> Technical Feasibility

1. CONSULTANCY/TRAININGS: we provide Consultancy to those that are trying to start farming for the first time and we train farmers on how to improve farm productivity on different crops.
2. AGRO BUSINESS(PRODUCTS):  this business comes in after farmers have been trained and those that consulted , they are shown products that are needed to they farming and the quality products that we have for different companies such as Syngenta, Bayer, Yara and main others.
3. MARKETING: our company also buys farming produce such as Maize, Soy beans, Sunflower, Beans and main others for the products that we don't buy we provide market linkage to other buyers available.

> Anticipated Social Impact

When farmers are trained and provided a good market they economic and social lives change for better this impact them to trust in other organizations that provides social services because when one has no food at home he/she can not attend various meetings and gatherings as he/she is busy looking for food. This also reduces the levels of thieft because main time in rural areas people still because they to have money to buy food. This innovation is not at the current market as trainings/Consultation, Agro products are very expensive and no market linkage is given to these farmers to get high value on they produce.
