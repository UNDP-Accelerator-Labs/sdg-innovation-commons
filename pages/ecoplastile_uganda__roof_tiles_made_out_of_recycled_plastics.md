EcoPlastile is a registered Ugandan social enterprise that allows thousands of slum dwellers to collect and use waste plastics as a form of financial resource in exchange for medical services and uses an innovative, chemical-free and energy-efficient technology called “waxy 2 technology” to transform post-consumer waste into plastic poles, lumbers and tiles which replaces expensive wooden timbers! thus reducing plastic plus marine pollution, deforestation rates, and the effects of climate change while improving access to health facilities especially for marginalized communities in developing countries
