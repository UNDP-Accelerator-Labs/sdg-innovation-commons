Natural Cooling

> Description of the solution

Architects such as Karim El Kafrawi and his partners at archictural practice co-founded the Karm Architecture Lab (KAL) based in Egypy. Their designs use extra-thick walls, airflow corridors and other features for cooling. They position openings for daylight and for air to come in certain places so that when the door opens, suddenly hot air is in one place and cool air comes and moves where hot air is. Ceiling height could also be adjusted to promote airflow, while having a large thermal mass, thick wall. In Wadi Sabarah- a boutique five-star hotel in Marsa Alam on Egypts Red Sea Coast KAL used Coral Limestone which was locally available, 80cm thick walls in three storey building 10 metre tall. Another KAL project is the Grove Residential Complex in Cairo where a mix of apartments are intergrated around one anothers green spaces.
