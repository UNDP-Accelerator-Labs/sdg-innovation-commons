Employment Formalization Laboratory

> Description

Lack of accurate information about social insurance coverage, policies and procedures is a major barrier to formalizing work in the construction industry because it leads to an undervaluation of social insurance and lowers workers interest or willingness to make social insurance contributions. AccLabPy and the Ministry of Labor developed methodologies for informational seminars and reflection workshops.
