## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.No baseline data or repository exists at national level to map plastic waste flows or quantum which can inform policy outcomes hence a data/ evidence generation digital tool needs to be created at national level to provide aggregated data for multiple cities in Pakistan. 
2.Increase local capacity for waste collection, management & disposal by introducing door to door waste collection program, installing a material recovery facility, creating scientific landfill sites in Rahim yar khan city (experiment intervention site). Divide the population in 4 zones to scale up the waste sorting and reduction program in phases. Build on public-private partnership model to help sustain the operations of the program (operational costs are higher than capital costs).
3.Local government in Rahim Yar Khan is interested in private sector powered municipality management system referring to Bahawalpur Waste company’s model.
4.Unilever and UNDP’s ambition to create a plastic free city requires injection of capital investment for around USD 1 million- so far, we have not mobilized much resources for this.
5.Local informal garbage picking, and recycling sector is very vibrant but has limited capacity to recycle due to outdated machinery or non availability of tools. We have learnt that money incentivization  will work if we want in fomal collectors to  collect all type of waste irrespective of market value (volume vs value debate?). This will minimize leakage of non-recyclable plastics from the value chain. Hence, we need to increase livelihood of local people by generating more recycling activities in the city- can we introduce a govt. regularized recycling program? How do we regularize this industry in the city? Loan programs, government buy-in, etc
6.Collaborate with recycling community or create a recyclables selling program to generate financial resources to support circular plastics management initiatives; Recycling material is sent to nearby cities i.e. Lahore for upcycling purposes, can we start a local program?
7.Behavior change, incentivization, packaging, alternatives: Conduct a behavior experiment to promote sorting at source and promote use of bin system/ segregation at source; Run an innovation challenge to source ideas on alternatives to single use plastics;  with a focus on women led production of circular products; Initiate an industrial level behavior change campaign to promote the demand of products made from recycled plastics; Promote ‘business for circularity’ as a solution for plastics waste management in the country
8.Sink point interventions to minimize waste leakage in the environment: Heat recovery, landfill dumping, upcycling, alternative energy; Design and test a landfill system or heat recovery system to store/ manage non recyclables to store; Test conversion of plastics to Liquified Petroleum Gas using non-recyclable plastics in the recipe.
9.Punjab government with support from World Bank has announced a subsidy program to promote waste to energy initiatives in Punjab province.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Scaling of experimentation work in Rahim Yar Khan: UNDP Pakistan and Unilever Pakistan have formalized their partnership. Together, in our efforts to bring a shift towards circular economy for plastics, we are co-creating portfolio of experiments in Rahim Yar Khan. The results from these experiments will provide us field-tested and holistic insights on effective solutions to developing a larger programme and policy on plastic waste and circular economy.  Incase, Unilever and UNDP partnership doesn’t mobilize well, we can develop a case study report housing all the learnings and scalability plan for other city governments and private sector partners to use.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We used multiple new tools of data to inform evidence-driven policy making around plastic waste management in Pakistan. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

for this portfolio, we have used methodological frameworks to understand the system as well as behaviours. We used ethnography for contextual inquiry to gain user’s insights. Furthermore, we conducted systemic analysis and solutions mapping through community of practice that helped us to understand the context, policies and relevant systems (formal and informal) in place and how different categories of people experience it. We use a suite of techniques ranging from:

1.      Exploration and contextual Inquiry; identifying emerging trends and entry points in plastics management system

2.      Solution Mapping; identifying innovative solutions and experiment leads through System Design and strategic foresight

3.      Experimentation; developing portfolio of learning experiments that will test multiple solutions
