Citizen Science
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The lack of acknowledgment, visualization or data about grassroots solutions that are not necessarily on the radar of the governments or the scientific system and which could be valuable to solve and deal with local problems affecting the population of Argentina. Also, the lack of evidence on which policymakers could base their decisions and take advantage of by incorporating citizen science as an innovative approach on their agenda. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Citizen science can be at the service of communities organized around certain claims or local concerns. Participants can formulate research questions that are relevant to their needs (without imposing the nature of the problem from the outside) and can collect and analyze data. In fact, data visualization can be a means to bring a subject to the attention of society or governments. So, it can also be used to advocate for new issues on the public agenda. Moreover, citizen science can promote evidence-informed policies. It can be a source of data to make decisions that affect the lives of many people. For example, citizen science can become strategic to collect a large amount of data in a short period of time in moments where the design of a public policy is being discussed. And this design is not restricted to the decisions of a few. Participatory knowledge-building projects can promote the co-creation of creative and innovative solutions. Besides, citizen science can be a tool to promote behavioral changes to the extent that, by allowing the identification of what we have naturalized (for example, the amount of waste generated in our homes), it has the potential to raise awareness about our habits or points of view.   We want to continue with this cycle, with the solid base of concrete actions that we have already achieved: a complete learning cycle through the exploration of forefront topics and collective intelligence exercises on the topic, the identification, mapping and characterization of 30 environmental solutions in collaboration and as a strategy of co-creation with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation of Argentina, and two current experiments to test whether some initiatives would work as proven solutions and, therefore, to increase their scale. This mapping stage is growing through collaboration. There is a website in the Ministry's web page with a questionnaire where information on new projects in different areas may be uploaded.   In 2022, we are facing the challenge of collaborating with the Ministry in the design of a federal citizenship program, which was announced during the launch of the mapping initiative. We will also be working on the dissemination of stories related to citizen science, along with its respective campaign in social networks, together with an organization with a large number of followers whose work focuses on scientific and experimental communication. In conclusion, by working on citizen science, no longer focusing on environmental issues but on diverse issues, we want to bring the projects closer to decision-makers and other players, highlighting the potential of collaborative, innovative, and cost-effective data collection and analysis. This is a viable alternative, with a bottom-up approach, capable of solving environmental, health, economic, social, and other problems which would have harsher effects on the most vulnerable populations if they were postponed.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">

The sources of evidence that we use include the official science and technology data site: https://datasets.datos.mincyt.gob.ar/ and https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia/sact/ciencia-citizen/join-the-mapping-of-citizen-science. The latter is the form to apply and incorporate new projects to the environmental citizen science mapping that we launched in 2021 and which is institutionalized in the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation of Argentina and contributes to the sustainability of the activity. It is important and urgent to implement actions regarding this topic, as projects could contribute to the design, formulation, implementation, monitoring, or evaluation of public policies —whether scientific, educational, environmental, or social— based on evidence.

Many environmental and health problems affect vulnerable populations more severely. This has been further aggravated by the advance of the climate crisis and its negative effects. However, solutions that come from the top seem to find no solution. That is why it is important to include the citizens affected by these problems in the construction of community solutions, with a bottom-up approach.   In fact, one of the leaders of a mapped project told us an anecdote that illustrates the need to include citizens. He was focused on publishing papers. Eventually, he was called upon by the public administration because they needed support. That's how he approached management and the community. Along the way, he realized how much children and their families could contribute to the research he was conducting. He is currently carrying out multiple citizen science projects. As he talked about them, he told me that one girl liked his science class so much that her parents even used it as a punishment: "If you don't behave yourself, you'll miss science class." It was not a good idea. One day, she ran away from home and walked more than two kilometers so she would not miss it. That same girl collected rainfall data in a place where there were no official measurements and was key to the generation of information about a flood. This story shows that it is not necessary to be a professional researcher to contribute to the knowledge on a subject and to the development. Citizen science is based on this idea. That little girl was no exception. This scientist awakened other scientific vocations, and some of his pupils, when deciding their professional profile, chose to work as civil servants after getting their PhDs to hack the system from the inside.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Climate change is affecting entire ecosystems and damaging the quality of life and health of people and animals. Therefore, last year, considering its contribution to the mitigation of negative effects, we launched the mapping of environmental citizen science, which identified 30 initiatives. Furthermore, we decided to continue identifying initiatives on this and other topics. To date, not only have we received and identified more than 12 environmental initiatives that could be included in a second launch, but relevant information on mapping has been presented at two open science conferences. This demonstrates the interest of the academy and the leaders of these projects to continue contributing to the mapping and actions based on the information they gather.   Likewise, the public sector —based on the mapping— wants to launch a financing program for this type of projects. In fact, other government agencies, such as one in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and Tucuman, have decided to apply the method of citizen science to measure the air quality. At the same time, we are currently carrying out two experiments together with four municipalities of the Province of Buenos Aires. This shows that we can influence the public agenda and decision-makers so that politics can take advantage of this bottom-up approach. Our methodology is innovative and successful when it comes to basing decisions on evidence.   Now, we have no doubt that this work —exploring, mapping, and testing— should be done on other topics included in citizen science, which go beyond the environmental discipline. To do this, we know that transferring knowledge and capacities to governments is a priority. It is also important to collaborate with professional scientists and scientific citizens to scale viable and powerful solutions.

We are co-creating the solutions mapping and achieving a deeper understanding of the dimensions that citizen science should have to enrich policymaking, as it is written in the Memorandum of Understanding that has already been signed.   Check the solutions mapping here: https://www.argentina.gob.ar/sites/default/files/environmental_citizen_science_-_mapping_of_national_initiatives.pdf.     They will also be launching a federal program based on citizen science to support this type of projects and to help maintain their sustainability, because of our influence on their agenda. In addition, we are looking forward to co-creating a toolkit and working on the educational side of this science. This turned out to be necessary due to the levels of interest, support and dissemination that the mapping had. Finally, we are also drafting a collaborative report about the mapping process and our findings, our takeaways and the patterns we found.

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

We are working with these four municipalities on two different experiments to test some hypotheses and increase the scale of environmental initiatives.   To be more specific, the experiment related to the observation and measurement of water quality in rivers, lagoons, etc. is being implemented in Balcarce, Areco and Mercedes. Its main objective is to understand the conditions under which citizen science can contribute to better public policies to foster development and to find out what types of state-citizens-scientists articulation, if any, are useful for achieving this goal. Through this experiment, we would like to know the potential of citizen science to create public policies and increase the use of evidence-based policymaking, while generating new data and useful evidence for local governments.   Meanwhile, in Quilmes, we are implementing an experiment linked to the measurement and characterization of waste. Its main objective is to understand whether it is possible to drive a change in the level of environmental awareness of citizens through their participation in a citizen science project. Thus, the learning question it responds to is: How can we promote citizen science to showcase local environmental challenges and enrich policymaking simultaneously?

We are working on one experiment to test some hypotheses and increase the scale of its environmental initiative. To be more specific, the experiment is related to the observation and characterization of water quality in rivers, lagoons, etc., with an app designed in collaboration between the Lab and the project to evaluate these aquatic habitats. This is an unconventional source of data, which could be implemented by municipalities and their citizens.   Our learning intention is to understand the conditions under which citizen science can contribute to better public policies to foster development and to find out what types of state-citizens-scientists articulation, if any, are useful for achieving this goal. Thus, the learning question in this case is: What kind of partnership among government-citizens-scientists is more successful to encourage policymakers to use the outcomes of citizen science solutions to improve development interventions?   Check the original app here: https://app-ear.com.ar/

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

a. What is the value of citizen participation in scientific activities? b. What kind of partnership among government-citizens-scientists is more successful to encourage policymakers to use the outcomes of citizen science solutions to improve development interventions? c. How can we promote citizen science to showcase local environmental challenges and enrich policymaking simultaneously?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Our methods and tools for this learning question involve broadening the mapping of citizen science solutions by identifying more initiatives with the support of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation of Argentina and other key actors. In addition, we are testing some of these initiatives to see if they are useful for solving environmental problems and monitoring phenomena.   The value of using these methods and tools has to do with their collaborative and co-creational character, which will allow citizens, policymakers, scientists, and activists to be included in the process. Likewise, it will allow us to implement and scale solutions with a bottom-up approach, which has already been tested by people and our experiments, as well as to provide evidence to make informed decisions.  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Addressing these new sources of data allows us to have rigorous information and to scale solutions in informed public policies in a collaborative and inclusive way, which involves contribution from diverse contexts. At the same time, it allows us to know patterns and test hypotheses through proven methods.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Since we started our journey in citizen science at the UNDP Argentina Accelerator Lab, we have tried to develop a portfolio of actions that, fortunately, has been growing thanks to different allies. The air quality pilot project is now being replicated in other provinces with the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development of Argentina. The mapping exercise of citizen science projects is the basis of a public repository of national initiatives on different issues and is now growing collaboratively. Such was the impact of the solutions mapping that the Ministry of Science of Argentina is now designing a citizen science program and we are collaborating with them. Additionally, we have experimented and continue to experiment with four local governments to gather empirical evidence to better understand solutions and scale what works, among other actions.
