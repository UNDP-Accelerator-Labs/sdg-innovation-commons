Recycling program established by the Coca-Cola Amatil Pte Ltd in 1999. Other local companies such as Motibhai Group and Natural Waters of Viti have also joined the recycling program, with 15% of PETs recycled annually made up of Sprint and Fiji Water PET bottles. The program operates out of three CCA offices in Suva, Lautoka and Labasa, referred to as Bottle Buy Back centers. PET bottles and cans dropped off at these centers are exchanged for cash at $1.00/kg, or pick up by program can be arranged for $0.50/kg.
