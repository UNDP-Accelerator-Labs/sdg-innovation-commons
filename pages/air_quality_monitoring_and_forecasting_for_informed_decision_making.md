> Description of the solution

Effective air quality management relies on a combination of air quality monitoring and forecasting systems.
Monitoring: Regularly collecting air quality data through strategically placed monitoring stations is crucial. These stations measure concentrations of various pollutants like particulate matter (PM), ozone, and nitrogen oxides.
Forecasting: Using air quality models and meteorological data, forecasts can predict future air quality conditions. This allows for proactive measures to be taken.
This combined approach provides valuable information for:
Public health advisories: Issuing warnings to vulnerable populations when air quality reaches unhealthy levels.
Regulatory enforcement: Tracking compliance with air quality standards and taking necessary actions.
Emission reduction strategies: Identifying sources of air pollution and informing policies to control emissions.

> Socio-economic effects

Reduced health risks associated with air pollution
Improved public awareness and preparedness for poor air quality events
Potential for economic benefits from reduced healthcare costs and improved worker productivity

> Type of Measure

- 4. awareness raising and knowladge sharing

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- international organization

> Timescale of implementation

- long-term (5 and above)

> Other Notes

Government Agencies (national, regional, local) and Environmental Protection Agencies can lead the solution. Public Health and Enviroment are affected sectors.
The effectiveness of air quality monitoring and forecasting systems depends on the quality and density of the monitoring network, the accuracy of forecasting models, and effective communication strategies to reach the public.
