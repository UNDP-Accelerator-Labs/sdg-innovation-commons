## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Driving inclusion of women in STEM through digital skills
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that young women, particularly in rural areas of Kenya, are often excluded from STEM fields due to issues including perception bias.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In Kenya, like most parts of the world, young women are steered away from STEM subjects towards the humanities through systematic exclusion across their entire education lives. This significantly limits their access to opportunities to venture into these fields despite them being some of the fastest-growing and highly paid jobs of the future. A large reason for this is harmful gender stereotypes where STEM fields are viewed to be "tough" and therefore masculine for boys, perpetuating decades of male-domination in this field. There are also very few role models who young women can look up to and relate to, to inspire them to venture into these fields. This issue is particularly worse in rural areas where young women have reduced access to information and opportunities that could help shift some of these harmful narratives.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Acc Lab developed the design of the proposed intervention and contributed to successful resource mobilisation, in partnership with another CO project, to source funds to implement. The Lab also mapped local partners on the ground who would be best placed to support with implementation and harnessed insights on the challenge through stakeholder engagements across other UN agencies, Government and private sector efforts. The Lab brought in human-centred design approaches to co-design the proposed interventions together with partners on the ground.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Improving access to the digital economy for women and girls is the key to creating an inclusive, accessible society that leaves no one behind. We have partnered with @LakeHub to train over 100 young women in Western Kenya on relevant digital skills to strengthen their employment & entrepreneurship prospects #FemiDevs

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we enhance inclusion of rural women in tech through targeted digital skills programmes?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation and design thinking were valuable tools used in the design phase to ensure that the programme was responsive to the target group's needs while meeting the necessary demands of the market. Ethnography was used to map the journeys of the participants throughout the programme duration to gain further insights into their aspirations and what role digital skills was playing in their lives. Positive deviance was useful in identifying behavioural characteristics of successful vs unsuccessful participants and iteratively tailor the programme as per the findings.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Digital inclusion data through a gender lens with a focus on the 3 target counties
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Internally at UNDP - building on the corporate digital strategy, providing evidence to inform design of future digital interventions Private sector and Govt - attracting attention for further investment in addressing gender inclusion with a focus on systematically marginalised groups
