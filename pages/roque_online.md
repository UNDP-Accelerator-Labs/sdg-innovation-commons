## Connect the informal markets of the world with empowering technologies.

Their focus is to help anyone compete effectively in modern society. Whether you’re an informal market vendor, small business owner, or a large distributor, you can download the mobile application and start registering your inventory so we can start monetizing it on our website or through our partners’ ecommerce channels.

It's a team of individuals dedicated to connecting the informal markets of the world with empowering technologies. Inspirate is the famous Roque Santeiro open-air market in the Republic of Angola that operated from 1991 to 2011. This market was the largest of its kind in Africa and provided a valuable service during a period of significant strife in the country's history. These types of markets exist all over the world and we want consumers to connect with vendors and service providers with which they ordinarily wouldn't connect.
