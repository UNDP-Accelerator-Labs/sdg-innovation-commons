> Description of the solution

CarbonFarm harnesses satellites and AI to monitor and certify decarbonisation projects at scale. CarbonFarm's services include satellite monitoring of practices, quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, managing the carbon certification process, and finally, brokering the credits on voluntary carbon markets. They do not work directly with farmers, but instead with agribusinesses, rice buyers, carbon credit developers, governments and others that have direct access to farmers and built-in trust from them.
