## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Although, AccLab had a productive meeting with the NEOC, and was geared towards starting its experiments, unfortunately, just after the meeting Samoa has its first case of Covid community transmission which halted all its work with the NEOC and MoH. Once the covid community transmission got under control, Samoa removed its Mandatory Quarantine requirement and AccLab could not take this challenge forward.  Still there are insights from this process that AccLab will leverage moving forward:   1. Government Ministries and committees like NEOC have an appetite/ interest in addressing the plastic waste problem. 2. Presenting/ articulating challenges in innovative ways such as visual representation of data is an effective technique to get attention to the problem.  3. Plastic waste is still not seen as a health concern in Samoa although the issue of micro plastic in the ocean is well acknowledged.  4. Insights developed from this learning question will be leveraged for AccLab's work on Regenerative Tourism and also assisting the CERO waste program.   5. Since this learning was quite narrow in its approach with just one key entry point. Moving forward, we will focus on having multiple entry points to overcome unexpected bottle necks.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes, since our challenge was focused reducing plastic waste in the State mandated Quarantine Facilities, we were: 1. Dependent on Ministry of health to give permission  2. NEOC to give a nod before we can engage with the quarantine facilities It took some time to gather the right data and present it is a way to get the right permissions. However, covid caused disruption not only immediately stopped the work, it also changed the course of the future actions since government of Samoa stopped the mandatory quarantine.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There was no aggregated information available on kinds of material/ catering supplies used in the quarantine facilities, how much waste single use plastic waste it generated how it was disposed. There was also no data on the cost of these supplies, both in terms of direct cost of purchasing and indirect cost of waste disposal. The interviews with the facility management of the quarantine centers gave an insight into understanding the material type, and the reason for choice. This helped in generating data on the extent of the problem which was then used to make a case for reducing single used plastic catering supplies. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

This learning challenge focused on making a case for reducing single used plastic in the back drop of a pandemic where main focus was on containing the spread of covid. Therefore it was important to bring health angle to reduce plastic waste. Additionally, there was no aggregated data available on the amount of plastic waste, thus NEOC and MoH did not see as a problem. Quantifying and Data visualization gave a good context on the nature and extent of the problem. Further, behavioral insights helped in designing alternatives that would meet the quarantine facility needs and make an uptake of the solutions by the passengers staying in the quarantine facilities. By co-creating with the quarantine facility management and visualizing waste from generation to disposal helped AccLab present a compelling case for experimenting on reducing waste.  Further, we used second-order thinking to include not just the procurement cost of the plastic but also calculated cost of managing plastic waste, which are both borne by the government. This approach also helped us make a strong argument from the financial aspect of using plastic too. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

SPREP - For calculating the cost of transporting and incinerating plastic waste from the quarantine facilities.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We interacted with 8 quarantine facilities including Marriott to get insights on the supplies used in the catering services. They also agreed to run experiments with Acclab on substituting plastic with environmentally sustainable alternatives. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NEOC - it is a committee comprising several ministries. Working with NEOC gave AccLab access to several ministries especially STA and SHA with who we would partner for our work on regenerative tourism.  
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The innovative methods, especially data visualization and second order thinking, enabled AccLab to make a strong case for Government to move away from single used plastic in the quarantine facilities to more sustainable alternatives. The partnership with the private sector (quarantine facility owners) gave government assurance that private sector will play a key role in rolling out the experiments thus reducing burden from the  government and helping in tackling plastic waste.
