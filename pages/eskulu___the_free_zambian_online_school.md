> Brief description of the innovation

Our long term goal is to be the largest massive open online course platform in Zambia. Moreover, we are firmly determined to provide all our educational services for FREE and at a higher quality. 

We are getting closer to this vision through our current project, “eskulu”. Via our website eskulu.com and the eskulu Android app, we currently provide the following online learning services for Primary and Secondary School students for free:

1.  We provide notes, exam revision guides and pamphlets. 
Example given: 
https://eskulu.com/senior-secondary/grade-12-past-paper-answers/ecz-mathematics-paper-2-gce-senior-secondary-external-exam-marking-scheme-2020/

2.  We produce gamified quizzes for students to test themselves 
Example given:
https://eskulu.com/senior-secondary/grade-12-quizzes/grade-12-english-2018-quiz/

3. Our newest feature as of August 2021 allows users to post questions (such as their homework) and get solutions from our team of experts. 
(You can test this feature in our eskulu Android App .apk file attached)

4. High quality tutorial videos through YouTube and our eskulu Android App
Example given:

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our current income sources:
1. Google Adsense Revenue from free services: 
Through our free apps and websites, we have earned over ZMW100 000. (*We explain how exactly we have done this in our business plan attached.)

2. Sales revenue from premium features: 
In the next year or two we plan to start charging for some features that we currently offer for free. Example given: we currently provide solutions to questions we receive from students for free. We will soon start charging for this feature. This way we will be able to get more freelance tutors and teachers to join us because they will earn more money through our platform.

Our target market:
Our target market consists of the 1.6 million people that are primary or secondary students and actively use the internet. 

We also engage with authors, freelance tutors and teachers. Moreover, they are able to earn money through our platform by providing learning material and online tutorials through  our e-learning platforms.

Value addition of our innovation on the environment:
Ultimately, eskulu being an online learning platform with everything the students need will remove the necessity of students;
1.driving to schools/libraries/bookstores all the time,
2.using so much paper
hence significantly reducing their carbon footprint.

> Technical Feasibility

We adopt the latest trends in technology and train our staff to be highly
skilled at using these technologies. It is also important to mention that our founder and head software engineer has over 4 years experience in software development. The following are some of the technologies we implement in our innovation:

a. Mobile and Web Applications: We are applying these technologies to
readily disseminate educational material. eskulu's website and android mobile application functions as detailed below:

i. Currently the eskulu.com website uses WordPress for easy content management. Furthermore, for features that do not run on plugins it runs custom Javascript and PHP scripts for those functionalities.
ii. Currently our Android application runs natively on android devices and was built using Java in Android Studio while utilising firebase for database management.

b. Artificial intelligence. We currently apply it in our marketing and analytics. However, it has powerful applications in education that we plan
to utilise in the future. None of our competitors is applying artificial intelligence in
their platforms. Through machine learning for hyper personalized learning we
will further transform education in Zambia.

> Anticipated Social Impact

1. In Zambia, even though one pays for an education, the quality of education they receive can sometimes be of low quality. This is where we come in. eskulu is already increasing the access to quality education with a focus on free education for all.
 
2. eskulu as a learning environment is highly effective because it offers  better adaptation to individual needs as compared to traditional class room and library set ups. This is because it provides students more opportunity to engage in learning activities independently because they are permanently at their disposal and can be offered independent of place or time

3. Besides from students, eskulu has proven to be incredibly beneficial to teachers who use our material as references when teaching. Moreover, tutors, authors and teachers can make money with eskulu by joining our team and providing educational content through our platforms.
