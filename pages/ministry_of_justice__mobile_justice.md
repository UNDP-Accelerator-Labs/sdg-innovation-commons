## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Ministry of Justice: Mobile Justice 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to understand the access to the Justice  in Guinea-Bissau and how to improve accessibility for the people who live far away from the city center.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

At beginning of the year the Accelerator Lab undertook 6 week tour around the country where they explored solutions access to justice and access security amongst the other. With Access the Justice being a recurrent challenge the Lab decided to funnel their energy in to make it more accessible to rural communities. The Lab in partnership with the DEMOCRATIC GOVERNANCE unit, intend to INNOVATE and decentralize the service provision to the rural population, as well as facilitating the management of their resources in order to improve their performance. One of UNDP's goals is to facilitate citizens' access to the Justice sector, currently people travel more than 50 km to the nearest region in search of some of these services. This challenge's intent is to test and explore how "mobile justice", using a vehicle to decentralize the service, can change how rural communities can access justice

The MICS report from 2019 indicates that the country does not have a functioning civil registry; the share of population with access to electricity is 46.2%; to safe drinking water is 66.2%. While the use of computers is limited (16% for men, 5% for women), on the other hand the high penetration of mobile phones (89% for women, 92% for men) represents a new frontier in transforming public service delivery. https://mics-surveys-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/MICS6/West%20and%20Central%20Africa/Guinea-Bissau/2018-2019/Survey%20findings/Guinea%20Bissau%202018-19%20MICS%20Survey%20Findings%20Report_Portuguese.pdf

Along the course of 6 week solution safari "solution trip", several week signal were picked up by the Lab and its partner pushing the urgency of bringing justice services closed to the population: "Some people travel  kore than 50km to the nearest region in search of justice services" "Cost and time to travel to the service point are some of the challenges face by population" "The big difficulty in terms of children's records is that the parents do not have documents" "The creation of outposts in health centers and hospitals allowed greater efficiency in terms of birth registration, but which still has some cultural barriers, Muslim ethnicity only names children after 7 days of birth, however, the child is discharged before after 7 days, then birth registration is not done";  "Sometimes only the mother is present so that she cannot register without the presence of the father "; "The use of voters card has lately been authorized".

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Lab is bringing an added value through joining hands with those who lives and operates closest to the problem, using new and innovative approaches such as System Mapping, Design Thinking and Collective Intelligence workshops, in order to co-create solutions with staff, users and other relevant stakeholders. It is worth investing in this challenge because MoJ is the first step of a citizens integration into society. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Could Mobile Justice change the way we reach those in the most isolated communities?

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we increase civil registration of people of rural community ? How might we can facilitate access to justice ? How might we understand the cultural barriers standing in the way of access to justice of women and girls? What its they perceive notion on civil registry and CAJ?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Design Thinking and Co-Creation will be used to structure the process and generate insights about the challenges faced as well as possible solutions. Positive Deviance will be used to understand how existing solution of decentralizing Justice Services can bring this services close to the population and especially isolated communities. The value that these will add to our learning question is that we will be able to delve deeper into the data and understanding the complexities of the problem and well as designing tests that can generate learning about different aspects of the challenge.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These new data sources bring to Lab more knowledge about the behavior of the rural population regarding to justice services and create basis for more informed decision making based on evidence.
