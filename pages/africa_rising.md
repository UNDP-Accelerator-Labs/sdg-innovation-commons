> Title of the innovation

Africa Rising

> Brief description of the innovation

After years of observation that several people have talents and skills that can help in changing our continent and they luck means through which there work can be made known to the world I then realized that, what if  we can bring development to our continent by promoting the work of those around us who have the capability to display their work to the world.
I also observed that unemployment rates in Africa are constantly increasing and most people have free access to the internet but in most cases these people spend there time on social media, chatting and scrolling through posts and I thought what if people can work on productive projects whilst they using the internet this can help them to become productive. Most of the activities that are included in this project are those that are either learnt from
school or from the community which means anyone can take part in this project, making it a non discriminatory project cause its open to everyone whose willing to share and develop his or her own project.
Another thing that was observed was that several entrepreneur, organizations and
investors are looking for people with whom they can partner with or can develop a new product for there business but they find it difficult to find such people this made me to realize that through this platform things will be much easier for these people.
