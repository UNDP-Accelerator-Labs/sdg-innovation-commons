## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Though science is viewed as important course at secondary school, little is done to promote it - There is a high motivation from the science teachers to improve the quality of the teaching,  - Though the videos are not ready but there is a mobilisation around its usage -

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

- Videos have not yet officially been used at secondary school, so to have a whole picture of the existing situation, what might be the appropriate approach to interest the final users who are teachers and students, what might be the eventual obstacles, we organize collective intelligence session with the teachers, the ministry of education and other actors. - The prototyping helps to foresee the different stages in making videos based on science for students, the methodology to be used, and the use cases.  informational conversations  helps to be convince that we are the right path

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Videos have not yet officially been used at secondary school, so to have a whole picture of the existing situation, what might be the appropriate approach to interest the final users who are teachers and students, what might be the eventual obstacles, we organize collective intelligence session with the teachers, the ministry of education and other actors. We co-create with the teachers, the ministry the videos based on physics, chemistry and technology for the first and the last of junior secondary schools. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

- Physics, chemistry, and technology teachers. They help in the design of the videos and the development of the videos. - High School of Science of Lome is assisting in providing the lab to be used for the recording of the videos 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Les freres cinema: they are to make the videos: to record, mount

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

- the ministry of education through the regional office of education of Lomé and the office of general secondary education for the quality and conformity of the videos and as the front office with the teachers, the high school.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

- UNDP does not usually work directly with teachers. So they are unusual partners - UNDP does not intervene directly with school program
