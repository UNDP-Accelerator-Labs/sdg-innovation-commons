> Brief description of the innovation

having about 1000 layers( poultry chickens) for a start, to start the production of eggs, building of atleast 8 dams for fish farming production..

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

mass production of poultry and fish farming and partnering with already existing pottery and fish farmers will curb the high prices of eggs and fish.
targeting the local consumer's first because they feel the impact of high prices more.
when the business expandes then targeting the rest of the country.

> Technical Feasibility

one of the greatest challenges faced by our nation is high price of food commodities, though most of the things are locally grown.
hence our innovativation will venture mostly into agricultural, prioritizing poultry and fish farming then later expand into soya bean farming and maize farming...
this will help beef up the shortages and provide sustainable supply for the current demand being seen..

> Anticipated Social Impact

it will broaden the scope of youths to work hard in order to be self-relient and industrious.
by helping them cope with the day to day financial challenges that are found in the society there-by dissuading them from engaging in vices that are unlawful and morally unacceptable like caderism, thievery etc..
this will also contribute to the national income, as the money invested and made will re-invested back in the economy...
