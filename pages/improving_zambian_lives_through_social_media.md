> Brief description of the innovation

The Zambian people have really brilliant innovative ways to improve our lives, but we luck exposure. I made this page on Instagram to advertise and give exposure to the Zambian entrepreneurs who luck the much needed exposure. I have over 39000 followers and a reach of over 1000000 hence I improve lives including my own.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I gain income by advertising peoples businesses, music, ...etc and in that way they get more exposure for there businesses and I earn a small amount as well.

> Technical Feasibility

When I get funds I plan on promoting the Instagram page so as to get exposure to everyone who is on Instagram and in that way when we advertise or promote someone they get seen btmy everyone around the world.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Currently I would say that we are the only Zambian page that gets a large reach. This means it is already on the market and are ready to improve lives.
