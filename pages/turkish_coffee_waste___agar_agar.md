“I was trying the recipe of "Agar Agar+Clay" recipe by @fabtextiles & @fabricademy founder Anastasia Pistofidou, from her Bioplastic Cook Book when I noticed how similar the texture of the clay was to the wastes of Turkish coffee.

I decided to replicate the recipe using dried used Turkish coffee grounds. The first few results weren't what I hoped for, and there was several iterations before getting to this recipe.

The resulting material has a rubbery texture, it can be described as a soft solid that's a little flexible. I've tried soaking this resulting pieces in water for almost a week, and they kept their characteristics, so now I'm trying to develop and test the usage of this material as a coffee cup.
