> Title of the innovation

Health care waste  Minimization through using the three 'Rs' namely waste Reduction, Reuse &amp; Recycling

> Brief description of the innovation

Waste Minimization is the prevention or reduction of any kind of waste through an emphasis on waste source reduction and recycling. In this case, source reduction is mostly preferred and as such for a feasible waste Minimization program, a collaborative approach by all key stakeholders is key towards less wasteful clinical practices.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

A very effective, efficient and we'll planned waste Minimization plan and approach has numerous benefits for institutions, business owners, the environment and the general public at large. Firstly waste Minimization reduces costs in terms of waste disposal; secondly waste Minimization reduces negative environmental impacts that come with improper waste disposal and hence it enhances public health and worker safety. Lastly it improves public image, less waste in the environment, clean environments.

> Technical Feasibility

Waste Minimization is very feasible in that laws and regulations, procedures and legislation are available for implementation. These regulations have put in place procedures on how to minimize waste. Unfortunately it is a lack of good will, political will and financial constraints that hinder proper implementation of this important stage of waste disposal. The procedures include: planning and organization which includes engagement of stakeholders, goals etc, assessment of the program through existing data, setting targets, assembling resources and more, feasibility analysis through technical &amp; economic evaluation and final implement by lobbing for funding and beginning the process.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Waste Minimization has numerous social benefits. With the world at risk of emerging environmental problems, waste Minimization is the real deal. Firstly waste Minimization increases the efficiency of production in that an organization or individuals are able to reduce carbon in the atmosphere, other dangerous gases and water emissions through sustainable means. This therefore entails that waste Minimization saves 
through reduction in healthy risks  resources and energy, reduces pollution thereby saving numerous lives and also diminishes more demand for dumpsites and landfills. All these increases environmental performance.
