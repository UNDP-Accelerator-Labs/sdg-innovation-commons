> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

Mr. Gia Maisuradze

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

Tbilisi, Georgia. Email: microhesi@gmail.com

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

Yes. Potskhvrevi 2402 LLC

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The project represents the generation of electricity with the minimum utilization of natural resources without impacting the environment. Finally, the initiative serves to simplify the living conditions of the highland villages of Georgia and improve the business environment. The energy sector specialists and technologists worked on the project of a 100 kW micro hydro power plant and produced a hydraulic part for it, namely, a Pelton type turbine with mechanical attached parts. It is connected to an existing 160 KVAr synchronous motor that operates in generator mode and will be controlled by software we have developed. Monitoring will be done remotely (via the Internet) from the base office.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

USD 147,030.00

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Advance order has to be given

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

TRL 8

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

N/A

> Please upload a link of end-user feedback
There is no user feedback yet as the project has not yet been presented as a finished product.



> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

0.06 USD per kWh

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

The only obstacle is the lack of investment funds in the current period. With our resources, we managed to design, manufacture and test parts of the micro sample, conduct a site survey and cover the relevant permit costs (the costs are given in the explanatory document). We hope that through this competition we will be able to give a voice to the interested parties and develop the regions of Georgia together, simplify living conditions and improve the business environment through energy efficient solutions.
