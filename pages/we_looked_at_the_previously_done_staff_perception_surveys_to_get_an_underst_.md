## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) We looked at the previously done staff perception surveys to get an understanding of the innovation and collaboration culture in the CO. What we found was that the value of innovation is understood but there are challenges to bring it into practice such as being risk adverse, fear of failure and not feeling empowered to try new ways of working. The Staff expressed that adopting to new ways of working was not easy but that we are doing better at being open to ideas from all and there is good collaboration and teamwork in general. However, one point that resonated was that they felt that having access to knowledge and expertise across UNDP was not easy.      2) To explore this further, we conducted a behavioral insight survey that specifically looked at how knowledge is created and shared within the CO. From this exercise, with both the program and operation teams, we learned that the staff feel that learning and sharing learning is key for innovation and collaboration.  However, the how is remains a challenge especially for sharing knowledge. Half the participants expressed that they learned something new recently, mostly in the area best practices and procedures. The common medium for learning about the work of other team’s is through meeting showing that personal interaction are the common way for learning. When we explore further, we learned that this is because there is a perception that there isn’t a dedicated space for learning where staff can explore on their own.      3) On our sensemaking exercise with team leaders showed that to be  - Open and innovative we need motivated and passionate teams that regularly interact with each other and work together to learn new things through experimentation.   - Collaboration requires giving value, time, and resources to budling connections with the direct support of management to experiment with different modes of working together such as regular brainstorming sessions and joint planning across the teams.   - Networked means teams having shared goals and interests to which they dedicate time and resources to create multiple platforms (formats) for sharing and building horizontal linkages and communication channels. The platform, however, need to show how they benefit the teams and motivate teams to share.     4) On our Scenario planning​ and participatory design exercise with the team leaders to know the desired future for how they see their teams and projects working together​, we learned that siloes can't be removed but they can be more open, learn from each other's through sharing information, skill and resource as well from others organizations that are widely seen as innovative, especially private companies and CSOs, Teams should lead in their areas of expertise when it comes to knowledge creation and engagement, have true collaboration, be curious and develop an interest outside our area of expertise and joint planning and implementation which leads to  a shared vision and investment in each other's work and success.    5) The action suggested to drive sharing from a need-to-know bases (knowledge sharing within a hierarchy) to a need to share is creating an inclusive learning platform [events, sharing weeks, learning resources...etc.] that cover both program and operations that promote joint learning and sharing plans across the hubs. This should be supported by management to create incentives for engagement and create a sharing culture. To succeed we need to look internally at the expertise we already have, identify what is not working, and create a common vision based on that.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

When it comes to sharing learnings, even though there is interest in sharing, they don’t because they don’t know how and where to share their knowledge.  The lack of an easily accessible knowledge-sharing platform is the major barrier even for those who don’t share regularly. In addition, having recognition from peers, management and making knowledge sharing part of the work plan were the top picks for what would motivate them to share knowledge in the future.    Through we planned some face-to-face exercises, we were not able to do it due to COVID 19, so we have done all the exercises virtually and introduced different digital tools for the CO team.   Lack of time to spend on learning and other activities was one of the challenges that was expressed in our exercises. We saw this in action as there was low participation in some of the exercises. While there is ample understanding for the need to learn and change the way we work, turning that into action and dedicate time to participate in activities we were holding is not easy.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

   Open data: we used exiting data of General Staff survey 2018 vs 2020 to know Border perception when it comes to innovation and collaboration and What areas do, we need to work on for the future? We chose this type because it was easy to access, reliable and some of the data sources covered the CO staff perception of agility, innovation, collaboration, and leadership.     Behavioral insight survey: to understand how the country office creates, shares, and uses the knowledge that we have through our work and to sense the organizational culture influence on the ways we innovate and collaborate we developed an anonymous survey that we want you to participate in. This was to help us capture learnings that were not covered by the general staff survey such as staff’s learning journey and the particular action people were taking and not taking in sharing.   Focused group discussion: To understand particularly the organization's vision of becoming open, innovative, and networked we are setting out to gather insight through a mural exercise with team leaders. We looked at desired futures, driving factors and identified what we need to change to become a more innovative and networked organization. We did this because while the CO reconfiguration states the need for a change in organizational culture it doesn't express what the tangible changes should or could look like. So, this exercise allowed us to expect how to operationalize the changes based on the vision and understanding of the team leaders.  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

  - Sensemaking is used to understand what is open, innovative, collaborative, and networked? What is it not? We also try to comprehend what activities are seen as being crucial for creating an open and innovative approach as well as what activities are seen as being crucial to create networks and collaboration.     - Backstabbing and Desired future ​​are used to determine barriers and what needs to change ​when it comes to knowledge creation and sharing within the CO as well as to design how the team leaders see the hubs and projects working together​.    - From our exploration on how we are creating a more open, innovative, networked, and collaborative approach within the team through the reconfiguration at the beginning of the year, we have engaged the team leader in an interactive virtual Mural consultation exercise through using Scenario planning​ and Participatory design​ aimed at exploring how you envision the hubs working together and with each other to achieve the goals we set forth in the CPD.

Not Applicable
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

 Using unusual data sources as well as bringing unusual partners helps the lab team to generate quick insight with a short period of time in different topics as well-diversified learnings from different angles which we will not be able to get if we are implementing in a previous implementation form. The methods also help us to explore more the CO internal perception and draw more insight which even enables us to scale it on the new CO Knowledge management road map and to save time as well provide evidence in a short period of time for decision making.
