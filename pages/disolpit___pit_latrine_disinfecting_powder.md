Most households in peri urban and rural areas are not connected to the main sewerage lines that facilitate efficient and adequate waste disposal. This has led to some households relying on the use of pit latrines as a means of human waste (faecal matter) disposal. These pit latrines are buried when full and another site located for a new one. The pollution, health concerns and environmental degradation of this activity leaves much to be desired. 


The innovator has produced a non-toxic instant pit latrine dissolvent powder (Disolpit) which reduces the volume of human waste in pit latrines. The powder can be used both in pit latrines and septic tanks. With this reduction in volume, the number of pit latrines dug in peri-urban and rural areas would be reduced as the same one can still be used for a longer periods. The powder also helps to reduce bad smells associated with pit latrines as it rapidly digests waste assuring easy pump-outs. It attacks and neutralizes fly larvae, kills bacteria and maggots; and is non hazardous to people, animals and water bodies.
