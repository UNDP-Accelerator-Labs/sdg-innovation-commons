> Title of the innovation

SUSTAINABLE INTEGRATED AGRICULTURE-AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION &amp; NUTRITION SCALING UP (SIAAP &amp; NSU)

> Brief description of the innovation

The Project (Sustainable Integrated Agriculture- Aquaculture Production &amp; Nutrition Scaling Up) SIAAP &amp; NSU, is an integration of Oreochromis andersonii (three spotted bream) WITH Broiler Chickens and Vegetables. 
This Project is an Agricultural INNOVATION targeting 3 enterprises (Poultry rearing, Fish and Vegetable farming) on 5 hectares of land and Fish Farming being the key enterprise. Integrated fish farming – a system of producing fish in combination with other agricultural/livestock farming operations centred around the fishpond. Integrated aquaculture entails increasing the productivity of water, land and associated resources while contributing to increased food and nutrition - fish production. This equally will maximize land utilization within a specific area, as it also utilizes land which would have otherwise been idle and also makes one system of farming (enterprise) benefit from the other. This closed system will reduce costs associated with aquaculture and makes use of land which would otherwise have been unutilised. The fish will convert plants (vegetables) and animal waste (chicken manure) into high quality protein and simultaneously enriching pond mud for use as fertilizers on crop land. The systems also feed into each other so well due to various interactions (eco-system or interdependent) on one another.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our innovation will generate income for us and other stakeholders (both direct and indirect beneficiaries) through the intensive production of fish, broiler chickens and vegetables, then sale of produce from the 3 sectors of production (fishponds, poultry housing and horticulture) at very competitive prices due to overwhelming demand that surpasses the supply. So we take advantage of that scenario.
The demand for fish, chickens and vegetables is high. Therefore, the production verses the marketing and consumption is increasingly demanding products on the market AND the project will operate in full swing to meet that demand resulting in more profits for the project and realizing steady income that will sustainably support the self-sufficiency of the project also assist improving operations of existing small business. Additionally, The low cost of production in all enterprises will necessitate the profit build up and expansion of the enterprises for the sustainability and self-sufficiency of the Project. Targeted market include Chipata District and the eastern province as a whole, however, the consumption of fish is even much lower due to the massive increase in human population coupled with a lack of a major natural fishery in the province. The per capita consumption of fish currently stands at 6.5 kg. The soils in the district are clayey loams, implying that they are good for fishpond farming- ideal for pond construction and support crop farming activities. The Government of Zambia has a policy in the Agriculture Ministry to diversify the economy and aquacultures are on the top of the developmental agenda for the country. 
Additionally, our Organisation is trying to mitigate such adverse effects of the pandemic. This includes job/employment creations, financial and socio-economic empowerment, food security, nutrition scaling up and sustainably reducing vulnerability more especially in People with Disabilities (PWDs), People Living with Disabilities (PLWDs), Child-headed households, Orphaned, Widowed and the Old but Viable population in the communities and surrounding areas of our project operational area.

> Technical Feasibility

STREAM OF WATER ------------ STERAM OF WATER -------- STERAM OF WATER

FISH PONDS 

POULTRY HORTICULTURE

The innovation is designed like this:
There is a source of water which is a perennial stream with a gentle gradient that will allow filling and draining of ponds by gravity. This will reduce costs associated to digging a borehole and pumping water in and out of the ponds. The drained water will be fed to the garden because it will contain nutrients needed to fertilize the soils in vegetable beds and as a way of sustainably utilizing water containing microbes that might contaminate natural water if it was introduced into the perennial stream.
The culture types will be semi-intensive system where mono-sex culture of Oreochromis andersonii will be cultured in integration with broiler chickens and vegetables – cabbage. Pond sediments will fertilize the vegetable gardens, thereby reducing cost of manuring vegetables. The pruned vegetable leaves will be fed to fish in ponds as well as vegetables thrown in chicken housing for chickens to feed on greens once in a while. The culture type is also all about a closed energy flow system where one agricultural sub-system feeds into the other to maximize benefits and reduces operational costs. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
The closed Integrated Aquaculture-Agriculture System will need water, land, infrastructure, inputs and labour (skilled &amp; unskilled).
- Pond constructions
- Poultry housing constructions
- Land preparations for vegetable growing
- General procurement of materials
- Management of all 3 enterprises
- Stocking of fingerlings
- Chicken rearing and management from day-old chicks to maturity
- Planting and transplanting vegetable seeds and seedlings
- Harvestings and Marketing in general

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project expects the marketing of fish, broiler chickens and vegetables as a  Processing Project to contribute to other community's socio- economic activities: i.e. the traders involved in retailing to various customers. This project will enable the traders involved to create employment for the youth through the expansion of their businesses. These will include transporters, mobile money service providers, agro dealers, financial institutions (Banks), local Marketers, Restaurants, Lodges. Participating members will also be able to invest in the expansion of other farming activities they do in their field crop productions that include Maize (as food security), Soyabeans, Groundnuts and Sunflower production for income generation, sustainably enhancing the current market- that will prove and consolidate its relevance.
The Project will be supplementing Government efforts through paying taxes, fees, levies and other statutory obligations and job creation for the women and youth. The project will also lead to improved food and nutrition security, income generation will enable farmers to pay for other services such as Education, Medical Recreation/home entertainments and other amenities. Further, the project will help farmers to reduce dependence on government handouts. 
The use of improved technology in production and processing enables value addition in the production and supply chain of goods and services. This will lead to  civilized and potential marketing through market linkages with Commercial Buyers that will contribute to the development of rural industrialization, because of increased disposable incomes among the members. This will enable the members provide ready market for other goods and services within the rural community.  
The entire community benefits from this eco-enterprise through accessing the nutritive food products (fish, vegetables, chickens and manure / feathers as by-products from chickens) nearby and within their locality/vicinity from one source before the replication go elsewhere, access to employment to youths, women, men and newly married young couples. Economically, the entire community sees more developments in terms of attracting business men and women (from local council market centres) frequenting / coming into the community to order products and bringing other necessary goods and services which never were in the community that time, eg. Sale of kitchenware of any form- plastic or metal, Airtime from Mobile providers which used to be available only in town, availability of local transporters in terms of bicycles, taxis and small trucks going in and out of the community ferrying products from the eco-enterprise and other products grown/produced from within the smallholder farming communities, farmer cooperatives supported by the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives.
Social Impact continues: 
1.	Farmer mobilization. Form producer groups for aquaculture, horticulture and poultry farmers as cooperatives with similar goals and have a collective social responsibility to combat poverty, hunger and vulnerability.
2.	Decentralized system of farmer training and practical demonstrations on superior agricultural farming practises. This will be done through calling farmers to one central place in form of field demonstrations/ field days/ expository visits to see innovations we are doing, train, practice and physically see what they are learning, what to do and what will become if they fail to follow laid down management practices on-farm.
3.	Improved health through better nutrition and food security in households. Results will be good health for households, reduced and later eradicate nutritional diseases like malnutrition in under-five children, low haemoglobin condition in pregnant women and other dietary related diseases.
4.	Sustainable lifting of smallholder farmers out of poverty, hunger and vulnerability by increasing income opportunities at household level inclusive of child headed and widowed due to COVID-19 pandemic- which has claimed mostly men as heads of households in our area..
5.	Open gates to access schools for smallholder farmer’s children thus reducing illiteracy levels sustainably. This will permanently end child labour in the local farming communities and empower young ones with education. Also those that prematurely went into marriages are afforded a chance for the Education Re-entry Policy in schools implemented by the Government of Zambia and become an element for their once shuttered dreams.
