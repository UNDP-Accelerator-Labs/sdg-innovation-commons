## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Testing and embedding innovative Monitoring, Evaluation, Reporting, and Learning (MERL) methodologies 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that UNDP MERL focuses on monitoring to evaluate and score rather than learning. AccLab with project colleagues and Integrated Results Management Unit (IRMU) and working to test new ways to integrate learning and efficient monitoring. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

MERL is a function of compliance rather than project management. Significant design of MERL tools is impacted by donors and UNDP standards. In some cases, this increases the imbalance of trust between UNDP and stakeholders instead of decreasing this imbalance as it is intended to do. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Projects don’t have a learning component and there is no space, focus on structured reflection processes for learning. In addition, there is an opportunity to further strengthen monitoring data obtained at the IRMU levels using different forms of ethnographic tools, in order to present the bigger picture and as well to complement and supplement the learnings obtained.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

As projects evolve from one stage to the other and with change in staff, it has been challenging to document, codify lessons which can be replicated and scaled. Learning is an extra component with little focus on learning design. 


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

AccLab is looking to test new tools and methods which can allow projects to track their learnings. As this is a cross cutting theme, the AccLab acts as an integrator – connector between projects, IRMU and global teams working on this. The AccLab is also well suited to try something completely new outside of the way learning is currently done. We have supported a project for integrating innovative frameworks in their MERL plan. This led to 4 entry points for experimentation – MERL survey /tool for GESI, agile and adaptive learning through structured reflection, retrospective codification of impact for identifying core successes, and working out loud through digital engagement. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

“How do we shift focus of monitoring frameworks from scoring to learning. AccLab Pacific is testing new ways to report and learn from our work”.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the new ways to monitor UNDP Pacific’s projects and be learning responsive?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

MVP / Pilots / Prototyping / Proof of Concept will be used to test new ways of working and integrating learning in our projects

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Existing Data Gap: documented on-going course correction is missing which the structured reflections will highlight and document. The beneficiary bring onboard evidence based data (videos, quotes, testimonials, etc.). The GESI survey tracks the progressing capacity building of teams for GESI issues.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Projects adopt these experiments, scale them and extend these to government partners
