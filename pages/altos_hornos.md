> Description

PARAGUAY OBSERVA, is an organization whose mission is to implement actions that become alternatives in the search for the improvement of social, cultural and economic aspects of the people who are part of Paraguayan society. Its vision is manifested in the contribution of actions that allow women from socially and economically marginalized areas to have access to better development opportunities through the success of their enterprises and their economic and personal empowerment, offering opportunities with proven impact, in an articulated, transparent manner and pushing its execution capacity to the limit. Among its most outstanding actions, and in primacy in the face of the crisis unleashed by the COVID-19 Pandemic, are those that faced and are facing to combat the hunger that surrounds the extreme poverty of families from different areas of the country, including the areas of Pte. Hayes, Ñeembucú, Central, Paraguarí: The popular pots are founded as a strategy in this management. In the analysis of the aforementioned reality established through interviews, statistics and visual materials PARAGUAY OBSERVA, visualizes the situation of extreme poverty of Paraguayan families, whose characteristics reflect chronic undernourishment, malnutrition and stunted growth of boys, girls and teenagers. The consequences are serious for the health and quality of life of individuals and communities. The reality that we mention confronts the fundamental right that people have to "adequate food that is exercised when every man, woman or child, either alone or in common with others, has physical and economic access, at all times, to food or the means to obtain it” (FAO-Zero Hunger) When we OBSERVE, we think of solutions, of relief. We know that women in vulnerable situations can respond to the fight against poverty with activities that allow them to achieve equal rights, based on their will and labor force, offering the scope of equitable and economic means, in the search for better conditions. of life. WE OBSERVE, capacity and work experience in the field of bakery and confectionery. With minimal resources, women have placed a quality product on the market with easy access to society. With the management of women, the dishes of the popular pots have not lacked bread for lunch and cookies or cakes for snacks. WE OBSERVE that this response to the decisive empowerment of women in the task of fighting hunger becomes a business opportunity, of obtaining economic means, of viewing women as bearers of answers to their situation of poverty. WE OBSERVE that this alternative with better resources and machinery can become a real effort to achieve equal opportunities for gender, combat hunger and achieve dreams. WE OBSERVE that our bakery and confectionery project will have better results with the purchase of electric ovens, supplies and training programs for women. WE OBSERVE that our blast furnaces can heat dreams! WE KEEP our ovens on high!
