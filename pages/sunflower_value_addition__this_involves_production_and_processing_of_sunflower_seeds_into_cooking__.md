> Title of the innovation

Sunflower Value addition. This involves Production and processing of sunflower seeds into cooking oil and sunflower cake. Recruited farmers under the out grower scheme are tasked to produce quality sunflower seeds with high oil content which is later processed into finished products.

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation aims at increasing the value of sunflower seed by processing it into cooking oil and sunflower cakes. The value chain process increases the appeal to consumers and the consumer's willingness to pay premium price over similar but undifferentiated sunflower seeds.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income through sales of cooking oil and sunflower cake which are currently on high demand. It will improve the operations of existing supporting business such as commercial houses, food markets, households as well as livestock farmers who are the potential off-takers. The challenge prize will help grow the business in that there will be a smooth production and buy back of raw materials which has been the biggest challenge. The innovation has the potential to improve farmers' livelihood through income realized from the sale of sunflower seeds. The light taste of cooking oil is also of great benefit to consumers with health challenges.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed into two operational phases: 
1. Production and Buy back; This involves production of sunflower seeds and buying it back from farmers. Extension service will be given to ensure production of quality seed with high oil content.
2. Processing and Marketing. This is all about turning sunflower seeds into cooking oil and sunflower cake and making these products available for sale
The technical extension skills acquired through working with out-grower companies as well as the old expeller machines are the prototypes currently existing. The implementation plan is to execute the innovation immediately after winning the prize. Technical and extension services will be offered to farmers tasked to produce raw materials. At buy back time, bulking and transportation of raw materials to the processing plant will be done without delays.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will offer an income generating activity to farmers. Different operations along value addition processes will create job opportunities for the local people. The scarce products (light tasting cooking oil and sunflower cake) wil be available on the market.
