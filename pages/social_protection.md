EXPANDING SOCIAL PROTECTION TO YOUNG INFORMAL WORKERS
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that young informal workers are lacking social protection.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The situation of young people, especially women, in conditions of informality, is a priority for public policymakers in Ecuador. There are approximately 3 million youngsters, between the ages of 18 and 29 who represent 18% of the total population, 25% of the working-age population and 21% of them live in a low-income household. In 2018, for every 100 young people aged between 18 to 29, 39 were only working, 34 were only studying, 10 were studying and working, and 17 were neither working nor studying (this last group is predominantly composed by women). Before the crisis, 7 out of 10 young employees had an informal job (ILO, 2020). The direct effect of this situation is that youngsters will lack access to decent jobs, meaning that they will not only be uncovered by the social protection system, but they will also have low salaries with extended hours of work and without access to many workers´  rights. In the long run, this condition affects the life cycle of the person and the opportunities that his/her family might have in the future which perpetuates the cycle of poverty.

> 

The following information is taken from the Post-Disaster Needs Assessments (PDNA) done by UNDP Ecuador in 2020. The left figure shows that the age group most affected by the loss of formal employment are youngsters aged between 18 to 29, 100,835 young people no longer have a job, neither social protection. We know that 21% of young people live in a low-income household, the second figure points out that there will be an increase in the number of people living in poverty and extreme poverty going from 2,8 to 4,1 million and 1,5 to 2,3 million respectively. The level of income will fall back to similar levels of those in 2007, meaning that we will lose most of the social progress achieved in the past 10 years.

Signals from non-traditional sources: Virtual perception. The Acc Lab has held lately a few diverse webinars destined for the youth population, in all of them there are at least five comments posted where  to get support to find a job is requested. Street perception. The number of homeless and beggars has increased in the streets make it more frequent to find a person asking for economical support. Signals from traditional sources: Research. The Acc Lab held a Data School where 23 local youth organizations received a scholarship to learn how to manage and analyze quantitative data to study labor informality. Five data projects were created covering, for example, differences in the youth labor market between rural and urban areas and repercussions of the COVID-19 crisis on youth entrepreneurship. There were a few testimonies in these projects that emphasize the downside of informal and the difficulties faced getting a job. https://informalidadjuvenil.org/escuela/#resultados Newspapers. We know that youth unemployment reached 37.6% in December, this rate is 10 times higher than the one at the national level. This indicator is also related to informality since youngsters with an informal job frequently change their working status to unemployed during a period of a few weeks or months, also if they are unemployed, they might get a temporary informal job. https://www.primicias.ec/noticias/economia/jovenes-empleo-desempleo-ecuador-inec/

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The CO included the Lab in the work of this project from the very beginning given its knowledge on innovative tools and perspectives that allow us to work on social protection from a different angle. The Acc Lab has two propositions that add value to the work done on social protection: to work on data innovation with an open data approach and to run behavioral insights experiments aimed at increasing young informal workers’ access to social security. Expanding the social protection system is a joint effort along with  two other agencies of the UN system, ILO and UN Women, and with national government counterparts such as the Ministry of Labor, the Institute of Social Security, the Institute of National Statistics, and the Social Registry Unit. The Lab´s work and approach are appreciated by these actors because of the fast pace implementation of its actions and original and creative ideas brought to the discussion.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Social protection is a must if we talk about decent work. The Ecuadorian Acc Lab works to identify young informal workers through a self-sovereign data collection system and to diminish their cognitive bias toward social security affiliation.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

To work on the generation of a nominal register of young informal workers we decided to create a digital solution (result from an innovation challenge) that allows collecting data from youngsters while they use the web application, we thought of new ways to collect data that goes beyond surveys. We count with the support of government institutions and UN agencies to define which data we need to collect so that we complement the information available on national registers. Also, we are partnering up with a South-African startup so that the data management model is run with a user self-sovereign approach.  To expand the social protection system to young informal workers that are currently left out, two behavioral insights experiments will be run with the support of the Institute of Social Protection. The first experiment focuses on nudging independent young informal workers that generate enough income per month, to enroll in social security by contributing the required monthly affiliation fee. The second experiment targets SMEs that generate enough income per month to affiliate their employees to social security but are not yet doing it.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can behaviorally-informed communication strategies aimed at targeted groups expand social protection to young workers in the informal labor market? What types of mechanisms ensure that labor data is current, accessible, and useful to all audiences by respecting self-sovereign rights?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Design thinking and a human-centered design will be used to implement the nominal register of young informal workers by collecting data without having an extractive relation with the user, respecting his/her self-sovereign rights over data and prioritizing the user at all times. The digital tool developed to collect data will use AI to math the youngsters with job opportunities and learning courses. These are two of the four functionalities that the web platform will have. Behavioral insight is a key method to answer our learning question as we seek to test this approach as a way of increasing the scope of the social protection systems and its ability to capture young informal workers without a safety net.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The major gap in social protection is related to the unknown numbers of young informal workers, their working conditions and socio-economic status. The digital platform will collect information in these domains but also spatiotemporal data from youngsters’ mobile phones. The data collected through the platform has a citizen data approach meaning that young people will provide data based on their free-will and personal commitment to use the platform. Finally, the platform will use automated language processing to find a “perfect” match between youngster profiles, job opportunities and training courses. Behavioral nudge messaging will be used to nudge independent young informal workers to enroll in the social security system. This method will be also used to change the SMEs cognitive bias in favor of affiliating their workers.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We expect to generate a data ecosystem so that the model of governance of the nominal register is run by diverse actors to guarantee an open use and sustainability over time. The results of the experiments can be used mainly by the Institute of Social Protection to keep expanding the social protection system to independent and SMEs workers. The Institute of Social Protection is a key partner throughout the experimentation process as they are directly invested in testing this approach with the expectation to scale it through their institutional communication strategy.
