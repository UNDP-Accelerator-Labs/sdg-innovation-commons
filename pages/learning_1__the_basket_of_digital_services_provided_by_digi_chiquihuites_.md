## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Learning 1. The basket of digital services provided by Digi-Chiquihuites, made up of a smartphone, eight weeks of face-to-face and virtual training, mobile connectivity packages, generated positive digital attitudes, knowledge and trust in digital tools among the participants.




Learning 2. The benefits of digital technologies can be acquired indirectly through digital assistants, but these effects are smaller.




Learning 3. Although the figure of the assistants did contribute to generating knowledge and trust in digital tools, no evidence was found that it managed to generate trust in the use of digital financial tools.




Learning 4. The models of promoters and digital service kiosks generated positive attitudes towards the use of technologies, but not trust in being able to replicate what is taught. Given such results, the promoters model can be iterated as a volunteering program or a municipal/central government technical assistance program.





Learning 5. Human interaction in virtual training processes, even if it is brief or carried out through virtual means, is effective enough to generate trust in the use of digital financial tools.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. Project attrition

2. tight implementation times
3. digital literacy levels, participant's advanced age and illiteracy

4. general distrust of digital solutions, more specifically, financial technologies

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Why? quasi-experimental models to test the digital basket's effectiveness to have causal evidence of their impact. Prototyping to test a potential new public service (digital support kiosks, and digital promoters). We leveraged the project's online capacity building component to generate causal evidence using randomized trials through Zoom.



Gaps: 1) information about the model's effectiveness for potential scalability purposes, which is why a control group was required.



2) Data about a non-existing model that would support the case for scaling it or dropping it.



3) Data about the effectiveness of online learning to generate knowledge and trust on digital financial tools.


> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

-Solutions Mapping and sensemaking were used to generate relevant insights that could serve as input for the co-creation and design stages.



-Co-creation, design thinking, proof of concept, prototyping, MVP were used to come up with the two models to be tested.


-RCTs were carried out to test the effectiveness of the models created in previous stages.

## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Asociación CONEXION (NGO): CONEXION was one of the project's key implementation partners responsible for the digital capacities training program. We worked with them to set up the RCT through a special Zoom session where we provided them with the required prompts to carry out the experiment protocol. CONEXION was in charge of generating the training content of the session.



CREA Consultores (Private consulting firm): This exercise had the support of CREA Consultores, who, at the request of the Accelerator Labs, trained two digital promoters, and tested the initial menu of digital services. Finally, they were in charge of materializing the prototype of two digital service kiosks and took it to the field.






> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A


> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A


> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

MITUR (Ministry of Tourism) and ISTU (National Tourism Institute):

Digi-Chiquihuites was developed in conjunction with the Ministry of Tourism (MITUR) and the Salvadoran Tourism Institute (ISTU) with the aim of designing a basket of digital services to safeguard livelihoods and improve the financial inclusion of women entrepreneurs in the country, tourism sector, mainly in the circuit of ISTU and CORSATUR tourist centers.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Both CONEXION and CREA were new partners for UNDP. They are traditional partners for similar implementations. However, it is worth mentioning that the scope developed for CREA's support was unusual in that it incorporates the creation of service model prototypes and field testing.


> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNDP - Social Investment Area and Digi-Chiquihuites project coordination.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Through these learning cycle we were able to generate evidence about the effectiveness of the “Digital Baskets” model, proposed by the Digi-Chiquihuites project, mainly about its impact in creating positive attitudes and trust towards digital technologies, as well as digital literacy skills. All through a quasi-experimental methodology implemented by the Accelerator Lab. Experimentation is not something that is done regularly in the El Salvador CO and this is likely the first project to test hypotheses about what works and what doesn't in an intervention, allowing to scale the positive results, and discarding the elements that were not as effective.





A fun fact is that the models were partially inspired by the Argentina Accelerator Lab's work on the "Con Vos" network, which explored the topic of digital assistance via community shops.
