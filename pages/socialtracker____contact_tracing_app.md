Developed by Komlan Akpedje KEDJI, SocialTracker's goal is to build a completely anonymous database of social interactions. Records from the database can be partially de-anonymized, with the consent of the persons concerned, upon doctors' requests.

The social interactions are recorded by the application :
- explicitly, by scanning the QR code associated with a location or another user of the application;
- implicitly, by automatic Bluetooth and wifi scanning to detect nearby users.
