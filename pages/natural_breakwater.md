The neighborhood of Kesunean is a coastal community in the city of Cirebon, and as such, they are prone to coastal flooding and high tide. Such events have the potential to bring seawater into the homes of residents, pollute streams and sewers with litter, and create debris which is left on land as the water retreats. Residents responded by constructing a simple seawall along the coast using bamboo as well as a breakwater made of used coconut husks. These can last a couple of years and are useful in preventing coastal erosion. Given that both materials are biodegradeable, this is a nature-based solution. But at the same time, the material is also readily available in the area and easy to find. Therefore, such an approach to mitigate coastal flooding can be easily scaled and replicated in other locations in Indonesia and beyond.
