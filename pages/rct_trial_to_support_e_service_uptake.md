## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. We identified multiple actors who work on the topic.  2. The Actors work is disintegrated and fragmented manner, including international organizations. 3. Mismatch between the number of registered residents in rural areas and actual persons living there limits the communication channels available to the RCT. 4. Partners lack understanding of user-centered design, which prevents proposing actionable solutions. 5. Most portals that are created as a solution to the uptake of e-services are malnourished by the owner entities and support of the platforms is not systemic.
