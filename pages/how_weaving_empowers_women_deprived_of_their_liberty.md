In 2018, it was detected that only 16/32 entities in Mexico registered some post-penitentiary program for women, such as agreements to form a job bank or with companies so that they employ the graduated population. In addition, only 13 have a periodic advice or assistance program for the graduated population.

LA CANA is a social project that seeks to create job opportunities for women in prison, through the implementation of programs and workshops aimed at their personal development, as well as work and job training, in order to promote a reintegration process that contributes to reducing recidivism and crime rates in the country.

La Cana trains women deprived of their liberty in various weaving, embroidery, sewing, macramé and textile weaving techniques through a weekly workshop held in each of the prisons where we work. The purpose of this is to help them learn a trade in which they can be remunerated away from delinquency. Subsequently, they are in charge of selling the handmade products made by the women in prison, to whom they deliver the proceeds from the sale of their work. In addition to the above, they carry out other productive work for the development and learning of skills and abilities, as well as mental health workshops for the personal growth of the inmates.

"While listening to the stories of women inmantes, we detected that in many of them the common factor was the structural gender violence to which they have been subjected, which greatly influenced how they ended up in prison,” explains Wendy Balcázar, of La Cana, who has a degree in Law.

Through special projects and orders, they also connect fashion and product designers with women deprived of liberty, supporting an alternative labor market.
