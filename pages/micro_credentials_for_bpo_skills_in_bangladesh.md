The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Industry is rapidly expanding and has huge potential for creating employment opportunities, specially for the youth. For Bangladesh to become a competitive BPO offshore destination for international companies, there is a critical need to develop a skilled human resources pool based on the industry requirements that would pave the way to address job market challenges, especially for the young labour force. Bangladesh has yet to develop a scalable model that would rapidly upskill youth on skills demanded by BPO employers. To address this gap, the Accelerator Lab is designing a scalable online micro credential scholarship program for Bangladeshi youth to learn new digital skills demanded by the world IT market which will accelerate their employment in the rapidly growing local business process outsourcing market and better prepare them for the fourth Industrial Revolution.
