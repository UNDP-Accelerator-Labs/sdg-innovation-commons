> Brief description of the innovation

Toothache Solution is medicine for teeth problems. It is made from all natural herbal ingredients. This paste solution eliminates bacteria on the affected teeth, makes one's teeth strong and healthy again, restore gums (assisting in stopping gums from bleeding or making puss), stops the pain on the affected teeth within a few hours. And a Solution can  be made from powder as mouth wash. It also eliminates the bacteria as it pulls out dirt from the teeth upon squishing.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will generate income through profits from the sales. The product will be pegged with a specific price that is affordable to all whether rich or poor. Suppliers of the products shall also benefit as there will be more demand of the product. My target market is local town, other Provinces, the whole Zambia and in future world wide. Potential offtakers are from the age of 4 years and above since everyone do experience a toothache at some point in time because of the foods that we eat on daily basis that contains some sugar usually and some toothpaste found in shops/stores are too sweet to kill the bacteria in the teeth. The Challenge prize will help the business grow by drawing up a good marketing strategy, production, sales, pricing, packaging e.t.c.
The product will add value to the environment as more farmers will start growing and producing the  ingredients in bulk.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is designed in such a manner that it can even be made at home as it doesn't have intoxicated chemicals in it. The prototype that exists is the product packed in small plastics that consumers take. And I have not received any complaints from those people who have used the medicine before including myself. The proposed implementation plan should begin in January, 2022.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation can improve the lives of people by restoring their teeth  and live a good health. There will be no need and no more going to the Dentist to extract their teeth as the medicine works well and keeps one's teeth strong and healthy again. 

The proposed innovation is very relevant to the current market because many people world wide are suffering from toothache which causes headchachs normally. And it is believed that there's no medicine that cures toothache and this promotes tooth extraction which is not supposed to be the case at all.
Now everyone will be free from toothache/toothpain problems.
