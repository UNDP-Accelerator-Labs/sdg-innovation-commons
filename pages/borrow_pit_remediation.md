> Brief description of the innovation

This project is a localised fish pond construction which targets to directly and indirectly benefit 1,290 households in Kandabwe settlement in Kitwe District. A large abandoned borrow pit from Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) mining activities is located in the center of Kandabwe settlement. This borrow pit which is about 120 meters long, 40 meters wide and  2.5 meters deep is sometimes used as an illegal dumping site and is also a breeding area for mosquitoes which breed malaria, hence exposing the community of Kandabwe with a population of 8, 143 to malaria. The pit also poses a high environmental health risk as children are constantly playing in the stagnant water that accumulates in the borrow pit during the rainy season. Furthermore, three fatalities of children drowning in the ditch have so far been recorded over the past few years. 

The project tends to convert the borrow pit into fishi ponds. This will be a source of employment to Kandabwe residents, especially women and youths from construction stage of the fish ponds to sales and marketing of the product. The project will contribute in filling up the fish supply gap on the Copperbelt province.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It has been noticed that fish farm business is on high demand in Kitwe and Copperbelt at large. The project intends to construct 3 fish ponds on the borrow pit and grow fish for business. This will contribute towards self-employment, job creation and increased income among members of Kandabwe and Kitwe at large.

> Anticipated Social Impact

'-	The area (Kandabwe) is generally characterised by poor living standards as most residents survive below one US dollar per day. However, the project will benefit the community especially the vulnerable living in this area. 
-	Reduce cases of water borne diseases and children drowning in the borrow pit
-	Improve diets for poor and vulnerable people through access to highly nutritious animal protein from fish.
-	Increase livelihoods opportunities in form of fish farming and marketing
-	Increase knowledge to youths and women in fish farming
