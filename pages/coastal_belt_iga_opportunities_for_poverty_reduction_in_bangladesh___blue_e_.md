Coastal Belt IGA Opportunities for Poverty Reduction in Bangladesh - Blue Economy
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is open Blue Economy potentials for coastal belt livelihood (45m people) 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In Bangladesh, around 45 million people live in the coastal belt regions and their lives and livelihood are mostly depending on the Ocean and rivers. The total coastal belt of Bangladesh is around 47,201 km (3. 32 % of the total land), it has covered around 19 districts out of 64 districts in Bangladesh. Almost 90% of export and import business in Bangladesh are run through the sea. Considering the potentiality of the Ocean, the UN has proclaimed 2021 to 2030 as the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. Blue economy in Bangladesh is paving the way for sustainable development. Whether it is through the network cables across the ocean floor on which global communications relay, the oil and gas exploration on the ocean floor or the availability of fishery resources, the ocean has been an integral part of the global economy for a long time. There are various challenges are associated with this sector. To utilize the benefits of blue economy in Bangladesh, it is important to create new knowledge and evidenced based findings to support the local community by creating employment opportunities and protecting the environment at the same time.

Bangladesh is a densely populated county in the world. Recently Bangladesh has graduated from LDCs and moving towards SDGs achievement by 2030, becoming a developed country by 2041, and implementing the Delta Plan by 2100. It is estimated that the Blue economy can contribute minimum 20% percent for achieving its various goals and plans. Around 15 percent of total fish come from the sea, by exploring only 30 to 40 percent of the sea area. Another 60 percent of sea area remains untouched due to lack of logistic support and surveillance. Also, in Bangladesh, we are lagging from using the potentialities of blue economy, although we have the world’s longest sea beach, more than 700 rivers and the largest mangrove forest in the world. Besides, tourism shipbuilding, fishing, and aquaculture, transportation, are other raising sectors to contribute to national development in Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh has given emphasis on exploring the potentialities of the Blue economy for ensuring its sustainable development.

- Research studies have shown the increasing farmers’ adaptability to climate change impact and resilience to natural disasters and socioeconomic risks through the development. Also, these studies have highlighted the importance of promoting innovative aquaculture management concepts and practices in Bangladesh. More research on the blue economy can contribute to this area.

 

Also, tourism, which is one of the important sectors of the blue economy in Bangladesh, has been recognized as one of the most gainful business and the key to worldwide traders. Bangladesh has an incredible open door and the capability of turning into a tourist-based country. Tourism industry gives more openings for work when contrasted with different ventures. Tourism business reduces unemployment and helps to earn more foreign exchanges. But due to lack of knowledge, exploration, and innovation, Bangladesh have not been able to build an established tourism industry in Bangladesh.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

AccLab_Bangladesh can perform as a catalyst to connect the Government of Bangladesh, relevant national and international organizations to explore evidenced based knowledge on the potentialities of blue economy for employment generation in Bangladesh. Using systems thinking approach, piloting, research expertise, and exploratory thinking, AccLab wants to contribute to emerging new dimensions of blue economy in Bangladesh for supporting the coastal belt people. Its design thinking, behavioral insights and voluntarism approach with the local community can support for better waste management, generate new knowledge working with the community and share those ideas with policymakers for sustainable policy improvements. It is expected that AccLab can contribute to the local community in multidimensional ways, such as creating employment opportunities, managing waste management etc. through UNDP projects based in the area.

By using desk research, it is possible to understand the global and international context of blue economy. It is possible to utilize that knowledge with our local innovation for finding out solutions for local challenges. Also, our field research, survey, FGD will help to understand the current situation, assess the needs of local community and explore the opportunities of blue economy. Besides, the collaboration and partnership with national and international organizations will help to create employment opportunities for local people in the local community using the potentials of blue economy.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Since the blue economy is related to national interests, the Government of Bangladesh will be able to get policy decisions for employment and environmental protection of the coastal belt region. Most important, people of the costal belt region (very specifically people living with poverty) will have employment and livelihood opportunities and relevant training which will enable them to have a decent and better life. But it is a challenging task, so other national and international organizations should come forward along with GoB and UNDP to support this initiative and find out innovative solutions for the above-mentioned challenges to get the benefits of blue economy in Bangladesh.
