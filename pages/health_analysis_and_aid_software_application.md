HEALTH ANALYSIS AND AID SOFTWARE APPLICATION

> Brief description of the innovation

This is a highly accurate and comprehensive software that will give dynamically detailed medical information to users.
It has the ability to tell the user what sickness they have and what course of action to take based on the input given by the user.
Unlike google, this software will provide personalized data to the user based on their age, height, ethnicity, weight, habits and medical external readings. Users will also receive statistical information depending on what data they input in the software.
This application will also have some useful embedded features such as a map which shows the nearest hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and how long it will take for one to get there. It will also show the times that those medical facilities open and close.
It will also give solutions in the case of emergencies at home or in any other location. It will give solutions when there is no time to seek medical attention.
This application will also determine ones mental state by means of human like interaction between the user and the application.
Essentially, this a somewhat sentient application that will give personalized information to users in all areas of their health and general wellbeing.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

First and foremost, this application is for the benefit of our citizens. The main goal is to help our citizens with any medical challenges as well as to equip then with the necessary knowledge within the field of medicine.
This application will also help the medical personnel to give accurate and untainted data with no human error for it is my desire to expand it so as to facilitate its use within medical centers.
The prize money will not only help sustain the business but it will also enable me to improve the work that will be done so as to help even more people. It will enable to buy high quality devices that will imporve the quality of my application as well to help me design even much bigger and robust applications.

> Technical Feasibility

This is a software application that will be usable on computers, mobile phones and tablets. It will be used both online and offline.
I intend to use an integrated development environment to build this application, as well as any other software tools at my disposal. Everything will be done on a high end computer.

> Anticipated Social Impact

1. This health application will give essential aid to all citizens in regards to their health hence, the life expectancy of the nation will rise.
2. This application will be extending medical assistance to many citizens even without the help of input of medical personnel.
3. This application will educate many citizens on healthy living and the field of medicine.
4. It is revelant in this technological age to have a digital doctor at all times. Many people will be skilled and enlightened in the field of medicine just by using this application.
5. It will lessen the chances of people contracting coivd from meeical facilities as they will nolonger have to visit medical centers as frequently as before.
