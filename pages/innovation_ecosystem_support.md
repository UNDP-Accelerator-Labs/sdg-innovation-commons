## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Rather than solely focusing on equipping universities with modern fabrication tools to attract students in engineering and practical artisanal fields, the innovation space should actively promote interdisciplinary collaboration. Creating a conducive environment for students interested in areas like health, governance, and education can foster impactful ideas without the necessity of substantial hardware investments.

2. Investments in infrastructure and equipment, while valuable for prototype production, may not be the most effective use of limited funding. Such investments alone do not cultivate a culture of innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking. Prioritizing the instillation of this culture is crucial for long-term success.

3. Ensuring the long-term sustainability of innovation spaces and fabrication labs requires careful consideration. Costs associated with consumables, internet facilities, utilities (electricity and water), and essential support staff are often beyond the universities' financial capacity. Establishing strategic partnerships with both private and public sector entities is essential to make these spaces self-sustaining. For instance, partnering with telecommunication companies for internet provision can offer mutual benefits, including marketing opportunities. Additionally, utilizing the facilities to conduct practical short courses for non-university youth can serve as a viable means of generating funds.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

The aim is for our work  is to enhance UNDP country office's UniPod project. With the UniPod being the central hub in Freetown, the fab labs located in the regions will feed into it. This would ensure better coverage around the country for innovators to access these spaces for idea generation and fabrication of prototypes. 
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

A review of the digital and entrepreneurship ecosystem mapping report provided insights in the innovation space in Sierra Leone and the needs. 

Interviews with key stakeholders in academia, private innovation hubs and innovators also gave insights into the functionality of fabrication labs and innovation spaces and how they can be sustained in the long run.
