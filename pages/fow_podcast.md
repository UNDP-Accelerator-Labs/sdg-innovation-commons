FoW Podcast
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that key discussions on the Future of Work (FoW) need to be mainstreamed in the country.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



UNDP has developed a Portfolio on FoW with 6 areas of focus. This framework was designed to support a systemic approach to job creation aligned with the future of work scenario for the country. To promote systemic change, UNDP is not only looking at UNDP projects but also connecting with the entire ecosystem of development partners, government and private sector through a Learning Platform, which has resulted in new partnerships, and coordinated increased impact in projects. The unemployment rate remains above 30% in the country and it is a challenge for the youth, who need to be prepared to engage in the employment market having access to opportunities and training. Now it is the time to take all the learnings from the Portfolio and mainstreaming it with the broader audience. UNDP is inviting its partners for thematic discussions/Podcast around the challenges of work and based on the Portfolio framework.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Through the FoW Learning and Coordination Platform, it was verified that there was a significant absence of coordination for employment related projects and initiatives. It was also confirmed that there is room to increase multi-stakeholder collaboration to accelerate projects and increase their impact and strengthen access to information. Recent emerging discussions and government plans associated with the diversification of the economy, green transitions, and digital inclusion are all evidence of the urgent need to align training/education and the employment agenda to the Future of Work agenda.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab was able to bring all actors together and establish a learning and coordination mechanism using innovative methodologies and approaches. The Accelerator Labs are now able to mainstream these learnings to the broader audience through a Podcast.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

## Learning questions
****

We want to test a Podcast model as a way to increase access to information and share information with the Youth.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We will use the Podcast format for a new way of communicating and sharing a message.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



These data sources will help shape the discussions and understand audience engagement
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



If the format works, we are identifying key champions to support the growth of the initiative, which we see as a continuation of the discussions in another format/forum, the development of initiatives/partnerships to boost employment for youth that might emerge from the discussions. But another outcome can be for similar format being used to mainstream discussions on other areas of development and not only FoW.
