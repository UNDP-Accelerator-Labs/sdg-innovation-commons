> Title of the innovation

To Venture into Livestock Production, Cropping Operations &amp; Fisheries

> Brief description of the innovation

To Venture into Rearing of Chickens for Meat &amp; Egg Production, Fish Farming as well as embarking of Growing of Crops for Sustainable Development. Under Cropping Operations, we intend to Grow Crops such as Potatoes, Carrots, Cabbage, Egg Plant, Chillies &amp; Sunflower. Under Fish Farming we would like to Come up with Fish ponds and Stock atleast a 1000 Fingerlings per Pound and we plan to have about 12 Pounds so as to be able to bridge the Gap of fish in the market as the main source of Protein for most Households. The vegetable market is another Lucrative market, in that Considering the Population of our Country, there's an increasing demand for more &amp; more food requirements for livelihoods.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Wow like Chicken Business is Quite Lucrative, the Market is readily available both local and on the Boarder areas of our country such as Kasumbalesa Border Post, Sakanya just to name but a few. Benefits to acrue from this innovative are that, the Business is going to employ some youths and women from amongst the locals who shall be full time farm workers thereby Contributing to employment Creation &amp; bridging the Gap on nutritional needs derived from these Ventures. Given a Full Start up Support, the Business can employ roughly around 20 workers under the Poultry Section, 20 under Cropping Operations &amp; another 20 under Fish Farming, thereby Contributing to National Employment Creation &amp; Food Security.

> Technical Feasibility

The Proposed Implementation Plan is to start by putting up a Borehall for easy access of water, then put up Poultry Houses and build Fish Ponds.

> Anticipated Social Impact

To a very great extent this will being about massive employment to both the Youth, women &amp; those marginalized in Society in that they will be getting paid on a Monthly Basis &amp; as Selling Starts, it's anticipated that we shall get on Board Qualified personnel to handle the aspect of deliveries
