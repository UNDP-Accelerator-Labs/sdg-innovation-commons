George Maina founded Shamba Records, an agritech startup that uses Blockchain and AI to collect small scale farmers' production data, link them to markets, process their payments and connect them to credit alternatives. So far, Shamba Records has digitized more than 6,000 small scale farmers and their respective cooperatives. Shamba Records solves the challenges of records manipulation, delayed payments, credit score and inadequate farming information.
