> Title of the innovation

Carbon Farming project

> Brief description of the innovation

Carbon Farming is simply farming in a way that reduces Greenhouse Gas emissions or captures and holds carbon in vegetation and soils. It is managing land, water, plants and animals to meet the triple challenge of landscape restoration, climate change and food security. It seeks to reduce emissions in its production processes, while increasing production and sequestering carbon in the landscape.The benefits of carbon farming include carbon sequestration, reduced erosion and soil loss, improved soil structure, increased soil fertility, reduced soil salinity, healthier soils, vegetation and animals, increased biodiversity, buffering against drought and greater water efficiency.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Healthy soils, healthy climate
The Carbon Farming project aims for a double goal: mitigate climate change and improve agricultural soils. How? By implementing carbon sequestration (CS) techniques on farm-level: fixing CO2 from the atmosphere in soils and improving the soil quality and biodiversity. Healthy soils, healthy climate. A win-win situation.

> Technical Feasibility

Carbon farm plan is a whole farm approach to optimizing carbon capture on working landscape. We start with the creation of a carbon farm plan (CFP) where our team works with a farmer or rancher to assess all the opportunities for GHG reduction n carbon sequestration on their property

> Anticipated Social Impact

Seeing as we are approaching the farming season, better and more efficient ways of farming are worth trying out.
