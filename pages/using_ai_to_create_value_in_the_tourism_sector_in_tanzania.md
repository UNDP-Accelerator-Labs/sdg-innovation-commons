## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Using Ai to create value in the tourism sector
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is a lower returning rate of tourists after first visit to the islands. Further to the systemic challenges identified above, the 2017 International Visitor Exit Experiment showed that the majority of the top 15 source markets with the exception of Kenya were first time visitors to the islands, with repeat visitors accounting for just 14 percent of the total number of visitors.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Zanzibar has cultural, historic, natural, and man-made tourism assets that have the potential to transform it into an up-market and competitive tourist destination in the Indian Ocean archipelagos. It is the primary economic sector that connects all other economic sectors. Zanzibar's tourism industry accounts for approximately 27 percent of GDP and generates more than $400 million in revenue. COVID-19 has spawned a slew of economic, social, and environmental issues that are impeding private investment and the ease of doing business in Zanzibar's tourism sector. The main challenges are undercapitalized institutions in the sector, lack of professional competences, and crumbling infrastructures, to name a few. However, for the purposes of this experiment, we have focused our efforts on determining the problem of lower returning rate of tourists after first visit to the islands. Further to the  systemic challenges identified above, The 2017 International Visitor Exit Experiment showed that the majority of the top 15 source markets with the exception of Kenya were first time visitors to the islands, with repeat visitors accounting for just 14 percent of the total visitors.

The advent of COVID 19 pandemic has further exacerbated the situation. In Zanzibar the first case was reported on 18th March 2020, and as of 29th April, 2020 there were a total of 105 confirmed cases of corona virus with 4 deaths reported in Zanzibar. In response to the COVID 19 pandemic, the government had imposed several preventive measures, including travel restrictions, closure of schools, social distancing, restrictions on large meetings and gatherings as well as suspension of all international flights.  It is worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis, it is affecting societies and economies at their core. The immediate and medium-term impact of COVID-19 on Tourism, to small island developing economies, including Zanzibar, cannot be overstated. The closure of hotels in Zanzibar, coupled with COVID-19 related lockdown of international travel, contributed to reduced forex earnings and domestic tax revenue. This in turn results in government’s inability to provide basic social services. The pandemic has also had an adverse impact on jobs security[1] and reduced economic activities in the tourism value chain, resulting in increased poverty and inequalities affecting the vulnerable communities, including women and youth the most. Cognizant of tourism industry as an accelerator of sustainable development, with a potential to contribute towards several SDGs due to its crosscutting and multiplying effect on other sectors the impact of COVID 19 on tourism will definitely impede achievement of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Zanzibar, hence underscoring the significance of corrective measures to address and mitigate the adverse impact of COVID 19 on Zanzibar’s economy and tourism value chain in particular. [1] According to Xinhua, July 30, at  least 5,000 people in the tourism sector in Tanzania's Zanzibar have been left jobless following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-07/30/c_139252465.htm

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This kind of data collection has never been employed by UNDP or any other actor before in the islands of Zanzibar and in Tanzania in general. The entire process will bring new data sources that have never been used before. We expect the process is inexpensive, accurate and timely. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

As part of the country office's project in tourism recovery and resilience, the Tanzania Acc lab and its partners are experimenting with exploiting satellite imagery data to uncover new tourist destinations in Zanzibar's islands.
