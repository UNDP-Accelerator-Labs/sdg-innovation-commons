## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Wicked problems such as SWM in developing countries with weak institutions are hard to address systemically given the various agendas and interests around the theme.

2. Gov't officials tend to see SWM as a technical problem alone (ie lack of funding for more collector trucks, landfills, etc.) yet civic and citizenzens' attitudes and practices toward SWM go largely ignored and they are a key factor.

3. Community-based approaches to SWM offer an efficient alternative to top-down solutions that don't meet the specific needs of different communities

4. Experimentation is an agile approach to testing what works/doesn't work when addressing SWM as it provides a space for failure and learning, and thus improvement.

5. Community-level governance is key to a smooth project implementation process. In poverty-stricken areas, resources are scarce and local stakeholders might see a project as a way to benefit individually, thus a struggle might ensue among leaders and organizations. One needs to manage and thread carefully how to gear efforts towards common goals.



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

The municipality of Santo Domingo Este is satisfied with the project and has continued to fund it after the lab's funds were used. They are also discussing our model with other neighbor municipalities.



> Please paste any link(s) to blog(s) or publication(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

All of these data types and sources were useful in getting us the framework, insights and learnings we needed to advance the project.



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The SWM challenge has been typically approached from a top-down, technocratic perspective. Our methods were more flexible and encompassing of various frameworks. Also, our methods placed people at the center of all activities.
