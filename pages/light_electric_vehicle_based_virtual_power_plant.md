Although energy access in Bangladesh has drastically improved in recent years in terms of the number of connections, the challenge of today mainly lies in assuring quality service for those connections at an affordable cost to the consumer and the government. Load shedding was a common phenomenon in the past, but since the latter half of 2022, its rate of occurrence has been on the rise again. The fear of load shedding is further increasing with the number of energy-hungry electric vehicles on the roads. While the adoption of renewable energies is slowly improving, their potential is far from utilised.

A discussion white paper by Solshare (link to the paper shared below), a climate-tech startup based in Dhaka, Bangladesh, explores the role of electric rickshaws (three-wheeler vehicle prevalent in Bangladesh), also known as e-rickshaws, in virtual power plants (VPPs) as an innovative solution to the above problems. Virtual power plants are cloud-based systems that manage and optimize various distributed energy resources such as solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, and, in this case, rickshaws. By connecting and coordinating multiple individual rickshaws, the rickshaw VPP acts as a decentralized energy storage and generation source. The International Energy Agency recognizes VPPs as crucial for achieving a carbon-neutral or net-zero economy.

Through the VPP, e-rickshaw batteries can be efficiently charged and discharged, their capacity aggregated, and their energy usage optimized based on grid conditions, demand, and other factors. This allows e-rickshaws not only to serve as transportation vehicles but also to contribute to the stability and resilience of the electricity grid as distributed energy resources, facilitating the integration of renewable energy.

The solshare paper highlights that, at the end of a driver's day, approximately 25% to 30% of battery charge remains. Using the VPP, this excess electricity can be sold to the grid during peak demand hours and repurchased during low-demand periods, enabling the driver to earn extra income while helping stabilize the grid and address load shedding issues. The cost of fully charging the vehicle at night is much cheaper for the driver compared to selling electricity during peak demand, creating a financial advantage.

One of the significant advantages of VPPs is that they provide grid operators with a comprehensive understanding of the combined load. Additionally, they offer precise information about specific distribution lines, known as feeders. Unlike traditional load-shedding methods that consider only sanctioned load levels, VPPs take into account real-time actual load data. This enhanced visibility of the actual load enables more connections to remain online during periods of low load and allows feeders with renewable energy feed-in points to remain connected, promoting increased integration of renewable energy into the grid.

Affordability is another key benefit of VPPs. Participation in VPPs provides direct compensation to homes and businesses. Additionally, VPPs reduce wholesale energy and fuel costs by shifting demand to low- or no-marginal-cost resources, as opposed to relying on expensive peaking resources.

The technology builds on what is readily available today. The components and mechanisms of the Rickshaw VPP are
