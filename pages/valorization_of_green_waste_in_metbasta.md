Valorization of green waste in Metbasta
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that the valorization of green waste will contribute to reducing inequalities and promoting inclusion

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



In 2024, The Acceleretor Lab has started a major initiative in Kairouan, in the community of Metbasta. After installing 30 bins for organic waste and 5 for sorting plastic, several awareness-raising actions have been organized, particularly with women and on social networks by inviting page holders to participate in this awareness-raising effort. Currently, the majority of waste is no longer thrown into the open but collected and we note that a new collective consciousness has been established among the inhabitants.
The next step will be the valorization of green waste and the formalization of marginalized artisans

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab is working in a rural area that is cut off from many public services, including municipal ones. We fully immersed ourselves with the villagers, gaining the trust of community leaders. This trust capital allows us to carry out experiments, particularly on waste management, which is the village's main problem. We are in the process of developing a major partnership (public sector, private sector, civil society) around this initiative.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Through behavior change and waste management, the Accelerator Lab is building a bridge of trust between citizens and the administration, fostering inclusion, job creation, and access to services.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



The Office holds data on farmers and livestock breeders who need animal feed. The valorization of green waste will help balance local supply and demand. The Office will conduct chemical analyses to assess the quality of the processed waste, ensure the formalization of producers, and distribute animal feed equitably.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



All these methods are used for immersion in a rural municipality and understanding its internal dynamics. The goal is to build partnerships around waste management to naturally reduce inequalities and promote inclusion.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



In rural areas, finding data is challenging. It is recommended to rely on direct contact and on-the-ground information collection.
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



an entire community of informal craftswomen (more than 20 families) will benefit, as will the entire surrounding region, discovering that it is possible to transform waste into wealth
