> Title of the innovation

Object detection system using deep learning and machine learning

> Brief description of the innovation

Object detection system using deep learning and machine learning, with improvement on the system and given the right resources the system will be able to detect different types of diseases and which soil is good to plant a particular type of fruit thereby limiting human error and provide accurate results

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With current pandemic that has hit our nation Zambia, I believe with this software will be able to reduce on the number of covid cases and closure of certain companies by introducing a face recognition and attendance software, the software will recognize the employees face and name and record the time they have reported for work, thereby reducing on human contact and use of pens and paper sheets for login information as well as provide efficiency and transparency among workers . This will be targeted to both private and government companies.

The object detection and recognition using deep learning , given the right resources the system will be able to predict and detect a particular type of disease, including different soils good for particular types of plants, the software will be targeted to various healthy institutions and farmers. With this technology the system has to be given data, suppose different types of disease, the system will then learn from the given data, and there after test it’s accuracy

> Technical Feasibility

Basically the system is designed using python programming language and I plan to use C++ as well.

The prototype that exists is what the software will be able to do given the right machinery or better computer hardware. I must mention that the development process is currently on hold because of my limited access to a better PC.

I believe this will set a stepping stone to better technological advancements in Zambia

> Anticipated Social Impact

The software will provide efficiency and transparency and of course provide Zambia with a fast delivery system among health institutions
