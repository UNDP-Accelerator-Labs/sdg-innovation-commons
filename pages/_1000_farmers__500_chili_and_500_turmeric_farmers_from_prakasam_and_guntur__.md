## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.      1000 farmers were registered on the platform  (500 Chili and 500 Turmeric farmers from Prakasam and Guntur Districts of Andhra Pradesh)  2.      The platform for successfully demonstrated for immutability and transparency of data 3.      Efforts are underway to expand the pilot to 3000 farmers and also to demonstrate how blockchain can help in establishing real world traceability of spices on the field. 4.      A blockchain-based trading module will also be designed to facilitate direct buying and selling of spices by small and marginal farmers 5.      Based on the results of the pilot, UNDP and Spices Board will scale up the blockchain platform to make it the National Gateway for Quality Assurance and Traceability of Indian spices involving farmer producer organizations (FPOs), quality certification agencies, state governments, export associations as well as regulator (Spices Board)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Getting the multiple partners on board and on the same page at all points of the project- be it the technical coordinator- NEC India, Govt partner- Spices Board, and our implementing partner GS1. We ensured that there was consistent and clear communication for all the stakeholders. On the field level, there are always several challenges with respect to getting data on field level yield etc, this was enabled through onboarding of a local NGO through the implementing partner.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There is a need to make the spices value chain efficient, transparent and equitable for all stakeholders and leveraging technology is key to achieve this outcome.  These methods and tools helped both UNDP and the partner (Spices Board) to validate the hypothesis and to get convinced on the usefulness of our intervention.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The first step was to design a platform to demonstrate value of blockchain technology for immutability and transparency of data. Therefore, prototyping was key. The pilot stage led to registration of 1000 farmers (500 Chili and 500 Turmeric farmers from Prakasam and Guntur Districts of Andhra Pradesh). Once this step was achieved, the govt partner Spices Board agreed that there is merit in scaling it up to a national level. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

GS1 India (Non-profit Standards Organization) - Project Support Organization

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

 NEC Corporation (Private Sector) - Blockchain Developer 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Spices Board, Ministry of Commerce, Government of India  Spices Board is one of the five Commodity Boards functioning under the Ministry of Commerce & Industry. It is an autonomous body responsible for the export promotion of the 52 scheduled spices and development of Cardamom (Small & Large). The main Functions of the Spices Board relevant to this project is: Export promotion of all spices through support for technology upgradation, quality upgradation, brand promotion, research & product development. Both UNDP and Spices Board entered into a partnership to build a blockchain based traceability interface for Indian spices to enhance transparency and accountability in spices processing and trading.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All 3 listed above were new partners for UNDP India.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Blockchain with its robust and transparent functionalities has the potential to assure quality of spices by providing consumers and markets access to immutable data on quality parameters followed in the whole value chain. It will help in establishing traceability of spices across the value chain. Blockchain also supports fair trade of Indian spices, which will benefit low-income farmers by enabling them to obtain fair income through the smart contracts feature. Through this pilot and the upcoming scale up stage, it will help regulatory agencies such as Spices Board India to monitor, control and ensure quality of spices while ensuring equitable returns for small and marginal spices farmers.
