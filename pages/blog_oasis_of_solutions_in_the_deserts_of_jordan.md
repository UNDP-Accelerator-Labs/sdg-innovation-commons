OASIS OF SOLUTIONS IN THE DESERTS OF JORDAN
Oasis of Solutions in the Deserts of Jordan
JUNE 1, 2023
By: Mohammad Abumughli – Head of Experimentation, UNDP Jordan Accelerator Lab
As a new member stepping into the Jordan UNDP Accelerator Lab, I was embraced by a team of extraordinary individuals eager to shape a radiating vision that would illuminate our paths throughout the year.
Last year, my colleagues dedicated their energies to tourism in Madaba, grappling with ideas and activities, yearning to piece them together into a cohesive tapestry. Deep within their hearts, they felt the burning desire to leave a mark on the UNDP office and to be recognised as agents of change. Truth be told, I found myself genuinely captivated by the idea.
Focusing on tourism as our constellation, one sub-theme stood out in a landscape teeming with endless possibilities, beckoning the curious minds of explorers, experimenters, and solution mappers: the fascinating realm of Nature-Based Solutions (NbS). It was an idea that promised to reshape our connection with the environment and chart a course towards a sustainable future.
In the heart of the vast Jordanian desert, cradled between rugged cliffs and endless dunes, lies a place of awe-inspiring beauty known as Wadi Rum or the Valley of the Moon. With its towering sandstone formations and mesmerising views, Wadi Rum has captivated the imaginations of travellers, tourists, and moviemakers for decades. To me, experiencing this fascinating place was like travelling to another planet or even another dimension.

Driven by our unwavering commitment to engage in Nature-based Solutions (NbS) and prioritize the well-being of local communities, the Al Disi Women's Cooperative emerged as a remarkable women-led Community-Based Organization. Fueled by a shared vision, a group of determined women united to revive their environmental heritage symbolised by a native plant called "Al Ghada" (Haloxylon persicum) that once thrived in the region.

Their ambitions went beyond environmental restoration, as they sought to uplift their community and nurture their entrepreneurial skills. UNDP previously funded this cooperation through a project that supported the implementation of the three Rio Conventions with a particular emphasis on the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) focusing on propagating the Al Ghada plant.

The Accelerator Lab seeks to unravel the secrets of the famous Al Ghada, recognising its potential as a catalyst for ecological restoration, economic empowerment, and cultural preservation. To achieve this, the Lab conducted a mission to map out possible solutions that sustainably utilise local plants, primarily focusing on the “Al Ghada” while empowering the women of Wadi Rum.
Stay tuned as we embark on the following chapters of this extraordinary journey.
