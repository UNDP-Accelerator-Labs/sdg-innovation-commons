> Title of the innovation

Cleaner compounds better life

> Brief description of the innovation

The program am proposing is to set up community groups in the various compunds of Lusaka composed of household heads and volunteers to promote cleanliness in their environments. I am a student at the University of Lusaka studying for a degree in Purchasing and Supply chain management. To achieve the goal I have set up on a massive scale, we would require a lot of willing volunteers to solidify mutual interests with the household heads in the targeted compounds, and sponsors. Volunteers would have to interact with the heads of the households to discuss the improvements that could be made to their compound and how them the people can help significantly improve their environment to promote healthy lives. One of the steps I would like to propose to this mission is to have volunteeres ask people to donate money for garbage truck services and road clean ups.  Garbage bins should be strategically stationed across the compound so as to convince people with trash in their hands as they walk in the road. For people to fully embrace this mission sponsors have to take the first step by financing this program to buy the bins and pay for garbage disposal services so that the general public could be inspired more to donate to clean their environment. As this program is being carried out citizens should be educated on keeping the roads clean and strongly discouraging throwing trash in the road. 
I do not wish to be the head of this program because I understand the seriousness of this progam but I just ask to play my role in it to make our society a more comfortable and healthy place to live in.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The program I have suggested does not aim to generate income but improve the way of living of people in the country. 


On another isssue unrelated, I have had an idea of procuring two husky puppies which cost around k6000 each and raise them so that I can start selling their puppies at k4000. It might seem as a loss because I would be selling puppies at a lower price but this bread gives birth to 4-7 puppies. With the first birth I would have paid my loan and with the second birth I would keep some to expand my dog farm and sell two to cover expenses of cleaning products and vet services. With time the money I get from selling puppies would finance another endavour I might want to embark on. Your consideration would be greatly appreciated.

> Technical Feasibility

The program to aid people improve their environment is a recognized issue that I know is under consideration by higher ups and is being worked on. My idea is to cancel a bit of realiablity from sponsors even though they are critically needed and ask the general public to help them selves improve their environment. Depending on how successful the strategies to persuade the people to aid the cause of the program are, it would result into considerable social development. Creatung and holding events Inviting household guests to to convince them to participate in donations and celebrating the current that has been done. These events would help amplify the willingness of the people donating to the cause of the program continue to do so. Events should not be regularly held unless only when their is an achievement. 
Gathering volunteers is a work that I can do here at campus and perhaps partner with my brother, Mark Simweleba a graduate from the University of Zambia who is already in an organization that promotes social and health development. 




The second program I listed is a self empowerment program that I've been wanting do but lack the capital to procure two Huskey puppies.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The program I have suggested could help improve the way of living of people starting from Lusaka to other provinces in the country. A clean envirommemt promotes a better way of living for people. People from other countries should be able to rent a house in any community and feel safe and comfortable while stayin there. The time of Zambian people living in shanty compunds needs to come to an end. With strong willed volunteers and adequate financial aid from sponsors I know we can make a difference. All I ask is that I may be added in the plans to better the lives of my country men and women.
