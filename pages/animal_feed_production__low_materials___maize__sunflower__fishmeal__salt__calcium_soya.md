> Brief description of the innovation

Making feed using maize, sunflower cake, fishmeal, salt, limestone etc.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through profit I'll generate income. My workers will generate income through salary. My customers will generate income through profit, when they buy feed at low price and sale their chickens at high price. My target population is at least 5 provinces. It's zero harm to the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

Machinery ( grinding machine). Low materials are maize, sunflower cake, fishmeal,salt etc.
My implementation plan is to purchase at least 5 grinding machines.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The feed is chemical free as it contains natural ingredients only. Thus it improves the health of people. This is very relevant as the existing feed making companies are unable to produce enough feed to Carter all. And their feed is very expensive. My feed is affordable and available.
