> Title of the innovation

Village chicken poutry

> Brief description of the innovation

Our innovation is to bridge the gap between the poor and the rich in doing so we have looked at the group of people who are not considered in our community.If these people were to be trained in different life skills it would help our economy to go up.We have few people with disabilities whom we're trying to train  on how to keep village chickens so that they can have a source of income instead of them always looking for who to help them.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The value addition of our innovation in our Environment is that we are targeting people with lodges, restaurants and civil servants around us because were we are there is no one keeping the village chickens so far so the market is vast for us.Then we sell our chickens at an affordable price such that all classes of people can manage

> Technical Feasibility

Our plans are that we meet every week to see what are the challenges that our team members are facing in keeping these chickens and offer solution to the challenge.

> Anticipated Social Impact

People with disabilities feel that they are a part of the community because it brings about socialisation as they sell their chickens and satisfaction.
