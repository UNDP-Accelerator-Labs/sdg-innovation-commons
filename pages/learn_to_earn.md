> Title of the innovation

Learn To Earn

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is all about gathering youths together to one centre platform where they're not only going to be motivated to crave for knowledge but also gain something for their knowledge. It is a visionary application that will allow young people to contest on what we're calling a "Learn To Earn Quiz" on a daily basis.This quiz will be based on developmental topics such as Sexual reproductive health, science &amp; innovation among others. All quiz contestants will enter the live quiz after paying a small amount e.g K10 and given timed questions to answer within a short period. The system marks and grades the results for all and a certain number of people (e.g 1/4 of the total contestants with the highest grades) gets to share the amount from the other 3/4 who couldn't make it at that particular day. The platform also has an open zone to share skills,ideas, innovations etc. In the interest of winning,youths get exposed to right information and share knowledge. The aim is to encourage correct use of the internet, sensitising on different aspects of the community,reading culture, motivation, productive school leavers,,,,,kerb idle minds leading to immoral vices, organizations to easily locate talent.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Firstly the innovation will centre to benefit everyone on the platform. Income will be generated from affiliated schools, academies, tuition centres who wish to provide online learning using the platform as earlier witnessed by the struggles in the learning sector by the Covid-19. A huge audience gathering opens opportunities for advertising and marketing starting from SMEs, network providers such as Zamtel, Airtel, MTN will be at the centre of transaction hence boosting business for all, affiliated organizations who will come on board, the participants themselves will be another source of income that will be shared with others and the operations, other services such as YouTube videos, well wishers among others. Peotry,books etc will be available for purchase or free depending on the source.The list is endless

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed in such a way that the audience (contestants,schools,,,,,) create their account using either their email or phone numbers,once that is done they select their interest (if it's enrolling in a subject,course ,quiz, adverts, skill showcase centre,other) and explore the platform from there. When enrolling,they pay using a secured channel that connects to their mobile money accounts to comfirm their transaction for their particular selected site,to be able to see adverts only a very minimal amount will be required. If it's a sch or organization that want to bring their services, a channel to the administration's desk is available.All this will be centred on one platform.
A PROTOTYPE HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED BUT CURRENTLY A SAMPLE SITE IS AVAILABLE TO EXPLORE THE IDEA

> Anticipated Social Impact

Everyone will have a way to benefit from it. Small scale businesses will be help to boost by the potential available market, network service providers as it is now being encouraged to "Go the Digital Way",Easy access to correct knowledge, reading culture of the young people encouraged,aside of the unpredictable sports betting,this can be a guaranteed win once one has the knowledge about a particular topic,
The current market is highly in need of digital services, be it shopping,transport services such as notifying people on which bus goes to which place at a stated time. Online Learning is online the rise and better services that caters for the needs of the learners are highly needed,the correct use of the internet cannot be over-emphasized,a alot of young people who have knowledge and skills lack a way of reaching out to the masses and this will be a dream platform where everyone will have it at their finger tips,,,,,,,,
