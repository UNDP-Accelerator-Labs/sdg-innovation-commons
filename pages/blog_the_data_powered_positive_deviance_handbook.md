DPPD Handbook

A step-by-step guide for development practitioners to
apply the Data Powered Positive Deviance method

Version 1.0 | November 2021

Acknowledgments

The creation of the Data Powered Positive Deviance handbook has been a
joint effort of many people from various organizations.

in scoping,
Basma Albanna and Andreas Pawelke took the
developing, and testing the Handbook. Jeremy Boy and Andreas Glücker
were closely involved throughout the process and contributed heavily to
its development. Catherine Vogel, Richard Heeks, and Gina Lucarelli all
provided important guidance and useful inputs. Shumin Liu, Dharani Dhar
Burra, and Michael Dyer contributed during the early stages of the
Handbook. Marie-Helen Cymorek did the design and layout.

lead

The DPPD method was developed iteratively through its application by the
DPPD initiative partners who conducted seven pilot projects on six
different complex challenges. Without this pilot work, and the teams
behind it, the Handbook would not be what it is: a resource for
practitioners by practitioners.

We were able to present and test early versions of the tools and templates
in events and workshops, including the DPPD Bootcamp in July 2021,
attended by teams from GIZ and UNDP. We are grateful for the feedback
we received from participants.

The Handbook and, in fact, the entire DPPD initiative, would not exist
without the support and belief of the four institutions that initiated the
DPPD network: the GIZ Data Lab, the UN Global Pulse Lab Jakarta, the
UNDP Accelerator Labs Network, and the University of Manchester’s
Centre for Digital Development. Further, the work of the DPPD initiative is
grounded in the Positive Deviance approach and would not have been
possible without the pioneering work of the Sternins who were the first to
operationalize the approach in the area of development.

The development of the DPPD handbook was made possible thanks to the
financial support of GIZ.

The Method

Positive Deviance (PD) is based on the observation that in every
community or organization, there are a few individuals who achieve
significantly better outcomes than their peers, despite having similar
challenges and resources. These individuals are referred to as positive
deviants, and adopting their solutions is what is referred to as the PD
approach¹.

The method described in this Handbook follows the same logic as the PD
approach but uses pre-existing, non-traditional data sources instead of
— or in conjunction with — traditional data sources. Non-traditional data
in this context broadly refers to data that is digitally captured (e.g.
mobile phone records and financial data), mediated (e.g. social media
and online data), or observed (e.g. satellite imagery). The integration of
such data to complement traditional data sources generally used in PD is
what we refer to as Data Powered Positive Deviance² (DPPD).

The digital data opportunity

Data Powered Positive Deviance

The DPPD method described in this Handbook emerged from a process of
research and testing and follows the same stages as the PD approach. The
difference is that DPPD integrates pre-existing, non-traditional data across
the five stages, requiring a series of new and specific methods and
practices that are not required in the PD approach. The first stage is also
somewhat different because it not only defines the problem, but it also
checks if it is suitable and feasible to use the DPPD method for the
proposed project.

Table 1 lists the five stages of the DPPD method. This Handbook dedicates
a section to each stage.

Define the problem and check if DPPD is a
suitable and feasible method by assessing the
required data and capabilities and by ensuring
that potential outcomes are desirable for the
target group.

Divide the population of study into
homogeneous groups and measure the
performance of the observed units to identify
potential positive deviants. Conclude this stage
with a preliminary validation of identified
potential positive deviants.

Conduct field research on the performance of
both positive deviants and non-positive
deviants. Collect and analyze data to identify
predictors that distinguish both groups.
Uncover positively-deviant behaviors, practices,
and other factors that explain the
outperformance of positive deviants.

Assess the potential of the identified practices to
be replicated and scaled. Based on the insights
generated, design and implement community
interventions to scale those practices. Further
insights on contextual factors influencing
behavior and outcomes within communities can
be considered for future policy interventions.

Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness and
suitability of the community and/or policy
interventions.

Methodological differences between PD and DPPD

Both PD and DPPD start with the same premise: in every population,
there are
individuals or communities who, despite facing similar
challenges and limitations, achieve better results than their peers. Both
acknowledge the value of locally-sourced solutions, the agency of
people, and the need to value the relative advantage that a positive
deviant might have over others. However, they somewhat differ
methodologically, as highlighted in Table 2.

Positive Deviance

Data Powered Positive Deviance

Data

Positive deviants and their practices are identified using
primary data collected through direct observation, like
interviews and surveys.

Positive deviants are identified using existing digital
data sources, as well as more traditional secondary
data to control for potential confounds. Their practices
are then identified using primary data collected during
the field research phase.

Coverage

Positive deviants are generally individuals identified
within very specific areas that are largely homogeneous
(e.g. an individual village).

Positive deviants can be individuals, communities,
administrative units, or geographic areas that can be
identified in large spatial areas and on temporal scales.

Capabilities

Requires local knowledge, domain expertise, basic
statistical analysis, appreciative inquiry, and ethnography
skills.

Requires local knowledge, domain expertise, and a
combination of domain-specific data knowledge,
advanced statistical analysis, appreciative inquiry, and
ethnography skills.

Costs

The initial cost of positive deviant identification is directly
proportional to the sample size, as it relies mainly on pri-
mary data collection.

The initial cost of positive deviant identification can be
low because it relies on readily available data. However,
there can be significant additional costs associated with
data access and analysis.

The Initiative

The DPPD network

In April 2020⁶, a network of partners launched the DPPD initiative. The
Initiative was set up to design, test, and document a method combining
the use of novel, digital data sources with one of the most prominent
asset-based approaches to development practice — Positive Deviance.

The DPPD network was initiated by the GIZ Data Lab, the UN Global Pulse
Lab Jakarta, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network, and the University of
Manchester’s Centre for Digital Development. It is an action-learning
network that explores the use of new digital data sources to systematically
identify and understand positive outliers in various domains, including
deforestation, agriculture, and gender-based violence. The goal is to build
a shared understanding of the opportunities and limitations of the DPPD
method, to develop a set of tools and techniques to apply the method, and
to test the method across locations, sectors, and data types and sources.

While the DPPD method may seem niche and very technical, it has the
potential to help development practice shift from top-down identification
and tackling of development challenges to focusing on communities’
inherent assets and capabilities as the ultimate starting point in the search
for solutions⁷. It provides a path to move away from external solutions to
the diffusion of local practices and strategies that take into account
contextual variables, making them more likely to stick⁸ and less vulnerable
to social rejection.

The choice of locations and development challenges addressed by the
pilot projects⁹ was made to ensure diversity in terms of non-traditional
data types used, such as remote sensing data, mapping, and cadastral
geographic data, as well as both proprietary and open data sources.
These were further complemented by a variety of traditional data
sources, including official statistics, administrative data, surveys, and
interviews.

The units of analysis were selected to cover different aggregation levels,
from individuals and communities up to administrative and geographical
units in urban areas or villages. The diversity of domains, countries, data,
and scales was important for testing the DPPD method and to gauge the
breadth of its applicability.

The Handbook

This Handbook is a practical guide for the application of the DPPD
method. It aims to help development practitioners identify and scale
uncommon but successful practices in different sectors by mixing
analytical insights from traditional and non-traditional data sources. This
should help amplify innovative, locally sourced, and evidence-informed
solutions to development challenges.

The step-by-step guidance contains an
initial assessment of the
suitability, feasibility, and desirability of the method given a particular
project scope all the way to the more technical details of how to identify
potential positive deviants in large data sets and subsequently validating
these findings through fieldwork. It builds on the documented
experience of pilot teams who have worked on six different challenges
across seven countries.

This Handbook targets all development practitioners. The language and
terms used are therefore not specific to any of the institutions involved
in the DPPD initiative.

How to use the handbook

The pilots have yet to reach these final stages of the DPPD method where
they design interventions to scale and amplify the positively-deviant
practices identified and monitor their implementation.

The Handbook will be useful for data for development experts interested
in exploring a new method that looks at identifying and scaling solutions
rather than understanding and describing problems using digital data. PD
practitioners will find value in DPPD as a way to explore and use new
sources of data and expand the scope of their work.

Finally, domain experts will see value in the DPPD method to find
uncommon practices to inform and complement their current portfolio of
development interventions. It is important to emphasize that the DPPD
method is best suited for teams, as it requires a range of skills unlikely to
be accessible to one single individual.

The DPPD handbook is written by practitioners for practitioners. It is
meant to be brief, practical, and easily applicable. For those interested in
diving deeper into theory and the underlying conceptual frameworks, the
Handbook contains links and references to relevant resources. Each
section of the Handbook contains descriptions of the steps to follow,
practical examples from the pilots, as well as templates to fill in when
designing and implementing a DPPD project.

The Handbook is divided into five sequenced stages, as shown in Figure 2.

1

Stage 1 helps define the problem and validate if it is suitable and viable to
use the DPPD method. Stage 2 provides guidance on identifying positive
deviants within available datasets. Stage 3 details how to uncover factors
underlying outperformance. Stages 4 and 5 cover the different aspects of
designing and implementing DPPD interventions, as well as means to
monitor and evaluate those interventions.

You will find detailed guidance with practical examples in Stages 1 through
3. Most of the pilot teams have worked through these stages and their
experiences and learnings were documented for the Handbook. The
descriptions of Stages 4 and 5 in the corresponding sections is different
from the first three. While we provide initial thoughts and suggestions on
how to go about Stages 4 and 5, they do not have the depth and practical
learnings from the pilots.

Section overview

Stage 1, Assess Problem-Method Fit, will walk you through a set of
questions to help you decide whether or not to apply the DPPD
method. It is designed as a light-touch exercise requiring little initial
investment of time and resources. Note that while DPPD can help
you identify, understand, and scale existing, locally-sourced
solutions, not every problem will lend itself to the DPPD method.

Problem Definition

The first step in this stage is to properly describe the problem and its
root causes. It is also important to define the target group of individuals,
communities, or geographic units that are impacted by the problem, as
well as the units that will be analyzed in that target group. Finally, it is
crucial to consider the desired outcome, which is what should be
achieved at the end of the intervention. Try to develop or validate each
of these components with people affected by the problem using Tool 1.1
at the end of this section.

Problem

Briefly describe the essence of the problem. This does not need to be long
and detailed but should give you an initial idea of where to look for
positive deviants.

Root causes

Describing the likely root causes of the problem will help you better
understand the problem, who would be considered positive deviants, and
what factors need to be controlled for when identifying them. For
example, if the root cause is drought, you need to identify positive
deviants from within groups that experience similar rainfall conditions and
that have similar access to water resources.

Keep in mind that the target group needs to be big enough to provide a
sufficiently large sample size (see Stage 3 for details), and it needs to be
in a location that is accessible to undertake the qualitative fieldwork in
Stage 3 of the DPPD method.

In the Ecuador deforestation project, the target group was the
farmers at the frontier of the Amazon forest, as they were the
ones harming the forest the most. In the Somalia rangeland
project, the West Golis region was the focus — it has the
majority of the pastoralist communities and sufficiently large
sample size with over 200 settlements across four administrative
regions mostly accessible for fieldwork.

Unit of analysis

The unit of analysis refers to the level at which you expect to find
positively-deviant solutions. They are the major entity within the target
group that is being analyzed. This could be individuals such as farmers,
groups such as clusters of farms, or even geographic units like villages.
While you don’t need to settle on the unit of analysis at the beginning, it is
important to reflect on it when determining the scope, as it will impact the
data sources you will be using later on.

In the Somalia rangelands project, the problem statement was
as follows: population growth, increased settlements, pressure
on natural resources, and recurring droughts all led to the
severe degradation of rangelands. This led to losses in livestock
numbers while threatening the sustainability of pastoral
livelihoods.

In the Somalia rangelands project, units of analysis were villages
with a 5 km buffer around their centers to represent the
average movement radius of livestock.

Desired outcome

Target group

The desired outcome is the state you want your target group to reach
after the intervention.

The target group is the group that will be included in the search for
positive deviants and their uncommon practices and strategies. It is
sometimes also referred to as the study population or the study sample
when it comes to the more analytical steps later on.

In the Somalia rangelands project, the desired outcome was
healthier rangelands that enable pastoralists to maintain and
enhance their livelihoods.

The nature of the problem

There is no single and exact way of answering the first of the two
questions. However, as a rule of thumb, consider this: If the problem
requires a technical solution, say building a road, constructing a dam, or
introducing a new IT system, the DPPD method will likely not be suitable.
The positive change you are aiming for is likely not related to a change in
practice or behavior.

If addressing the development challenge, however, (also) depends on a
change of practices or behavior, the DPPD method will likely make a
difference. It will allow you to identify and scale practices that can shift the
status quo. This applies to challenges in areas where the behaviors,
practices, and coping strategies of individuals or communities are key
determinants of success, such as health, nutrition, agriculture, or
education.

A note on engaging stakeholders:

It is important to involve stakeholders early on, ideally those
negatively impacted by the problem or with considerable stakes
involved in identifying and scaling practices. Understanding their
perspectives and securing their buy-in at the very beginning helps
develop a much stronger understanding of the problem, its
perceived causes, the community’s challenges and constraints, and
existing common practices and normative behaviors. It also makes
the adoption of positively-deviant practices much more likely
through increased ownership.

The team in Somalia met with government officials,
researchers, and members of agro-pastoral communities
to develop a more nuanced understanding of the
problem, the main drivers of rangeland degradation, and
what could be considered a positively-deviant community.

Suitability

The second step is to assess the suitability of the DPPD method. You
should ask yourself a simple question before moving forward: “Should I
be applying the DPPD method?” To help you answer this question, use
Tool 1.2 and consider these two secondary questions¹:

What is the nature of the development challenge I am trying to
address?
What is the likelihood that positive deviants exist?

¹ There are other criteria to take into account such as the buy-in and commitment of local leadership, but
we highlight these two here as they are specific to the Positive Deviance approach and the DPPD method.

27

28

The likelihood that positive deviants exist

The more likely the existence of positive deviants in the problem space you
are engaging in, the greater the chances are that you can identify them for
the particular challenge you are tackling. While you will not know for sure
at the beginning, you can at least get a sense by searching for signs of
positive deviance and grassroots solutions in other communities living in
comparable contexts and facing similar challenges. This should help you
determine the chances of finding positive deviants.

Note that this should not require significant time or resources. Talk to
people in your network who are familiar with the specific sector you are
focusing on or review academic and grey literature. You can also browse
existing collections of grassroots innovations like the Honey Bee Network’s
database² which contains more than one million ideas, innovations, and
traditional knowledge practices.

In the Ecuador cattle-farming project, the team learned from
agriculture experts that certain farmers adopt more sustainable
cattle ranching practices and deforest less than others. In
Somalia, the team learned through interviews with an officer
from the Ministry of Environment and Rural Development that a
positively-deviant community was protecting its trees from being
cut down or burned for charcoal production.

The suitability matrix

The PD suitability matrix (Figure 1) shows four quadrants that can be used
to judge how suitable Positive Deviance (PD) is, including the DPPD
method, for a particular problem. Problems for which PD is best suited
generally lie in the top right quadrant, where positive deviants are likely to
exist and where scaling their practices is likely to contribute to addressing
the challenge. Problems in the bottom left quadrant, where positive
deviants are unlikely to exist and where scaling practices will likely have a
limited impact on the challenge, are not suitable for PD.

Feasibility

The third step in the Problem-Method Fit Stage is to assess the feasibility
of applying the DPPD method. While many factors are involved, the two
most important ones are data and capabilities.

Data

The DPPD method leverages various data types from different sources.
Three broad categories of data are needed for the method to work:
outcome data, contextual data, and behavioral data.

Contextual data

Behavioral data

Outcome data

Outcome data

We refer to outcome data as data that can help directly or indirectly
measure the performance of the target group, given the desired outcome
— for example, crop yields for sustainable agriculture or food insecurity,
crime rates for public safety, or test scores for school performance. The
outcome data helps identify individuals, groups, or, more generally, units
within the target group that outperform their peers. The DPPD method
leverages the potential of readily available non-traditional data, like earth
observation data, online or mobile data, citizen-generated data, or sensor
data, to capture these outcomes.

In the agricultural project in Niger, villages that produced better
crop yields than others were identified using remote sensing
data, from which the team derived a vegetation index that
indicated the health of sorghum and pearl millet crops during
the rainy season.

Contextual data

A large portion of those factors should emerge from determining the root
causes when defining the problem. Contextual data helps put the outcome
measure in perspective, enabling the identification of positive deviants in
relation to their context — a relative rather than absolute approach.

Contextual data

Behavioral data

Outcome data

Identification of positive deviants (see Stage 2)

In the agricultural project in Niger, positively-deviant villages
were not identified simply based on their absolute vegetation
health values, but rather using relevant contextual factors that
would affect the yield of sorghum and pearl millet, such as
precipitation, climate, and soil. This prevented us from falsely
identifying a village as a positive deviant, simply because it had
more rainfall than others.

Behavioral data

Behavioral data is data that is collected during the fieldwork at Stage 3. It
fills the gap between the outcome data that shows certain units are
outperforming and the contextual data that only in part explains why they
are. What we refer to as behavioral data is essential information on the
uncommon practices and strategies of identified positive deviants.

Contextual data

Behavioral data

Outcome data

Contextual data allows controlling for factors that are likely to impact
performance but are not related to practices or behavior.

Understand underlying factors (see Stage 3)

31

32

In the Niger agricultural project, the team used a semi-
structured survey to uncover uncommon practices and strategies
of farmers, such as farming tools, techniques, and inputs in the
positively-deviant villages that were identified in the quantitative
data analysis (Stage 2).

Public vs non-public data
Data partnerships

Data readiness: availability, accessibility,
and adequacy

A number of conditions regarding data availability, accessibility, and
adequacy need to be met for DPPD to work. The questions presented in
Figure 2 and Tool 1.3 at the end of this section can help you assess
whether your data fulfills these conditions.

Availability

First, it is important to ensure there is a non-traditional data set that can
be used to capture the outcomes of the observed population (outcome
data). You will also need data to contextualize the findings to make sure
positive deviants are identified based on relative performance rather than
absolute performance (contextual data).

Search for suitable data and contact potential data providers, such as
government offices, telecom operators, research centers, and social media
data aggregators that might know of or hold this data. The data needs to
be granular enough for the envisaged unit of analysis and provide the
required spatial coverage of the envisaged study population and the
temporal coverage for the type of performance you have in mind.

Accessibility

Do you have access to
and are you allowed to
use the data?

Availability

Does the
relevant data
exist?

Adequacy

Is the data
adequate for your
intended use?

In the Ecuador cattle-farming project, the team tried to identify
cattle farmers who operate in areas of potential forest clearance
without deforesting themselves. Sufficient temporal coverage,
across several years was needed in the outcome data — a farm
could be a positive deviant one year but not in the following
years, as it may start to deforest heavily, turning it into a
“negative deviant.”

34

Accessibility

Check if you have access to the data sets in question and if you are allowed
to use them. If you need to use non-public data, having data access
agreements in place with data providers is a real asset³. It can take
significant time to negotiate the conditions of data access.

The cattle-farming project in Ecuador grew out of an existing
partnership between the UNDP ProAmazonia project and the
Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment. This made it possible to
access cattle vaccination data from the Ministry of Agriculture,
training datasets for land cover analysis through the Ministry of
Environment, and cadastral data as well as farm boundary data
from the national agricultural survey through ProAmazonia.

Adequacy

The data you are able to access and use should fit the scope of the project.
That means the know-how needed for the analysis should be attainable
and the choices of both data and skills should consider the project’s time
and budget limitations.

Achieving data adequacy can take several iterations between framing the
problem, scoping the project, and mapping the necessary and available
data until you find a fit. However, make sure you do not compromise the
initial purpose of the project. We suggest you start with a flexible framing
of the development challenge you want to address. This will allow you to
explore different data sources to capture the performance of the target
group.

In the Somalia rangelands project, the team pivoted from trying
to find drought-resilient pastoral communities, using their
livestock numbers as outcome data, to identifying them based
on their ability to sustain healthy rangelands, a necessary
condition for them to maintain their livestock. The livestock
numbers were very difficult to reliably derive from available data,
as this required extensive and complex analytical skills. On the
other hand, the rangeland health data was accessible and could
more easily be analyzed.

Capabilities

The capabilities needed to apply the DPPD method typically include local
knowledge, domain expertise, and a range of computational and analytics
skills. The questions presented in Figure 3 and Tool 1.4 at the end of this
section can help you assess whether your data fulfills these conditions.

Community resources, challenges, ongoing
interventions and normative behaviors

Local knowledge

The performance and underlying practices of potential positive deviants
need to be understood within the specific context they exist in. This
requires a multidimensional understanding of socioeconomic, cultural,
structural, and other factors that might affect the outcome and are very
much linked to the local conditions.

Domain expertise

Identifying positive deviants and controlling for potential confounding
variables requires the ability to select domain-relevant performance
indicators and contextual variables that can only be understood through
deep domain expertise.

Data skills

The DPPD method
includes the analysis of both quantitative and
qualitative data that requires respective skill sets. They range from
analyzing large digital data sets — which requires advanced computer
science skills — to collecting ethnographic data and observations about
positive deviant practices.

Try to have a data analyst on your team who is experienced in working
with non-traditional data from the particular sector or domain you are
addressing and who has knowledge of the different data sources that can
be used. You will also need someone who has experience in conducting
mixed-methods studies to collect and analyze the field data. As such a
combination of skills is rare for a single person, you might need to build a
multidisciplinary team.

38

Desirability

Key questions to ask here include:

The fourth step is to assess the risks and benefits (or the desirability) of
applying the DPPD method using Figure 4 and Tool 1.5 The PD approach
entails acknowledging the value of locally-sourced solutions, the agency
of the people you are working with, and respecting the right for positive
deviants to decide whether they want to share their practices or not.
Moreover, DPPD is about using data responsibly to minimize the risks
related to potentially sensitive data, especially when that data
is
personally identifiable.

As in every development intervention, if you think the outcome might
disadvantage or even harm the positive deviants, their communities, or
the wider systems they are embedded in, it is important to adjust the
project or to ultimately not move forward with it. Just because the DPPD
method is suitable and feasible does not mean it should be applied.

Unintended consequences

This section will guide you through the desirability assessment by helping
you identify potential unintended consequences of a DPPD intervention,
as well as potential risks related to data privacy and protection.

Positive deviants

When applying the DPPD method, you can generally assume that positive
deviants are not aware of their innovativeness and/or of the success of
their uncommon practices and strategies. In some cases, however, they
may be aware of this and may choose deliberately not to share their
strategies with others in their community.

For example, positive deviants might fear
losing their competitive
advantage over others or depleting a resource they alone are aware of, if
it were to be shared with others, making their solution unsustainable. It is
important to assess whether it is desirable for positive deviants to share
their practices with others. Note that this is less likely an issue where
cultural norms dictate against competitive strategies, such as child
malnutrition or health care, but it might be problematic in areas where
people more overtly compete with one another.

Is it generally safe to assume that it will be desirable to scale the
practice in question?
Are we endangering the competitive advantage of positive deviants by
sharing their practices and strategies with others?
Might we risk harming a positive deviant by revealing their identity?

Community

The individual positive deviant(s) might be supportive of the idea of
sharing their successful practices. However, you should also ask what the
likelihood is of these individuals or communities, who you intend to be at
the receiving end of accepting, adopting, and embracing such practices.

Another important question to ask is to what extent a successful practice
will really lead to positive effects in the long run. For instance, identifying
and scaling the practice of a positively-deviant pastoralist might lead to an
increase in pastoral activities and livestock numbers. However, over time
this might result in a shortage of grazing land, eventually leading to the
obsolescence of the positive practice. In other words, it is important to
consider the sustainability of PD practices.

Key questions to ask here include:

In the short term, are non-positive deviants likely to accept and adopt
the PD practice? Or might there be issues linked to limited capabilities
or cultural factors that will hinder such adoption?
In the longer term, will the adoption of the practices lead to
foreseeable negative effects?

Systems

While it may be difficult to go beyond the needs and aspirations of an
immediate community, it is also worth reflecting on potential negative
impacts on the environment, natural ecosystems, governmental and social
institutions, and other wider political, social, and economic systems, sub-
systems, and institutions.

39

40

In the Niger agricultural project, the team found that some
farmers left millet stalks on their land between agricultural
cycles, while others sold it to livestock farming communities.
Keeping it on the land protects the soil from wind erosion and
helps restore the organic matter, which contributed to higher
yields in the next cycle. This gave a competitive advantage in
crop production to the prior group of farmers. However, simply
scaling this practice to all farms might lead to a shortage of
fodder for livestock and pastoral communities. Hence, this might
lead to negative consequences for communities in the wider
system.

Key questions to ask here include:

What could be undesirable (or even harmful) outcomes for the
system(s) when scaling PD practices?
Is there a risk that wide adoption of a practice will lead to negative
consequences, beyond the positive deviants and the community/
target group?

Positive
Deviants

Have an advantage
over others

Data privacy

If you believe the DPPD method is suitable given the scope of your project,
and that you will have access to the necessary data and skills, it is still
important to think about the protection of privacy of individuals and
communities involved.

Key questions to ask here include:

Is the data source to be used of sensitive nature? (e.g. does it contain
personally identifiable information?)
Are safeguards in place for secure data access and processing?
Has consent been given (directly or indirectly) by the data subjects to
use their data?
To whom can the identity of positive deviants and non-positive
deviants be revealed, if at all?

Given the next stages involve the identification of positive deviants, such
questions must be thought through at this point. Below is a list of helpful
resources on the responsible use of data. The specific assessment to be
performed will depend on your project scope and the data envisaged for
the analysis.

Tool 1.2
Suitability Assessment

Use the tool below to describe what or who the positive deviants might
be, given your particular project scope. This will help you determine the
data sources you will need. Remember that in DPPD positive deviants can
be individuals, communities, or even administrative or geographic units.
Use the boxes below to develop an initial description of potential positive
deviant(s).

Who am I?

An individual, a group, or a geographical unit? Add other
attributes or demographics you can think of (e.g. age, gender,
socioeconomic status).

General Tips:

In some cases, there might be an agreed definition of who is
considered an outperformer. Check the academic literature!
Engage with people who might be aware of
communities who are adopting uncommon practices and strategies.
Talk to people working on the problem including sector experts,
government officials, or NGO staff.
If you have access to data on the performance of potential positive
deviants and easy access to data analysis skills, run a preliminary
analysis to understand the data distribution and to see if you can spot
any immediate outliers.

Tool 1.5
Desirability Assessment

Using the tool below, ask yourself whether it is desirable for a positive deviant, should you identify one, to share their practices with others. If so, would
the community be able and willing to adopt the practice and benefit from it? Might there be negative consequences on the (social) systems that the
positive deviant and the community are embedded in or connected with?

Positive Deviants

Communities (Target Group)

(Social) Systems

A positive deviant has an advantage over
others given their knowledge of and
application of PD practices. Sharing their
practice with others could endanger
their competitive advantage.

In the short term, non-positive deviants
might not accept, adopt, or embrace the
PD practice. In the long term, adoption
of the practice could lead to overall
negative effects.

The wide adoption of a common practice
could have negative consequences
beyond the positive deviants and the
community (e.g. on governmental and
social institutions, the natural
environment or political, social or
economic systems).

Potential
negative
consequences

A competitive advantage is more likely to
exist in areas where people, groups, or
units compete with one another, e.g. a
market with a limited number of sellers,
and less likely for non-competitive issues
(e.g. malnutrition, new-born health or
climate resilience).

Factors that hinder acceptance and
adoption of practices could be cultural
factors or limited capabilities. Long-term
negative effects could be overuse of
natural resources like overgrazing.

Scaling a particular practice could, for
example, result in increased air, water or
noise pollution.

Performance Measurement

Digital component

After defining the problem and ensuring the applicability of the Data
Powered Positive Deviance (DPPD) method comes the stage of looking
for the positive deviants. The first step of this stage is to establish a
strategy for measuring the performance of the units of analysis in your
target group. Essentially, those who will perform high on this measure
will be your positive deviants. Take the following requirements into
account:

The DPPD method derives the performance measure from non-traditional,
mostly digital data sources. These include mobile transaction data, remote
sensing data, social media data, citizen-generated data, among others.
Figure 5 provides an overview of useful digital data sources for the
seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). You can use the digital
data alone or in combination with other, more traditional data sources,
like census data or ground measurements.

can be used to help achieve the SDGs¹

development

Proxy validation

Much of the non-traditional data that can be used for performance
measurement is collected for other purposes. This means any insight into
your topic of interest will be indirect — you will seldom get a direct
measurement of the performance of your units of analysis. We use the
term proxy to define this level of indirection between what is observed in
data collected for a different purpose and the actual measure of the
phenomenon of interest. Beware that it is crucial to validate proxy
measures before using them widely. This usually requires a strong
correlation with ground truth data.

In the Indonesia agricultural project, the Enhanced Vegetation
Index (EVI)², a remotely sensed vegetation index, was used as a
proxy for crop yields. A number of studies³ have previously
validated the use of such remote sensing-derived vegetation
indices as good proxies for yields, so the team did not need to do
the validation themselves. However, had the proxy measure not
been previously validated, we would have to use statistical
methods to compare the direct and proxy measures⁴.

Desirable outcome

The performance measure should reliably capture the desired outcome
that is defined or validated by domain experts and, ideally, the target
group. As already mentioned in Stage 1, it is crucial to involve the
community in the framing of the problem, as they are directly confronted
with the problem and likely know what desired outcome they want. The
domain experts’ main role is then to help you identify and validate the
data sources you can use to capture this outcome. The desired outcome,
for example, could be farmers achieving healthier vegetation or livestock
farms with low deforestation rates.

! " #$%&’$ ($)(*)+ %$,(-#$ &. ’/$ (’,’$ &. 01,)’ /$,1’/ 2,($3 &) /&4 ’/$ 01,)’ #$.1$5’( 1*+/’ ,’ 5$#’,*)

In the Niger agricultural project, the team used the Soil Adjusted
Vegetation Index (SAVI)⁵, rather than the EVI used in Indonesia,
as an indicator of vegetation health and crop productivity,
following the advice of a local domain expert. She told them that
SAVI was more suitable for semi-arid areas like Niger, given that
it incorporated a soil brightness correction factor.

Multiple performance measures

Depending on how you define your desired outcome, you may have to
deal with one or multiple performance measures.

In the Mexico safe public spaces project, the team used three
performance measures related to crime severity. The first
labelled “Severity 1” was concerned with crimes that threatened
life and aimed to damage the physical and sexual integrity of
women. The second, “Severity 2,” was concerned with physical
and psycho-emotional violence that did not threaten life. The
third, “Severity 3,” was concerned with incidents where physical
violence did not occur, but which had a strong psycho-emotional
impact.

These categories were used to test whether it is possible to find different
positive deviants within and/or across multiple measures. This enabled
them to identify a set of positive deviants for “Severity 1,” the most severe
crimes such as femicide and rape, and another set of positive deviants for
“Severity 3,” the less severe crimes such as robbery to passerby without
violence. This way, it might be possible to identify distinctive factors that
are conducive to more or less severe types of crimes when they conduct
fieldwork.

Dealing with multiple performance measures

Statistical techniques can be used to summarize multiple
performance measures into a single index or fewer measures⁶. The
simplest way is to develop a weighted average⁷ applied directly to
the standardized performance measures, forming a single weighted
average across all types of measures, but this would require you to
determine the weight (importance) of each measure.

Another more complex technique is principal component analysis⁸
which replaces the original set of measures with a smaller number
of uncorrelated measures that account for most of the information
in the original set. The new set of measures are referred to as
components. You can decide to use the first component or the first
two or more components based on the amount of variance they
were able to explain.

Homogeneous Grouping

The second step of Stage 2 is concerned with dividing the target group
into homogeneous groups (or clusters) that share a common set of
structural factors (e.g. climate, socioeconomic conditions, or geographic
proximity). You want to identify Positive Deviance (PD) related to
particular practices and behaviors that can be transferred, not to in-
group “structural” attributes. In other words, we want to find the units
of analysis that perform better in similar circumstances.

To do the homogeneous grouping, you need to determine a set of
variables that define the different contexts of your target groups. Check
Tool 2.1 in the tools section which can help you map out the different
variables that will be used in this stage.

In the Indonesia agricultural project, biophysical factors such as
rain and temperature were used to do the homogeneous
grouping. The team identified these variables by following the
results of both theoretical and empirical research, as well as
common sense, that showed they had a significant impact on the
outcome measure.

Why is clustering important?

A number of studies⁹ have demonstrated how clustering a
population into homogeneous groups can improve predictions in
the later steps of this stage, where you will try to identify and
understand positive deviants within each cluster. This is because
you will not need to build models that explain the natural variation
between clusters. You will only have to focus on within-cluster
variations, which generally increase the model’s performance in
prediction. Additionally, findings can be extrapolated with more
confidence because more detailed and localized information can be
extracted from homogenous groups because they share similar
conditions.

intuition, or

Moving from this set of structural variables to homogeneous groups
requires some form of clustering. This can be done manually, based on
professional experience and
it can be done through
unsupervised machine learning techniques such as cluster analysis¹⁰.
Cluster analysis is a way of grouping, or clustering, units in relation to
certain variables. In your case, these will be the structural variables. The
prime objective of cluster analysis is to identify clusters that are internally
homogeneous and heterogeneous between them. In other words, the
point is to minimize the variance of structural factors within homogeneous
groups and to maximize the variance between the groups.

Figure 6 is an illustrative example of clustering observations according to
two variables: income and age. There are four main clusters. Each cluster
represents individuals that fall into similar age and income groups, each
individual being closer to others in the same group than to others in other
groups. You might also be able to find predetermined homogeneous
groups or clusters that you can reuse for your DPPD project.

In the Niger agricultural project, the team found a map¹²
developed by the Adapt’Action Facility that divided Niger into
agro-ecological zones with similar biophysical, ecological, and
climatic conditions (Figure 7). The team decided to use these
zones instead of creating their own since they took into account
valuable local and contextual information they could not get
access to.

Additional methods for clustering

The COVID-19 pilot in Germany used
yet another strategy to ensure fair
comparisons between homologues.
Instead of sorting every district into
a static set of clusters, each district
was assigned its own group of peer
districts, based on the euclidean
in the geometric space
distance
defined by
structural
factors. The districts’ raw deviances
were then standardized relative to
each individual district’s peer group,
by subtracting the peer group’s
mean and dividing by its standard
deviation.

relevant

These means and standard deviations were calculated with
the focal district included. (red: focal district, blue: included in
peer group, grey: not included).

Univariate analysis

Only one variable, the performance measure, is used to identify positive
deviants. This variable can be categorical (i.e. pass/fail, win/lose, or
healthy/sick) or continuous. If it is categorical, then positive deviants are
simply those who succeed when a majority of others fail. If the
performance measure is continuous, then the way to identify positive
deviants depends on the distribution of performance within homogeneous
groups. If performance can be assumed to follow a normal distribution,
then positive deviants are those who lie at the extreme high end of the
distribution. In this case, a typical cut-off point can be two standard
deviations from the mean. If no assumption of normality can be made
about the distribution of performance, different types of extreme value
analysis can be used. These generally deal with extreme deviations from
the median.

Proximity-based models can also be used. These define outliers as
observations that are far from dense clusters in the data. For example,
clustering methods like K Means, segment the data into clusters, and
positive deviants can be defined as observations that lie far away from
important clusters¹³. Similarly, the Interquartile Range (IQR) method
segments the data into quartiles, and positive deviants can be defined as
observations that lie beyond 1.5*IQR¹⁴.

In the Egypt research publication case study, positive deviants in
each citation metric were identified using the IQR. Researchers
who had citation metrics scores that are beyond 1.5*IQR were
considered positive deviants.

Positive Deviant Identification

Multivariate analysis

The third step of this stage consists of identifying outliers, your positive
deviants, within each homogeneous group. This requires defining the
techniques and cut-off points that distinguish positive deviants from
non-positive deviants. Depending on your performance measure, which
we refer to here as the dependent variable, there can be several ways to
do this.

Multiple variables are needed to confidently identify positive deviants. In
addition to the performance measure, these variables usually account for
contextual variations among units of analysis that belong to the same
homogeneous group — they need to be controlled for (i.e. to reduce their
effect). Here you will typically model the performance measure (dependent
variable) as a function of the structural factors (independent variable).

3126244

63

64

If the performance measure is categorical, then positive deviants can be
identified using probabilistic models like a logistic regression in which they
are “false negatives,” observations that, based on the independent
variables, are expected to fail but, in fact, succeeded.

If the performance measure is continuous, then positive deviants can be
identified through other types of regression analysis. The models obtained
can be used to predict the performance of the units of observation, and
this prediction can be compared to the actual, observed performance. The
“error” that distinguishes predicted from observed can then be run
through an extreme-value analysis to identify positive deviants.

In the Ecuador cattle-farming project, the team developed a
model that predicted farm deforestation rates as a function of
farm cattle density, size, soil adaptability, and type of land use.
Positively-deviant farms were then identified using the residual
values, the difference between predicted and observed
deforestation rates. In the Germany COVID-19 project, the team
predicted weekly reproduction factors using prior infection
spread, mobility, and weather. These weekly values were then
compared to the weekly observed reproduction rates, yielding
weekly deviances. After peer-group standardization based on the
groups they belong to, positively-deviant districts were identified
as the top three districts with the highest average deviance
across one of two study timeframes.

A posteriori expectation

The cutoff for PD is already established or known and a posteriori
expectation of an outcome exists. Here, positive deviants exceed this with
some level of magnitude. For instance, according to the International
Union for Conservation of Nature, species under threat are defined as
some level of decline for three generations or over 30 years. A positive
deviant, in this case, would be a population of a species whose size is
increasing or stable for three generations or more when the species as a
whole is declining rapidly.

Exceptional responders

Exceptional responders are units that respond better to interventions than
what was expected at the onset. An example would be an intervention to
protect forests. Forest cover could be measured both inside and outside a
protected area. The difference between the inside and outside can be used
to generate an average expected effect of protection and positive deviants
would be the protected areas significantly exceeding the expected effect.

This can be done using the difference in differences method where positive
deviants would be the units having the largest difference in differences¹⁵.
Understanding positive deviants as exceptional responders can be
to exploring why certain
particularly
communities responded better to an intervention than others and which
underlying factors contributed to this “better response.” This could then be
used to inform the design of future interventions.

Exceptional responders in tiger conservation

This study¹⁶ evaluated the effectiveness of tiger reserves within
India using the PD approach. The opinions of three tiger experts
were used to generate a list of seven tiger reserves classified as
successful (or exceptional responders) and five reserves as failures.
Expert opinion was also used to identify any key individuals that
garnered widespread support for tiger conservation at any of the
identified reserves. They found two uncommon insights:

Tiger conservation success is achievable even within a densely
populated human landscape where a high percentage of the
population is involved in agriculture
The presence of ‘‘conservation champions’’ can dramatically
affect the performance of individual reserves and have positive
outcomes for tiger conservation

Positive Deviant Validation

The last step of this stage consists of initial validation of the potential
positive deviants you identified. While field research is necessary for full
confirmation of their deviance, there are intermediate ways to validate
whether observed deviance in the data is simply due to random noise or
whether it is based on actual signals of outperformance. Here are
several ways to do so.

Time series analysis

In the Indonesia agricultural project¹⁷, the team conducted a
time-series analysis to see whether the performance of rice
farming villages was independent of climatic patterns. They
developed a model to predict the EVI at the village level as a
function of precipitation and temperature in 2013, where they
used historic climate and EVI data from 2000 to 2012 to train the
model. The observed performance of positively-deviant villages
was significantly higher than the observed performance of non-
positively-deviant villages. This implied that outlier villages had
likely adopted specific approaches and practices that others had
not, and had established production systems that delinked
climatic patterns and productivity. This provided an initial
validation of them being potential positive deviants.

Evaluate the performance of positive deviants over time and check whether
they consistently outperform their peers. The timeframe will vary according
to the focus of the project, and selecting it can require expert opinion.

Local knowledge

Reach out to community leaders, government officials, local domain
experts, and development practitioners who are engaged in activities,
projects, or services related to the targeted areas before doing the field
research. Sharing with them the initial set of potential positive deviants can
lead to possible explanations for outperformance that may have been
overlooked, and could bias the results without reflecting the actual
practices you are interested in. Explanations such as the existence of
development
(i.e. external
support) or having better access to resources, like irrigation points.

interventions

Triangulating different data sources

Check whether possible predictors of PD can be identified through official
statistical data, like a census or survey, or other sources of data, such as
high-resolution imagery, covering the targeted areas. Although the PD
approach is mainly concerned with identifying grassroots practices, which
are seldom captured through such data, some higher-level management
practices can be distinguished. If their association with positively-deviant
units is in accordance with existing literature and local knowledge, this can
count as means of validation in itself.

In the Somalia rangeland project, the use of the remote sensing
datasets was complemented by the use of open-source, high-
resolution imagery available from Google Earth for pre-fieldwork
visual inspection. The imagery was used to rule out false-positive
deviants whose vegetation scores were inflated by interventions
(e.g. government reserves), and to look for early signs of pastoral
and agro-pastoral activities, visible soil and conservation
techniques, and other rangeland management practices.
Through this remote inspection, the team identified patterns
indicating
the existence of soil and water conservation
techniques at a number of potential positively-deviant
communities. Figure 8 presents some of those interventions.

Similarly, in Niger, where the team was looking for positive
deviants cultivating purely rain-fed crops, they visually inspected
all potential positive deviants. They excluded those that were
close to river basins, as these are a source for irrigation and thus
crops were not purely rain-fed.

Different techniques for outlier identification

Experiment with various methods for outlier detection (e.g. regression vs.
neural networks, univariate vs. multivariate) to see if there are outliers that
persistently appear across the different methods.

In the Ecuador cattle-farming project, the team modelled
deforestation rates using yearly predictors and inter-annual
variations in predictors. When doing the fieldwork, priority was
given to positive deviants identified across multiple approaches.

Tool 2.1:
Variable Mapping

This tool will help you in mapping out all the possible control and
independent variables in order to select the most suitable variables for
the homogeneous grouping and the positive deviant identification steps
of Stage 2 and the positive deviants' characterization step of Stage 3.

The X-axis shows to what extent a variable is behavioral and could be
transferable, at the level of the individual or community. The further to
the right, the more effective it is to recommend this practice, strategy or
behavior to other members belonging to the same homogeneous group.

The Y-axis shows to what extent the independent variable is structural or
supra-individual (i.e. above the level of the individual). The more supra-
individual (structural) and less transferable the variable is, the more
suitable for homogeneous grouping it becomes; the less structural and
more transferable a variable is, the more suitable it becomes for
characterizing positive deviants and understanding their underlying
behaviors.

Using the guidance provided below you will be able to categorize and map
the study variables into four main types:

Homogeneous grouping: Factors beyond the control of individuals
that can influence the outcomes of the target group, and at the same
time they cannot be changed e.g. rain.

PD identification: Individual-level factors that can influence the
outcomes of the target group, and at the same time they cannot be
changed. Those variables should be controlled for when identifying
positive deviants within each homogeneous group or cluster e.g.
socio-economic status.

PD characterisation (Supra-individual): Factors beyond the control of
individuals that can influence the outcomes of the target group but
can be transferred to peer communities e.g. policies.

PD characterisation (Individual): Individual-level factors that can
influence the outcomes of the target group and can be changed and
transferred e.g. soil and water conservation techniques.

Fieldwork Planning

By now, you should have identified a list of potential positive deviants.
In the first step of Stage 3, you will prepare all the instruments
necessary for conducting the fieldwork for the Positive Deviance (PD)
inquiry.

The goal of the fieldwork is twofold:

We recommend discussing your conceptual framework with relevant
stakeholders and the colleagues who were involved in the previous
quantitative stage to make sure you did not miss anything, such as the
control variables that were used in positive deviant identification that
might require validation.

Study design

To validate if the potential positive deviants are indeed true positive
deviants
To uncover the underlying factors responsible for their deviance

You should expect to consult with a variety of stakeholders, all of whom
should have something to do with your performance measure. Consider
a stakeholder anyone who has an indirect or direct relationship with
your units of analysis and could be part of the problem or the solution.
Start by asking yourself who these stakeholders are. Get familiar with
their social and cultural environment, and keep them in mind when
approaching them. For further guidance check Tool 3.1 in the tools
section.

After mapping out the different stakeholders, ask yourself how you are
going to collect the information you need to validate your positive deviants
and uncover the underlying factors of their deviance. There are generally
two approaches: a qualitative approach (e.g. interviews) and a quantitative
approach (e.g. surveys). But you can also use a mix of both (i.e. mixed-
methods). The data collection section presents the methods you can use
for each of the approaches. We generally encourage a mixed-methods
approach. It enables you to first gain highly specific and valuable insights
from a small, information-rich sample of positive deviants. These will help
you generate hypotheses about the individual, cultural, social, and
structural factors that are likely to influence deviance, which you will
validate through more structured investigations with a larger sample
including both positive deviants and non-positive deviants.

In the Ecuador cattle-farming pilot, the unit of analysis was
cattle-raising farms. The field inquiry targeted farm owners,
workers, families, farmer associations, and community leaders.

Conceptual framework

Before developing your data collection tools, it is important to read any
background literature and understand the conceptual frameworks that
others may have developed and used when investigating similar topics.
Are there any dominant theories or models that are used? Are there any
approaches or variables that have not yet been taken but which you or any
of the stakeholders think could add something new? Can you combine
elements of different approaches which could help you better understand
your positive deviants? Look for frameworks that are based on a thorough
understanding of the studied topic and are aligned with existing literature.

Figure 9 proposes a mixed-methods study design. Note, however, that in
cases where you only have a small number of potential positive deviants,
or where you only have limited resources to conduct large-scale surveys,
you may prefer an entirely qualitative approach. Conversely, when doing
retrospective studies using secondary data sources, or when it is difficult
to have face-to-face engagements with stakeholders, you may prefer an
entirely quantitative approach.

In the Egypt research publication case study, positively-deviant
researchers were first interviewed to generate hypotheses
about the basis for their performance. Quantitative data was
then collected from both positive deviants and non-positive
deviants to validate those hypotheses, and to identify
significant differences between both groups².

Step 1:
Gather data from positive deviants

Step 2:
Look for patterns

Step 3:
Hypothesis generation

A social phenomenon is
observed. In our case, this social
phenomenon will be PD and we
are going to focus on observing
and collecting data from positive
deviants and relevant
stakeholders using qualitative
approaches.

Inductive
Reasoning

After collecting the data and
observations, step back and
get a bird's eye view of the
data in search of patterns.

Infer tentative hypothesis
and potential PD
explanators from this data
which will be validated
through deductive
reasoning.

Use the hypothesis generated
from the inductive reasoning
together with established
theories from prior research to
develop the quantitative data
collection tools.

Collect data from positive
deviants and non-positive
deviants to compare both
groups. You can also use
digital data sources to
generate and test additional
predictors of performance.

Analyse the collected
data to identify
significant predictors of
positively-deviant
performance.

Reasoning

Step 4:
Hypothesis

Step 5:
Collect data from (non)-
positive deviants

Step 6:
Test hypothesis

Note that the first step of Figure 9 could include non-positive deviants to
establish an understanding of the population’s normative and common
behavior before interviewing positive deviants. This could make it easier to
identify uncommon practices and strategies among positive deviants.

Sampling

When doing qualitative and quantitative data collection, it is important to
properly determine your sample size. Unfortunately, there is no golden
rule for this. For the qualitative investigation, it is a good idea to start with
20-30³ units and to grow your sample size if necessary until you reach data
saturation⁴. For the quantitative data collection, you can target a sample
size of around 100 units for each major sub-group (i.e. non-positive
deviants) in the population, and between 20 to 50 units for each minor
sub-group (i.e positive deviants)⁵.

Sampling tools

There are tools⁶ that suggest the ideal sample size based on the
confidence level, confidence interval, and the population size.
However, such tools should be used with caution, as they enable
inferences on entire populations, not subgroups within the
population. That said, for comparing the prevalence of certain
practices between two groups, positive and non-positive deviants,
there are also case-specific sample size tables that can be used, as
shown in this guide⁷.

It is also important to ensure diversity in the selection of the sample units
— make sure your sample covers the different attributes of the units that
are being analyzed.

In the Ecuador pilot, a convenience sampling was carried out
that achieved diversity in the farms’ animal load, pasture (%),
forest (% and ha), poverty level (index), access to roads, and
proximity to the main city. The team used a qualitative study
design in which the key informants were farm owners or those in
charge of the farm.

Things to consider

Concept communication

What message do you want to bring along? Why would your target group
be willing to achieve the desired outcome? How would they benefit from
applying the positively-deviant practices? Think of a narrative that will
encourage communities to engage.

Incentive model

When conducting a quantitative investigation, you might face the problem
of getting enough responses. Think of ways to encourage respondents to
fill out your survey without having a negative impact on the data quality.
For example, consider getting approbation through community leaders.
Convincing people who are influential in the community to participate in
the study can incentivize other community members to participate.

Gatekeeper

Data Collection

In the second step of Stage 3, you will collect the data needed to identify
factors that favor PD. While the conventional PD approach focuses
mainly on individual-level factors, the Data Powered Positive Deviance
(DPPD) method enables you to take a more systemic lens that also
considers structural-level factors like infrastructure, public policies, or
social dynamics. This should help you gain a more comprehensive
understanding of the complex forces at play behind positively-deviant
practices or solutions.

It is important to design your data collection instruments in such a way
as to capture this mix of both individual and structural factors. There are
several methods you can use, and the choice of participants to include in
each method depends on your study design. If you follow a mixed-
methods approach, as recommended in the previous step, you should
include positive deviants in the initial qualitative data collection. In the
following quantitative data collection, you should include the larger
target group (having both positive and non-positive deviants). If you
follow either an entirely qualitative or an entirely quantitative approach,
include both positive and non-positive deviants
you
simultaneously. Some of the qualitative and quantitative methods that
can be used for the data collection are outlined below.

should

Somewhat related to the previous point, are there individuals or entities
who could act as shortcuts to interviewees and respondents?

Qualitative methods

Ethical considerations

The PD inquiry is based on a deep respect for the community, its members,
and its culture and focuses on interactive engagement and the capacity to
let the community lead. Make sure you take that into account when you
reach out to communities. Who will collect the data and how? Will the data
expose stakeholders to potential harm? How might you mitigate the risks?
For further guidance check Tool 3.2 in the tools section.

Resources
What resources do you have (financial, time, and personnel) for reaching
out to communities? And for collecting and analyzing the data you will
gather? Reflect on how this might affect your choice of study design and
research methods.

The main benefit of qualitative methods is that the information you gather
is richer, and therefore it generally provides deeper insights into the
phenomenon you are investigating. It might also help you understand the
interaction between relevant factors. Examples of common qualitative
methods include:

Individual interviews: Interview your positive deviants to identify any
uncommon attributes, attitudes, and/or practices that might
distinguish them from non-positive deviants
Focus group discussions: Have a collective discussion with a group of
positive and non-positive deviants
Observations: Observe positive deviants’ practices closely to
understand what they do and how they do it

83

Employing DADs in the PD approach

This study⁹ used PD in the control of healthcare-associated
infections (HAIs) due to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA) in a Colombian hospital with the aim of reducing HAI rates
through a cultural change in processes. They used DADs in the
presence of a facilitator, a group of around eight positive deviants
and other non-positively deviant participants to discuss the
identified problem and how barriers may be overcome to find a
solution. The group made proposals and commitments and
identified specific actions to be taken forward as interventions. The
most feasible and low-cost economic proposals were selected for
implementation.

In the Ecuador cattle-farming project, 19 farmers — 9 positive
deviants and 10 non-positive deviants — were interviewed at
their farms. The interview schedules contained closed-ended
questions and observational checklists to capture contextual,
demographic, and socioeconomic variables, in addition to
variables derived from the conceptual framework. Open-ended
questions were also asked to uncover uncommon strategies,
attitudes, and practices that positive deviants may have by
comparing them with those of non-positive deviants.

Community-based participatory research

Community-based participatory research is also commonly used in the
conventional PD approach, as it recognizes the importance of including
community stakeholders in the different steps of the PD inquiry. Practice
shows this
increases
knowledge, and changes attitudes. The researcher or practitioner acts as a
facilitator who creates a space for the community to elicit and share
knowledge from and for action. Examples of common participatory tools
include:

involvement mobilizes people, creates buy-in,

Discovery and action dialogues

This type of dialogue is central to the PD approach which focuses on the
solution rather than the problem⁸. The aim of this method is to ensure that
in the presence of a facilitator, people in the group, unit, or community
elicit by themselves the positively-deviant practices. The dialogues also
create favourable conditions for stimulating participants’ creativity in
spaces where they can feel safe to invent new and more effective
practices. Resistance to change diminishes as participants are given the
freedom to choose the practices they will try out and the problems they
will tackle. Further, social proof increases the likelihood that solutions will
be adopted. The discovery and action dialogues (DADs) make it possible to
achieve frontline ownership of solutions. It acts as a tool that does both,
discovering positively-deviant practices and mobilizing communities to
take action.

Participatory sketching

Data-driven participatory approaches

Participatory sketching is a method of collective drawing employed to
obtain enriched narratives. Participants are divided into subgroups that
jointly draw a sketch that describes what they envision as good practice or
an ideal model in a physical space. It is mainly used when visual aids are
required to identify positively-deviant practices. Sketches are then shared
and discussed with the entire group. This study¹⁰ used PD to inform the
design of an anti-triatomine prototype house by identifying knowledge,
attitudes and practices used by families that have remained triatomine-
free. In this study, participants were divided into subgroups to jointly draw
a sketch describing what they envision as a healthy environment at home
in intra and peridomestic areas. Sketches were then presented to the
entire group.

Photo elicitation

Photo elicitation is a method used in visual anthropology that introduces
pictures to elicit comments. Pictures taken during the interviews with
positive deviants are presented to focus groups and participants are asked
to reflect on the captured practices and solutions.

Community mapping

Community mapping describes a process where the community gets
together to map their own assets, values, beliefs, spatial units of interest,
or any other self-selected variable¹¹. This method is about mapping “by the
informal processes.
community for the community, using relatively
Community mapping has been used to
identify positively-deviant
households, the location of a community’s resources and infrastructures,
or where the most vulnerable families in a community live. The method
can also be used to better understand and identify spatial factors
contributing to the observed deviance.

These include methods that engage community members in interpreting
the data that were collected about them (in Stage 2) to encourage
dialogue and debate around the challenges they face and possible means
to address them. This shifts community members from a passive role of
producers of data to an active role of investigators¹².

General tips for qualitative methods

During the PD inquiry stage, focus on what positive deviants do
and also on how and why they do it.
Interview potential positive deviants as well as others around
them, anyone who might have an influence on the deviance
(community members, family members, community leaders).
Usually, interviews and focus group discussions are conducted in
parallel. The themes uncovered in the focus groups can then
help orient the interviews.
Focus groups and participatory activities should include between
6 and 10 people, as smaller groups may limit the amount of
information collected, and more may make it difficult for all
participants to participate and interact. Bigger groups will also
make it harder for the interviewer/facilitator to make sense of
the information gathered.
Focus groups are better suited when you have limited resources
(time, manpower, money). Greater insights might be developed
from the group dynamics, and the phenomena being researched
requires a collective discussion in order to understand the
circumstances, behaviors, or opinions.

Quantitative methods

The main benefit of quantitative methods is that the data you collect can
be analyzed statistically. Such methods are generally used to test
hypotheses, so it is important to identify a suitable conceptual framework
that incorporates the hypothesis generated from the qualitative inquiry, in
addition to established theories in the literature that might explain the
investigated phenomenon. You will use the framework as the basis for
questionnaire development. Examples of common quantitative methods
include:

Surveys: Collect structured data from both positive and non-positive
deviants to identify statistically significant differences between both
groups.
Observation checklists: Lists of things that the observer will look at
when observing positive and non-positive deviants.

The nature of the DPPD method, which leverages digital data in the PD
approach, provides an opportunity to use such data, not just for positive
deviant
identification but also for understanding their underlying
behaviors and practices. While this is not possible in most cases, it is still
important to ask, “Are there digital traces that can shed light on positively-
deviant behaviors and practices?”

In the Egypt research performance case¹³, which looks into
outperforming positively-deviant researchers in a resource-
constrained country, the publications of those researchers were
analyzed to identify paper extrinsic features (e.g. a number of
pages), intrinsic features (e.g. topics covered), and publication
outlets (e.g. where do they publish their research) that could
shed light on their publication strategies and tactics.

General tips for quantitative methods

Before you build tools from scratch, always look for existing
questionnaires, checklists, or tests that can be adapted to your
specific investigation.
Tools should always begin with an introduction outlining the
purpose of the data, collection efforts, the ethical norms that
govern the use of the tool and the data collected, and how the
data will be used.
Before you use the tool, make sure to follow these steps:

a) Translate the tool into any local languages required
b) Train researchers and test the tool
c) Revise and finalize your tool based on the results of your
testing
d) Plan for implementation and data management

Keep it short and simple.

Data Analysis

The main goal of this step is to identify significant attributes of positive
deviants. The data analysis techniques you use will depend on your
study design and whether you have used a qualitative approach, a
quantitative approach, or a mixed-methods approach. Specific analytical
techniques for each approach are outlined below.

Qualitative data analysis

Thematic analysis

This type of analysis starts with a verbatim transcription of all recorded
interviews and focus group materials. The transcriptions are then
analyzed to identify themes that capture recurring patterns in attributes,
attitudes, practices, and strategies of positive deviants¹⁴. You can also
bring a quantitative lens to this kind of qualitative data through open and
closed coding processes. Through these, you either use an existing
codification of topics and themes or create your own before coding your
transcriptions and counting the number of times different themes appear
across the two groups of positive deviants and non-positive deviants.

In a mixed-methods approach, the themes identified are used to develop
a survey instrument that is grounded in the views of the participants. Its
main objective is to validate the qualitative findings (uncommon factors
that contribute to positive deviance) using a large, representative sample
of the population.

In the Ecuador cattle farming project, the team conducted a
thematic analysis of interviews using the Dedoose software¹⁵ t o
identify differences between positively-deviant and non-
positively-deviant farms.

The central themes that emerged included the typology of the
farm, farmer characteristics, farm characteristics, enablers and
barriers of deforestation, attitudes towards conservation,
practices and innovations.

Positive deviance accessibility sieve

In this case, findings from interviews with positive deviants are presented
to a large group of non-positive deviants, where potential uncommon
practices are presented one by one to the entire group. Participants are
then asked to point out those that are known to them by a show of hands.
This method is mainly used to uncover the distinguishing practices and
behaviors of positive deviants. Photo elicitation can also be used here.

Accessibility sieve in action

This study¹⁶ used PD to improve student clinical performance. They
employed the PD accessibility sieve to identify behaviors that were
truly uncommon but replicable. Here, individual in-depth interviews
were first conducted with 20 positively-deviant students who were
asked what they thought were the reasons for their good
performance. The transcribed responses were then analyzed to list
potential behavioral predictors of their outperformance.

In a large group session with the entire batch of students, these
behavioral predictors were displayed one by one to the students,
and they were asked to point out behaviors that were common to
many other students by a show of hands. A list of behaviors was
compiled, eliminating those behaviors that were voted to be
common for the batch; behaviors of seven students were found to
be truly novel.

Regression analysis

(dependent variable) and the

This analysis is used to examine the relationship between the captured
performance measure
independent
variables. Regression analysis enables you to estimate the effect of each
independent variable on the dependent variable while holding all the
other independent variables constant. In this stage, the independent
variables will include both the structural variables used in the positive
deviant identification step and the sociodemographic and behavioral
variables captured in the data collection step. For each homogeneous
group, you will have a separate model to identify significant predictors of
performance that are relevant to the respective group.

Cluster-then-predict

You might consider regressing the performance measure using
different subsets of the independent variables. For example,
modeling the performance measure as a function of structural
variables that are beyond the level of individuals, modeling
separately behavioral predictors of performance, then creating a full
model containing both subsets.

This way you might be able to understand the effect of each subset
of variables separately which could guide the design of the
interventions. If structural variables have more influence, then you
might consider a systematic policy-focused intervention. If the
behavioral variables stand out then you should consider a
community-focused intervention. If both have significant effects,
then you should consider an intervention combining both.

Quantitative data analysis

Descriptive statistics

These are used as a first step to quickly compare results from different
groups: positive deviants, non-positive deviants, average performers, or
negative deviants. This provides a basic overview of the data (e.g. mean,
standard deviation, min and max).

Inferential statistical tests

They are used to identify significant differences between the means of the
analyzed groups for each variable using statistical tests like student t-test,
Mann Whitney, and Fisher exact test when comparing two groups and
tests like ANOVA, Kruskal–Wallis and Chi-square when comparing three or
more groups (e.g. PDs, average performers, and NDs)¹⁷.

Scaling

Following the same logic as the conventional
Positive Deviance approach, these interventions are
designed to enable people to share, learn, and
practice the identified positively-deviant strategies
and practices

These interventions make use of the insights
generated from the contextual data analysis to
inform interventions beyond the replication of
individual practices

Scaling in the DPPD context can take on different
forms. Community interventions will mostly seek to
scale-out positively-deviant practices to reach
greater numbers of people. Policy interventions
would rely on scaling up to impact policy and laws
or scaling local conditions to improve infrastructure

Scaling of solutions can be done in at least two different ways. The first
is what we refer to as community interventions that focus on activities
that enable members of the community to apply the behaviors and
strategies of positive deviants. The second seeks to use the contextual
insights generated to design what we broadly refer to as policy
interventions. The process of designing and implementing interventions
as part of the application of the Data Powered Positive Deviance (DPPD)
method is yet to be fully explored and tested in the pilots, but initial

follow established principles like "Leave No One Behind" and that every
organization will have its own frameworks and protocols of how to
design and implement interventions.

Community Interventions

Designing and implementing DPPD community interventions follows the
logic of the conventional Positive Deviance (PD) approach described in
the Positive Deviance Handbook¹. It includes a number of activities to
enable people to share, learn, and practice the behaviors and strategies
identified in Stage 3. Reflecting on our DPPD pilot projects, this could
include farmers sharing their agricultural practices on cultivating
rainfed cereal crops in the South of Niger or cattle breeders in Ecuador
helping their peers reduce their deforestation imprint.

Things to consider

It is crucial for positive deviants and the community to be at the center
of, and closely involved, in every step of the process. Participatory
design offers a range of practical methods and tools² to enable the
active participation of those who have developed and own a given
solution (the positive deviant), those who stand to benefit from adopting
a positively-deviant practice (the non-positive deviant or members of the
community), as well as those who might have influence over the design
and implementation process.

While the list of suitable methods and tools is long and ranges from co-
design workshops and living labs to focus groups and usability testing,
there is no single right way of going about the design and implementation
of activities. Here are some suggestions on how to enable active and
meaningful participation throughout the process:

Further refine and contextualize the understanding of positively-
deviant practices together with one or several positive deviants.
Jointly develop a plan of action to support members of the community
in adopting the practices. Do not design interventions that simply tell
people about them. The point is not to transfer knowledge but to
encourage a change in practices. Try instead to design your
interventions in a way that will enable those who are not positive
deviants to access and act upon the practices and strategies of positive
deviants (the discovery and action dialogues presented in Stage 3
could be a useful technique).

"It’s easier to act your way into a new way of thinking, than to think your
way into a new way of acting”.

Millard Fuller

Collectively generate activities to enable the adoption of positively-
deviant practices. Encourage and enable the people who discovered
the deviations to spread the word in their groups or homologues. Note
that the scaling of positively-deviant practices and strategies should be
done for each homogeneous group separately (clusters created in
Stage 2). In other words, practices identified within a certain cluster
should be amplified and scaled only within this cluster because this is
where they are relevant.

101

102

While the process mainly relies on the qualitative insights generated about
positively-deviant practices from the inquiry stage, you might also want to
consider sharing (some of) the quantitative data collected, generated, and
analyzed in the previous stages for people to generate their own insights
and draw their own conclusions. Doing so might require training or
targeted guidance by someone with the necessary technical skills, but it
could allow you to go from having a one-way conversation informing
people about the conclusions drawn from the data to a collective process
of analysis, discovery, and discussion. The Data Zetu Shareback Sessions³
along with other data empowerment-based interventions⁴ could be drawn
upon in the design of such activities.

Policy Interventions

The DPPD method employs a wide range of data, both traditional and
non-traditional as well as quantitative and qualitative. Using what we
referred to in Stage 1 as behavioral data, we can capture the factors
within the control of individuals. But we can also learn about external
factors that are beyond the control of individuals by using the insights
generated from contextual data. The DPPD method might therefore not
only allow us to identify positively-deviant practices of individuals or
groups, but also provide a better understanding of factors that are
beyond individual practices, but which enable, facilitate, or support a
positively-deviant practice. Understanding these structural or supra-
individual factors and their interactions with behavioral factors can
inform the design of nuanced interventions and thereby increase their
effectiveness and contextual fit.

Policy interventions should set the “rules of the game” and
clarify what the right use of the land should be through a
general land-use plan. On the other hand, how the rules are
implemented on the ground, such as which areas are closed,
who gets access at what time and under what conditions, and
individual-level practices such as soil and water conservation
techniques, can only be amplified through community
interventions that engage all stakeholders on the ground.

In addition, as the notion of PD in the DPPD method not only goes beyond
behavior but also beyond
include
communities and administrative or geographic units, adapting human
practices should not be the only focus of DPPD interventions.

individuals or (small) groups to

If positive deviants are public spaces, as in the Mexico safe
public spaces pilot, it will be more appropriate to focus on how
structural attributes like infrastructure or governance
mechanisms affect their “performance.” Finding positively-
deviant public spaces in Mexico City that have lower crime
rates than others means there is a focus on identifying and
understanding non-behavioral factors such as lighting, the
existence of alarm buttons or safe pathways, or the distribution
of informal commerce as determinants that enable positive
deviance to emerge.

Things to consider

In the Somalia rangelands pilot, the team knew that managing
rangelands sustainably is very complex and cannot be
successful if community interventions that focus on individual
practices and policy-level interventions are not combined.

As is the case with community interventions, there is no single right way
of designing and implementing policy interventions as part of the DPPD
process. When designing DPPD policy interventions the following three
questions can serve as a starting point:

What policy areas do you want to address? These can be at different
levels (from local to national) and address different domains and
sector-specific policies.
Who should you engage with to develop and implement the policies?
As mentioned in Stage 1, see if you can involve such policy-level
stakeholders from the start of the project.
How will you go about feeding the project findings into policies?
Activities can range from meetings with policymakers to present the
project findings and suggested policy changes to working with NGOs
to formulate and advocate for changes in policy.

Policy interventions will benefit from different ways of scaling, such as
scaling up and scaling initial conditions (see Figure 10). Community
interventions will
likely scale-out by replicating positively-deviant
practices. Given the complexity of most of the challenges DPPD will be
applied to, and the range of behavioral, contextual, and other factors
that need to be addressed for an intervention to be successful, it might
make sense to employ systems thinking, collective intelligence, and
experimentation for conceptual guidance to address multiple leverage
points.

There is a growing number of practical resources from these fields
applied to address development challenges that could be used for
guidance, for example:

complex problems, make better decisions and find new solutions.

Figure 10: Scaling can mean different things and different types of scaling can be
effective under different conditions. Community interventions will normally seek to
scale out positively-deviant practices to reach greater numbers of people. Policy
interventions would rely on scaling up to impact policy and laws and scaling local
conditions to improve infrastructure⁷.

The focus of Stage 5 is to assess and evaluate the impact of the Data
Powered Positive Deviance (DPPD)
interventions, both policy and
community interventions. It is important to undertake this step to make
sure data is being used to make interventions as effective as possible
and to be able to report on results at the end of the project. It is also
important to note that, usually, there are specific monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) guidelines for each organization and the suggestions
provided in this stage are for a general audience. There are three main
elements related to the M&E of DPPD interventions:

Once you determine how the data will be collected, it is necessary to
decide how often it will be collected and how long after the intervention
to undertake the measurement. Too soon and it will not fully have had
an effect. Too late and exogenous factors might be impacting the
community. Will you need to capture the outcomes of the intervention
group continuously, every six months, or once a year? And for how long?
This should depend on the intervention timeline (check Tool 5.1 in the
tools section for further guidance).

3.

Measurement: What data will be collected to track the outcome
measure?
Analysis: How will the monitoring data be analyzed?
Dissemination: How will the results of the data collection be
disseminated across the different stakeholders?

Measurement

The measurement can be done using the same digital outcome measure
that was used to identify the positive deviants in Stage 2. However, here
in Stage 5, this measure will be used to see if the intervention group
experienced a significant enhancement in performance (i.e. better
vegetation, lower deforestation, or fewer crime reports). Such as the
remote sensing derived index in the Somalia, Niger, and Indonesia
pilots, the crime reports and calls in Mexico, and the deforestation rates
in Ecuador.

You should then decide whether traditional data (e.g. surveys or focus
groups) is also needed to track the progress and the impact of the
intervention. For example, alongside a survey, will you also need to do a
focus group discussion with the intervention population to capture the
challenges, unexpected dynamics, and benefits the group faced in
adopting the solutions? You might also be interested in identifying
largest
positively-deviant practices and strategies
contribution to the positive outcomes or the highest prevalence among
the intervention group.

the

Analysis

The main focus of your analysis should be measuring the change caused
by scaling the positively-deviant practices and strategies. Other changes
that are not triggered or influenced by the intervention might exist.
They can have an effect on the outcome measure, but you should
consider these as secondary in your evaluation. To isolate the effect of
the intervention from the non-intervention related effects, the changes
in the outcomes of the intervention group should ideally be compared
with changes in the outcomes of the control group, which wasn’t
exposed to the intervention (only in the case where a control group is
ethically justifiable). Alternatively, if you use the same digital data as in
Stage 2, you might consider looking at the same group before and after
intervention. This should give you a closer estimate of the
the
intervention-caused effects or differences.

The most prominent ways to do this comparison are randomized
(RCTs) or quasi-experiments. In RCTs, both the
controlled trials
intervention and control group units are randomly selected from the
same sample of non-positive deviants within the same homogeneous
group. Both groups are considered similar at the beginning, and only
the intervention sets them apart. The outcomes of the intervention
group are then compared with the outcomes of the control group to
check if there is a significant difference in the performance of both
groups. In quasi-experiments, the intervention and control groups are
not randomly selected, and the units are assigned to those groups
based on their choice or on convenience¹.

/experimental-vs-quasi-experimental-design

109

110

It is also possible to approximate effects by before-versus-after designs
without control groups if confounding effects are negligible, in a way
similar to how it was done in this study². However, not all evaluators use
such methods in assessing the impact of the interventions. Some prefer
to use more accessible approaches that depend on the common sense
of the evaluator and on the theory of change of an intervention (e.g.
outcome mapping³, contribution analysis⁴, or building on stakeholders’
capacities in grasping and valuing causal relations (e.g. Utilization-
Focused Evaluation⁵)).

Dissemination

The last step of the M&E process is to identify how and to whom data will
be disseminated. In order to do so, ask yourself the following questions:

1.

2.

3.

How and to whom will you communicate the M&E results internally
(within the organization you work at)?
How and to whom will you communicate the M&E results externally
(the different project stakeholders and donors)?
How will this data be used to design more effective interventions
both internally and externally?

For instance, a team may want to review data on a monthly basis to make
programmatic decisions and develop future work plans, while meetings
with the donor to review data and program progress might occur
quarterly or annually. Dissemination of printed or digital materials might
occur at more frequent intervals.

The Problem Definition tool will help you describe the problem and its root causes, define the target group and the units that will be analyzed in that
target group as well as the desired outcome of a potential intervention. Try to develop or at least validate each of these components with people affected
by or with expert knowledge of the problem.

Tool 1.2
Suitability Assessment

Use the tool below to describe what or who the positive deviants might
be, given your particular project scope. This will help you determine the
data sources you will need. Remember that in DPPD positive deviants can
be individuals, communities, or even administrative or geographic units.
Use the boxes below to develop an initial description of potential positive
deviant(s).

Who am I?

General Tips:

In some cases, there might be an agreed definition of who is
considered an outperformer. Check the academic literature!
Engage with people who might be aware of
communities who are adopting uncommon practices and strategies.
Talk to people working on the problem including sector experts,
government officials, or NGO staff.
If you have access to data on the performance of potential positive
deviants and easy access to data analysis skills, run a preliminary
analysis to understand the data distribution and to see if you can spot
any immediate outliers.

Tool 1.5
Desirability Assessment

Using the tool below, ask yourself whether it is desirable for a positive deviant, should you identify one, to share their practices with others. If so, would
the community be able and willing to adopt the practice and benefit from it? Might there be negative consequences on the (social) systems that the
positive deviant and the community are embedded in or connected with?

Positive Deviants

Communities (Target Group)

(Social) Systems

A positive deviant has an advantage over
others given their knowledge of and
application of positively-deviant
practices. Sharing their practice with
others could endanger their competitive
advantage.

In the short term, non-positive deviants
might not accept, adopt or embrace the
positively-deviant practice. In the long
term, adoption of the practice could lead
to overall negative effects.

The wide adoption of a common practice
could have negative consequences
beyond the positive deviants and the
community, e.g. on governmental and
social institutions, the natural
environment or political, social or
economic systems.

Tool 2.1:
Variable Mapping

This tool will help you in mapping out all the possible
control and independent variables in order to select the
most suitable variables for the homogeneous grouping
and the positive deviant identification steps of Stage 2
and the positive deviants' characterization step of Stage 3.

Using the guidance provided below you will be able to
categorize and map the study variables into four main
types:

Homogeneous grouping: Factors beyond the control
of individuals that can influence the outcomes of the
target group, and at the same time they cannot be
changed e.g. rain.

PD identification: Individual-level factors that can
influence the outcomes of the target group, and at
the same time they cannot be changed. Those
variables should be controlled for when identifying
positive deviants within each homogeneous group or
cluster e.g. socioeconomic status.

PD characterization (Supra-individual): Factors
beyond the control of individuals that can influence
the outcomes of the target group but can be
transferred to peer communities e.g. policies.

PD characterization (Individual): Individual-level
factors that can influence the outcomes of the target
group and can be changed and transferred e.g. soil
and water conservation techniques.
