## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

First, assess how much knowledge young people have about solid waste and its impact on the environment and their communities. Then, implement the gamification intervention as a means to build capacities and skills in this area, to reassess whether learning has occurred and to what extent. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If young people have knowledge and skills about sustainable and proper solid waste disposal practices, then they can influence waste disposal at home and in the communities at large and change the encompassed behavioral. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Develop a gaming application based on state-of-the-art sustainable waste management practices that is user-friendly to young people of different age groups.  Test a prototype and assess what needs to be improved/changed/discarded/added  Complete the final version   Release the gaming app and use it at schools across the community where the experiment is being conducted 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The average number of correct answers of the participants compared to the control group. 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

User-generated data (quantitative)  Gaming to obtain the learnings Questions and surveys of the experience Surveys with a control group.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
