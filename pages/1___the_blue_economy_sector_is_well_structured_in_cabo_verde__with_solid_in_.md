## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1 – The Blue Economy sector is well structured in Cabo Verde, with solid institutions including a dedicated ministry (of Maritime Economy, presently the Ministry of the Sea), an Institute for Fishery Development, the Sea Academy (with 3 higher education institutions) and an Oceanographic Center (of research). The sector has strong support from international community (including FAO, that supported the development of the national strategic plan for the Blue Economy and other programs and projects for the sector) and well-designed plans, instruments and events (including the “Ocean Week” in November every year). The sector is a national priory for the Government.   2 – Nevertheless the sector potential, Artisanal Fishers face increased challenges in their activities. Overfishing (with some species in danger) has led to a decreasing volume of capture near the shore, and to the need to travel longer distances to find fishes, normally in small boats with poor conditions, raising security issues. Others identified challenges are low value added to the fishing products and a deficient distribution system.   3 - Proposed Innovations to fishery sector include: New activities to fishermen’s connected to tourism (including maritime tourism guide, ecotourism, recreative fishing and diving); Improve the distribution value chain using digital channels and solutions; Improve security using georeferentiation systems; Use research and the scientific community to help identify new species and locate sustainable resources (with technology).   4- Entrepreneurship Ecosystem has improved significantly over the years. Solid institutions have been created, including Agency to promote SMEs and Entrepreneurship (PROEMPRESA), a decentralized network of Incubation Centers (including with Public/Private partnerships, like BIC and IMCV) and several instruments (including programs like Start-up Challenge, Micro-Empreededorismo, and Cabo Verde Digital). It is a great opportunity for the development sector to cooperate with this ecosystem to address development challenges. There is evidence that young people and woman in Cabo Verde actually engage in these programs. LAVANTA initiative is one example, with a well-designed partnership framework (between UNDP, INFF, PROEMPRESA, Financial Ecosystem, Accelerator Lab, Private sector) it was possible in a two weeks call procure more than 300 solutions/projects nationwide from young people (majority woman) and begin a process of supporting them with technical assistance and innovative instruments to access to finance.   5 – Access to finance has always been one of the top challenges small entrepreneurs and business indicate as barrier to their sustainment and development. Transports, cost of factors (like energy, telecommunications or materials) and a small internal market are other important challenges indicated too. The government has promoted the Financial Ecosystem, composed by banks and other public instruments (see below) that has done a great work in increasing credit to the economy in the past few years, but challenges still persists. Improvements in the demand side (of credit) are also necessary. An holistic approach to tackle both sides of the problem seems to be the way forward, including Capacity Building for improved projects and investment propositions aligned with creative new financing instruments. INFF and Cabo Verde Stock Exchange are working on a projects like Blu-x for sustainable finance instruments for the blue economy. A new and exciting instrument, a Social Bond, was recently launched with a Micro-Credit Institution (Morabi) to promote projects in poverty reduction and social inclusion.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Managing partnerships. We tried to use some standard instruments available in the CO to develop partnerships and faced some challenges (with budget and payments). More flexible partnerships instruments for the lab to develop activities and involve partners and the private sector would be helpful.   Election Year and changing office in key partner (Ministry of Maritime Economy) introduced priorities rescheduling and delayed activities (namely in the organization of the innovation challenge in Blue Economy).   Data availability. Statistical information about the Blue Economy sector is a challenge. Only general information about is open to the public for analysis in the National Statistics Institute (economic data and GDP). Detailed sectorial data about fishery and other Blue Economy domains are not easily accessible. Public institutions (like National Directions, Institute for the Sea, etc.) that owns more detailed data about the sector are working on a digital platform to collect and provide data and more factual information. But for the moment, is still a big challenge to find reliable data about the sector.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We used open data and public reports to research the sector and build the ecosystem mapping. In-depth interviews and workshops with key stakeholders (public, private and academia) in the sector were held to gain more understanding about the sector and address the challenge proposition. In the experimentation phase, an innovation challenge was used to crowdsource solutions from the private sector and civil society, mainly focused in young people and woman entrepreneurs (the LAVANTA challenge). An application form with several survey questions was used to better understand the audience and collect solutions and projects in selected areas. With help of several partners a mentorship program was put in place to help applicants develop their solutions and projects, and access to finance.   Statical data in the sector is very sparce. Institutions collect their own data and some reports can be found, but lacks regularity and coverage.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Collective intelligence was key to involve many stakeholders and develop activities conducing to  knowledge and impact in the challenge. In-depth interviews, workshops and field trips were used to gain more understanding of this complex ecosystem, with many stakeholders and different interrelated challenges affecting target groups.    Following this sensemaking process, the best way to impact the system was to engage with several key stakeholders (both internal and external, including governmental agencies, internal portfolios, private sector associations, etc.) in the organization of an open innovation challenge to procure solutions and projects in 5 areas (Green, Blue, Digital, Social and Health and Others with inclusive growth and job-creation potential) from youth and woman entrepreneurs and address challenges in these key thematic areas of sustainable development (including blue economy), and provide creative financing solutions (like LAVANTA fund from INFF) for these target groups.
## Partners

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Association of Young Entrepreneurs of Cabo Verde (AJEC) – Partner for operating NEGOCIA Business and Launch the LAVANTA Fund. This association was key partner in de development of NEGOCIA platform and the deployment of LAVANTA Call for Projects phase. They promoted the engagement of their associate members (young entrepreneurs from all islands of Cabo Verde) in the initiative, helped promote it and receive applications via NEGOCIA Platform.   Chamber of Commerce of Cabo Verde (CCB and CCISS) – Partners of NEGOCIA Business Platform. Together with AJEC, they are the beneficiaries of the NEGOCIA Business Platform and development partners. A MoU was signed between them delegating in AJEC the operational management of the platform.   Financial Ecosystem – Composed by banks and other financial institutions (Partial Guarantee, Venture Capital, etc.), this ecosystem was organized by the government to increase access to finance in Cabo Verde. In this process, with the help of PROEMPRESA, this ecosystem was engaged with INFF and SPU (see below) to create an innovative financial instrument, LAVANTA Fund, to promote credit for institutional change for private entrepreneurship and bottom-up innovation.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Maritime Economy – Blue economy sectorial partner. Provided sector expertise and insights, and is a key partner for a new innovation challenge dedicated to the blue economy on digital solutions (to be organized).   Cabo Verde Digital - Digital economy sectorial partner. Provided digital transformation expertise and experience, and is a key partner for a new innovation challenge dedicated to the blue economy on digital solutions.   PROEMPRESA – SME Entrepreneurship agency. Key partner in the implementation of LAVANTA Fund. With offices in several islands, this agency is responsible for the operation of LAVANTA Fund, providing technical assistance and coaching to selected applicants to develop their projects and business cases and access to loans backed by LAVANTA fund.   Public Institutions from the Financial Ecosystem (PRO-Garante) – PRO-Garante is a government partial guarantee institution created to work with the private sector and banks to facilitate access to bank loans, via partial guarantee provision. In LAVANTA Fund, PROMEMPRESA worked with PRO-Garante and INFF in the LAVANTA fund instrument to provide loan guarantees for the selected projects of LAVANTA initiative.   Ministry of Finance / DNP – Key government partner for LAVANTA initiative. Provided high level engagement from government and alignment with the several other public institutions in this process.   Cabo Verde Stock Exchange (BVC) – Key partners in in project Blu-x with INFF. In the Blue Economy Challenge, this institution provides technical expertise in financial literacy and instruments.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Private Sector associations and the Financial Ecosystem are unusual. We wanted to engage with them in order to involve the private sector and develop and test creative solutions to key challenges including young and woman entrepreneurship, access to finance and sustainable finance.   The private sector associations are non-profit organizations that represents the private sector (or its sub-groups, like young entrepreneurs or woman) and their interests, with a large network and influence in the sector. They can be particularly good vehicles to involve and influence the private sector in sustainable development initiatives from a broader perspective, while not engaging directly with private companies or interests. They are sensitive to these issues, have time to engage and can help find and involve specific companies that are more suitable to help depending on project.   Cabo Verde has established a financial ecosystem to promote access to finance and credit to the economy. A Government initiative involving the financial sector, public institutions and the private sector to provide financial instruments that address the issue of access to finance and provide credit to the economy. Engaging with this ecosystem to provide innovative sustainable financing instruments can be an exceptionally good strategy, aligned with the principles of INFF.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

RFF (Rapid Response Facility) INFF (Integrated National Financing Framework) SPU (the Strategy and Policy and Joint Office Cabo Verde SDG Platforms in Municipalities (Decentralization Project)   We (Accelerator Lab Cabo Verde) engaged with these internal partners and instruments to develop NEGOCIA Business Platform and connect this initiative to LAVANTA Fund to Launch the Call for Projects phase of the Initiative. RFF and INFF provided the funds (the budget), SPU provided the conceptual framework for the LAVANTA Fund and the link to INFF and to the Ministry of Finance, and the Decentralization Project provided the link to municipalities for local operational support in procuring and coaching applicants to the LAVANTA innovation challenge nationwide.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The LAVANTA Call For Projects was simultaneously an innovation challenge targeted to crowdsource solutions and projects from young people and woman in a digital platform (NEGOCIA) at national level, and a vehicle to test the engagement with other institutions and with the financial ecosystem for the development of new and creative financial instruments to support projects with a particular focus on SDG Accelerators (including Blue Economy, Green Transition, Sustainable Tourism, Digitalization and Human Capital).    This process involved the engagement with a number of stakeholders at different levels to be successful, including the entrepreneurship ecosystem to develop a robust innovation framework to receive and coach applicants and their solutions into well designed projects and access to finance, private sector associations and municipalities to promote the initiative locally and engage with target groups (entrepreneurs, young people, woman, small business), the government, to promote high level support and access to other institutions in this complex process and the financial ecosystem to develop a sustainable financial solution, tailored to this initiative.   All this process and engagement generated valuable insights and experience that we would not been able to achieve without this mechanism.
