> Description of the solution

This might be cooled below outside air temperature by the use of refrigerants or by thermal mass such as thermal labyrinths, or by night time purging. Mechanical fans drive mechanical ventilation. Fans can either be installed directly in windows or walls, or installed in air ducts for supplying air into, or exhausting air from, a room. The type of mechanical ventilation used depends on climate. In warm and humid climates, infiltration may need to be minimized or prevented to reduce interstitial condensation (which occurs when warm, moist air from inside a building penetrates a wall, roof or floor and meets a cold surface). In these cases, a positive pressure mechanical ventilation system is often used. Conversely, in cold climates, exfiltration needs to be prevented to reduce interstitial condensation, and negative pressure ventilation is used.
