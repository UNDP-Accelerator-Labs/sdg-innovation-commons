IN RURAL UZBEKISTAN, BUILDING BRIDGES TO A MODERN WORLD THROUGH ENHANCED PUBLIC SERVICE OUTREACH
In rural Uzbekistan, building bridges to a modern world through enhanced public service outreach
By UNDP Resident Representative Matilda Dimovska
MAY 31, 2021
UNDP’s global mandate is well-defined -- to overcome poverty in all its forms. In this effort, we support countries to create long-term, socially responsible, and sustainable development strategies that foster respect for human rights and which promote democratic governance, the rule of law and inclusive and sustainable growth. It is a global commitment to work in partnership at all levels to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, for everyone, everywhere, leaving no one behind.
In Uzbekistan, this approach includes working closely with local and national partners to develop a new Public Administration Strategy with a sharpened focus on the poor and disadvantaged, especially women and marginalized groups. Within this framework, open government and decentralization were our twin pillars of pro-poor and human rights-based approach to development.
Through this approach, UNDP in Uzbekistan, with funding from the European Union, is supporting the government’s sweeping national public administrative reforms with a concerted effort to reach the most vulnerable and remote citizens across the country with public services of the modern state.
Digitalization of public services
One of the best ways to extend the reach of government services (such as unemployment, pension or medical benefits) is to ensure that everyone with the means can access them through their computers or smartphones. The provision of such services also becomes much more efficient because unlike physical offices, digital ones are open to the public 24/7—and stay open during public-health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a recent McKinsey study, such digitized services also helps to build trust and confidence in government: citizens who are satisfied with public services are much more likely to trust the government overall than those who are not.[1]
Therefore, the programme is supporting digitalization in local government through an EU-financed joint UNDP/ Public Service Agency (PSA) initiative under the Ministry of Justice. The project, “Improved Public Service Delivery and Enhanced Governance in Rural Uzbekistan” is in part focused on providing equitable access to public services for anyone and everyone who needs them. This is an important goal for realizing people-centred government and improving the quality of life for all-- key goals of the government’s public administration reforms.
On the move: bringing services to the people
The Government’s interactive public service portal now provides more than 200 public services by government organizations[2]. The Government is very much aware of the digital divide in Uzbekistan and that not everyone can get online due to the lack of Internet infrastructure or the dire financial positions of poor families. To ensure the services reach everyone who needs them, the PSA has opened 30 remote service centres across the country, with many more planned to cover all rural areas. These remote centres bring important services to those who would otherwise be unable to access them.
The centres furthermore organize regular visits to those in need with mobile service centres, and –in the case of the elderly and disabled, they provide house calls. To support them in this effort, 189 Damas cars and 20 Isuzu buses were provided to serve as mobile administrative service centres. The mobile centres allow the most vulnerable – the elderly, people with disabilities and families with young children living in the most remote areas – to access important administrative and social services that have a profound impact on their daily lives.
Such outreach services are usually provided on weekends and are needed for those who cannot reach the physical locations, such as the disabled and the elderly who have difficulties with mobility, and by poor families for whom transportation is too expensive. Last year, more than 7,000 people benefited from these outreach services in all five districts. The services include paying for utilities, obtaining a tax identification number or a business license, securing e-signatures, registering for pensions and signing children up for pre-school. In four out of five pilot districts people have applied for commercial building licenses and/or registered real estate.

The EU/UNDP joint project is supporting Government efforts to improve public service delivery in several important ways, through reviews, analyses and assessments of the process, and by sharing the best practices from other European countries along with the expertise of international and national experts. UNDP in Uzbekistan also is working with the Government of Uzbekistan to build the capacity of its civil servants in critical areas of public service delivery through on-line learning platforms and other initiatives.
Through targeted outreach in Dekhanabad district, pension-related services are provided to senior citizens who are unable travel to the administrative offices. Here, Ravshan Eshonov of Istiklal village receives important information about his pension fund.
Ravshan Eshonov, who lives 50 kilometers from the nearest district offices, is relieved such services are available. “Otherwise, it would have been extremely difficult for me to get there and to petition a request for an increase in my pension,” he said.
Through this targeted outreach, Eshonov and others can connect with the same services enjoyed by all others in Uzbekistan. If he cannot get to the services, the services will come to him. In this way, UNDP in Uzbekistan is building bridges and empowering people in rural and remote areas. Being able to sign up for utilities, to register new property, to apply for passports and driving licenses, to register weddings and births – these are all basic services of the modern state whose promotion are very much part of UNDP’s mission to leave no one behind.
