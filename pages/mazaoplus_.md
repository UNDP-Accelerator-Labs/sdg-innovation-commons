> Description of the solution

MazaoPlus+, an innovative data platform created to collect and share fertilizer supply and demand data (e.g., fertilizer price, fertilizer type, etc.) among smallholder farmers and fertilizer vendors with the aim of improving market inefficiencies. Using a USSD code, farmers get information on fertilizer vendors closest to them, who are selling the type of fertilizer that they are looking for. In addition, farmers get to know different fertilizer prices either per 50kg bag or per unit kilogram.
