> NEED: What need does this answer?

This initiative satisfies several needs in alignment with the UN's SDG's. The sale of locally crafted jewelry to tourists and other beach visitors is a source of decent work and economic growth for this community. Additionally, the goal of re-using waste materials in a sustainable way is achieved through the creative use of organic and inorganic beach waste; such as bottle caps to produce earrings, calabash (local fruit that grows near the beach) husks to make purses, and necklaces made from old smoothed out glass fragments strung onto discarded fishing lines, and many other examples. 





> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Local crafts-people, Patsy and Thomas, are contributing to coastal preservation through sustainable innovation. Their approach of transforming waste into valuable and profitable products is an approach with global applicability. There is a growing trend towards up-cycling, with plastic bottles in southeast Asia being converted into sneakers, sargassum seaweed being used as organic fertilizers for plants, and many other examples.


Additionally, a small self sustaining economic ecosystem has bloomed around artists like Patsy and Thomas. Thomas mentioned that he purchases the components of his shark teeth necklaces from a man who visits the fish market on a weekly basis to collect discarded waste. Patsy attains components of her "donkey-eye" (seeds of a local fruit) chains from a man who grows and sells the fruit. Both Thomas and Patsy source some of their other products, like hand made wooden or leather purses, drink coasters, etc, from highly specialized local craftsmen. All of these items are sold at a high premium to willing tourists and sentimental locals.


This local example may be applied to other coastal communities in the Caribbean and beyond. Additionally, there are opportunities to grow and scale these businesses through the provision of alternate channels for sale of the art, such as through e-commerce sites.
