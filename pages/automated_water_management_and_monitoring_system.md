This system gives the user the ability to automatically  manage and monitor the level of their water tank at home or office. The pump automatically comes on when water level in the tank is at 25% and turns off when full at 100%. It has a colour coded display which indicates the various water levels.

The system allows for more efficient use of water, reducing unnecessary wastage.
