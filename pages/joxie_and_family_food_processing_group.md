Joxie and Family Food Processing Group

> Brief description of the innovation

Implementation plan for high innovations under Agriculture through food processing and value adding to all raw agriculture products, and making stores in order to sell and distribute all the processed products produced at affordable prices with full of quality. Using the SWOT analysis we found that processing Agricultural food products bought from farmers all over Zambia and making affordable food products to increase Zambia's food production, will make profit to grow the company in order to hire more unemployed youths and women in the company. As a company we will strive to create more employment and diversify through providing quality affordable processed products which are essential for human needs as food is one of the fundamental physiological needs which are needed to motivate people to be more productive. The methods of processing will be environmentally friendly,producing tasty but nutritional food helping with contributing to the national production of food,contribution to end world hunger,as plans of exporting are future plans and also relieving poverty through job creation as the company grows and expands.

Then phase three is package and sell the value added products at affordable prices but with profit. All these phases will be done while balancing effectiveness and efficiency, through proper management,while promoting a great business environment which is environmentally friendly,also making sure working through the legal and proper channels and obeying the business laws of Zambia.
