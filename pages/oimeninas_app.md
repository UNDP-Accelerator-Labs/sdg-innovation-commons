## The "Oi Meninas" App is the country's first edutainment application dedicated to Sexual and Reproductive Health for adolescent girls. Developed in response to insights from over 30,000 participants in the UNFPA project, supported by the UNDP/Global Fund with the support of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the app provides a practical and innovative solution to disseminate information, focusing on young people, particularly girls and young women.

Through an interactive quiz format, the app addresses four key themes related to sexual and reproductive health and rights: Knowing your body, relationships, Sexuality, and Sexually transmitted diseases. Tailored questions, approved by the Ministry of Health, are categorized for different age groups. Users input their name and age to access questions appropriate to their age group. The responses contribute to generating statistical insights into users' knowledge levels, providing a foundation for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Education to tackle challenges and enhance access to adolescent-friendly Sexual and Reproductive Health services. The app aims to empower adolescent girls and youth by fostering informed decision-making.
