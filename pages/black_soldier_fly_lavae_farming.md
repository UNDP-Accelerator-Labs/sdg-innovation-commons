> Title of the innovation

Black Soldier Fly Lavae farming

> Brief description of the innovation

This projects aimed to take advantage of the readily available organic waste that can be seen everywhere in our communities. Using Black soldier Fly Lavae (BSFL), the waste is disintegrated and in the process breeds millions of these lavae which is a good source of protein for livestock such as; chickens, pigs, cows and fish. This will drastically cut down on the cost of feeding. Research has shown that the protein obtained from feed made from BSFL has a higher protein content than can be obtained from commercial feed.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation can generate money through selling the end product of the process to farmers (either as fresh larvae or pellets as can be seen from the pictures). This can be a way of creating employment for the youths who can be directly involved in the production of the BSFL as well as the marketing and delivery of the product to customers.
This innovation which is currently being practiced in many parts of the world can create an opportunity to handle organic waste as well as provide people with employment.

> Technical Feasibility

Growing BSFL starts with first attracting the Black Soldier Fly to an attractant so that it can lay eggs. When the eggs hatch, maggots are formed. During the life cycle of the BSF, the maggots or larvae turn into pupae. It is this pupae that forms the first raw material that can then be put in a cage and after the fourth stage of the cycle, flies emerge in the cages. It is these flies in large numbers that form more larvae to be used for feed.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation can create employment for the masses and provide them with an income. This project is viable due to the fact that commercial feeds are a huge cost on the part of the farmer while growing BSFL requires few inputs and can therefore be cheaper than conventional feed as it is in places where this innovation is being practiced. It also produces quality meat for the farmers as the feed is organic and looking at the current situation world over where organic type of eating is advised, it is a step in the right direction.
