Kawon Cultural Library was created by Ghaith Bahdoosheh, a young man from the city of Madaba, Jordan.  He started off with a mobile bookshop idea. He would drive around parts of Jordan in his old Mercedes, park, and set up his books on his car, and sell them to people. He dreamt of doing more related to books and reading and this eventually led to launching the social enterprise, Kawon. Brief about Kawon in his own words: Kawon Cultural Library is determined to become a daily place for locals to come to it, visitors from neighboring cities and tourists from all over the world, a place to dream and try to escape from the daily pressures of life and try something new, a comfortable place to meet your friends or read a book, all in one. With the increasing demand for high-quality coffee, food and great service, Kawon will benefit from its presence in the city of Madaba and the surrounding areas it serves, aiming to create a healthy environment, where cultural activities and knowledge exchange are the valves to evoke and spread new social values. 

Kawon brings a special experience of book culture to its visitors through its unique collection of books and publications in multiple languages. I made this library because of the lack of safe and cultural spaces that provide basic services to youth We aspire to achieve the developmental sustainability of our social enterprise by applying some of the concepts that will give us our independence, such as solar energy production and food production, both internally and externally. We aspire to be the pioneers in the field of rare and ancient publications, preserving them and re-publishing them to revive the written human heritage.
