> Brief description of the innovation

The future of these street children does not look bright, and if no mitigation measures are undertaken to help them, they would fill up prisons, police cells and terrorize families, communities and the nation at large. The crime rate will escalate and the resources of the country will be channeled to combat the increased vices in the country, henceforth endangering the innocent law abiding citizens.
Clean the Streets of Lusaka - Street Children project is meant to mobilise resources and availing these resources for modeling the street children into useful and responsible citizens and to wipe out all kinds of child exploitation, protect and safeguard the rights of children by means of awareness creation and adopting rehabilitative measures such as entrepreneurship activities.
While there is no doubt that there are common themes and reasons that push children onto the street, dealing with each child as an individual, with their own backstory and identity, is key to understanding their situation.
Fix Foundation intends to devote the resources needed to address street children’s needs. We have information of street children that will help us to better design the programmes for them. This information will help us to address their needs.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The commercial viability of this project is through agricultural production and construction of a street children complex facility.

FFO has 2 hectares and 43 hectares pieces of land in Shantumbu area and Chisamba districts.
FFO will utilize the 43 hectares of land available in Chisamba for agricultural purposes such as poultry farming, horticulture, aquaculture and general cash crop farming. These agriculture produce are on demand and easy to sell.

Target markets: grocery shops, butchery, restaurants, hotels, out grower schemes and export markets (COMESA Export Permit).

Value addition of the project on the environment:
- GHG emission reduction - street children use unsustainable fuels for heating at nights and cooking
- Reduction in garbage and dump sites piles up by street children. They collect a lot of plastics and carton boxes for sleeping on.

FFO under the 'Clean the Streets of Lusaka - Street Children Project' intends to construct a facility in Shantumbu to house up to 450 Children aged between (5yrs -18yrs). The facility will have dormitories, a school and recreation facilities for the children.

> Technical Feasibility

The project is designed as follows:
Component 1: Identification of vulnerable children and their families.
    - Activities: staff recruitment, identification of street children and profiling of street children 
      circumstances
Component 2: Providing nutrition, education and rehabilitation support.
    - Activities: health check-up and treatment, food &amp; nutrition programme, education support
      services and rehabilitation services
Component 3: Promotion of entrepreneurship among street children for income generation wherever necessary by mobilizing facilities of institutional credit
    - Activities: entrepreneurship skills, agriculture activities and other life skills
Component 4: Sustainability and lessons learned
Component 5: Construction of the Fix Foundation Street Children Complex

> Anticipated Social Impact

FFO is trying to improve livelihood opportunities for the street children by leading them to economic empowerment by building their capacity through various entrepreneurial and life skills so as to wean off street lives and vices such as prostitution &amp; drug peddling. FFO is trying to help street children to find themselves and their role in the family, community and society as a whole.
Relevance to the current market:
Street children lack basic needs, have health problems and are exposed to illicit drugs, communicable diseases and sexually transmitted diseases. They are also vulnerable to exploitation with the growth and mushrooming of certain industries and markets, the working population is sizable. With support &amp; collaboration with other stakeholders, FFO intends to carry an immediate and purposeful action to save lives and livelihoods of street children which include extending social protection towards health coverage, academic, shelter and rights support
