## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Innovation Ecosystem in Mosul:  During UNDP-ACCLab in Iraq's work with the Mosul Space organization to develop the Startup Bus Platform, It was found that the entrepreneurial environment in Mosul is a welcoming environment for rapid change and the integration of innovation in the private sector.  With a focus on stakeholders and donors to work on developing youth, advancing the reality of the private sector, and supporting innovation, entrepreneurship, and digitization in Mosul Governorate. It has been shown that there is duplication among the enablers in the Innovation Ecosystem due to the lack of space for all stakeholders to gather and the lack of sharing knowledge and experiences among them. Enhancing the efficiency of Digital solutions by embedding Artificial Intelligence:  During UNDP- AccLab in Iraq's work with local private company partners on Innovation Mission, it was found there is a need to focus on supporting the Iraqi young women in coding, programming, and machine learning skills. There is a lack of Iraqi young women who specialize in Coding and artificial intelligence, and most tech companies are led by male developers more than females. That means the next learning cycle will be circled around asking the question: What are the challenges that make Iraqi tech women limited to leading tech companies in Iraq? Policy Change through the scaling deep the local solutions: UNDP-Accelerator Lab in Iraq launched and hand over the first unified teaching methods of curriculum to the MoHESR, it was found that the trainers in Continuous Learning Centers in the public universities have a good knowledge background, and writing skills, but there is a lack in training and communications skills. There is a misunderstanding between the comparison between training and teaching perspectives. That led the ministry to implement two rounds of ToT training to increase the number of qualified trainers who have the ability to implement Blended Learning Teaching Methods Courses. Online Courses: Throughout the work with North Hands company and Iraqi Innovators to develop online courses, it became evident that the daily practices followed in the management of the small and medium businesses showed that Iraqi SMEs are still taking a traditional approach to their everyday work. The need, for example, to adopt more technological approaches, was not widely recognized as an urgent requirement to create efficiencies.   Business Development Manual: One of the insights generated from developing the first of its kind “Business Development Manual'' incorporation with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, GIZ and various partners in Iraq is that innovation is lacking within the Iraqi student’s mentality and the main reason for this limited innovation mindset is the lack of business innovative methodologies within the Iraqi education system. For this, the AccLab worked to embed innovation within Iraqi youth mentality as part of the formal education system in order to prepare them to be creative in the job market.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

During our work with higher education, it was noted that there was a weakness in the training skills of teaching methods trainers in Iraqi universities. Many of them have a very good cognitive stock, but they lack interactive skills and digital tools during their work. With a blur in distinguishing between education skills and training skills in terms of application and not knowledge.  Regarding the innovation ecosystem,  There is a significant increase in the number of female entrepreneurs in Iraq, and success stories began to emerge that encourage the opening of new innovative projects. However, a clear lack of young women specialists in the field of digitization, artificial intelligence, and design for electronic platforms and applications was noted.  Also, there is a lack of a culture of building partnerships and working collaboratively within the system. The stakeholders within the ecosystem work individually and establish their own projects and programs. There is a need to establish a partnership culture within the ecosystem to ensure collaborative work.  There is a lack of publicly sharing knowledge and insights within the ecosystem to learn from each others’ successes and failures.  The amount of published sources and access to data about the ecosystem is minimal and there is a need to encourage the various stakeholders to speak out loud about their work, learning, and insights.   The legal framework for registering startups is complicated and lengthy in Iraq, hence this drives startups away from registration and is leading to a growing informal sector within the entrepreneurial ecosystem.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Systems thinking: It is difficult for decision-makers/ enablers or those working in the field of development institutions to identify accurate and specific gaps and opportunities in entrepreneurship due to the weakness of using innovative analysis tools that depend on users' journeys of critical players in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. System Thinking was the perfect tool that relied on visualization and that sped up the process of analysis with the decision-makers. Collective intelligence: There need to be more sources of data about the innovation environment in Iraq, especially in newly liberated areas. Hence, there is a need to know the active players, the existing efforts and initiatives, and the possible collaborations to enhance the innovation environment. Also, there is a lack of synthesis between efforts in the innovation ecosystem, also there is a lack of coordination between eco-system enablers’ activities & programs. And most of the available data is not used to generate new ideas, activities & programs based on their needs that are not visible to the stockholders. Sensor and sensor network data: There is a lack of sensor and sensor network data in Iraq, especially the updated data that take a long-term perspective on the most suitable methods, tools, and local solutions that survive sustainable development.  Quantitative and qualitative data:  In Iraq, data is scarce, and there is a lack of both quantitative and qualitative data. In terms of quantitative, there is a gap in reporting actual numbers and many different sources have different numbers, hence this hinders access to information. Adding to that, qualitative data explore the individual psychology and the effect of the culture in Iraq. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning: The UNDP AccLab in Iraq used Artificial Intelligence as a tool to  develop Iraqi youth projects and Ideas in order to be responsive to the emerging development needs in the country, and enhance the efficiency of these local solutions . This methodology has been applied during the implementation of Innovation Mission Competition. Human-Centered Design: the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq used human-centered design approaches, specifically Design Thinking, in order to support the portfolio approach and embed an innovation mentality within the mindset of Iraqi youth. This will also support the portfolio approach by directing youth mentality to find innovative solutions that tackle the existing gaps. Participatory Design: The UNDP- Acclab in Iraq used the participatory design tools through designing the primary features of the Startup Bus Platform that was implemented in Mosul Governorate. The team chose this tool with the enablers of the entrepreneurial ecosystem using User Experience Journey.      Future Analysis and Future Thinking: The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq used a future thinking approach with several interventions. The team used this approach in the Innovation Mission as a tool of data sources to  automate machine learning with specific data. Also, it was used as a tool to allow the Iraqi youth  to design local solutions that are future-responsive. that supported the youth portfolio in Karbala with innovative tools.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Mosul Space Organization: The UNDP Accelerator Lab Iraq with a generous fund from UNDP - Recovery Solution and Human Mobility in Crisis Bureau worked with the Mosul Space Organization to support boosting the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the newly liberated areas through developing an online platform “Startups Bus” to gather all the entrepreneurship ecosystem activities in one place, and visualize a database of service providers in Mosul. Hence, supporting bringing different technical and business communities together in one place. Throughout the process a collection of data from various sources will be achieved and visualized on the platform. (This solutions is still under experimentation) Knowledge Gate Organization: The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq and this organization focused on  to a sustainable and innovative economy in Iraq through innovatively analyzing the challenges faced by the private sector, newly startups, and SMEs in Iraq during COVID-19 to gather most common systemic problems and allow a group of youth to find innovative solutions in a shape of a business model that is to be studied and rated by the companies, each company adopts one project that matches its scope and helps it operate better and sustain. During the Q3 of 2022, the two partners implemented two phases of initiatives , the first one prepared the needed assessment with several companies in the Private sector in Iraq, and then  developed the report that led the partners to implement the interactive workshop for 3 days, and used system thinking, future thinking , and design thinking.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

University of Karbala, University of Al-Warith, Safwa University College, Technical middle University in Karbala: The UNDP AccLab in Iraq supported 60 Iraqi senior students from three universities in Karbala Governorate with Capacity Building training on how can identify  the specific problem in Karbala  from the development challenge and design the solutions by using innovative methods , system thinking, design thinking, and future thinking. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Asiacell and Codelab:The UNDP AccLab implemented an Innovation Mission with CodeLab company and Asiacell Telecommunication Company within three months in Q4 of 2022. This mission is  centered around supporting the community's local solutions to implement and grow their solutions through integrating the power of Artificial Intelligence to their projects in order to be responsive to the emerging development needs in the country.  The uniqueness of this completion were: Experimented a new approach in Iraq of mixing the Human Centered Design approach (Design Thinking Methodology) with the Artificial Intelligence to come up with innovative, sustainable, efficient, and human centered business projects. The Competition responded to the emergent needs of digitalization and put Iraqi businesses in the front seat of development. Creating partnerships between big private sector companies (e.g. Asiacell) and startups (e.g. CodeLab). Phase One (Call for Application): +450 applicants from business owners in Iraq applied to participate in this competition through a 2 weeks online campaign on social media. Only 30 participants were selected. Phase Two (Training): intensive training to the participants to integrate the power of Artificial Intelligence and Human Centered Approach to their projects. Phase Three (Mentorship): Nine innovative projects were filtered from the previous stages and took 5 weeks of intensive mentorship from specialists in different fields in order to develop their projects (Finance, Marketing, AI, business development, etc.) Phase Four ( Final Competition): Seven innovative projects where they presented their ideas in front of 300 public audience and 5 judges. North Hands: The  UNDP AccLab in Iraq supported one of the local solutions owned by Iraqi innovators initiative and North Hand Company to develop  The Startups and SMEs Management in Crisis Times online Course.  The aim of this course is to improve business skills necessary for SMEs operating the post-crises scene. The final innovative local solution should support the training of key aspects of post-crises business management to Iraqi startups and SMEs, specifically focusing on sharing tools and alternatives to minimize business disruption post the crises and providing operational and financial management advice. This interventions implemented through three stages as below: Developed curriculum for the course focusing on the five objectives identified above. Tested the developed curriculum material before the production of the final course through performing a workshop for startups and SMEs which will cover key aspects of post-covid business management. Developed the final course and recorded it to be posted on the UNDP InPoint platform. Origins Program by Doinc Company: Origins program is implemented and owned by a local startup called Doinc for Business Development and Consultation. The UNDP Accelerator Lab Iraq supported the implementation of this program on different levels.  First intervention was through the designing phase, and the second intervention was through sharing the knowledge and experience.  This program aims to put participants in the driver’s seat on a safe, fun and well-designed learning journey. The destination of their journey is to enter the private sector as entry level employees or as interns by developing their knowledge, skills and attitudes.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MoHESR): During Q2 the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq implemented two experimentation workshops with MoHESR to test the developed Blended Learning Teaching Methods curriculum with trainers and professors from 35 Iraqi universities. In June 2022, the UNDP Acclab launched this solution to the Research and Development Department within the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in order to embed the curriculum within the higher education system in Iraq.
