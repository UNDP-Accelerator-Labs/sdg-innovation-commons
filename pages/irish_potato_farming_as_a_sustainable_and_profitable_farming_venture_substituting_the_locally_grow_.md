> Title of the innovation

Irish Potato Farming as a Sustainable and Profitable Farming Venture Substituting the locally grown maize cash crop in Kalumbila of the North Western Province

> Brief description of the innovation

The most familiar agriculture practice in North Western Province is the growing of maize despite the Environment being conducive for other crops like Irish Potato in other parts of the province and also cassava among others.
It is for this reason therefore, that I seek to venture in this innovation to start growing quality Irish Potatoes at a large scale in Kalumbila District. Kalumbila as a district has good soil that produces good potato produce. This however is only done at household level for local consumption. 
With enough capital to get proper irrigation systems, purchase high grade potatoes on the market, secure enough land and enough man power will be enough resource to kick start the project

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Irish Potatoes is cash crop that is locally on demand as it is consumed by all. It is sold at all markets including small local market which is beneficial to locals fighting hunger even at this level. Potatoes also have market on big markets in towns of our country. Before thinking of export, the crop has market internally and will be sold out in no time. This will also be cost effective on the nation as their will be a reduction in the importation of potatoes which is higher than expected.
Irish Potatoes can be grown on already bare land which was early used for maize production. This will help reduce farther exploitation of natural resources like trees to create land for farming. Growing different crops on the same land helps to naturally enrich the soil. Prevention of cutting down of trees will in turn help the fight against climate change

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation will for starters first take advantage of the farming system and grow the product on a 20 hectors of land. And in the dry season will be planned to grow on 10 hectors of land  using irrigation systems. Harvest will be sold at local market and also in urban markets of nation.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Farming as business can not be successful with a single hand hence, the need to create local employment to members of the community. The employment opportunity will enable them to access income for their livelihood and also enable families to take their children to school. Local business men and women will also have access to buying the produce on wholesale for them to resale which will enable them to make profits and in return bettering their lives. Job and business creation will reduce on the burden for government to be overwhelmed by the demand for creating jobs for everyone. This will also contribute to nutritional variety on Zambian meals.
Small business such as selling of locally grown crops also contribute to GDP of the country.
The innovation will also take on a charity arm of giving back to the community by empowering the less privileged children in the local communities by sending them back to school. 10% of all profits made will be given back to the less privileged like orphans, elderly and those with disability
