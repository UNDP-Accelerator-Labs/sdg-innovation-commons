## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Connect local micro, small and medium enterprises in the tourism sector for better recovery from the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Our challenge is to create and/or strengthen connections between local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the tourism sector to enhance business and trade opportunities and, hence, allow them to better recover from the resulting socio-economic impacts of COVID-19

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

What are the potential socio-economic consequences of the current pandemic on the lives and livelihoods of people directly or indirectly working for MSMEs operating in the tourism sector?

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Public Sector: Mauritius Revenue Authority, SME Mauritius, National Women Entrepreneurs Council.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to learn whether the entrepreneurs running their own MSME can improve their level of financial literacy when technology, specifically short targeted videos in the native language, is used. The Accelerator Lab proposes to test whether a shift in the mode and method of financial literacy training for MSMEs can improve the operational and financial performance of MSMEs irrespective of the background of the business owner.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF entrepreneurs running their own MSME are given access to short videos in the native language on financial literacy over a period of a few months THEN they can improve the operational and financial performance of their MSMEs irrespective of the background of the business owner.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

30 women entrepreneurs in MSMEs (with 30% youth) will be selected. To baseline the financial literacy level, online financial literacy tests to participating proprietors of selected MSMEs will be performed (including a self-administered baseline profitability and operational health assessment). During the experiment, the women entrepreneurs access self-paced online training modules in the form of video content in Mauritian Creole at specific intervals over a period of three months. This training will teach the financial language, helping the participants to read and interpret financial statements, to make informed operational judgements and decisions to maximize the financial success within their business undertakings. Participating MSMEs retake the benchmarking test administered in the preparatory phase after the three months.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The unit of analysis is the score obtained by the selected participants in the financial literacy test done before the video content in Mauritian Creole are shared with them and after two months.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Data collection will be performed by evaluating the women entrepreneurs face-to-face by brining all of them to a suitable venue and asking them to fill in a questionnaire.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months (4 to prepare the learning material and 2 to run the online training)

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities

Participation in joint technical supervision of a monitoring committee comprised of UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles Accelerator Lab and SME Mauritius.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The hypothesis was proven. After being exposed online to financial literacy video content in the local language over a period of two months, the performance of the women entrepreneurs increased by more than 17%.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Nothing

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

7 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

About 17,000 USD.

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Not for the time being.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Not for the time being.

> Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Women entrepreneurs who manage MSMEs, irrespective of the level of financial knowledge they have, can benefit from online content on financial literacy in the local language. Furthermore, the women entrepreneurs have created an online community where they exchange on the videos but also on other topics they are interested in, including areas of collaboration.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

To be sure to have an efficient implementing partner conversant with finance but also in the creation of video content in local languages.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All units, including other Accelerator Labs, which need to train people using videos and in less mainstream languages.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

All other entities which need to train people using videos and in less mainstream languages.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

To be sure to have an efficient implementing partner conversant with finance but also in the creation of video content in local languages.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes as the training topic can be completely different.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The three Heads worked together on this Experiment from day 1. In particular, the TOR, the initial interviews and evaluations, the training, the construction of the questionnaire, the brainstorming and catch up session as well as the various events and outreaches were organized by all the Heads.

> What surprised you?

Women entrepreneurs were very enthusiastic from day 1 to acquire new knowledge by watching videos online in their native language and interacting with each other.
