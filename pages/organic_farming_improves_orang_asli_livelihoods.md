The typical top-down business model was turned upside down such that the lion's share of OA Organik's profits was given to the Orang Asli (OA) farmers. The purpose of this project was not only to strengthen the economic livelihoods of the OA but also to empower them to preserve their forest and environment. The first project was based in Tasik Chini, Pahang   YKPM together with the Indigenous Peoples Assistance Facility (IPAF) created this organic farming project, which has grown from the initial eight farmers to 40 today. YKPM Managing Director Kon Onn Sein said OA Organik had the opportunity to penetrate the local market on a premium scale because Jaya Grocer assisted farmers under the OA Organik project by transporting their produce from Kuantan to Kuala Lumpur using the supermarket chain's chiller trucks. Every month, Jaya Grocer transports three tonnes of produce from the farm. Additionally, the OA community and farmers are not expected to pay high down payments to promote or market their produce. In addition, Jaya Grocer pays them reasonable prices for their produce. Therefore, the farmers not only get to reduce their production and promotion costs, but they also get to enjoy a higher profit margin.   Jaya Grocer also benefits from its partnership with OA Organik, as the brand is able to create a positive image among the rakyat through this corporate social responsibility (CSR) project. By assisting the farmers under the OA Organik project, both the OA Organik and Jaya Grocer brands have become more reputable in towns and metropolitan cities.
