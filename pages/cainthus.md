> Description of the solution

Technology that allows for computer vision and deep learning to monitor animal behaviour. It is an AI camera used for facial recognition and behavioural patterns of cows to answer questions like: are they eating, standing, sleeping, drinking, etc. This data is used to monitor and analyse health, environmental, production factors. More generally, big data analytics techniques can be used to aggregate and integrate data across farms in order to optimize production processes and systems.
