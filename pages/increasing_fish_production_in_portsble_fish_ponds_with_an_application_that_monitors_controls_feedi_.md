> Title of the innovation

INCREASING FISH PRODUCTION IN PORTSBLE FISH PONDS WITH AN APPLICATION THAT MONITORS,CONTROLS FEEDING OF FISH

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation will use a gadget for monitoring, controlling feeding activities of 3,000 fish in 6m x 6m portable fish ponds that will play a vital role in feeding of fish as overfeeding and starvation risk the fish health, which leads to low profits or high costs, a poor water quality in fish tanks. It will use   microcontroller, which contains built-in Wi-Fi module. The system will enable to monitor fish tanks for correct functioning of the fish feeder as well as to set schedules for feeding the fish and monitoring of water quality by utilizing pH sensor and turbidity sensor. A real time monitoring system will be implemented using an app, a mobile application that is reliable to all android and IOS fish feeder users. The ponds will be stocked with Fingerlings and fed daily, monitored using the installed system. Further the ponds will have water filtration system (bio filters) are important, that shows the great impact on pond environment, to remove pond waste in water. Use an aerator to supply oxygen, small pumps to supply and recycle water and collect oxygen as it is passing in the air.The innovation will increase production through adoption of a cost reduction technology.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Projected total cost of project -$ 80,000 to acquire equipment, feed, fingerlings, van, refrigeration, Target
No. of ponds to be acquired 40
No. of 3,000 fish/pond
Estimated weight / fish 0.3 gr
Estimated production volume/pond    900 kg (3,000 x 0.3g)
Sales volumes/pond 850kg
Price per kilogram K50
Total sales revenue /pond/cycle K42,500
Annual sales revenue /pond K85,000
Total annual sales K3,400,000
The gadget will improve production and profitability,sue excess space to enhance high production volumes, reduce costs.The business will create other business opportunities to suppliers of fuel, fingerlings, feed, transporters, makers of ponds, packaging materials.On the environment, it will reduce wastage of fish feed, generate less waste,no destruction of trees to clear new land but only use already available space.The higher fish consumption than production is attributable to an increased amount of fish imports mainly from Asia and South Africa.The CSO projects by 2025, Zambia ,population growth of 20.5 million requiring fish production of 247,000 tons to meet the demand for 12 kg consumption per capita. Deficit is estimated to escalate to 71,000 tons  by 2025.Market-Copperbelt,Lusaka,Democratic Republic of Congo.Offtakers will be The Hut Restaurant, Yalelo, Sherbourne Hotels/lodges, Choppies, Forte meat, Termites Meat.Value addition through smoking, salting, seasoning, packaging, branding FISH.

> Technical Feasibility

the design and implementation of an automatic fish feeder and water quality
monitoring system. Algorithms to dispense the fish food at a required set by the fish owner and water quality detections implemented to send notifications to the owners via mobile application developed on their smartphones.It will use a gadget linked to all 6m x 6m portable fish ponds for monitoring, controlling feeding activities of fish, easily adapted, easy to disassemble, fold and move. Its design is aesthetically appealing and hold water for longer periods. It uses an aerator to supply oxygen to the ponds to enhance air supply, small pump to supply/rotate water to make it like run through the air and back again collect more oxygen, remove excess toxic gases (it will use bio filters). The ponds are nontoxic, food-grade, UV resistant, anti-oxidative and thermostable material, durable, on-distortable, long life, low maintenance costs.

> Anticipated Social Impact

•	More women will be empowered as we will identify some beneficiaries in an out grower arrangement were they will be given all the requirements, then buy and bulk for supply to big buyers
•	It will create jobs for both women and youths at local level and increase their income, reduce poverty and improve both food and nutritional levels
•	As far as outdoor activities for kids go, a pond has high potential for consistent kid fishing success
•	It will lead to cost reduction and increase their profits and improve their social economic lives
•	Lead to reduction of social evils in the farming communities such as prostitution, crime, excessive beer drinking, reduced unproductive hours due to idling and suicide as people will have something to do.
•	It will lead to an increase in sales revenues, volumes, production volumes and profitability per annum as
•	The project will improve relations between employees, key stakeholders, 
•	It will increase shareholder value earnings for the business
•	Supplement government effort in alleviating poverty, employment creation, tax revenues for government, export earnings, income generation, infrastructure development at local levels
•	It will create new opportunities for other businesses that supply materials and services
•	People will be trained new skills such as customer relations, equipment handling, health and safety. Employees and contracted farmers will be trained in farming techniques to increase productivity
•	Women will be actively involved in fish processing and marketing
Relevance of Innovation to current market is that it will lead to consistence supply to our customers, increase in sales revenue, meet the growing demand and meet customer expectations as well as meet the quantity and quality for the export market
It will help close the gap on the supply of fish as the deficit of fish in the country is very huge below the prevailing demand and meet the protein requirements of poor people.
