> Title of the innovation

COMPUTERS IN EDUCATION

> Brief description of the innovation

Materials Production (Textbooks, Pampletes, Training / Learning Modules) as Resources for Training Teachers in Educational Tertiary Institutions, Teaching Aids for Serving Teachers / and Lecturers, and Learning Aid for Students in Tertiary Institutions and Pupils in Schools...

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Considering that I have been in the Zambian Education System since 1992 as a Trained Teacher, and in the field of Computers since 1998 as a Student, Data Processing Officer and Tutor, I have noted with sadness that about three-quarters of the Serving Teachers and Lecturers are either partially or not Computer Literate.  Computer Resource Materials that I have created if produced on a Commercial Scale can be sold or supplied to various Training or Learning Institutions, within and outside our country.

My Computer Educational Materials are intended to equip Lecturers, Students and Pupils with Practical Survival Skills that would not only improve the Quality of Education but also prepare them for successful careers in Business, Entrepreneurship, Industry and Government Service.

Some pupils who may not go higher in the Educational Hierrachy would have the incites or skills to run their own Business Centres where they would be Self-Employed as they offer their services to the community at large. I have through personal initiative produced such valuable Human Resources equipped with Computer Skills and working in various fields.

> Technical Feasibility

Sample Computer Training Materials are in both Soft and hard Copies. They are a step-by-step or do-it-yourself form of production. They are subject to adjustments depending on the intended target group.

Rolling Out of training awareness for existing teachers may be done through Provincial to District Teachers' Resource Centres, so that each teacher starting from grassroot level can have such skills as Word Processing, Spreadsheet Manipulation, Preparing Presentations, Publications, Databases and Internet Skills, to mention the least. In the long-run, the skills obtained would held to improve the quality of Education because teachers would be in a position to created their own Teaching and Learning Materials through the use of Computers in Education.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Computers in Education play a very important role in improving the lives of many people. For example, many youths in our area have been engaged in Composing and Recording Music and Videos through my son who I started teaching computer from as early as Grade 4. This has kept youths busy and avoid such vices as alcoholism and / substance abuse. Some have even opened up their own music studios on a small scale.

Technology is applicable in any field and can be applied once the basics of computing are imparted to the majority, starting from the early years at school and regardless of gender differences, not just for examination purposes but for real-life or practical and sustainable skills in Commerce and Industry.
