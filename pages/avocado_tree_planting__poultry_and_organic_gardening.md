> Title of the innovation

Avocado tree planting, Poultry and organic gardening

> Brief description of the innovation

Planting of a special breed of avocados which produce fruits between two to three years of planting.  Rearing broiler chickens and use the chicken manure for fertilizing vegetables to avoid degradation of soils.   Avocados are currently on high demand for fighting diseases such as COVID19 and as blood boosters for healthy living.  Avocados are currently in short supply and my innovation will not only boost my income but also contribute to healthy living of many Zambians.  The organic vegetables and fruits are safe for consumption and improve soil fertility.  
My focus is to plant up to a 1000 trees of avocado and include other fruits such as mangoes, oranges and lemons to attain sustainability.  I also hope to rear at least 3000 chickens every four weeks to sell at a competitive price at the local markets.  I have been keeping chickens and gardening for more than 20 years. My experience has paid me off by producing high quality chickens that are appreciated by many customers earning me an increase in market share.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Currently in Zambia one avocado is fetching between ZMW10-20. If my plants do well two hundred plants can give me up two million Kwacha rebased per year. The chickens are currently at a market value of about ZMW90. 3000 birds less reduced mortality will earn ZMW250,000 per month. This will help me attain sustainability in education for my children food and support for the vulnerable around me. I will provide employment opportunities by hiring farm workers, accounts staff to help with booking, drivers to distribute the products. Avocados are currently in short supply and my innovation will not only increase my income but also contribute to healthy living of many Zambians. The organic vegetables and fruits are safe for consumption and improve soil fertility. Chickens provide a rich source of meat protein and give business for others who sell processed foods for functions such weddings, and other events. It is a source of business for eating places, restaurants, hotels, schools and even hospitals. Fruits are a good source of essential vitamins and blood boosters for healthy living especially for growing children and active youths. I will eventually add to the Gross Domestic Product and eventually to the Gross National Product.

> Technical Feasibility

The planting of avocados is a borrowed experiment from expert farmers who are already producing.  I am buying already grafted and growing trees which are anticipated to produce fruits within the next two to three years, based on the existing research results. About 70 plants have been planted.  The planting will be a gradual process.  The avocados are  on a 2 hectare land but are earmarked to be planted around the 4 hectare farm.
Chicken rearing is my existing business for which I have more than twenty years experience and requires no research or feasibility study. Currently I have been rearing between four hundred and eight hundred per month requiring capital of about ZMW23,000 and 45,000.00.  All I need is capital booster to rear more.  For the envisaged 3000 birds, I plan to be rearing 1000 every two weeks since chickens take up to six weeks to grow.  This will enable me to have a constant supply. The chicken run expansion will be achieved on a progressive basis as the income and market share increases.
The organic garden is on a 2 hectare land. Vegetables grown include the pumpkin leaves, cabbage, onion carrots, rape, egg plants and tomatoes.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will provide health food for healthy living.  It will provide employment and business opportunities. The organic vegetables and fruits are safe for consumption and improve soil fertility. Chickens provide a rich source of meat protein and give business for others who sell processed foods for functions such weddings, and other events. It is a source of business for eating places, restaurants, hotels, schools and even hospitals. Fruits are a good source of essential vitamins. Avocados have essential vitamins and currently on high demand for fighting diseases such as COVID19 and as blood boosters.
