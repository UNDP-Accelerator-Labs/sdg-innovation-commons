## Is a smartphone application (online and offline) that provides skilled birth attendants with direct and instant access to evidence-based and up-to-date clinical guidelines on Basic Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care.

The App leverages the growing accessibility of mobile phones to provide life-saving information and guidance through easy-to-understand animated instruction videos, action cards, and drug lists. It can serve as a training tool both in pre-and in-service training and equips birth attendants even in the most remote areas with a powerful on-the-job reference tool. 

The App consists of 13 modules, with each module containing five features: videos, practical procedures, action cards, a drug list, and a self-examination platform called MyLearning.

The clinical content in the global app versions is based on global WHO guidelines rather than the directives of a specific country. In Angola, the content was also validated by the Ministry of Health.

This App aims to reinforce the efforts to reduce the maternal mortality ratio (239 deaths per 100,000 live births). The high fertility and maternal mortality in Angola are linked to low family planning coverage (14 percent) and to the fact that 50 percent of births are performed without a skilled attendant.
