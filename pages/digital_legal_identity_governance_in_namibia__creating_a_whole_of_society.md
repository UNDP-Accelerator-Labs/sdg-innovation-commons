Digital Legal Identity Governance in Namibia: Promoting a rights-based approach as central to digital transformation in Namibia
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that digitalisation is catalysing the need for several institutions to develop digital systems; many of them seeking  to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.  However, the digital systems also collect personal and biometric data to both authenticate and verify an individuals' identity.  The governance of such systems as well as managing and storage captured personal data in the absence of a legal and policy framework is a challenge as this poses risks in terms of privacy. How might we introduce digital and legal identity safeguards while promoting UNDP's Model Governance Framework for Digital Identity as an entry point for ethical, accountable and improved service delivery?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The e-Governance Strategy and Action Plan launched by the Namibian Government and the 4th Industrial Revolution Report underscores the importance of information technology, the need for digitalisation and subsequent operations requiring human labour, with numerous new jobs created. While it will  take a long time to develop those systems, and while building them, there is a duty to be able to accommodate and meet the needs of the citizenry while upscaling and rescaling.  While many institutions at both private and public sector are digitalising and automating there has to be a conscious decision to educate all Namibians while maintaining those systems and  introducing safeguards while also  creating new jobs in future.

Government in the midst of finalising the Cyber Crime Bill and consolidated National ICT Policy | Namibia Economist

Namibia does not have a data protection and privacy law at the moment, but the right to privacy is enshrined in the Constitution12. Various sector-specific laws are in place to protect client information, including in the legal and banking sectors2. The Namibian Government has published the Draft Data Protection Bill, 20212.

Namibia does not have a data protection and privacy law at the moment, but the right to privacy is enshrined in the Constitution. Various sector-specific laws are in place to protect client information, including in the legal and banking sectors. The Namibian Government has published the Draft Data Protection Bill, 2021.  Equally, the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology is slow to advance the promulgation of the Cyber Crime (security) Bill, highlighting the numerous risks at all levels.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



There is no other UN Entity that is actively and as well positioned as UNDP given its role in advancing governance amidst the emerging digitalisation and tech revolution. The new portfolio approaches that UNDP appears to be leading on provide the Lab with an opportunity to set up a new digital and innovation portfolio as a service to the current programmes focusing  on the traditional  environment, inclusive green growth and governance agendas.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



If we highlight the importance of digital legal identity through this assessment, we will popularize the need to advance the process of e-governance reform in improving service delivery.  Through the process, we seek to influence polices which emphasize a rights - based  approach while reinforcing safeguards to protect data and identity in receiving service delivery.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Namibia is the first country to undertake this assessment which supersedes many of the early digital assessments undertaken by UNDP and other Agencies.  The Assessment will inform the governance and safeguard mechanisms  of data collected and stored by the Ministry of Home Affairs and encourage other use cases by other Ministries and Entities wishing to digitalize and verify the authentication of identity.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Administrative records: While there is a drive to digitalize administrative data prior to 1980, there is still a backlog which  has to be linked to the National Population Register.

Baseline Survey and Digital: Since this is the first Country to be assessed using this Digital Legal Identity Governance Model, baseline data is currently informing the use of the tool and assessment.

Focus Group and Qualitative Interviews: The main methodology used during the assessments are focus group sessions.

Policy Regulation and Laws: This has the ability to influence the current Legal Framework currently in Bill form.
