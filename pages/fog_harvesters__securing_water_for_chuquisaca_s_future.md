## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Fog Harvesters

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

01/12/2021

> What action learning plan is this activity related to?

The "Fog Harvesters" experiment is related to an action learning plan focused on climate resilience and water security. The plan addresses water scarcity in vulnerable communities by using fog-harvesting technology to collect water for both human consumption and agricultural use. It aligns with sustainable water management practices, promoting adaptation to climate change, and enhancing the livelihoods of rural families by providing an innovative, environmentally friendly solution to water access issue

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The activity aims to explore the effectiveness of fog-harvesting technology in addressing water scarcity for human consumption and agriculture in rural communities. It seeks to learn how this technology can improve water security and agricultural productivity under conditions of climate stress.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is crucial because it provides an innovative, sustainable solution to water scarcity, which is essential for the livelihoods of vulnerable communities facing the impacts of climate change. The project also promotes food security and community resilience​

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF fog-harvesting technology is implemented in vulnerable rural communities, THEN it will significantly improve access to clean water for human consumption.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Since the "Fog Harvesters" project was not implemented, the actions were not carried out. The proposal remained in the planning stage, despite the intent to install fog-harvesting systems and collaborate with PRODECO. Due to challenges, such as lack of execution, the project was never brought to the testing phase where the hypothesis could be validated​
