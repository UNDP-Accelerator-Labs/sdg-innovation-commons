## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Rural producers are often not keen to take on the management of e-commerce system and requires an aggregator, entrepreneur, or community to take on the role. The capacity for entrepreneurship and innovation requires different capacity building and specialisation from a different group of stakeholders.

2. Women are a good resource in managing the e-commerce ecosystem due to the fact that the majority of them are taking on homemaker roles and have more flexibility in managing the system. 95% of our entrepreneurs are women who are most willing to learn new skills in food processing and take on the aggregator/marketing role for the products.  However, they too struggle with childcare burdens and access to devices and capital due to gender inequality in accessing financial loans and stereotypical roles practices in communities.

3. Setting up an e-commerce system, onboarding the communities on the digital site, and inculcating digital literacy is just a simple first step but sustaining the business is a long process that requires multi-stakeholder collaboration, from product quality to consistent media marketing, to partner liaison for B2B partnerships, to certification of products for wider market access, to lowering logistics and delivery costs. It requires both public, private, and CSO to make it work for rural economic development while ensuring a green recovery and sustainable manner of development.

4. A strong champion in each locality is key in driving the digital economy. Eg. the newly set up e-commerce hub in Keningau is championed by one of our local entrepreneurs in ensuring organized and consistent supply and demand of products. The majority of the villages are not used to big bulk producing and there is a lack of natural resources as these micro and informal enterprises do not have big farms. We are also mindful to ensure it doesn't become an unsustainable mass production of businesses in the rural areas. 

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. The systemic challenges of inconsistent internet connectivity and electrification hampers the whole supply chain from production, processing to delivery.  Those are deep-seeded issues of urban-rural inequality that government initiatives have not been able to address for decades and are still ongoing struggles for the community. Alternative methods and solutions from private sectors eg. renewable energy for electrification and low bandwidth mechanisms need to be adopted for the rural community business ecosystem. 

2. social protection mechanisms and the lack of support during the COVID-19 for the rural community is an added blow to the already struggling communities imposed with movement control order nationwide. The communities are faced with additional challenges to commuting to receive cash assistance and to get essential supplies from the urban area eg. oil and salt to ensure business continuity and basic living necessities.

3. All modes of training and implementation has to be conducted virtually which is an additional challenge for rural communities who have lower digital/financial literacy and internet connectivity. The learning experience was an exponential one for the communities and requires a lot of handholding from the CSO and UNCDF local consultants. There have been several delays to visiting the remote villages for capacity building due to movement restrictions, which also hampers sensemaking, prototyping, and solution mapping processes in time for project changes to be made before funding/reporting cycle ends.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Focus group discussions and interviews were ideal methods used to engage with the rural producers through our implementing partners on the ground due to the lack of digital literacy and COVID-19 travel restrictions. Surveys and social media data were also utilised to understand the needs and behaviors of our sub-urban and urban customers. A value chain for an adapted ecosystem was also mapped out by understanding the current systems, issues behaviours and preferences from the users. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

A rural ecosystem for e-commerce is a new concept which the ministries have not gained notable success in mobilizing digital economy among the rural producers and entrepreneurs. Mapping out the current system and resources/assets in place for the rural community, we are then able pilot an ecosystem and experiment with different routes for an alternative ecosystem to be made available for rural economy. The process undertaken involves co-creation, design thinking, participatory designs enabled us to come up with a proof of concept that is more sustainable. Sensemaking and solutions mapping occurs throughout the process as new insights emerges.  
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

TONIBUNG and Moyog Innovation House (MIH) who are both social enterprises established from the local community. They played the role of an aggregator to connect the rural producers to the customers while supporting them in social development and environmental efforts. They are also our main hub to experiment with new product/food processing methods and capacity building for our rural counterparts.  They also help us gather feedback and user journeys throughout the process.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Indirectly, the CSOs are working with the academia for technological innovation in enhancing food preservation and processing methods to improve food shelf lives and organic products for e-commerce purposes.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with 

i) Easy Parcel-delivery company to build community capacity in packaging and delivering goods to customers, 

ii) Weave- media company for branding of Koondos platform

iii) B2B partners- villa resorts 

iv) Mark Baba Cultural Shop - FB Live training and product exhibition space

v) Maxis and Google Inc - Delivery on WhatsApp Business and Google My Business Training

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

i) Malaysia Global Innovation and Creativity Center - Provided matching grant for scaling purposes 

ii) SabahPay - provide training on state instituted e-wallets

iii) EPF and PERKESO Sabah - provide financial and microfinancing training for colleagues

iv) SCENIC Sabah - exhibition opportunities across Malaysia eg. KL City Art Festival

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The social enterprises are the unusual partners as traditionally all digital economy initiatives in rural areas by the government are conducted top down by trainers from government agencies, local councils and consulting firms with little participation from community enterprises and CSOs.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNCDF - They are our implementing partner in establishing the e-commerce system and ensure ongoing sustainability of the MSME businesses after project ends. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The innovation methods allowed us to understand the overall challenges in the system from the users perspective which traditionally not accounted for in national strategic papers and implementation plans. This includes social contracts, behaviors and underlying challenges such as corruption in fuel subsidies, the politicized reality for rural infrastructure eg. internet connectivity, roads and electrification. The experimental nature of the learning cycle using pilots, reiterative processes, prototypes and proof of concepts have also enabled us to gain new insights faster and provide customized solutions that works for the community. The data generated from social media and interviews also allow the community to better understand their local needs and the challenges that partners can support in rather than designing projects from generalised statistics and best practices from other locations that doesn't suit local context.
