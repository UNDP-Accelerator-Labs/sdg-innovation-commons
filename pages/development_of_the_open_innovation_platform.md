## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Part I - Development of the Open Innovation Platform In 2021, the AccLab team in Bosnia and Herzegovina mainly focused on the technical development of the Open Innovation Platform with the support of a local IT company. This was successfully finalized by the end of November 2021. Key insights related to this part are:  Developing a first in-country platform based on open innovation processes could be challenging, especially if you aim for several different thematic areas to be included on the Platform. In our case, we wanted the Platform to consist of the following sections: Innovation challenge space to enable the organization of innovation challenges; Hack the problem space to facilitate collective ideation and problem-solving; Learning space to provide access to innovative approaches and practices, and to inspire new thinking; Future-looking space to host the "Future Talks" as a series of future-oriented conversations; Experimentation space to host sandbox experimentation initiatives; and Innovation community space to enable registered participants to engage in activities/discussions in Platform's spaces.  The main challenge here was to share the same vision around how each specific section of the Platform should be designed and developed. Internal brainstorming design discussions were helpful in this situation, resulting in a shared vision captured in a detailed design of each platform space with graphical representation in Figma (Figma is a browser-based UI and UX design application with excellent design, prototyping, and code-generation tools). The internally agreed Platform design (containing both technical and visual preferred development directions) was shared with the IT company. It was also the basis of all further developmental activities related to the Platform and a very beneficial tool in communicating the Platform's vision during the sprint meetings held with the development company.  Test everything and test with everyone! This approach is crucial to developing something user-friendly. We were not o much focusing on this part during the development process in terms of testing the Platform so much with the external people, but this should be the priority from the outset. After several months of being deeply involved in the development process, one could be "lost" in the familiarity of Platfrom's logic, and in the end, everything seems logical and straightforward. However, the reality might differ for first-time Platform users. Lesson learned for the future: During the process of development of any digital tool/platform, behave like a lean start-up, and as soon as you developed a particular part, even as simple as the registration process for the Platform, test it with external people of all ages, genders, with different backgrounds and with different level of digital literacy, as this will give great insight on the user-friendliness of the tool/platform and overall concept behind the tool/idea.  It is beneficial to explore the existing solutions or similar Platforms and communicate the findings. The findings in this part could serve as food for thought and significant input for the IT company working on developing your platform solution.  It takes some time to create the intro content for the Platform through which you are introducing the users with different spaces on the Platform and how and for what they can use it, so it is wise to plan ahead. In the case of UNDP, the written content should be consulted with several different units/people, especially the communication unit, so that also needs to be taken into account.  As crucial documents to ensure that any user's (Data) rights are thoughtfully considered and articulated, Privacy policy and Terms and Conditions must be thoroughly prepared and in line with GDPR. Furthermore, these documents should be placed on the visible part of the Platform and included in the registration process, where it is mandatory to agree with these documents for the registration to be successful. A proper notification system (though email and on-platform notifications) should be enabled to signal any changes related to those two documents.    Part II - First innovation consultation process organized on the Platform  To respond to the urgent need of the initiative "Re-imagine my street," the AccLab team supported the organization of the first online consultations on the citizens' visions related to the urban transformation of Musala street in the City of Sarajevo through the Open Innovation Platform. The "Re-imagine my street" pilot initiative is jointly implemented by the Municipality of Centar, AccLab team UNDP Bosnia and Herzegovina, Faculty of Architecture, University of Sarajevo, and the City of Sarajevo, aiming to run inclusive transformation of five pilot public locations in the City of Sarajevo, one of them being Musala street. Prior to the online consultations, in October 2021, the Municipality of Center Sarajevo, with the support of the AccLab team, organized an on-street consultation workshop to collect ideas and suggestions of citizens on the future of Musala street. Based on initial ideas for the revitalization of this area, the Municipality of Centar Sarajevo, with the support of a wider project team, created four scenarios or conceptual solutions for the future of Musala Street. As part of the broader consultations with the citizens, four conceptual solutions were published on the Open Innovation Platform for public online voting and commenting from December 8, 2021, to January 6, 2022. As an additional type of presentation of the mentioned conceptual solutions, on December 23, 2021. in the neighboring high school Gimnazija Obala, the team behind the pilot initiative organized the virtual reality (VR) workshop where participants could "walk" the proposed solutions for the urban transformation of the street "Musala" in the virtual world through the use of VR technology. The Open Innovation Platform was also presented on this occasion, and people were invited to use it to cast their vote or share further ideas. Each of the four conceptual solutions for the urban transformation of Musala Street was presented on the Platform through a detailed description of a particular solution, a short virtual tour in the form of interactive panoramic images controllable by the user, and 3D video animation. Citizens were invited to visit all the proposed solutions on the Platform and get acquainted with the available content and share their opinion by anonymously clicking on the "Like" icon or, if a registered user, gave rating from 1 to 10 and share comments and describe in detail what they liked in the proposed solution, what they didn't like, or stating what is missing in the proposed solution. Based on the citizens' votes, ideas, and suggestions regarding the future looks and functions of Musala street, the Municipality will develop the main project and fund the implementation of the revitalization of this site. During the period that was open for voting (reactions, assessments, and comments of citizens), the Platform was visited by a total of 3,157 visitors, of which 2,163 were from the city of Sarajevo or 68.5%. In addition to most visitors from Bosnia and Herzegovina (88.3% of the total number of visitors), the Platform also recorded visits from Austria, the Netherlands, Croatia, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Germany, the United States, Sweden, etc. As this process was the first live "testing" of the Platform, the Lab team will further analyze the key insights and develop further actions around the results to improve the overall user experience of the Platform, not just for the users but also for the external partners. The proper promotion and utilization of the Platform are planned for 2022. It is perceived as a powerful tool for generating partnerships, especially with the unusual suspects in the context of UNDP CO.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

- Design thinking - to explore and convey the right vision of the Platforms among different teams involved in the development process.  - Google Analytics - to track the user's traffic, behavior on the Platform, and conversion rate from anonymous to the registered users. All this is in addition to the Platform's integrated analytics to ensure data validity.  - Spatial data - Considered by the experts' team during the creation of four scenarios/ conceptual solutions for the urban transformation of Musala Street in the City of Sarajevo.  - Collective intelligence - is one of the cornerstones of the Open Innovation Platform and is an integral part of everything that we did or plan to do on the Platform.   - Citizen data - data generated during the first online consultation process on the Platform will directly feed the final architectural/infrastructure project to be implemented on-site. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

- Co-creation and participatory design - great focus on co-creation and participatory design from the initial setup of the Platform's design and desired functions to the preparation of the first consultation process organized through the Platform.  - Crowdsourcing - "Re-imagine my street - Musala" online consultation process resulted in crowdsourcing ideas for the future looks and function of the Musala street in the City of Sarajevo.
