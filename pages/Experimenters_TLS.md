# "Timor Leste Accelerator Lab: Innovative Solutions for COVID-19 Challenges and Sustainable Development"

### [[0:00]] OK, we are rolling\. Tell me your full name, your title and say I give consent to be recorded\.

My name is Julio Fernandes Pinto\. I am a head of experimentation from Timor Leste Accelerator Lab\. And yeah, I think OK to be recorded\.

### [[0:23]] Perfect\. Over to you\.

### [[0:24]] Could you tell me about an R&D activity that you would like to share?

[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Beyond borders]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
Yeah, I come from background\. I have no background of R&D, but my journey of R&D started when I joined the accelerator lab back in 2021 with some of activities we conducted previously in lab\. In 2019 when COVID hit us in our country, there was a lot of problems went on and we started to look at COVID was one of starting point to me to start my journey of R&D\. The activities we conducted were so on how we can tackle the issue of COVID, rapid response to COVID in 2019\. It was when there was PPE run out\. We start to do sort of research online\. What can we do to help this COVID\-19 issue in whole countries?

### [[1:37]] How did it come about and where did it start?

[[tools:Quasi expermental design processes]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Finding new alternatives]]
It was all about how we can provide the solution to the problems of COVID\. That time we address in a way where there was no PPE, no equipment that help people in grounds\. So with the UNDP project at that time to 2019, they left starting and we UNDP has innovation lab\. We start conducting research online\. How can we help? So I started by using 3D printer\. At that time, I myself was the one who did conduct the research\. What can we do to help these people? So we sort out the this and we actually using TD printed tools to help people in the ground\. We printed the face seal more than 1000 to give it to front liners\. But before that it was involved a lot of process\.

### [[2:45]] Yeah\. What was the development issue that you were addressing?

One was the innovation we injected into that where 3D printer is something very new in Timor and we created products that help people printed this to help the front liner to address this COVID\-19 problems\. And this is new\. This is we think that is very innovative, a way that you know, country has never experienced before\.

### [[3:20]] What did the situation look like?

The situation could be I would say it was very difficult, challenging at that time, very challenging for all stakeholders include government, private sectors to give a hand how we can contributed and support\. So they let play an important role\. Accelerator Lab especially at that time play very important role with UNDP play important roles in shaping this and helping to solve the issue\. I could say using a simple method, R&D tools and method that we can simplify in a way that anyone can use\.

### [[4:09]] And who was involved in your journey? What was their role?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
We work with the government, especially Minister of Health and then some of the private sector like innovation companies at that time to address the issue together, but with common ground which we sit together\. Before that we need to you know lay down our you know idea what we can do together at that time there was a lot of valuable insight related with R&D perspective\. I would pick some of very important was the Co creation with the Co creation and some of method we use like experimentation method with prototyping was play an important roles on that and collective intelligent workshop\. We did some of stock taking work workshop involved in the process\. But I would extend the idea not only on the COVID response activities, but in Timo we also did some of activities in in the in the journey of the R&D with green building design challenge\. So we did in 2019 this this is all new ideas that we trying to embedded and introduces to the youth and the universities schools in Timor\.

### [[5:57]] What tool and method did you use to do what you just described in one?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
[[skills:Innovation management]]
[[tools:Innovation challenge]]
Innovation is something very complex and new in Timor, I would say\. And when we trying to introduce innovation is something very challenging because many people still, you know, still stand with this status quo with the traditional practice of doing things\. And we trying to with the lab method, we trying to introduce some of new idea with technology and innovation into the system\. It actually very difficult and challenging because it's forsaking the ground with, with something people already used to do it\. And when we try to bring the idea in table it also, you know, create a lot of skills like challenges that people face and with the labs\. Another thing also in in country office like UNDP country office level, they still not fully aware of this R&D is this innovation especially accelerator method practices that we are trying to advocate\.

### [[7:23]] Yeah\. What must be outcome of your all and journey?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
I would say firstly the new way of doing things that we trying to introduce with the activities we did\. One is we do it differently\. We do the sensemaking workshop to know that this this thing has not been done before\. And we trying to research the new ideas and new practices through the network that we have left\. And we found a lot of ideas which is actually new to, to, to, to introduce and some of some of idea actually very valuable, especially in helping, you know, development country\. I would take some example like a process like top down is one of very crucial in in in our country because countries using like method of top down, everything is coming from top to the grounds, but left actually reverse the idea we actually trying to introduce from bottom up\. So those are the example that you know, we can say that out very bring very big outcomes in and some of tools like collective intelligent workshop, we did some of portfolio of experimentation, co\-creation, design thinking, human centered design\. All these activities we integrated into all our practices, all our activities that we do in country and these are very new in in in country level\.

### [[9:20]] How did your work impact sustainable development?

Yes, something was very impressive was that we look in in different way different perspective when we talk about innovation more on sustainability side, which I don't think it's a more in the governments doing things or maybe UNDP other UN agencies\.

### [[9:47]] But let's focus on something more sustainable, impact driven and also something created changes in the ground\. What would you do if you had to start a game?

I would say that maybe we need to be, we need to be used to the method and tools with Accelerator lab tools because it's very challenging and we need to do more advocacy work because mean only not much people are aware, especially people in the grounds when we talk about innovation is something very new to them and we are trying to embed the idea of innovation into the development DNA\. It's very difficult because we need to do more advocacy work\.

### [[10:46]] What strategy or approaches did you employ to facilitate the decision and adoption of your O&D outcomes?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
This is quite hard to me\. I think the things that we, we labs are doing normally is that we research some of existing ideas and we try to expand and scale up all the existence ideas into in in the country level\. And then we bring it forward\. And that's the first\. The second we also trying to introduce new idea using technology innovations\. Like I mentioned 3D printer use the something that country has never experienced and it's, it's very new\. And all the method and tools\. Thirdly is all the method and tools that we using is something completely new\. Example horizon scanning method, which I think when they, they let us start that we advocate a lot of this method and tools\. Some of its changes diffuse in the, you know, government's policies\. One of things that I noticed back in 2023 country actually continuous development document plan, they actually adopted some of the method that we have like horizon scanning method to, to frame their documents development documents\. This is something very crucial that I don't, I think it's very important to mention communities or other key actor to catalyze broader change or impact based on your own work\. I think the partnership with the government and private sectors are very crucial\. The one of the techniques we using is we are using as we because only lab members are not enough to advocate this innovation\. So one of the techniques we use was that our previous labors they many of them moved to the government offices\. So we approach them individually to help lab to promote all the works into government\. And then with second, we also wanted to kind of institutionalize the lab it to make it more easier, to make it more feasible\. And then it can create more collaborative works with the government and also NGO and then academia and other stakeholders\.

### [[13:37]] Thank you so much for your time questions\. And one, just one more questions, can you elaborate on the principle that guided your all in the world? Why? Why were they important?

[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:De-risking the intervention by promoting an incremental approach trough R&D]]
One of the very crucial method we use is to simplify the R&D method that the normal R&D like universities are doing or scientific research are doing\. We need to simplify the R&D method so that many people can absorb technologies and they can use it to solve this complex issue challenges facing the community\. If we take R&D still same as previous what academic doing, it will be very complicated to put into practice\. And I think this philosophy is what is I like about the lab is we need to do it in a in a collective way and it is in a simple way that you know others has never done\.

### [[14:52]] Should I ask one more question?

### [[14:54]] No thank you\. I should probably wrap up because now those ladies are waiting\.

### [[15:01]] Thanks for the your time and info\.

Thank you\.
