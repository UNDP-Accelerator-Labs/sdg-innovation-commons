Elhee - Negee is a youth-led movement that aims to nurture and build a generation of young people connected to the reefs and natural environment around them. The movement started as an initiative to clean up litter from picnic goers on sandbanks close to the island of Alifu Alifu Rasdhoo. Since then, the initiative has expanded with a focus on working with schools, divers, and dive centers to provide young people with an opportunity to learn knowledge and skills needed to spend more time in the ocean. Recently the Elhee-Negee organized a PADI aware week which saw the organisation of marine education workshops and activities for students and community including two PADI courses (PADI aware and PADI coral conservation) for school students. During this week, the group secured sponsorships for four school students to get certified as PADI open water divers and for one individual from the community to get a PADI Master Diver certification.
