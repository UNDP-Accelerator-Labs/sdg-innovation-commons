> Brief description of the innovation

Online School Reporting System (OSRS). 
OSRS’s main goal is to help schools improve reporting and management of school resources inventory. The application is designed to be used by all school types, pre-school, primary, basic, secondary and high schools. It is designed to host many schools and our future plans include deploying the system in other countries like Malawi, Mozambique, and Botswana etc. The system allows for different profiles to be created for each school with functions that allow for administrators, teachers, accountants, secretaries and registrar to enter, track and review records/reports conveniently. OSRS is a Web, USSD and SMS based system targeting to be used by schools for pupils management and electronic reporting. Parents will be able to access the system via USSD and Web. Parents can view their children’s performance and school fees payment status. Pupil’s results are sent to parents via SMS and Email.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Revenue Generation Method &amp; Market Overview 
-	Revenue generation method
Service users will be required to pay a subscription fee. The fee will be paid online or at Megalphas offices, Megalphas will bill the subscriber credit card during subscription and subscription auto-renew (if user is still active). 
Population of pupils and growing access to mobile phones
-	Popular from grade 5 to grade 12. 

Market Dynamics and Competition
-	The targets service beneficiaries are primary and secondary schools
-	Subscription by the private and NGO funded schools  will require active business development
-	Subscription by the government schools will require project adoption by the government. Previously concerns have been raised with regards to the lack of a platform like OSRS to help enhance school record administration in the country. Megalphas can therefore take opportunity to offer such a system.
-	The products main competitor is Graduating E-school (http://zamed.net/Account/Login.aspx) which offer a local based software with limited functionalities and user friendly features. Their approach has many disadvantages which include:
o	Not easy to distribute updates as the system is not online and centralized. Each school is required to host its own system
o	Poor interfaces and does not provide USSD as it is not online.
o	Poor pupils school journey management, if a pupil transfers from one school to another, parents have to request information from different schools to view all pupil details.
o	Does not have an online interface. 
o	No indication to enable electronic school fees payment.

Competitive Advantages;
-	Adaptability to several types of learning institutions, ease in access and use as it includes Web, USD/SMS as well as the android application

Potential Regional Opportunity;
-	Immediate market opportunity consists of Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia and Malawi
-	Long term market opportunity consists of regional country in the Southern and Central Africa

Market Size and Marketing Strategies;
The market size of the Online School Reporting System (OSRS) consists of all private, government and NGO funded primary and secondary schools in the country. The services will carry a charge at of USD99.9 per year.  The market size is illustrated in the table below: 
 
Market Strategy;
-	Active business development by engaging private and public schools, NGO’s and relevant youth groups to demonstrate how the platform works and engage new clients. Limited training in usage of the platform will be required as it is user friendly.
-	Proposal to the Ministry of Education and active follow ups to ensure that the product is adopted country wide. Inquiries in this regards have revealed that no potent proposal has come through for the development of a Centralized electronic administration system for the schools.

Other Revenue Sources
1.	USSD Short Code Rental
After the purchase of the short code and integration to the MNOs for USSD, Megalphas will be offering USSD application development and hosting on our short code by doing access string extensions. There is a high demand for USSD applications by startups but they luck funds for short codes and hosting resources, also the expertise to develop the applications.
2.	SMS API
After the integration to the MNOs for SMS sending, Megalphas will develop and API that can be used by startups or individuals to send SMSs. They will have the profile on the system that will enable them to check the statistics and view billing details. MNOs do not provide HTTP APIs for sending SMSs, startups are required to do complicated SMPP configurations and setup VPN connections just for SMS sending. There is a high demand for this, local applications can stop using international APIs.
3. IT Consultancy Services &amp; Clients Systems Implementation
Megalphas also provides IT consultancy services to companies and will increase efforts in this regards to ensure additional revenues for operations. We also provide systems design and implementation for clients after analyzing their requirements. Our main area of focus is web services design, implementation and support, USSD application design, implementation and support (with our own short code, we can also provide USSD apps hosting using the short code access string technique i.e. *100*500# triggers another application). We also provide web dashboards and android applications design, implementation and support.
