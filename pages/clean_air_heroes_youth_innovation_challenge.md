## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Clean Air Heroes Youth Innovation Challenge 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that air pollution is a cross-cutting issue affecting Thailand, especially the northern region. The sources of air pollution are diverse, and people often feel that the issues must be addressed from top-down. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Air pollution has been threatening the human health and well-being as no one is unaffected by dirty air. In many countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, air pollution (outdoor and indoor) is the greatest cause of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), responsible for more than 2 million premature deaths (UNEP, 2019). Both outdoor air pollution and low physical activity-lifestyle are important environmental risk factors of the NCDs including cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes. In the Asia Pacific Region, NCDs are now the most significant cause of death and disease and as a result impose substantial social burden and economic costs (Low et al, 2015). The Government of Thailand determined key contributors to poor air quality to include agricultural burning and forest fires in rural areas, vehicular emissions and constructions in the cities, and industrial discharges in concentrated industrial zones (Pollution Control Department, 2019). Provinces in the northern Thailand have suffered from pollutants caused by local contributors as well as transboundary flow of haze from Lao PDR and Myanmar.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

With our concept of grassroots innovations, Accelerator Lab Thailand seeks to promote the development of solutions by local actors in Chiang Rai province. Local youth are empowered to develop their own social innovation initiatives and collaborate with local stakeholders including the local government, CSO, and experts to tackle the issues in their own communities.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We want to know what action local youth think they can take in collaboration with other local stakeholders to address air pollution issues in their communities. 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

A youth social innovation challenge in Chaing Rai province will be launched to create engagement of local youth along with multisectoral stakeholders to identify local innovations and empower youth to develop and test their solutions. The youth social innovation challenge will utilize a wide range of innovative methodologies from UNDP Accelerator Lab and Youth Co:Lab such as sensemaking, grassroot innovations mapping, system thinking, co-creation, experimentation, among others to gain insights on air pollution issue and potential solutions. The Challenge will consist of 5-day training workshops for local youth, mentorship, a local pitching, experimentation period, sharing forum, and a final presentation session. Stakeholders including local government authorities, private sector, academia and experts, as well as local communities will be involved to foster a sense of ownership and localization process.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The youth innovation challenge will engage local youth, move them away from the perspective that addressing air pollution issues are out of their reach, and urge them to come up with fresh ideas on solutions that work for their communities. It will add the bottom-up approach and perspective of the new generation to the air pollution issues. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Take up by local government and stakeholders to continue engaging with local youth and communities in finding local solutions to issues that affect Thailand at a national level.
