> Title of the innovation

Job opportunities

> Brief description of the innovation

Dear UPND
I congratulate you on winning the presidential elections. Alot of people voted so that they can see change and this one of the good things you've done for us by asking us how we can have polish up our economy. I think the best you can do is try as much as possible to create alot of job opportunities to youths I have noticed that alot of people are working due to having connections instead of good grades try to visit institutions and find out whether everyone they qualifie to be an employee another thing is that try as much as possible to encourage us to come up with entrepreneur skills especially those people who have made it in life so that they can create space for the unemployed youths in their working sectors and they can employ them in their business. Let us as a nation work together and not rely too much on other nation's we can't do everything alone but atleast we can try and I believe we can do it as long as we stay and stand together. Help us understand that you won't put money in our pockets by just sitting and waiting for you put it in our pockets but rather we work hard and earn it. Thank you.

It will be able to create alot of job opportunities for slot of youths out there. Alot of people will engage in businesses and that will need employees leaving less unemployed people in the state. For me I'm still a student and if you get rid of this messed up situation where only those with connections get employed I believe omec I'm done with my degree in Pharmacy I will be able to get a job as soon as possible.
