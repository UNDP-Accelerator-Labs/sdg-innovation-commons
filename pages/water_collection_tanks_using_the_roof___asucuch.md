Description: The Association of Organizations of the Cuchumatanes has promoted this project as a measure of adaptation to climate change, focusing on the effects of droughts. The system they use captures the water through sheets of Aluzinc, then conducts the water into a PVC channel and finally settles inside a water tank. At the bottom is installed a multi connector that allows the extraction of water.
