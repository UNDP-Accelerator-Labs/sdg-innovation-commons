This solution was mapped thanks to the third edition of the challenge "Innovating together for children and sustainable development", which aimed to boost solutions that had an impact on clean and affordable energy or solid and liquid waste management. It is a sustainable solution for small-scale energy generation, with the capacity to adapt to demand, it does not require reservoirs that affect river flows, reduced or no deforestation due to power transmission lines and, unlike other renewable energy sources, there is the potential for generation throughout the day, which reduces the need for energy storage systems.
