> Brief description of the innovation

These are fire blocks and briquettes made from agriculture waste. The blocks burn for 6 hours, are low in carbon monoxide, produce little to no smoke and are an alternative energy to charcoal.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income from profits made from sales and it will also create employment for some individuals. The target market is the whole country as most if not all zambian households use charcoal during power cuts or just for the preference of charcoal grilled food. The prize will help the business grow by acquiring the necessary machinery and higher production of the organic charcoal. It will help the environment as it is eco friendly and will prevent loss of 4000 - 5000 hectares of forest cover. The main source of charcoal is trees, if the country at large can start using green fire blocks instead then we would greatly cut down on deforestation and this would lead to restoration of land ecosystems in turn help to partly tackle climate change.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed by burning without oxgen then crushed into a powder which is solidified into blocks. We have a few samples which have been tried and tested. The implementation plan is to raise funds so that production can be increased and we can also be able to package the product in different quantities and sizes.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will improve the lives of others health wise as it is organic and produces very low carbon monoxide. On a larger scale it will also create employment. It is relevant to the current market as it will curb some of the climate change impacts that are dangerously increasing everyday. It will also cut down on the ongoing deforestation in Zambia.
