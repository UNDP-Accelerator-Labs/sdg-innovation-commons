At some point in life, you've likely felt lonely and suffered because of it. This deeply human emotion, once seen as primarily a personal experience, is now emerging as a hallmark of our times. Its manifestations are diverse: older adults facing the loss of loved ones or grappling with changing family dynamics; young people struggling to build social connections due to excessive screen time, which—alongside other factors—limits the development of interpersonal skills. Unwanted loneliness has become a growing public health concern, with many considering it a new epidemic that requires prevention and assistance efforts.This development challenge is linked to increased risks of cardiovascular diseases, dementia, depression, and higher mortality rates. Beyond age, unwanted loneliness—affecting both personal and community well-being—is associated with factors like the imbalance between work and personal life, the absence of common goals or meaningful social relationships, disconnection from nature, and the lack of fulfilling activities.
Other contributing elements include:technological dependence;the lingering effects of the pandemic (especially among younger populations);labor market challenges (layoffs, loss of status, etc.);changes in family dynamics;population aging;substance abuse;ageist narratives that reinforce social stigma;social pressures, and more.
International initiativesIn response, various countries have begun implementing targeted initiatives. Noteworthy examples come from the United Kingdom, Japan, Denmark, and Spain. The UK's University of the Third Age (U3A) promotes learning, collaboration, and enjoyment through local interest groups that foster informal education, knowledge exchange, and social interaction.Japan developed Fureai Kippu, a 'time currency' system that allows people to earn credits by helping older adults, promoting intergenerational solidarity. Denmark’s Cohousing Communities offer collaborative housing models where people of different ages live together to strengthen social bonds and reduce isolation. In Spain, the ONCE Foundation established the State Observatory of Unwanted Loneliness, aimed at raising awareness and generating knowledge on the issue.Beyond these examples, various intervention strategies have emerged. These include public campaigns to raise awareness, reduce stigma, and encourage individual and collective action; specific programs offering accessible housing solutions for young people in exchange for companionship and assistance with household tasks for older adults; and community volunteering opportunities, among others.
The key aspects of the initiativesBroadly, these initiatives share several common patterns:They adopt a community-based approach, fostering connections through networks, cultural activities, and public spaces.They promote intergenerational exchange, encouraging learning and solidarity.They integrate urban planning by designing public spaces that promote social interaction, accessibility, and the integration of green areas to reinforce community ties and collective well-being.Digital initiatives aim to enhance education, civic participation, and inclusion, tailored to the demographic characteristics of target populations or other specific factors. While digital tools cannot replace in-person interactions, they are particularly useful in low-density areas or for people with reduced mobility. Some strategies also focus on minimizing excessive technology use and mitigating negative consequences.While national plans exist, many initiatives are driven at the municipal level, as the creation and strengthening of community networks are the primary resources for addressing unwanted loneliness.Partnerships between governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector are promoted to expand the reach and impact of these initiatives. This framework offers a valuable opportunity to develop research and development (R&D) strategies with potential for future growth. It combines knowledge generation for action, collective intelligence exercises, consensus-building among diverse stakeholders, and the design, evaluation, and adaptation of innovative interventions to promote public policies that foster connection. At the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Accelerator Lab, we are beginning to explore this path—and, of course, we don't want to be alone.
