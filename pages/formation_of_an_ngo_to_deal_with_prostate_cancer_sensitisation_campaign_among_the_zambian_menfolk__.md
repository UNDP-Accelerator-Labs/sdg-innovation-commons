> Title of the innovation

Formation of an NGO to deal with prostate cancer sensitisation campaign among the Zambian menfolk so to reduce the needless loss of life to prostate cancer due to lack of knowledge about the disease.

> Brief description of the innovation

The Prostate Cancer Campaign -Zambia (PCCZ), was created to fill the vacuum of lack of  information on the causes, risk factors and symptoms of prostate cancer. There has been some information dissemination on breast, cervical and childhood cancers but nothing on prostate cancer, despite the fact that all black men are potential victims of the disease in advanced age if they do not lead a healthy lifestyle. The organization aims at reaching out to all men in Zambia through public and social media, as well as, community outreach activities.  The theme of the project is "Sharing Knowlege in order to Save Lives"
