Testing the Development of a Local Certification Scheme for Agro-Processed Products
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that local agro-processed products are finding it difficult to enter formal retail markets and remain in the informal economy

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

A FINSCOPE survey (FMT, 2017) states that ninety-two (92) percent of the country’s MSMEs are micro-enterprises, and 75% percent of them are in the informal sector. The FINSCOPE study further identified top five barriers that are common among MSME’s, and poor market access was one of the top five barriers. MSMEs are predominantly owned by individuals with limited formal education. Access to new technology for production, market information and access to credit from financial institutions remain restricted. This invariably limits the level of innovation and growth that could translate into greater economic impact.  The stagnation of the MSME sector has also been compounded by the lack of market access, particularly for MSME’s who are in the manufacturing sector. Local products are still perceived as lacking the necessary market value or pedigree to access mainstream market channels such as in retail outlets. Quality assurance and market standard production processes which inter alia includes sanitary and phytosanitary measures remain a major barrier for local products. Quality standards required by retail outlets are high and this is because major retailer outlets have become increasingly regionalized within the SADC region and as such hold significant buying power and market influence. As a result of risks associated with agro processed products dominated by small informal producers (cottage enterprises), retail outlets tend to shy away from these, and local MSME’s or producers are often forced to distribute their products in low-value informal markets, thus limiting their ability to grow. The sense making process undertaken by the Lab revealed that certification can cost an average of E200,000.00 ($12,000), a number that is too far out of reach for the local MSME, and this is mostly because, certification, even for local products is based in international standards, and not all of the certification processes (i.e. products testing), can be done locally.  There is also an inherent bias by consumers who prefer South African and international products because historically it is all they have known. While the product may be good, at times they suffer poor production standards which may be a deterrent to both retailers and consumers. At the present moment, there many local SME’s producing a variety of product but are not known and have not been able to place their products in retail outlets. This unfortunately stunts the MSME development in the country leading to stagnant growth of MSMEs and high unemployment rates.    For this challenge the Acc Lab has partnered with those involved or those who can held with solutions to it. these include the Small and Medium Enterprise development Company (SEDCO) a government owned SME development company; the MSME Unit as well as the Regulatory and Quality Infrastructure Department (RQID) under the Ministry Commerce Industry and Trade; the Eswatini Standards Authority (SWASSA) and local MSMEs.

a. https://legacy.export.gov/article?id=Eswatini-Agricultural-Sector – this fact sheet demonstrates that most of the products consumed in the country are imported from South Africa and other SADC countries. This includes products that the country has the capacity to produce  b. https://www.fao.org/3/cc0560en/cc0560en.pdf - this document demonstrates that Eswatini relies on South Africa for about 70% of its imports. It continues to state that Eswatini high dependence on imports to feed its people and that national production is constrained by frequent and prolonged droughts, erratic rainfall, inadequate farming technologies, low investment in seeds, fertilizers and equipment, and structural barriers preventing access to formal markets. Additionally, value chain development and the commercialization of smallholder agriculture are notable challenges and important elements of the country’s strategy to increase economic growth in rural areas and improve food security and nutrition outcomes.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The country has struggled to bring together the resources and partners that are necessary in solving this challenge. An effort has been made to encourage MSMEs to get certification for their products but the high costs of certification have continued to present a barrier. The Lab will use its different protocols for sense making, solutions mapping and collective intelligence and UNDP’s convening power to bring together the stakeholders that are required to map and co-design solutions for this challenge. UNDP Eswatini is also currently working on the development of an Enterprise Supplier Development (ESD)Program that aims to link MSMEs with retail markets. this experiment will provide the lessons on which this program will build upon

SEDCO is a government owned company established to create, develop, and promote (MSMEs) in the Kingdom of Eswatini. They exist primarily to stimulate homegrown entrepreneurship with sustainable economic growth through entrepreneurship development and growth. SEDCO has several programmes which inter-alia include business incubation, market facilitation, one household one product campaign and capacity building on business and product development. They are therefore a key stakeholder in the development of a certification scheme for local products and will provide the necessary experience and technical advice during the development and testing of the scheme.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

UNDP Eswatini is currently working on the development of an Enterprise Supplier Development (ESD)Program that aims to link MSMEs with retail markets. this experiment will provide the lessons on which this program will build upon. MSMEs that have been wanting to get certified but could not afford it will also benefit from our work on this challenge.  SWASA also stands to benefit as such a scheme will give them the miliage they need to get certain accreditations
