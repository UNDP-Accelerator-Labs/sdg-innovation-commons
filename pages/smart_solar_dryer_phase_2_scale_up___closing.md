## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Updated Technology: The second

phase of testing allowed the team to increase the efficiency and capacity of

the dryer. This resulted in better quality goods after drying. The next steps

would be to continue finding ways to optimize the dryer and scaling it to other

locations.

Community Empowerment: Training

was given to over 50 farmers and entrepreneurs from the informal sector on

maintenance, food processing and marketing, with 90% of them women.

Entrepreneurs sold their products through monthly booth events and were able to

earn about RM150-200 per month as side income.  

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Our work has been picked up by UNDP for food system R&amp;D and the government and has now expanded the project concept to other locations under the Green Facility Fund of US$1.5 million. The handover of the SMART solar dryer was accompanied by training on how to maintain and use the equipment over the long term. The training involved over 50 farmers and entrepreneurs. It also include training on food drying, packaging and marketing.
## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Collective intelligence allowed the project to utilize feedback from farmers and entrepreneurs in providing solutions for upskilling. This feedback along with partners like TONIBUNG who have deep insights into rural indigenous issues allowed for very targeted interventions

to increase capacity.

Data and knowledge were sourced from other solar dryer prototypes by our partner EbF and other open source knowledge from countries that have utilized solar dryers.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

If community farmers and entrepreneurs were not engaged and immersed in the project, then our activities would have had little value as they would not have met the needs of the communities. Having two community-based civil society partners allowed the benefit of unique insights in project execution. It also ensure that the solar dryer would not be a white elephant and will be utilised continuously by the communities are the end of the project.

> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

TONIBUNG used their in house expertise to engineer the SMART solar dryer and train farmers in using it. Moyog Innovation House used their expertise to provide the training of entrepreneurs in food processing and marketing. Global Peace Foundation facilitated trainings specifically in Pahang.

AGC Green Tech and Ebf provided technical expertise for the SMART solar dryer prototypes and Solar collector materials - ETFE films.

## End
****

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The stakeholder engagements allowed for iteration and improvement on the SMART solar dryer eg. the dome structure that enabled more solar collection, lower drying time and higher

volume of drying. It allowed products with high moisture content eg. meat and tubers to be dried in the efficiency similar to conventional oven without the high cost of electricity.
