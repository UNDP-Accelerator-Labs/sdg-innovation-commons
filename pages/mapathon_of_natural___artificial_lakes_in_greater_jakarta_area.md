## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

1. To elevate the type and quality of data sources for government partners. 2. To bring about insights regarding flood mitigation potential attributable to artificial and natural lakes and forthcoming governance issues and needs. 3. To encourage citizen science and data empowerment approach, whereby data collated by citizens will be analyzed by mapping experts and made accessible to public

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the environment, economic, social, and governance aspects of natural and artificial lakes in Greater Jakarta are mapped and published, then the government and public can access the data for further decision-making processes on flood mitigation and community resilience

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Preparation & coordination, surveyor selection & training, satellite imagery and field data collection, report & publication

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Environment, economic, social, and governance aspects of natural and artificial lakes in Greater Jakarta

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Field survey, interview, government data, citizen data

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?
