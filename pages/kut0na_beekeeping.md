> Title of the innovation

kut0na beekeeping

> Brief description of the innovation

Kutona beekeeping and its products is an agribusiness operating in the agricultural industry. It was born due to household poverty, Honey has been cited to have a number of health  and nutrition and pharmaceutical benefits. As such everyone is rushing for the sale of the organic honey overlooking the honey comb therefore as Kutona beekeeping we thought it would be a great innovation if we start working with the beekeepers on an off take basis or just buying from them the honey combs which we processes using simple machines to beeswax. Beeswax is the creamy coloured substance used by bees to build the comb that forms the structure of their nests therefore this makes it clear on how pure beeswax. Beeswax is a very valuable product that can provide a wealth while income in addition to honey.  One kilogram of beeswax is weaith more than one kilogram of honey. Unlike honey beeswax is not a food product and its simpler to deal with it does not require careful packaging which make it easy for storage and transport. We sale the beeswax in its natural form after the production but we intend to start adding value to it by producing cosmetics,cadles.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

this innovation generates  income through the sale of the beeswax we have been facing a challenge of not meeting the target market of the beeswax therefore we intend to increase the number of out growers so that we can increase the production of the beeswax. our target market for now is the Zambian market which we normally sell to people that are into skin care and cosmetics aswe3ll as the retailers ., we believe that the entrepreneurial spirit of young Zambian’s is strong and an important asset for sustained economic growth and social cohesion. As such we are managing a social enterprise that focuses on producing bee wax for profit optimization to the promoters and financial empowerment to the small-scale farmers that we engage for improved social livelihoods while contributing to effective climate management by engaging in a business model which reduces deforestation.
 this innovation can assist in the sense that that that have sensitive skin can be able to use products that will improve the skin and our out growers will be able to make extra income The Zambian market has market opportunity of about $600,000 per annum. We are currently producing 500 tongs from 100 out-growers and our target is to work with 5000 out-growers to meet the target of the $10000,  shortage on the Zambian market. The value addition we would want to start is making our own beauty cosmetics, candles etc.

> Technical Feasibility

for now  our only product is beeswax its the only product we have on the Zambian market.  Kutona beekeeping is a social enterprise that deals in primary the agriculture. We are working with out growers we only buy the honey comb from them that we process  from the forest of Mwinilunga using top bar hives and bark hives which we are phasing out as it has a negative impact on the environment. our plan is to first saturate the Zambian market.  our plan is to increase production and see to it that we are able to meet the target market wee want to als0 increase the number of out growers  in the sense that we can also have the right machines to help us with adding value to the bees wax. Providing a complete solution across the organic honey supply chain through working with beekeepers by introducing better beekeeping technique for sustainable source of income and reduction of deforestation and also The project will act as an intervention by making bee keeping farmers to understand the value of tress and thereby creating a positive a long-lasting transformational impact on their livelihoods and environment

> Anticipated Social Impact

Given the social impact nature of the project, 500 additional households will be equipped with knowledge and new skills to engage in better means of financial generation activities while at the same time being given knowledge on how to protect the environment and ecosystem in which they operate, thereby preserving the environment and helping with climate change management. This will be measured through the number of farmers that will be supported by the project during its duration. This will not only have positive environmental impact but reduce household poverty, allowance  to send their children to school and allow them to purchase other farming inputs for increased crop production.
