> Title of the innovation

Plastic recycling initiative

> Brief description of the innovation

Plastic recycling initiative,is one of bliriant initiative aimed at reducing land pollution caused by excessive use of plastics that can't decompose.platics can be melted,then put in special designed mold and new things can be made like booths used by Airtel and MTN money,more important booth structures can morderated and be used on pitratrins toilets as many zambians can't afford to build toilets due to increase in prices of cement and roofingsheets.every toilet requires a slab(flow) for it to be cleaned but many don't such toilets hence this project can be of help to the people of Zambia.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Plastic recycling initiative can generate income for me by selling booths and modified toilets made from plastics.This initiative many people can benefit from it,it can create jobs in the following ways
* People who will be collecting plastics from different places can be employed.
* People who will be buying those plastics collected from different places. 
* People who will be processing those plastics
* People who will making the actual booth or plastic mordified toilets.
* People who will be selling the booths.
This initiative will also help already existing businesses that uses booths to have more booths at the market at the cheaper price that many can afford and this will lender businesses to grow as More people will participate on the market.
  The value of this initiative on this environment is that it will reduce Land pollution, many areas will be clean as more people will be there to collect plastics and sell to plastic recycling initiative, clean environment.

> Technical Feasibility

Plastic recycling initiative,is aimed at making booths from plastics by collecting the plastics, melting the plastics, putting the melted plastics in mold designed to suit the size and the type of Booth, arranging the parts made from each mold and form a proper booth.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation can improve the lives of others by,
1: job creation
2: cheaper booths on the market
3: clean environment ( reduction in huge amount of garbages at the garbage sites and reduced land pollution).
 Toilets made from plastics are of help to the poor zambians because once that toilet is installed,it's easy to remove it in cases where the pitratrin is full than those made of cement,those made of cement once it's full the own looses almost everything, cement toilet can't be reinstalled but toilet walls made from plastics can be renistalled thereby reducing the expenditure of poor zambians.
 This innovation is very much relavant to the current market because very few companies that recycle plastics in Zambia and the same companies are only found in the capital city of Zambia only, the rest of towns have no such companies.and also they are very few companies that makes booths and the companies that are there, they don't use plastics, they use ironsheets meaning we will be one of the best companies if given a chance to implement this project because many of people can benefit and it can also reduce Epidemics such as cholera that had hit Zambia 2018.
