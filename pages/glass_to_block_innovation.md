> Title of the innovation

Glass to Block innovation

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is about picking glass bottles that people dispose and making them into bricks used for building. 
We crush the bottles and mix them with cement to become bricks which can be used for building houses toilets and other infrastructure that requires bricks.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The bricks are demanded everywhere that means they have a high market demand,the only thing pulling us back is lack of processing materials.The business has zero loss because we are not buying bottles but rather picking them from bars and other gabbages that people dispose. 
The value of the business is that it promotes clean environment and also creates employment opportunities if managed well.

> Technical Feasibility

We already have many glass bottles but we are lacking materials to be processing them so we do it at a slow pace. 
If we have the materials we can increase production because we already have customers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Clean environment 
Reducing gabbages 
The demand for bricks is everywhere thus it will help clean the environment whilst earning an income.
