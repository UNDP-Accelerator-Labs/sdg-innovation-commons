## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Citizens Engagement for the Climate Action 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Extreme weather events and the impact they have on urban communities, with a focus on increased heat and heatwaves.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

There are few important indications that  one needs to note: (1) Data from #HydroMed, showing a continuous rise of the average temperature in multiple cities in the country, including Skopje; (2) UNDP project [2018]  on urban heat islands, showcases and reaffirms the problem in the city, and maps the urban hotspots, as well as prescribes policy solutions to the challenge; (3) Media and civil society organizations have been vocal, raised awareness, and advocated on the topic, as well as association and students of architecture and urban planning.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

UNDP CO North Macedonia at the end of 2018 in partnership with City of Skopje published a comprehensive report on Urban Heat Islands in Skopje: Analysis and Action Plan, ( the access to the report is found here: https://zivotnasredina.skopje.gov.mk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/UHI-Skopje-Report-final-en-proofread.pdf)

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

By enabling citizens engagement in local urban planning, and implementation we will help citizens of Skopje to reduce risks related to heatwaves. 

*By enabling citizens engagement in local urban planning, and implementation, we will help policy-makers learn more and see the value of the climate change implications on city urban planning.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Exciting news from Skopje! Citizens are taking #ClimateAction into their own hands through collective intelligence. By coming together, they're generating innovative solutions to combat climate change and build a more sustainable future. #CitizenParticipation #CollectiveIntelligence 🌍🌿

or  

Exciting to see citizen participation in #ClimateAction in Skopje! By harnessing collective intelligence, we can generate data-driven solutions to tackle urban heat islands and reduce heat in our cities. Let's work together to create a cooler and more sustainable future! 🌍☀️ #CollectiveIntelligence #Sustainability

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How is extreme weather [heat and heatwaves] impacting citizens and communities in North Macedonia?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

This learning question is part of the Collective Intelligence Studio Design with Nesta. We have adopted a portfolio approach in the process and thus enables us to use multiple methods with various interest groups or actors. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Looking at the challenge of heat, there is an ongoing challenge to have a systematic data on the temperatures in a detailed manner. In addition, due to the complexity of the city, the data that is generated for the city may not really represent micro-climates in specific locations of the city. This was clearly seen in the thermal map above. The urban planning and the city infrastructure remain pivotal at the intersection of heat islands, and from 2018 until now we do not have a systematic scanning on the temperatures.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

There are couple of actors/enablers in the ecosystem that would benefit from the work: 

(1) Citizens – this would allow them to contribute meaningfully in the process of data generation as well as participation in the processes of urban planning  

(2) Policy makers (local) – would have a direct link to the citizens and the innovations and solutions that are deployed  

(3) UNDP CO North Macedonia would we able to probe with this challenge and further identify additional avenues  of work in the area, and possibility to build up further on the partnerships established.
