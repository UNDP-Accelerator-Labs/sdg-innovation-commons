> Brief description of the innovation

We mix chicken,goat and pig manure together with sand to come up with one product that is so easy to use and so beffinital to the plants and the soil plus the aciaa tree

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

First when our products are ready for sell it wwe will be selling them off to the people and than we will also be selling the seed and the plants of the accia tree to earn some money to keep us going we will as well grant the job opportunity to many people (youths) so that we work fast and our product is know to many people for use

> Technical Feasibility

When we mix the manure we wait for it to dry up afterwards when it dries we can put it in packages than we have a prototype we used the same manure on the accia tree and it didn't even take more than three weeks to germinate  it's was a successful project  we plan to educate people on the use of  manure and the accia tree

> Anticipated Social Impact

It well really benfit them I a way that they will be able to save money  and not to spend alot on fertilizer it well as we improve the capacity of moving from buying fertilizer but using the things around the to make there on manure
