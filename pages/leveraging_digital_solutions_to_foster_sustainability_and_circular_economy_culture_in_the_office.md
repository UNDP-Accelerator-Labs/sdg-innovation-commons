Leveraging Digital Solutions to Foster Sustainability and Circular Economy culture in the Office 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that the traditional practices and tools used in our office environment contribute to excessive waste and resource consumption, particularly through the reliance on single-use materials like paper roll-ups for presentations and events. Despite our efforts to promote sustainability, there is a need to shift towards more environmentally responsible practices that align with circular economy principles, such as reusability and resource optimization.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The challenge of transitioning from paper roll-ups to digital banners stems from a long-standing practice within many offices, including our own CO, where customized paper roll-ups are frequently used for various events and workshops. Historically, these paper roll-ups have been the go-to solution for visually representing projects, branding, and information dissemination at events. However, this practice has significant environmental implications, as these materials are often discarded after a single use, contributing to substantial paper waste.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab brings several unique value propositions to solving the challenge of excessive waste and resource consumption in office environments 

Innovative Solutions: The Accelerator Lab is designed to foster innovation and experimentation. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, such as digital displays instead of paper roll-ups, the Lab can develop and implement creative solutions that are both effective and sustainable. 

Agility and Flexibility: Unlike traditional units within UNDP, the Accelerator Lab operates with a more agile framework, allowing for rapid testing and iteration of ideas. This flexibility enables the Lab to quickly adapt to feedback and changing circumstances, ensuring that solutions are relevant and impactful. 

Focus on Behavioral Change: The Accelerator Lab emphasizes the importance of changing mindsets and behaviors within organizations. By promoting the use of Al Guffa and other sustainable practices, the Lab can drive cultural shifts that lead to long-term sustainability. 

Pilot Testing and Scaling: The Lab has the capacity to pilot new initiatives and scale successful practices across the organization and beyond. This ability to test and refine solutions before broader implementation ensures that resources are used efficiently and effectively. 

Why the Accelerator Lab? 

Specialized Mandate: The Accelerator Lab is specifically tasked with driving innovation and sustainability initiatives within UNDP.  

Worth Investing Resources: Investing resources in this challenge is worthwhile for several reasons: 

Environmental Impact: Addressing waste and promoting sustainability directly contributes to environmental conservation efforts, aligning with global goals such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

Cost Savings: Transitioning to reusable materials and practices can lead to significant cost savings for the organization in the long run, reducing the need for continuous purchases of disposable items. 

Enhanced Organizational Reputation: By leading the way in sustainability, the Accelerator Lab can enhance the reputation of UNDP as a forward-thinking and environmentally responsible organization, attracting support and collaboration from other stakeholders. 

Long-Term Cultural Change: Investing in this challenge fosters a culture of sustainability within the organization, leading to lasting behavioral changes that can have a ripple effect beyond the office environment. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



♻️✨ The Libyan lab is kicking off an initiative that is all about reusability and collaboration for a greener future! By engaging employees in sustainable practices! By replacing single-use paper roll-ups with digital banners, we're minimizing waste and supporting a sustainable future. ️

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can we engage employees to embrace sustainable practices by effectively promoting the adoption of digital banners instead of traditional paper roll-ups in office environments, and what strategies and technologies will support this transition? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We will organize interactive workshops to educate employees about the benefits of digital banners, including their environmental impact and cost savings.  

Pilot Programs: We will implement pilot programs in select departments to test the use of digital banners in real-world scenarios. This will allow us to gather data on usage patterns, employee feedback, and the overall effectiveness of the transition. 

Through pilot programs will allow us to test our approaches in a controlled environment, enabling us to refine our strategies based on actual experiences and outcomes. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



There is limited data on the environmental impact of switching from paper roll-ups to digital banners, particularly regarding waste reduction, resource conservation, and carbon footprint as well as the comprehensive cost-benefit for the long run.
