## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

 Although this learning cycle has not been completed, a number of insights can be reported: a.     The challenge of single use diapers can not be dealt with in isolation, at least not without looking at gender considerations. Through this learning cycle, we learnt that because childcare tends to be the responsibility of women, even taking care of that stream of waste tends to be a responsibility of women. As such, while single use diapers cause a major environmental and health problem when disposed of incorrectly, they have also contributed immensely to reducing the burden of childcare on women as they nolonger have to spend hours of their time fetching water to wash re-usable nappies and also spending time washing these nappies. As such our solutions mapping had to focus on finding solutions that were gender sensitive or at least involving mothers and care-givers in the solutions mapping exercise. b.     Another related insight was that because household waste in general and diaper waste in particular tends to be the responsibility of men, who in most cases do not occupy leadership responsibilities at community level, issues of appropriate waste disposal have not received much attention in many urban and rural areas which are outside municipal boundaries. As such, women are left with no choice but to dispose of this type of waste in environmentally sensitive areas like rangelands where they get ingested by livestock, waterways, where they clog drainage systems and pollute surface water usually used for domestic purposes, and other environmentally sensitive areas. This learning cycle therefore partly focused on finding solutions for effective waste management systems at community level to deal with this gender challenge. c.     Another key insight generated in this learning cycle was that using single use diapers are a symbol of wealth and status especially for low income earners, and therefore using economic incentives to change behavior was unlikely to result in significant change towards more sustainable solutions. In-fact, what we found was that women, especially young mothers would rather spend more on single use diapers than any other childcare needs. We further found that parents who are low-income earners are spending a large portion of their money on diapers. For instance, 94 percent of households earning below $ 32 (E500) were found to use single-use diapers and, of these, 51 percent were found to spend between ($ 3.15 – $10 E50 - E150), while 38 percent spend between $ 10 – $19 (E151 and E300) on disposable diapers per fortnight. This means that low-income earners who receive below $32 (E500), spend up to 60 percent of their direct incomes on single-use diapers. Although cloth nappies provide a cheaper option and can cost as little as $2 (E30.00) per piece, mothers and care givers have not embraced them. d. The lab further found that contrary to our expectations, women who were allocated to the control group of our experiment to continue using single use diapers wanted to change into the experiment group that were using a modernized version of the re-usable diaper. We believe that the modern design and perceived convenience of the re-usable diaper contributed to this want for change. When probed through focused group discussed, women revealed that one of the challenges of the traditional diaper was that it was white in colour and therefore became difficult to keep clean. in fact, women with a less whiter diaper were reported to be ridiculed in communities when diapers we hung on washing lines. as such, the modern design of the diapers, with a variety of colours to choose from may have contributed towards this change in behavior for those experiment participants e. Finally, noting that single use diapers were found to be a symbol of wealth or a sign that someone had moved higher up the income bracket, the lab found it surprising to learn from informal sellers of the modernized version of the re-usable diaper that most of their clientele tended to be women from the wealthier segments of society. Initially, the assumption was that these women probably didn't have to deal with washing the diapers as they were assumed to either have domestic help or washing machines, and were therefore more likely to easily change to re-usable diapers. however, conversations and the actions of  poorer women who did not afford these luxuries revealed that while washing is a major chore, it wasn't a determining factor in the choice of diapers. in fact, while the single use diaper was the most expensive choice in the long run, it was more affordable on a use as you go basis. babies need more diapers when they are younger and therefore the upfront costs of procuring the necessary diapers required tended to be higher than buying single use diapers as you go. It is therefore important to explore solutions that make sustainable options more affordable to poorer segments of society.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

- one of the main barriers experienced while impacting the system was the issue of gender disparities in traditional leadership systems. During the exploration phase of the challenge, part of our work focused on dealing with community leaders who tended to be mostly male and did not really relate with the challenge except when it came to disposal and it now affected their rangelands and their livestock (their wealth). As such, the blame tended to be placed mainly on the women who were the ones disposing of indiscriminately in inappropriate areas. It was not until the system was looked at as a whole that traditional leadership realised that because they had not ensured to put in place adequate waste collection systems in rural areas, women were left with no choice but to find other means of disposal

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Surveys - we used surveys in order to understand and get baseline information on the population that we were targeting for our experiment.   Focused Group Discussions – we used FDGs to get insights into the challenge in a shorter space of time. The aim was to attain insight into a topic where the experiences of respondents are conditional to specific context, i.e. the communities they reside in, their income level, their awareness level on environmental issues, etc.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Solutions Mapping – we used an innovation challenge as one method to map solutions to this challenge. This method was used because we found no solutions existing in public domains to deal with this challenge Co-creation – in the absence of many solutions on the ground, an experiment was co-designed with 5chiefdoms/ communities in the Manzini region to test the use of re-usable nappies. This was aimed at gathering information which would be useful in promoting more sustainable options to the single use diaper Randomised controlled trials – we used this method to measure the effectiveness of re-usable diapers when compared to single use diapers
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Community Health Motivators - We worked with local community health motivators to map potential experiment participants. They are also assisting with the monitoring of the experiment Siphilile Maternal and Child Health Organisation- We also also engaged with a local child and maternal health care organisation on data sharing engagements

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We did not work with any academic partners

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We have not yet worked with the private sector but we anticipate engaging local retailers in stocking more sustainable alternatives to single use nappies

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Eswatini Environment Authority (EEA) - EEA was (is) the lead partner in this frontier challenge.  Ministry of Health - was engaged to provide technical support in the design and implementation of this experiment. The community health volunteers who are active participants and key informants in this experiment fall under their ministry. WaterAid – we also worked with WaterAid, an international organisation working on surface water to establish partnerships especially for awareness raising activities

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

WaterAid, an international organisation working locally on water issues was a new (although not necessarily an unusual) partner for UNDP Community Health Volunteers under the Ministry of Health were also a new partner for UNDP. being on the ground and dealing with these issues everyday, they formed a useful key informant group that provided us with unusual data and well-targeted information for the experiment

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We did not work with any UN partners
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The use of randomised controlled trials enbles us to get context specific data that will allow us to learn more about this challenge and test solutions that could be scalable. the innovation challenge allowed us to engage with a wider audience and cast a wider net on possible solutions to this challenge, although it did not yield any practical solution on this challenge, it allowed us to get a picture of what solution developers were doing in this space. the use of unusual partners like community health volunteers allowed us to get access to data and people that we may not have been able to access who were useful in gaining insights on this challenge, especially as the experiment happened during a period of heightened civil unrest which made movement and access to certain groups difficult.
