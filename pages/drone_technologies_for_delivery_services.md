Alphaswift provides a unique service for industrial clients looking to adopt drone technologies: specialised UAS design and modification. The startup helps retrofit and modify drones from other brands to achieve higher performance or to complete other specialised tasks. The use of fossil fuels still dominates the aviation and air mobility industry. This in turn has resulted in the increase of the carbon dioxide emission, exacerbates air pollution and other greenhouse gases which further harms the environment. Alphaswift is able to deliver multi-functional UAS for use in light aviation, cargo and agricultural activities. Alphaswift drones have helped clients transport goods to hard-to-access locations such as remote towns in dire need of medical supplies, food, and water. Alphaswift UAS are also being used as crop sprayers in the agricultural sector, helping farmers and plantations spray fertilisers, pest-control chemicals, and other compounds across wide swathes of land while cutting down on man hours and machinery costs. These agricultural drones leverage artificial intelligence to fertilise plantations and farms incredibly efficiently, resulting in higher yields. Alphaswift drones, are customised to transport goods or spray crops without risking any harm to seedlings. A major part of all retrofitting and innovations undertaken by Alphaswift engineers is the payload consideration.
