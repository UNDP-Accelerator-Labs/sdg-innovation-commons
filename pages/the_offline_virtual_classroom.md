THE OFFLINE VIRTUAL CLASSROOM

> Brief description of the innovation

As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, education has been significantly changing. All across the world, many schools have shut down. Face-to-face classes have been cancelled and transferred to online ones. More specifically, students watch lectures, take part in class discussions, submit assignments, and meet instructors from home, via digital platforms.
Before the pandemic, I was not a big fan of virtual classes. However, since I acknowledged its associated environmental benefits.
One of the main benefits of using videos for learning purposes is that they help the students understand the subject matter better than text could. This is because videos foster a personal connection that the students are unlikely to find in any book regardless of how well it is written. When you use videos as a learning aid, you can be guaranteed that your students will comprehend more simply because of the human connection that video brings to the learning experience.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Subscription Fees
A subscription is another popular method to monetize an educational app. In essence, the user is charged a subscription fee (monthly or annually) for using the app. The perks covered under a subscription consist of free access to useful content, courses, lectures, or videos.
Paid Updates
Another transparent method of monetizing an educational app is by implementing charges for app updates. Users get an initial version of the app which is free of charge. The additional updates to be released in future versions with enhanced functionalities can be offered to the users for purchase.
Pre-recorded videos are more effective when they’re short, can have its pace controlled by the student and maintain students’ attention through objectives – such as a worksheet or problem to be solved
Winning the prize would help in upgrading and developing easy access software that would help teachers and learners do their work effectively.
Virtual learning reduces paper waste and saves trees
Virtual learning reduces emissions from transportation/travelling
Taking virtual classes enables students to stay at home and learn with comfort while avoiding wear-and-tear on vehicles and local roads. In addition, students can avoid the need to drive cars or take public transits to the place of study, which can help reduce fossil fuel use and lessen detrimental effects on the environment. Online learning cuts down on energy consumption
When doing virtual courses, students do not have to sit in physical classrooms to study. As a result, electronic devices are off in rooms that are not in use. This means schools would use less energy for power, electricity, heating and cooling systems, which is better for the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

The program is used for creating video tutorials and presentations directly via screencast, or via a direct recording plug-in to Microsoft PowerPoint. Audio or other multimedia recordings may be recorded at the same time or added separately from another source.
The major components are :
Recorder - a separate tool for capturing screen audio and video
Video Editor - the component for which the entire product is named, which is now a multimedia authoring tool with a "timeline" interface for managing multiple clips in a stacked track form.
Users may also download an add-in for Microsoft Power Point that will allow them to initiate recording of a presentation from within Power Point itself.
Rendering and deployment
The program allows import of various types of multimedia video and audio files including MP4, MP3, WMV, WMA, AVI, WAV and other formats into the Camtasia proprietary CAMREC format. The CAMREC format is a single container for various multimedia objects including video clips, still images, document screen shots and special effect containers. The created video can be exported to common video formats including MPEG-2, MPEG-4, WMV, AVI, and Adobe Flash.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Flexibility – You learn at your own speed
Faculties can even be from Ivy League colleges
Cheaper than physical classes
Personalization of course contents
Faculties can make more money by teaching more students at once
Location independent – Anyone can teach from anywhere
Class recordings are a treasure
Recording classroom lectures provide opportunities for your students to go back and listen to what you said if they have missed something or didn’t understand it the first time.
Recorded lectures provide flexibility for students to pause and re-watch the lectures according to their learning pace and needs.
Recording lectures don’t have to be restricted to the classroom alone. You can share lessons and insights anytime and from anywhere. However, you aim to do – be it in the classroom or elsewhere, all you need would be a video tool.
One of the other benefits of recorded video is that it doesn’t require robust internet connectivity. Videoconferencing often requires high-speed, highly stable internet, while recordings can be “buffered to the user’s device.”
For colleges and universities, researchers say instructors who are delivering asynchronous content to students now and in the future should ensure that videos meet high standards for content and editing. Institutions should also ensure that students have both access to videos and proper technical support.
