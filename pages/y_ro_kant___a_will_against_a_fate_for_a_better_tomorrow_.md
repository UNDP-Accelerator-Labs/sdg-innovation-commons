Yéro Kanté, a man who was not in his childhood favored by nature to be scolarized had the humility to get to work and by the strength of these points succeeded in building a school intended to train the younger generations of the city of Kamsar and by extension those of Guinea. Yero Kanté is a REAL HERO!!!
