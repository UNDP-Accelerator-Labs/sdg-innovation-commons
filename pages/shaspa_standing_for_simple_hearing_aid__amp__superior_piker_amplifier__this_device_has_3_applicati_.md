> Title of the innovation

SHASPA standing for Simple Hearing Aid &amp; Superior Piker Amplifier. This device has 3 applications: as a hearing aid, as a most sensitive to sounds for device for spying, broadcasting, recording and as a security alarm triggered by lowest sound decibels

> Brief description of the innovation

SHASPA standing for Simple Hearing Aid &amp; Superior Piker Amplifier. SHASPA has 3 main uses namely: 
1. As a simple Hearing Aid to help pupils/any person suffering from the impaired hearing by amplifying the sound on the ear drum inside auditory canal. The ability to communicate effectively is important to breaking the cycle of poverty through education (Zambia Demographic and Health Survey 2007; Central Statistical
Office: Lusaka, Zambia)
2. As a superior piker amplifier to be used during broadcasting, live show performance/drama by replacing all microphones needed in that room with only one device. This application will minimize the number of microphones needed as at an event.
 3. As a security alarm which is triggered by any smallest possible sound in a quiet room and in walls near windows and doors. This will security and promote safety by scaring away  the intruder/ritual killers, informing neighbours about the threat and reporting the threat via cellphone to the third party e.g the police, G4 security or security guard for intervention.    
SHASPA will directly contribute to health and well being, education through communication and security by reducing theft, burglary and enhancing safety in society.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will generate income because it is the simplest as it requires just 7 components to work hence it's cheaper to produce and can be made locally available at a cheaper price. The cheaper Hearing Aid will enable the poor to have access. The targeted market includes pupils, workers, Health facilities and exports to other countries. Exports will bring foreign exchange and will contribute to both Gross Domestic Products and employment levels in Zambia. This innovation has a positive value to the environment by enhancing communication and reducing theft. This security device is interfaced with a cellphone for immediate notification/warning to the owner of property or third party for action anywhere in the world provided there is a cellphone network. The same security device is interfaced with an electronic weapon for immediate action against intruders in isolated or crime-prone locations. This electronic weapon generates 40, 000v AC to shock or incapacitate the intruding victim.

> Technical Feasibility

SHASPA is designed in such a way that it uses a very low current and voltage of 1.5v clock battery enabling SHASPA to work as a portable Hearing Aid to be worn around the ear. This function is the same as the hearing aid prototype which is common on the world market. The main difference is that it is multipurpose in functions like security alarms, superior amplifier and as spy device for investigations by the police, etc. 

The proposed implementation plan is to order electronic components in electronic shops, assemble them on a perforated circuit board (PCB) according to my invented circuit diagram, market and sell them finally. The targert is to produce more than what will be consumed locally for export purposes. The 3 IN 1 SHASPA device will be separated into 3 devices with a single function each as a Hearing Aid, Superior Amplifier and as a Security alarm. Secuirty alarm will be interfaced with cellphone and electronic weapons for immediate action.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The Hearing Aid component will improve hearing ability of people with hearing impairment especially poor pupils thereby contributing to their health and education. This innovation will make such a device widely available and affordable to the general population who fail to afford it today at k200.

The security alarm based on SHASPA will enable install sensitive sensors in the walls of buildings near doors and windows. This sensor picks any noise made around the door and windows then trigger the alarm for the owner/neighbors to know and the intruder to run away. There are 3 more types of alarms I specialized in namely: BLOSEDE, COSEDE and MOSEDE. They are interfaced with electronic weapon and cellphone if the customer wishes it that way. Briefly: BLOSEDE, COSEDE and MOSEDE are security alarms for cars, motorbikes, houses or just rooms, car parks, visible and invisible fences and wharehouses.
