> Brief description of the innovation

I want to grow soyabeans in the 2021-2022 season in a quantity of 10 hectors.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It will generate income for me after its harvest. Am targeting a yield of not less than 250 bags of soyabeans, hence I will add value to the market share in terms of agriculture expansion as well as were food security is concerned, it will positively add value.
This will help other people also who do not have anything to do,to now have something to do and find some earnings forthemselves because I will employ some people on this task.

> Technical Feasibility

I have a field (farm) which is 35 hecres in size, I want to use for this montioned project. 
To this regard, I have so far bought sprayers, Weedkiller (Haloxyforce) a full box of it &amp; I have reserved so far about 450kg of soyabeans seed in readiness for the rain season.

My proposed implementation is as follows: I need transportation for me to be using for movements to go to the farm especially a motorbike. This is what will help me move efficiently from home to the farm at a distance of 17KM especially that the road to the farm is in a very bad state. 
Funds in the estimation amount of k10,000 to k15,000 to higher a 🚜 tractor in working &amp; preparing the field once the rains start is what am now looking at

> Anticipated Social Impact

I will employ &amp; empower my fellow young people in my community to work with me in the process of this project and be able to motivate them to diversify into agriculture .  This will save them from moving about any how in the streets. They have to grow by been indipendent in their financial life going forward.
