> Title of the innovation

Plastic and Sand Mixture Pavement Manufacturing

> Brief description of the innovation

Plastic and Sand Mixture Pavement Manufacturing is an innovative way of dealing with the plastic waste problem by shredding and shrouding it and mixing it with sand to make durable and strong pavements for industrial and domestic use. This innovation involves use of simple machinery which include a plastic shredder, shroulder, plastic and sand combiner and hydraulic press for final product of pavements.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With many construction projects around the country taking place both at industrial and domestic levels, Plastic and Sand Mixture Pavement Manufacturing will generate income from the manufacturing and selling of pavements to industrial and domestic customers.  Plastic and Sand Mixture Pavement Manufacturing will basically be of support to the operations of construction companies big and small by providing a variety of pavements needed for their construction projects. In order for this project to start operation there need for capital and machinery. Therefore, the prize money will be used for operation capital and machine procurement to start and grow the business.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation implementation design will follow an integrated system of operations. First there will be establishment of a place of operations and organization of machinery.  Thereafter detailed plans and specifications for pavement manufacturing will be made, followed by manufacturing planning and resources required to make the design a physical reality. In both design and manufacturing, numerous operational tasks will be performed with a variety of precedence and other relationships among the different tasks.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Green manufacturing that will be adopted by the innovation comes with reduced emissions and other environmental problems that occur during the manufacturing process. Another anticipated social impact is creation of social value whose themes will include promoting skills and employment; supporting the growth of responsible businesses; creating healthier, safer, more resilient communities; protecting and improving the environment; and promoting social innovation.
