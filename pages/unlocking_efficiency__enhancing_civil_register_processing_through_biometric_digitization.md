> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Access to Justice

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Access to Basic and Quality Public Service Delivery

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How might we optimize workflow processes in the Ministry of Justice in order to alter transparency and decrease corruption?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (Trial and erros, prototype, a/b testing)
- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)
- Experimental (Randomised assignment and/or control group)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- United Nations agency
- Public Sector

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Public Sector: Ministry of Justice (IT Department)

UN Agencies: UNICEF

UNDP: Governance Cluster 

GESDOC (European Union Project)
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We would like to learn how the Registry Keepers can use the Civil Register in a more efficient way. Currently the register is physical (books) and somethimes it takes days for the Registry Keeper to find a specific page needed to ex. process an ID Card. If the Register is digitized and stored in a database, the process might be more effective.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

 IF... the Civil Register is digitized with the use of Biometric Kits, THEN... processing efficiency will improve, decreasing waiting times of the population. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment
- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Staff from the IT department in the Ministry of Justice will be trained in digitizing the existing Civil Registry books by using Biometric Kits.

The experiment will measure the time required to find a specific page in the physical Civil Registry (books) compared to do a search in the database created by the digitization.

The Lab will work with the Civil Registry Keeper, comparing time required for 5 searches in the physical register compared to 5 searches in the digital register. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Number of registers found / time required 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The experiment will measure the time required to find a specific page in the physical Civil Registry (books) compared to do a search in the database created by the digitization.

The Lab will work with the Civil Registry Keeper, comparing time required for 5 searches in the physical register compared to 5 searches in the digital register. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2  weeks

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
