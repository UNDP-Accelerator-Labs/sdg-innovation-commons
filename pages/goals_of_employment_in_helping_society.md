> Title of the innovation

Goals of employment in helping society

> Brief description of the innovation

We can help change lives in ideas of keeping busy with different abilities and talents of youths in a country

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If employment is at least at a certain percentage% level from the scale of 1:10 at least 6, so that youths with different skills are kept busy and earn a living to reduce the high number level of crimes, then we can all benefit from that and help in developing our country with a high number of employment.

> Technical Feasibility

I don't have any prototype yet, but if I had I can help in ways of reducing lack  of source of income in youths of our country and the nation

> Anticipated Social Impact

Not everyone is working in companies nor organizations but my idea is to work with talented people too who feel left out and engage themselves in criminal activities such as theft, alcohol and sexual morals, but if engaged in an activity that will bring something on their table, that will reduce crime and bring prosperity in lives of humanity
