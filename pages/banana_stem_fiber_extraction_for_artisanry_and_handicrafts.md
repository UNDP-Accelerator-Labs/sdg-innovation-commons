This is a women's group association dedicated to extracting stem fiber from banana trees in Valverde, Dominican Republic. They create handicrafts and artisanry artifacts with the fiber. The association groups about 700 women. The group was supported by UNDP and some private sector donors, through capacity development, gender-specific business training, marketing, etc. It was the first solution safari conducted by the AccLab DR, as banana stem fiber is relatively known product with a lot of export potential, in addition to contirbuting to green business practices.
