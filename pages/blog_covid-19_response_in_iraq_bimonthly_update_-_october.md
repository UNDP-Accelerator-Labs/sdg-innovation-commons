COVID-19
Response in Iraq

Update #4: October-December 2020

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In line with UNDP’s Global Integrated Response1 and the WHO Iraq Strategic
Preparedness and Response Plan,2 UNDP launched the project Support for the
COVID-19 Response in Iraq in April 2020. To ensure agile, quality implementa-
tion in a rapidly evolving operational context, UNDP leveraged existing mech-
anisms and in-house resources to support its COVID-19 response in Iraq. The
implementation of UNDP’s COVID-19 response makes use of the operational
platforms of the Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS), the Iraq Social Cohesion
Programme and the UNDP Iraq Accelerator Lab.

The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Iraq has plateaued, with the num-
ber of new cases decreasing to just over 900 per day at the end of December
(see Figures 1 and 2).3 But as temperatures decline during the winter months, the
number of COVID-19 infections might increase in areas that experience extreme
cold, such as Mosul and neighbouring governorates. The spread of the highly
contagious, mutant variants of the virus in the UK and South Africa, while ⊲

Figure 3. PROJECT LOCATIONS (on 31 December)

UNDP has made significant progress in its support to
healthcare facilities. By the end of 2020, a total of 238
airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) were complete
in Anbar (Fallujah and Ramadi), Babil (Hillah), Basra, Dhi
Qar (Nasriya), Diyala (Baquba), Dohuk, Karbala, Kirkuk,
Missan (Amara), Najaf, Ninewa (Mosul) and Salah al-Din
(Tikrit) (see Figure 3). The procurement and provision of
medical equipment and essential personal protective
equipment (PPE) for all locations is underway. 180 ven-
tilators and patient monitors, 10 defibrillators and 180
suction devices have been delivered to 8 healthcare
facilities, while cumulatively 8,160 N95 respirators have
been provided to facilities in 8 governorates.

The “Corona in Iraq” awareness platform continued
to be operational, with 210,045 cumulative views at the
end of the reporting period. To improve user friendli-
ness, the platform was redesigned.

The campaign with Asiacell was launched and has so
far received over 400 responses for health courses

Furthermore, the Karbala Governorate’s ‘Spatial Data
Infrastructure’ (SDI) system supported by UNDP contin-
ued to be operational providing analytical data required
to enable improved decision-making processes.

Following the successful distribution of life-support
packages and hygiene products to families that have
been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, UNDP
has provided a second round of low-value grants to
previously selected community-based organisations,
ensuring that an even greater number of vulnerable
families will be supported in Anbar, Ninewa and Salah
al-Din. Implementation is currently underway.

The Post-COVID-19 Socioeconomic Response Plan
(SERP) for Iraq was formulated with the technical
support of UNDP, which leveraged its integrator role
to support the UN Resident Coordinator and bring to-

coordination with the UN in Iraq, continued its socio-
economic assessments to identify the impact of COV-
ID-19 and the fall in oil prices on key sectors and vulner-
able populations in Iraq. Three policy papers had been
launched by end of December 2020 – one of them cit-
ed by Al Jazeera.3

UNDP continues to recognize the challenges and risks
faced in providing its support amidst an evolving con-
text. These are reflected in an updated Project Risk
Analysis (see Annex 1).

UNDP has also seized opportunities across its Coun-
try Office portfolios to provide additional support to
pandemic response and recovery. The initiatives, which
are implemented by existing projects beyond UNDP’s
dedicated COVID-19 response project, are described
on Page 7.

UNDP Iraq COVID-19 Response Update #4 (October-December 2020)

PROGRESS AGAINST OUTPUTS (October-December 2020)

Output 1
The healthcare system in Iraq is strengthened to prevent the spread of COVID-19

1.1. Two online platforms for
raising awareness on or
monitoring on COVID-19
are operational

1.2. At least 200,000 views
of the online platform

1.3. WHO, MOH and other
official/authorised
guidance and
information on COVID-19
provided

1.4. 3 medical labs supported
by UNDP with priority
medical equipment
to strengthen testing
capacities for COVID-19

1.5. 16 designated health-

care facilities supported
with personal protective
equipment (PPE)

1.6. 16 designated healthcare
facilities supported by
UNDP to strengthen
healthcare systems to
respond to COVID-19

The “Corona in Iraq”4 platform, launched in April 2020, continues to focus on: (i)
Raising awareness on the symptoms and risks of, as well as combat misinformation
about, the COVID-19 virus; (ii) Offering a symptom tracker to encourage users to seek
appropriate medical advice; and (iii) Providing a geographical overview of emerging
COVID-19 hotspots.

At the end of December 2020, there were 210,045 cumulative views of the online
platform. The symptoms tracker continued to be used, with a total of 685 cumulative
users since the launch in April. 38.2% of users during the reporting period were
women, a increase from the previous reporting period (32%).

By the end of the reporting period, the redesign of the platform—including a
reorganization of its information architecture and new branding—was complete. To
increase the platform’s visibility, UNDP has launched an online campaign with Asiacell,
a major telecommunication company in Iraq. The campaign ran throughout December
2020, reaching 5 million people and receiving a total of 462 responses for health
courses.

The “Corona in Iraq” platform was established in partnership with the Government
of Iraq (GOI) Commission on Media and Communication and UNICEF. UNDP
coordinated with the Ministry of Health and Environment, Commission on Media and
Communication, WHO and UNICEF to inform the guidance and public information
provided through the platform.

The Karbala ‘Spatial Data Infrastructure’ (SDI), supported by UNDP to track and trace
COVID-19 using modern geographic information system (GIS) technologies, continues
to be in use by the Karbala Governorate.

The technical evaluation of bids was underway at the end of the reporting period to
procure laboratory equipment for the Central Laboratories in Anbar, Dohuk and Erbil, in
coordination with the Ministries of Health. The equipment is the critical RT Polymerase
Chain Reaction/PCR (3) and Biosafety Cabinet Class II (6), which will enable these
laboratories to process COVID-19 tests, relieving the burden on Iraq’s Central Lab in
Baghdad and, overall, expediting testing times.

16 designated healthcare facilities were identified in the 15 targeted governorates of
Anbar, Babil, Basra, Dhi Qar, Diwaniya, Diyala, Dohuk, Erbil, Karbala, Kirkuk, Missan,
Muthanna, Najaf, Ninewa and Salah al-Din. These facilities were identified by UNDP
in coordination with the Ministry of Health and local authorities. The facilities are
being supported through rehabilitation of infrastructure and the provision of medical
equipment and furniture to make available the necessary airborne infection isolation
rooms, which will strengthen the ability of Iraq’s healthcare system to safely treat
severe cases of COVID-19.

Leveraging UNDP’s procurement systems, the provision of PPE continues to progress
despite global supply chain and logistical challenges. A total of 8,160 N95 respirators
have been delivered to 8 governorates (Anbar, Basra, Diyala, Dohuk, Karbala, Najaf,
Ninewa and Salah al-Din). An additional 9,792 N95 respirators are currently under
customs clearance. 43,200 gowns have been procured through UNDP’s Global
Procurement Unit (GPU) and are in the process of being shipped. Further procurement
processes are underway to secure additional PPE.

By the end of the reporting period, medical equipment - including 180 ventilators and
patient monitors, 10 defibrillators and 180 suction devices - were delivered to facilities
in Ramadi (Anbar), Basra, Dohuk, Baquba (Diyala), Karbala, Kirkuk, Mosul (Ninewa) and
Tikrit (Salah al-Din). Medical equipment for Najaf will be delivered once the movement
facilitation is issued.

1.8. 300 airborne infection
isolation rooms (AIIRs)

Additionally, medical furniture has arrived in Iraq and will soon be delivered. The fur-
niture includes beds, overbed tables, bedside cabinets and IV holders (180 each) and
will cover 8 governorates (Anbar, Basra, Diyala, Dohuk, Karbala, Najaf, Ninewa and Sa-
lah al-Din). An invitation to bid was published to cover medical furniture for 4 additional
governorates (Babil, Dhi Qar, Kirkuk and Missan) and bids are currently undergoing
technical evaluation.

Output 2
Integrated crisis management and response is strengthened to enable the Government of Iraq to maintain core functions
and manage its response

2.1. Coordination meetings

facilitated among the
UN Country Team on
the post-COVID-19
response plan provided
with technical advisory
support by UNDP

2.2. UNCT Iraq’s multi-

sectoral, Post-COVID-19
Recovery Strategy
developed with technical
support from UNDP

The UN Country Team (UNCT) in Iraq continued to follow the coordination structure
outlined in the UN Framework for the Immediate Socioeconomic Response
to COVID-19 (April 2020), with the coordination structure led by the Resident
Coordinator’s Office (RCO), OCHA coordinates the humanitarian response, WHO
coordinates the health response and UNDP coordinates the socioeconomic response
and recovery.

For increased efficiency, coordination continued to be aligned with the Programme
Management Team and Priority Working Groups (PWG) of the UNCT. Upon request,
UNDP provides technical support to the UN Country Team meetings, the Resident
Coordinator’s Office/Development Coordination Office (RCO/DCO) and PMT.

During the reporting period, the Socioeconomic Response Plan (SERP) was approved
by the UN Regional Development Coordination Office and translated to Arabic.

UNDP Iraq COVID-19 Response Update #4 (October-December 2020)

2.3. At least 25,000 people
reached through social
cohesion activities

2.4. Local Peace Committees,
Youth and Women’s
Groups, and Community
Based Organizations
supported to work
collaboratively to
respond to immediate
community needs arising
due to COVID-19

To support families who have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
pandemic due to the lack of access to services and difficulties earning an income,
UNDP had provided four Community-Based Organisations (CBOs) with low-value
grants to distribute life-support packages and hygiene products, raise awareness
on health and COVID-19 prevention guidelines and sterilize public spaces, including
school exam centres, healthcare facilities and municipal buildings, in coordination with
18 Local Peace Committees (LPCs) in cities and towns in Anbar, Ninewa and Salah al-
Din governorates. All CBOs completed the distribution of packages to 6,000 families,
awareness raising and sterilization of public spaces in their respective governorates
reaching 64,181 people (30,365 women, 15,377 youth) and sterilizing 124 locations.

Following the successful implementation, UNDP has provided a second round of low-
value grants to previously selected CBOs, ensuring that an even greater number of
vulnerable families will be supported in Anbar, Ninewa and Salah al-Din governorates.
Implementation of activities is currently underway and will continue in January 2021.

Finally, to support local youth and women’s groups in their social cohesion efforts
and to combat the stigma and negative stereotypes associated with COVID-19 in
their communities, UNDP has selected a cumulative total of 17 initiatives proposed
by youth groups and 10 initiatives proposed by women’s groups to receive small
grants to implement initiatives directly supported by a CBO. 17 initiatives proposed
by youth groups (7 in Anbar, 4 in Diyala, 4 in Ninewa and 2 in Salah al-Din) and 10
initiatives proposed by women’s groups (6 in Anbar, 2 in Diyala and 2 in Ninewa) have
been implemented as of end December 2020. Selected initiatives include awareness
sessions on drug abuse and mental health, rehabilitation of schools in different
districts, and establishment of a book club for women. A total of 11,033 people (4,194
women, 6,839 men and 3,291 youth) have been reached.

Output 3
The social and economic impacts of COVID-19 are assessed to enable the Government of Iraq to define short- and medi-
um-term recovery strategies

3.1. At least 6 socioeconomic

needs and impact
assessments completed

The SEIAs supported by UNDP focus on the following thematic issues which are iden-
tified as priorities in the context of Iraq, and findings continue to be released through a
series of Policy Papers.

• Impact on fragility in Iraq (10 August 2020)
• Impact on the macroeconomic and fiscal space (6 October 2020)
• Impact on social cohesion in Iraq, in collaboration with IOM (15 November 2020)
• Impact on social protection (ongoing; in collaboration with ILO)
• Impact on vulnerability at the household level (ongoing; in collaboration with IOM

and UN Habitat)

• Impact on environmental sustainability (ongoing; in collaboration with UNEP)

Findings from the SEIA on ramifications for the macroeconomic and fiscal space were
referenced by Al Jazeera.

A team of technical experts to support the SEIAs, led by a Senior Coordinator, contin-
ued to be in place during the reporting period. The team comprises experts on macro-
economic issues, social cohesion, resilience and environment, and social protection.
IMPACT/REACH Initiatives are also contracted, and methodologies finalized for the
field-based research required for the assessment of the impact on household vulnera-
bility.

UNDP will also support the ‘Informality Diagnostic' for Iraq, which is led by ILO, in col-
laboration with UN Women and IOM.

LESSONS LEARNED

The Need for Agility

The need for agility continues to remain critical to re-
spond to evolving needs and to ensure the quality and
timely completion of activities in the rapidly evolving
operational context. UNDP has done so by using and
adapting existing project management systems, oper-
ational processes and in-house human resources, in-
cluding the safe mobilisation of technical capacities in
the field to support the COVID-19 response. Given re-
cent pandemic activity, UNDP is reviewing implemen-
tation timelines to enable the completion of activities
(including assessments) and a full handover.

Implementation and Monitoring

Implementation continues to be supported by FFS
technical experts from the medical and engineering
teams in the five liberated governorates. New engi-
neering teams were recruited in Basra, Dohuk, Karbala,
Najaf, Ninewa (Mosul), Babil, Dhi Qar, Missan, Diwani-
ya and Muthanna to implement activities in these gov-
ernorates under the supervision of FFS central engi-
neering teams in Baghdad and Erbil. 39 engineers are
supporting the implementation and monitoring of the
COVID-19 response in the 15 governorates. While field
presence has been critical, UNDP has ensured that all
field teams are provided with the required PPE.

UNDP continues to partner with CBOs, LPCs, and youth
and women’s groups to ensure community level en-
gagement. These groups and mechanisms have been
key in reaching out to vulnerable people, building trust
amongst their communities and providing information
and support during the pandemic.

After the effective launch of the "Corona in Iraq" Plat-
form, the Accelerator Lab’s monitoring system was in-
itiated to measure the use of the platform and impact
of the messaging. Data showed that the number of us-
ers were beginning to decrease, indicating that people
were not actively seeking COVID-19 related content as
much as they did when the site was initiated in April
during the lock-down period and the demand for reli-
able information was high. The Lab has also identified
that this decrease could be due to the saturation of
information regarding COVID-19 and post-lock down
changes and adjustments in lifestyle. Therefore, the
Lab has identified through its Design Thinking Meth-
odology the need to adapt the platform to the changed
context and promote more engagement and competi-
tion-based learning.

Procurement

The dedicated UNDP Iraq Service Centre was lever-
aged to provide the necessary operational backstop-
ping for quick, efficient and transparent procurement
processes to facilitate delivery. Using this dedicated
procurement team has enabled a quick response in
moving the healthcare facility rehabilitation process-
es forward. Furthermore, this enables rapidly identify-
ing ways to address procurement-related challenges.
Given high global demands and logistical bottlenecks,
some procurement challenges persist (e.g. orders be-
ing cancelled on short notice and delayed clearance
processes), requiring UNDP to be agile.

Gender Mainstreaming in UNDP’s
COVID-19 Response

Gender-sensitive approaches are incorporated into a
range of activities, for example:

1. Social and economic needs and impact assess-
ments: The SEIAs have a gender focus, under-
standing that women and girls have different expe-
riences and face different challenges when it comes
to the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

2. UNCT Iraq Socioeconomic Response Plan (SERP):
The SERP has mainstreamed gender consideration
to reflect the different needs and challenges faced
by women and girls in the current context.

3. Women’s engagement in social cohesion activi-
ties: UNDP had received proposals for communi-
ty initiatives from women’s groups in Anbar, Diya-
la and Ninewa to build social cohesion during the
COVID-19 pandemic. UNDP supported the imple-
mentation of 10 initiatives (6 in Anbar, 2 in Ninewa
and 2 in Diyala), which have provided women with
an opportunity to openly discuss a range of issues
and topics. In addition to providing financial sup-
port to a women-run factory that produces masks,
gowns and medical vests, CBOs also provided mar-
keting and business skills support for SMEs and are
running a women-only book club.

LOOKING AHEAD

Risks and Challenges

Despite progress, the implementation of UNDP Iraq’s
COVID-19 response is not without risks and challenges.
Particularly within the rapidly evolving operational con-
text, UNDP has been working to mitigate these risks, as
far as is possible. A risk analysis, which is continuously
updated, is provided in Annex 1.

UNDP Iraq COVID-19 Response Update #4 (October-December 2020)

BOX 1. ADDITIONAL COVID-19 RESPONSE SUPPORT THROUGH UNDP IRAQ

Recognising the far-reaching impact of COVID-19 on Iraq, UNDP has seized opportunities across its
portfolio to provide additional support to pandemic response and recovery. The following initiatives, which
are implemented by existing projects beyond UNDP’s dedicated COVID-19 support project, are described
here to present a comprehensive overview of related activities during the reporting period.

Awareness Raising: The “Let’s Beat Coro-
na” awareness campaign was concluded by
the end of September 2020 as reported in
the August-September bi-monthly update. The cam-
paign was supported following an agreement with
the European Union to repurpose funding from the
Supporting Recovery and Stability in Iraq through
Local Development (US$36,733) and Strengthening
the Long-Term Resilience of Sub-National Author-
ities in Countries Affected by the Syrian and Iraqi
Crises/“Headway” (US$134,770) Programmes. The
Headway Programme is financed by the EU Regional
Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis (“Madad
Fund”).

Security Sector: Under UNDP's agreement
with Canada, the second and final consign-
ment of PPE was handed over to the Ministry
of Interior in November. The consignment included
2,500 boxes of medical face masks and 2,300 bot-
tles of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and will be large-
ly distributed to police officers in Baghdad, where
there has been a continuous increase in COVID-19
cases. Together with the first batch of PPE, UNDP
provided a total of 4,250 medical face masks, 4,300
bottles of hand sanitizer, 2,000 boxes of examination
gloves and 2,500 boxes of face masks to the Minis-
try of Interior.

The development of an e-learning system for police
training, financed by repurposed funding from the
Government of the Netherlands, is well underway.
The design and set-up of the platform is complete.
Course curricula were adjusted to the online format,
and voice recording, editing and uploading of course
material were finalized. Over the next months, the fi-
nal configuration will be carried out and the launch
of the platform is anticipated for mid-January 2021.
The e-learning platform will provide options to con-
tinue training with minimal disruptions as COVID-19
restrictions are likely to continue in 2021.

Social Cohesion: In preparation for the na-
tionwide campaign on social cohesion and
overcoming the negative impact of the COV-
ID-19 pandemic, UNDP is currently in the final stages
of selecting a media production company. Following
the selection of a production company, graphics, ad-
vertisements and short videos will be produced and
shared throughout Iraq. To complement the informa-
tion shared by the campaign, continuous discussions
will be held with UNDP’s Accelerator Lab to ensure
messaging is aligned and consistent once media
products are developed.

Livelihoods Support: Having resumed
implementation in June 2020, UNDP con-
tinued its livelihood support programming
through the Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS),
Iraq Crisis Response and Resilience Programme
(ICRRP) and the Headway Programme, providing
critical support to boost economic activity in target
locations in Iraq, during the reporting period.

implementation of activities.

UNDP staff and third-party contractors will not
enter isolation facilities.

If rehabilitation work is undertaken in health
facilities already treating COVID-19 patients,
staff and third-party contractors will be provid-

UNDP Medical Officers working on the Project
will closely monitor the accurate and full use of
PPE by staff and third-party contractors.

Additionally, in the event of no response from
qualified contractors and/or suppliers, UNDP
will, in keeping with its rules and regulations,
rely on direct contracting within a specific
target location.

UNDP Iraq will secure the required approvals
from the Government of Iraq to ensure safe
passage for equipment and supplies to be
provided through the Project.

UNDP Iraq will secure confirmation from the
Government of Iraq of the continued priority
placement of medical staff to the facilities that
will be supported through the Project.

UNDP will also coordinate with WHO and
the Health Cluster regarding the support it
will provide, in order to help leverage any
complementary support services provided by
non-state service providers.

The Project has also proposed to provide
PPE for health sector staff in order to help
safeguard them from exposure to the virus.

For UNDP Iraq’s “Corona in Iraq
platform”, there is a remaining
risk that other online platforms
will be launched which will
address the same topics and use
similar features, which might, in
turn, affect the number of visits to
the Platform.

Delays in the delivery of medical
equipment, furniture, materials
and supplies to Iraq could take
place due to limited availability of
cargo space.

Once medical equipment,
furniture and PPE arrive in
country, delays in delivering
goods to the designated
healthcare facilities and the end
user could be experienced due
to restrictions on movement
between the governorates put in
place by the GOI and KRG.

The increase in global demand
for Personal Protective
Equipment (PPEs) for health
sector staff could result in limited
global supply and present
challenges in procuring the
required quantities.

The Accelerator Lab is working to scale-up the
platform, making the design more engaging in
order to attract and reach men, women, boys
and girls, and to also adapt the platform to be
relevant to the evolving context.

The Lab is also working to ensure relevant and
appealing content is shared by liaising with
different partners, such as WHO, UNICEF, UN
Women and UNFPA.

This is a global challenge over which UNDP
Iraq has little control. However, in order to
mitigate against this risk, UNDP will arrange, if/
when needed, for partial delivery of orders in
order to take advantage of all available cargo
space and accordingly secure delivery of items
in smaller batches.

UNDP will also identify local representatives of
major manufacturers in order to try to resource
the required medical equipment in a timely
manner.

UNDP may also, in keeping with its procure-
ment rules and regulations, explore options
for partial bidding on procurement advertise-
ments, to facilitate procurement and delivery in

UNDP is proactively working to obtain all need-
ed facilitation and access letters from the cen-
tral government, respective governorates and
the KRG Joint Crisis Coordination Centre (JCC)
to allow movement between governorates by
the suppliers to deliver the medical equipment
and furniture.

If UNDP faces challenges in procuring PPE,
particularly with the necessary specifications
(i.e., types of masks), due to limited global sup-
ply, UNDP will:

In coordination and consultation with end
users, reduce the originally identified quanti-
ties to be provided in the initial package for
each designated healthcare facility. This will
ensure that all healthcare facilities receive
some supply of PPE and subsequent follow-up
deliveries can be made once additional supply
is secured.

Explore all available procurement options,
seeking to procure PPE not only locally and
regionally, but also through UNDP’s Global
Procurement Unit.

Description of the Risk and Impact

In consultation with the Ministry
of Health and Environment,
UNDP aims to deliver the most
critical medical equipment
needed to provide high quality
care for COVID-19 patients. Some
of the medical equipment (e.g.,
ECMO) requires a high degree
of technical expertise and incurs
some significant expense to
operate and maintain.

Due to its complex nature,
there is a risk that targeted
governorates may have limited
technical capacity to utilise the
ECMO and limited financial
capacity for the procurement
of patient starter kits that are
required to operationalize the
system.

In order to mitigate these risks, UNDP has con-
firmed with the Public Health Directorate that
each governorate has adequate capacity (i.e.,
technical human resource capacity, and finan-
cial capacity to maintain the supply of the Pa-
tient Starter Kits needed to use the machine) to
run two ECMO machines. Accordingly, UNDP
has decreased the number of ECMO systems
that will be provided to each governorate from
the originally proposed five to two machines.

In order to ensure each governorate has the
needed technical capacity, UNDP requires that
the supplier provide orientation to each facility
receiving the ECMO. Moreover, the Ministry of
Health’s ICU Committee has agreed to provide
a detailed training on the operation and main-
tenance of the ECMO for medical staff who will
be responsible for operating them, once the
equipment is delivered and installed.

UNDP will continue to maintain a zero-toler-
ance policy for SEA and will continue to further
strengthen its accountability mechanisms to
mitigate SEA-related issues within the office
and project teams through enhanced sensiti-
sation and awareness-raising about SEA and
mechanisms in place to report cases.

Staff and partners will also be sensitised on
SEA and trained on how to prevent SEA.
