> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Collects and exports used cooking oil (UCO) for biofuel. This type of waste can be found in every household. However, there isn’t enough UCO to cater to the high global demand, cofounder Tagaddod Nour El Assal says. This shortfall is not due to the lack of people’s love for a juicy piece of fried chicken, but rather because of the lack of a sufficient mechanism to collect UCO from factories, retailers, and households. To solve that gap, Tagaddod built Green Pan, an app that allows households to schedule UCO pickups and another one for hotels, restaurants and cafes — or Horecas for short. The company then exports the UCO to refineries abroad, where it turns into biofuel and hydrogenated vegetable oil — basically the new version of biofuel, from which other types of fuel (jet fuel, diesel, gasoline etc.) can be extracted.

Households and restaurants have certain perks in mind when using Tagaddod. One of the perks of using Tagaddod as a multi-branch restaurant, for instance, is that it helps track each food outlet’s consumption of oil, providing inventory and operational data that is otherwise hard to come by. As a household, every liter of UCO handed to Tagaddod translates into incentives and small gifts.
