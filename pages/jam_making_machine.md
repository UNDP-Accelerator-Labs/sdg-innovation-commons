> Title of the innovation

Jam Making Machine

> Brief description of the innovation

This is a machine that will be making jam from fruits e.g mangos. The machine can be operated from a smart phone, using an application which was made for it. 
considering the tidies work involved in making jam, this machine bring in an effortless work of making jam. therefore, even large quantity of jam can be produced very easily and efficiently

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

this project will create jobs for a lot of people since both the production of the machines and jam will be needed. Additionally, this will have an a large economic impact as jam will be exported to other countries

> Technical Feasibility

the system is composed of 6 subsystems namely prismatic joint, stirrer, heater, controller and power system. 
this project will for both domestic and commercial use

> Anticipated Social Impact

This project will create employment for people of different skills e.g. electricians, metal and wood workers etc. furthermore, it can be used at a domestic level. this could help families preserve the sweet taste of home fruits throughout the year e.g mangos
