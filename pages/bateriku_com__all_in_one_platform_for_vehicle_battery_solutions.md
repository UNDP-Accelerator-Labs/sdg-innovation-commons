Bateriku.com is a battery delivery and installation system which is based on a sharing economy model, contributing to environmental sustainability. To date, Bateriku.com has helped train almost a thousand B-Heroes who are mobile battery installers and we have also successfully recycled almost 15 tonnes of used batteries in the span of 8 years. Mr. Azarol Faizi found that the economy was slowly transitioning to more on-demand services like Uber, MyTaxi (Grab), Food Panda and others in 2012. He observed that more and more people were using their smart phones to do a search on products and request for online services which were easier and faster. At that time, he realised that there were advantages to the on-demand battery business model. This is because prior to this, batteries were mostly sold in workshops or specific battery shops. This transitional model has helped consumers save money and time, as well as overcome other inconveniences of getting batteries themselves Bateriku.com offers free training and has created job opportunities especially for the B40 community via the B-Hero programme. Participants from this programme managed to earn at least 5 times more than their peers in similar service delivery companies. Some of the challenge they need to overcome is the issue of lead acid batteries. Their irresponsible disposal may negatively affect health and also the environment. On the bright side, almost all lead acid batteries can be recycled, which is why Bateriku.com has kick started a programme called “Go Recond, Save the World” to recycle these batteries. In this programme, batteries will undergo a thorough selection process for reinstallation and restoration purposes, and a discount will be given to used-car dealers, workshop owners and others who may find them useful for their businesses. This is how they contribute to the preservation of the environment as well.
