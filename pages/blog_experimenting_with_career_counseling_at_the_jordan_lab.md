Experimenting with
Career Guidance
in Jordan

Introduction to career
guidance in Jordan

The Lab's efforts are particularly crucial in Jordan, where unemployment presents a
significant challenge. According to the World Bank, the unemployment rate has risen
to 22.3%, markedly higher than the pre-COVID-19 average of 15.1% (2012-2019). Youth
unemployment is 46.1%, and women's unemployment is 30.9%.

UNICEF's statistics paint a stark picture-approximately 100,000 young individuals step
into the job market each year, only to be met with a daunting 32% unemployment rate
among those aged 15-30. This uphill battle is even more pronounced for women and
girls, as Jordan ranks third from the bottom in terms of working women globally.

To understand some of the issues youth face in starting and building their careers, the
Accelerator Lab conducted a short research project to gain insights into young
people's perspectives and challenges in the job market. The research revealed that
career counselling and guidance contribute to youth’s career decision-making.

Research Phases

Sense

Explore

Test

During the Sense phase, the Accelerator
Lab identified that youth face challenges in
making career decisions. Although the
activities with youth were not
initially
intended to gather this insight, the topic
frequently surfaced in discussions.

In the Explore phase, we conducted a an
online survey targeting university students
and recent graduates to understand to
understand how youth currently make their
decisions about their careers' preferences and
their experiences with career guidance.

In the Test phase, the Accelerator Lab
designed and implemented an experiment to
compare the effectiveness of different career
counseling modalities. We tested in-person,
phone, and chat sessions to assess their
impact.

Understanding Career Counseling Needs in Jordan

In Jordan, career counseling is a critical yet underdeveloped area. Despite the Ministry of Labor providing career clinics across the country, many
young people continue to face high unemployment rates, particularly among those in their early twenties. This suggests that there is still a disconnect
between education and the job market and that the youth are not necessarily informed of their career choices.

The Sense phase involved learning more about the current landscape of career counseling in Jordan and mapping a few unconnected efforts
between UN agencies and international NGOs to build career counseling services or guides, some targeting refugee youth exclusively. However,
while commendable, these efforts seem insufficient in reaching all youth in Jordan.

The desk review pointed to the role of chatbots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in offering potential solutions that are cost-effective, scalable, and
effective in designing counseling services. Chatbots and AI can provide personalized, data-driven advice, helping youth make more informed choices
about their future careers. This set the foundation for exploring how to incorporate digital tools into career counseling, making it more accessible and
practical for Jordanian youth.

Methodology

The Survey

The exploration phase involved conducting an online
survey through social media to understand how young
individuals in Jordan make their career choices. The survey
targeted individuals aged 18 to 25, collecting data on their
demographic information, educational and employment
status, technology usage, and career aspirations.

Objective:
To gain insights into the career aspirations and decision-
making processes of young Jordanians, and to identify
areas for improvement in career guidance and job-
matching platforms.

Research Questions:

What factors influence career decisions among young Jordanians?
How do technology and social media usage impact career choice and job-
seeking behavior?
What improvements are needed for job-matching websites to better serve
young job seekers?

The Experiment

From the experiment, we aimed to collect information on the
effectiveness of different career counseling modalities. The
experimental phase involved working with a professional career
counselor who engaged with 16 young individuals, including
university students and recent graduates. To test our hypothesis,
three modalities were utilized: in-person sessions, phone calls, and
chat sessions. These sessions were designed to evaluate the
efficiency of each modality, identify trends, assess the pros and
cons, and measure participants' satisfaction with each method.

Research Questions:

Is there a difference in effectiveness between face-to-face and remote
career counseling?
Which tool is most appealing to youth?
How did the modality of the session affect the retention of the session
content?

Experiment Hypothesis:
Remote career counseling can be just as effective as in-person sessions.

Objective:
To support and guide Jordanian youth in their career paths while
evaluating different counseling modalities.

Demographics:
Jordanian youth (students and recent graduates)

Counseling Modalities Tested:
In-Person Sessions – 45 minutes
Phone Calls – 15 minutes
Chat Sessions – 30 minutes

In-Person sessions were overwhelmingly preferred due to better emotional expression,
natural conversation flow, and the ability to see reactions and body language.
Phone sessions were considered convenient but lacked visual cues, which made some
participants less comfortable.
Chat sessions not preferred since participants found them slower, more stressful, and
less engaging than other modalities.

Observations from the Experiment and
Follow-up Interviews

Despite participants’ preference for in-person sessions, a significant number did not attend
these meetings. This highlights a potential barrier in accessing face-to-face counseling.

Feedback frequently centered on the counselor’s skills, suggesting that interpersonal
abilities are crucial for effective career counseling.

All participants acknowledged the benefits of discussing their career paths with someone and
expressed interest in further sessions.

Many were inclined to sign up due to the UNDP’s involvement, indicating that the association
with a reputable organization enhances participant engagement.

A few individuals reported reluctance to participate based on their personal experiences,
underscoring the need for continuous improvement in session delivery.

Conclusion

The Accelerator Lab’s experiment on career counseling modalities compared remote sessions, such as chat, with traditional in-person
counseling. While the hypothesis that chat-based counseling could match the effectiveness of face-to-face sessions was partially
supported, the research revealed that most participants still preferred in-person sessions. Face-to-face counseling was found to be the
most effective in terms of emotional connection, engagement, and content retention. Although chat sessions allowed for freer
expression and showed potential as a viable alternative in specific contexts, they were generally seen as secondary to the natural
rapport and effectiveness of in-person interactions.

Recommendations

Expand Access to In-Person Career Counseling: Because of the clear preference for in-person sessions, efforts could
focus on increasing the availability of physical counseling services. This could involve flexible scheduling and organizing
events to accommodate participants around Jordan. Additionally, integrating career counseling into schools and parents'
workplaces could provide valuable support, allowing parents to consult their children on their careers.

Diversify Counseling Modalities: While in-person sessions were preferred, phone and chat counseling hold a chance.
Introducing hybrid models, adding video call options, and improving the structure and engagement of non-visual
modalities could provide flexibility and cater to different youth preferences. Further research can explore the implications
and feasibility of these various modalities across different groups and contexts to better understand their effectiveness
and practical applications.

Improve Career-Matching Platforms Based on Participant Feedback: Based on survey results, improving job-matching
platforms by providing clearer job descriptions, more detailed filtering options, and incorporating English language
support would address some of the challenges participants faced. Enhancing these platforms with embedded career
counseling features could also help bridge the gap between education and employment.

Strengthen Follow-Up Support: As participants expressed interest in ongoing support, offering structured follow-up
sessions or a career mentoring program would help maintain engagement and provide long-term benefits, particularly in
helping individuals manage career transitions and professional development.
