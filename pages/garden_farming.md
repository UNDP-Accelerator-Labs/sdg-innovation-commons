> Title of the innovation

Garden farming

> Brief description of the innovation

Currently gardeners In my area use water from the wells for watering which is destructive to high production and bring about damage to the land as the wells fall during the rain season. So we want a borehole, pump and pipes that will connect each farmers to the water source. Able farmers will be filling up tanks unable will be watering direct from the borehole as the pump is running.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will enable me and others to generate income through farming during the winter and the rain season where there can be drought to enhance production continually. Here in mumbwa specifically in Machipisha village I grow cabbage and sell k5 and above each head, rape is k5 per bundle k120 per 50kg bag, fresh maize is k3 per cob order and k5 retail, onion is k2 each and tomato ranging from k120 to k180 per box. The target market is mumbwa town and soweto market after supplying the local consumer. Giving me and the team a borehole, pump and pipes for this business will help us save land for growing and from being damaged as we use water from the wells which fall annually and widens.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed in the way that a borehole is sunk in the area to supply the local gardeners with water. There is no existing prototype yet. My proposed implementation is to be helped with a borehole, pump and the dollars to generate power. Then each farmers buys the pipe to tap water to his or her garden.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will be of help to others in the way that they will be feeding from the local products and to the challenged people it will be easy to join farming business to those who are unable to dig the well especially widows and other older women including orphans. The innovation is more relevant to the current market
