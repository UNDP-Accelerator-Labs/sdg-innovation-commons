## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Combatting illegal wildlife trade
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that illegal wildlife trade is threatening wildlife species worldwide. Thailand is both the country of origin, transit, as well as consumption when talking about illegal wildlife trade. While the Thai government has increased the law enforcement efforts, innovative solutions especially those from local stakeholders and change agents are still in need for addressing the problems in a more sustainable manner. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The illegal wildlife trade in Thailand involves both native and non-native species. Well known products include ivory, tiger products, rhino horns, and pangolin scales, among others. These wildlife products are purchased for a variety of reasons, including food and medicine; recreation and companionship; jewellery, accessories, decorative and collectibles; and for spiritual purposes. Trade in wildlife products was previously conducted in physical markets, but the internet has rapidly evolved to become the key channel facilitating trade in wildlife specimens. In addition to domestic consumption, illegal wildlife products are also traded cross border to Lao PDR to the market in China. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Research conducted for WWF by GlobeScan in March 2020 revealed that 15% of 1,000 Thai respondents (representative of the general population for age and gender) had personally bought, or knew someone who had bought, wildlife products in an open wildlife market in the previous 12 months, most likely as pets, food or for use in traditional medicine. The analysis of available data indicates that whilst there is demand for ivory and tiger parts in Thailand, domestic demand for pangolins and rhino horn is negligible (TRAFFIC, 2020). There have been very few reported seizures of rhino horn, indicating that there is neither demand for nor supply of rhino horn in the Thai market. However, Thailand may be a geographic point of transaction within rhino horn trafficking chains as evidenced by the seizure of 12.5 kilograms of rhino horn from South Africa that led to the arrest of the Bach Family Syndicate in Thailand (Mongabay, 2018; The ASEAN Post, 2018). Meanwhile, seizures made during transit shows that smugglers still use Thailand as a transit hub for pangolins, as evidenced by the seizure in March 2017 at Bangkok airport (BBC, 2017).

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

UNDP Accelerator Lab Thailand in collaboration with Youth Co:Lab is planning to bring social innovation approach to tackle this issue by engaging with youth in border provinces as local change agents to tap into local insights and co-create solutions. We also plan to engage partners in Lao PDR as illegal wildlife trade is a transboundary issue and cross border collaboration is needed.
