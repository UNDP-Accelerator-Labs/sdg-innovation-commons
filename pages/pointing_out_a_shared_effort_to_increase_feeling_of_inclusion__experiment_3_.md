**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Javier Brolo and María Inés Castañeda



> On date (Day/Month/Year)

December 30th, 2021



> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Implementing environmental public policy



> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

How to improve the collaboration between society and public institutions to increase resilience to climate change 



> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How to implement environmental public policies? 



> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Fully Randomised (RCTs, etc.)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Municipality of Guatemala; Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources; Residents of Zone 5 in Guatemala City


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The experiment wants to evaluate the degree of acceptance of

feeling included among the beneficiaries of the 164-2021 agreement, between a

group of people who are taught that its implementation involves a shared

effort, and a group of people who are only taught their individual

responsibility regarding the agreement. The intention is learning if, by

showing that the implementation of the agreement involves a shared effort from

municipalities, environmental and health ministries, as well as citizens,

people will feel included as part of the group of people who benefit from the

policy instead of feeling they are affected by it. It is expected that those

who know that the effort implements the policy is shared feel included as

beneficiaries of the policy and not as affected by it.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF people are pointed out that implementing waste management regulation not only requires collaboration from citizens but also using human and monetary resources from institutions; THEN, people will feel that they are among those benefited by the regulation. 



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We will compare between a control and a treatment group, where the treatment is assigned randomly. The treatment consists in offering a complementary explanation about the role of the municipality and ministries on the implementation of the 164-2021 governmental decree. We will observe the degree of acceptance that people are included among the beneficiaries of the policy.



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Residents of zone 5 in Guatemala City. 



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Participants will be selected from people walking who are invited to participate and asked for consent. To assign the treatment, we will use Google's randomization tool (https://www.google.com/search?q=flip+a+coin). We will use a paper questionnaire to collect information. 



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

One day



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

This is a low cost experiment. We printed the paper forms and filled them by hand. We used a vest and card for identification. We were two people during 6 hours for data collection. We used open source software for analysis. The total monetary costs were under US$50.00.


## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Disproven



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The sample size should be increased. The instrument can be piloted and refined to reduce the length of the explanations. Instead of randomly intercepting people, we could select a sample of households (but this would require additional permissions). Considering a different time for data collection to include people who work during the afternoon. 



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Less than one month



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Under US$50.00



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We used these results to define the question for the next

learning cycle. Why do people do not adopt practices even if they recognize

them as beneficial?



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

It is planning to scale in several ways. Its results will be

used for the next cycle. The methodology will be transferred to local

governments and the ministry of environment so they can discover what works,

instead of only providing them with the results. 



> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment led to partnerships
- This experiment led to adoption of new ways of working by our partners
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The results showed that most participants consider the

policy that requires separating waste as something that benefits them,

regardless of whether they are pointed out that its implementation requires

effort from both citizens and public institutions or not. There is no evidence

that people resist environmental public policy because they don't see their

benefits, or because they think it's imposing responsibility only to citizens.

At least separating waste is a politically correct response. It is also

interesting pointing out that people do recognize that separating waste could

mean having to spend on more bags. Additional conversations suggested that

people do not comply because they do not want to pay for waste collection.



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

We had to prepare in little time so instruments could not be tested properly. We were limited to people willing to participate and available during that time. 



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The environment programmatic area because their projects

include efforts to increase public support for environmental policies. 



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The municipalities and the ministry of environment and

natural resources who have the responsibility to promote waste management

practices under the new regulation. 



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No. This was only one iteration to inform questions in the next cycle. 



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Try to anticipate that people have a bias to support politically correct regulation such as environmental policy. 



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Certainly, the use of prompts that include additional information to affect attitudes is a technique that can be applied to other topics that are interested in increasing public support. 



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The selection of the hypothesis to test was a direct result from exploration and mapping activities. We prioritize together based on the opportunities to link grassroots solutions and new sources of data. 



> What surprised you?

That people don't respond negatively to a framing that emphasizes that responsibilities are being transferred to citizens.
