> Title of the innovation

Poultry farming is the title of my innovation. It's a form of farming which involves raising domesticated birds. In this case am specifically referring to chickens. Their are chickens that are raised for meat which are called broilers and chickens raised for eggs known as layers.

> Brief description of the innovation

My engagement is to engage into layer poultry farming  business. For the purpose of commercial egg production. Poultry farming on a small scale requires only a minimum space. And chickens can be reared even at the backyard of homes.  Layer poultry farming is less costly on equipment, and only require feeders for feed and drinkers for water as a necessity. 
Management of layer chickens is quiet tricky when they are still chicks, as it is an age group most vulnerable to diseases, environment and nutritional problems. For this reason newly hatched chicks need special attention and care during their 4-5 weeks of life. As they get above 6 weeks they become less vulnerable to diseases. And an annual vaccination is given as they grow to prevent common diseases among chickens.
When it comes to food consumption, a range of food stuffs is available for chickens along side commercial feed. Such as nshima residues, green vegetables, maize and grains. When it comes to commercial feed, chickens above 6 weeks old are less costly. For a minimum of 12 chickens, only 1.4kg of commercial feed is required per day. Whilst water should always be filled up. Chickens start laying eggs at 20 weeks old. When above 30 weeks old, the rate and size of eggs increases gradually. A minimum of 12 chickens produces two trays of eggs per week. Which is equivalent to 60 eggs every seven days.
The goal is to keep layer chickens for eggs production. And become part of the bigger market of egg suppliers.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Layer poultry farming is for the purpose of commercial egg production. Layer chickens start laying eggs commercially afrom 19-20 weeks of age.
Layer poultry is achieved at a low cost of production. And because of the growing demand of eggs on the market. Their is actually a rise for eggs consumption while their is low egg production on the market.
Chicken poultry droppings are rich in nitrogen and are considered highly valuable as fertilizers. Once piled up can be sold. Layer poultry farming offers an opportunity of employment for both full time and part.

> Technical Feasibility

Layer poultry farming comes with its challenges. When still chicks, layers are more vunerable to diseases. Meaning that if not properly handled, they die. At this stage they require attention constantly, as a change in weather and environment can easily affect them. When it's cold they require a heater to provide warmth. And they are required to take an annual vaccination in prevention from diseases. As far as feeding is concerned, the feeders should always be filled up and water should not be empty for a longer period of time. Managing the growing development of chicks is very fundamental for a successful production of eggs. Once laying of eggs begin. A minimum of twelve chickens produces two trays of eggs per week. Which is equivalent to 60 eggs every seven days.
When it comes to the market, most homes in Zambia contain a tray of eggs among their groceries. Small scale grocery shop owners mostly run out of eggs. A clear indication of a huge demand to low supply of eggs on the market.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Eggs are affordable and can be purchased even by low income families. And it can be a source of income especially for women. And one can support themselves through backyard layer poultry and earn a living.
