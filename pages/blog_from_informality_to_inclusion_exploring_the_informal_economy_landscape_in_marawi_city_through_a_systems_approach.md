realities of
informality. With support
from the United Nations Development
Informal
Programme
Economy Facility, UNDP Philippines
sought to
leverage data and social
innovation to support the informal sector
in the socioeconomic recovery of the
Bangsamoro Autonomous Region
in
Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). It aimed
to seed the foundations for a holistic
issue, through
understanding of the
the development of a social protection
database for the Bangsamoro Ministry of
Labor and Employment complemented
by this research on the informal economy
landscape in Marawi City.

Building on UNDP’s long-standing efforts
to promote an enabling environment and
build capacities for inclusive growth, This
rapid ethnographic study was conducted
to map the journey of informal workers
and entrepreneurs, financial flows within
the value chains in which they operate,
and the system that influences inclusive
financial access in the region. It highlights
the multiple drivers and dimensions of
informality in the area, surfacing that while
it undeniably serves as a major driver
of the local economy and livelihoods,
cultural preservation, social cohesion,
and heritage also provide a strong
motivation for informal enterprises to
engage in the value chain. This presents
an opportunity
to
better understand informality and device
strategies to address informality as part
of inclusive recovery. While this study
focuses primarily on Marawi City and
surrounding areas, it is our hope that the
multitude of perspectives shared across
communities and different
levels of
governance can inspire opportunities for
integrated and area-based development.

B. Informality in the Philippines and
Bangsamoro: Overview

Aligned with the standard definition
adopted by the ILO at the global level,
in the Philippines, the “informal sector”
is defined for statistical purposes as
“household unincorporated enterprises
informal own
which consist of both
account enterprises and enterprises
of informal employers."13 Operationally,
this definition excludes corporations
and quasi-corporations, along with
single proprietorships, and commercial
fishing, farming, and livestock raising,
and those owned by cooperatives or
those whose accounts are separated
from the household.14 This definition also
emphasizes the nature of the informal
sector as enterprises and employers
within the economy. Related to this,
Republic Act No. 8425 identifies “workers
in the informal sector" as one of the basic
sectors that include “poor individuals
who operate businesses that are very
small in scale and are not registered
with any national government agency,
and to the workers in such enterprises
who sell their services in exchange for
subsistence level wages or other forms
of compensation.”

Workers in the informal sector often
comprise those who are most vulnerable,
including those engaged in casual or
seasonal employment with no legal or
contractual arrangements. This makes

Department of Labor and Employment
(DOLE) approximates that in the decade
between 2008 and 2017, employment in
the informal economy has averaged 21.1
million workers or roughly 56 percent of
total employment in the country, covering
those in precarious employment (e.g.
wage and salary workers in seasonal
jobs or different employers on a daily
basis) or vulnerable employment (e.g.
self-employed without paid employee
or unpaid family workers in a family-
owned business). In the same period,
employment in the informal economy

Bangsamoro Transition Authority issued BTA Bill No. 109 or “An Act institutionalizing
the registration and regional database for informal workers, economic units, and
organizations or associations,” to address the issue on the quality of employment of the
informal workers.

Section 4.b of the BTA Bill No, 109 defines the Informal Economy as “all economic
activity by workers and economic units that are, in law or in practice, not covered
or insufficiently covered by laws or any formal arrangements. It does not cover illicit
activities, in particular the provision of service or the production, sale, possession or
use of goods forbidden by law.” The said Bill also defines Informal Employment as
“an employment arrangement in the formal or informal sectors or in households that
exist based mostly on casual employment, kinship, or personal and social relations
with no formal guarantees on pegalm protection, and benefits economic units that are
unregistered, unlicensed, and unregulated.”

Marawi, a city within the Province of Lanao

hub prior to its siege and was known
for its mosques and lively commercial
areas. Its economy hinges significantly
on agriculture, trading, and exporting.23

A. Rationale

Recognizing that solutions to tackle the
complex issue of informality would need
to be context-specific and adequate to
conditions defined by the availability
of social safety nets, wages, and an
enabling environment, UNDP launched
the Informal Economy Facility (IEF), as a
knowledge platform and policy initiative
to help “move the needle on poverty,
vulnerability and inequality by protecting
actors of the informal economy and
empowering them to benefit from and
contribute to inclusive, job-rich, and green
recovery & development pathways.”24
UNDP especially promotes a systems
approach in tackling the complexity of
issues surrounding informality in order to
better elucidate the dynamics between
factors that shape the sector, which can
then better inform integrated policy and
programmes for sustainable impact.

1. Scoping and data collection

In assessing the informal sector’s access,
barriers, resources, and social innovation
practices, the study sought to start from a
human-centred approach through rapid
ethnography. Rapid ethnography is a
form of qualitative research that includes
a variety of methods that are all integrated
to provide deeper insights into a person’s
life and how they interact with the
world and systems around them (MaRS
Solution Lab, 2021).29 Sangaramoorthy
and Kroeger (2020) highlight several
contexts wherein rapid ethnography
is especially useful for, such as when
hidden or vulnerable populations need
to be reached, as well as in involving
communities in developing or adjusting
programs or policies, among others.30

The data collection is deemed complete
when raw findings gathered from various
sources have reached a saturation point
of similar views for triangulation. To this
end, a series of activities were conducted
to gather information regarding the state
of informality in Marawi City. The team
employed semi-structured
interviews
and focus group discussions, the outputs
of which were analyzed through journey
mapping and synthesized into sectoral
personas. These were deemed most
appropriate given the pandemic context
when data collection took place, which
discouraged other methods that require
deep community immersion.

Given the limitations in time and available
data, within the context of the COVID-19
pandemic as well as Typhoon Odette that
hit the Philippines during data collection,
purposive sampling was used to focus
on the characteristics of the targeted

these interviews were triangulated with
insights shared by ecosystem actors, such

from the academe and civil society, to
provide anchors for a systems lens.
These include a focus group discussion
with representatives of provincial offices
(10 females, four males), as well as
dedicated key informant interviews with
representatives from different levels of
governance at the city and ministerial
level, as well as the academe.

2. Analysis and validation

The study seeks to provide a qualitative
complement amid data gaps about the
informal sector, considering its size and
links to poverty and inclusive growth.
To this end, the analysis employed a
complementary approach
to bridge
individual experiences with a systems
perspective. It aimed to build on and
contribute to the richness of the existing
discourse by contextualizing these in a
fragile setting through patterns identified
and nuances that surfaced on the ground
for triangulation.

A. Sector Profiles

This illustration summarizes the profiles of key sectors that the field research team encountered
during the rapid ethnography interviews in Marawi City. This provides an overview of the
respective contexts, challenges, and aspirations from each sector, which then feeds into the
analysis, in order to understand and synthesize insights from diverse lenses.

Fisherfolk

Artisans

Marawi City is located along the shores of
Lake Lanao, the largest lake in Mindanao
and the namesake of the Maranao people,
where the fishing villages provide livelihood
for the communities. Fishing knowledge is
often passed down to the sons of fisherfolk
through early exposure and apprenticeships,
where the son accompanies the father in
many instances whenever the latter goes to
the lake. Similarly, the mother would rely on
the help of her daughter to sell the caught fish
and perform house chores. These traditional
roles and responsibilities of men and women
are thus also passed down from generation
to generation. Fishing provides food and
income for the daily needs of the family. The
respondents also view their occupation as a
beneficial source of fresh affordable food for
their village or community.

Artisans are employed by more established
enterprises, particularly those selling heritage-
inspired goods, souvenirs, and products. Some
of these enterprises are registered, whereas
others are not. Nevertheless, regardless of
status, enterprise owners need to establish
trust and relationships with the artisans they
employ and if possible, provide necessary
training for them. Most of the weavers tend to
be women whereas woodcarvers tend to be
men. These artisan products and crafts are
marketed within the community and externally
through trade fairs, exhibitions, and even online
platforms. Since this is a niche market, cultural
value and aesthetics become important factors
in pricing. Additionally, this becomes a source
of pride and a means for cultural awareness,
as well as a means for artisans to participate in
this niche market.

Farmers

Micro-retailers

Tricycle drivers

the consequences of

The destruction of post-harvest
facilities,
equipment, and rice mills during the Marawi
siege impacted the livelihood of farmers, who
often had been tilling the land for decades.
Despite their crucial role in producing food,
farmers remain among the poorest population
and endure
the
agricultural sector’s sluggish growth. Farmers
without their own land end up working for
others or illegally occupying public or private
land. Lack of access to credit and insurance,
poor adoption of new technologies, and lack of
proper training relevant to the industries have
contributed to the perception that registration
to systems such as the Registry System
for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA) is
unnecessary and does not have added value.

Tiangges and sari-sari stores are classified
under micro-enterprises and are considered
informally as part of
the “underground
economy” due to their small business size
and lack of registration with the appropriate
government agencies. Many sari-sari stores
operate unregistered. A major challenge
identified is the limited customer base, often
confined within the community; however, at
least one respondent has utilized online selling
during the pandemic as a means to reach
potential buyers. Delivery in Marawi City has
been observed to be mostly “one-way,” with
no known outgoing delivery providers.

All of the interviewed tricycle drivers were
married men, with at least an elementary
education, and at least six years of experience
operating within Marawi City, earning an
average of about PhP 4,000 to PhP 5,000
per month. However, pandemic lockdowns
shortened operation hours due to the curfews
imposed by the city, thereby doubling waiting
time and lessening income. Some tricycle
drivers also resorted to providing private
services to senior citizens and persons with
disabilities. The issue of deteriorating health
was also raised by the drivers. The lack of
sleep, along with the longer working and
waiting hours, significantly endangers the
health conditions of many tricycle drivers
who become more vulnerable to illnesses or
depression in the long run.

B. Understanding the Drivers of Informality in
Marawi

from

Results
the rapid ethnography
and consultations were consolidated
and analysed
through a systems
lens to identify recurring themes and
possible interlinkages across responses
coming from the different sectors in
the community. Through this, the study
sought to establish a deeper and more
nuanced understanding of the informal
sector specific to the context of Marawi
City, with the view of nuancing the
discourse on prevailing assumptions
about the informal economy.

Existing metrics of “formality,” such as
registration or certification do not fully
capture the experiences on the ground.
Notably, the respondents for this study
do not necessarily identify or are aware
of the categorization between “formal”
and “informal.” Deeper probing revealed
that the distinction between “formal”
and “informal” has also been blurred
to the extent that external events, such
as conflict or emergencies can push an
individual or an enterprise to identify
themselves as being “informalized.”
Delineating
such definitions have
policy implications, noting differences
in the circumstances of individuals and
economic units, amid assumptions that

formalization is correlated with scaling
of economic ventures from individual
to collective enterprises. In this regard,
responses from the community were
cross-checked with insights gathered
from the literature review and validation
sessions with other local stakeholders, to
situate the experiences of respondents
with the broader socioeconomic context
in the region.

Emerging findings were clustered under
three major themes to help make sense
of the drivers of informality in Marawi
City:

1. governance and political drivers,

2. economic and market drivers, and

3. sociocultural drivers.

A crucial point to consider is that instead
of solely focusing on the concept of
“informality” itself, these themes could
also be viewed as an exploration of the
drivers of economic decision-making
and participation in Marawi City. These
themes are based on the experiences and
perspectives of the local stakeholders as
further discussed below.

have led to unfamiliarity for cooperatives

Along with this transition at the regional-
level, Marawi City
is still grappling
with the effects of the siege, which
occurred less than two years before the
establishment of BARMM. The Marawi
Siege resulted in extensive damage to
infrastructure, displacement of residents,
and a complex security situation. As
a result, several factors contribute to
informality in Marawi City, such as:

Another proposed
Informal Economy Registration and
Bangsamoro Database Bill (Bill 194) seeks
to establish a comprehensive database
that covers all workers and economic
units in the informal economy.33

In terms of setting up and running a
business, other laws such as the Magna
Carta for Micro, Small, and Medium
Enterprises
(Republic Act No. 9501)
and the Go Negosyo Act (RA 10644)
put emphasis on formal registration as
a prerequisite to avail of government
assistance. These laws also mandate the
creation of MSME Development Plans
and the coordination of programs at the
local level. Despite these, respondents
from the informal sector are still not fully
aware of the incentives or benefits offered
through formal registration under these
laws. The process of formal registration
involves costs and administrative burdens
that informal workers businesses might
find challenging, particularly if they are
operating on a smaller scale or are facing
financial constraints, which in turn could
be a deterrent to formalization.

Another related initiative identified in the
Bangsamoro Development Plan 2023-
2028 is the Bangsamoro Local Economic
Support Services (BLESS) Program, which
seeks to support the operationalization
of Local Economic Enterprises in local
government units as part of their drive
to promote area-based development,
stimulate local economic activities, and
create opportunities for development.

The bill’s objective to promote SEs may
also inspire partnership between the
formal and informal sectors, that could
lead
to collaboration or mentorship
opportunities wherein established SEs
support or guide informal businesses
in transitioning towards these socially
impactful models. However, challenges
may still arise regarding the transition
of
into a more
structured social enterprise model,
including meeting regulatory standards,
access
resources, and adapting
operational structures. Hence, while the
proposed bill presents an opportunity for
recognition and alignment with socially
impactful models, support mechanisms
and
transitional assistance will still
be necessary in order to facilitate the
integration of informal businesses within
the social enterprise framework.

In addition to spurring local economic
growth, enterprise development can also
address socioeconomic outcomes while
aligning with the local culture and values.
The proposed BARMM Social Enterprise
Act (Bill 157) provides a framework that
recognizes “social enterprises”
(SEs)
as businesses that primarily cater to
a social, cultural, or environmental
purpose and only secondarily seeks to
create profit. The bill highlights that the
concept behind SEs actually aligns with
Islamic beliefs of “Zakat” or care for the
poor, emphasizing how businesses can
offer “transformational services for the
well-being of the marginalized sector it
serves or society at large.”34

saw
rehabilitation of Marawi City as an
opportunity to engage members of the
informal economy, noting that recovery
efforts can be designed to encourage
the formal registration of workers and
enterprises. Apart from serving as a form
of social protection through employment
guarantee schemes,35 it can also serve
as a display of governance to build an
appreciation for how taxes are spent.

It was likewise reiterated that efforts
to support peace and development in
the transition require accountability to
be fostered across the new regional
government and local government units
comprising BARMM.

During the pandemic, barangays were the
main distribution point for the ayuda or
assistance. A best practice that has been
reported in the context of the pandemic
was addressing special needs amid the
lockdowns, i.e., matching tricycle drivers
with constituents that have particular
mobility needs such as senior citizens
and PWDs. In certain instances, given the
urgency and immediacy of the situation,
some barangay captains were reported
to provide assistance out of their own
pockets.

For example, one respondent shared
that the barangay captain was able to
lend them money when they wanted to
start their livelihood. In another instance,
a barangay captain subsidised
the
struggling community enterprise borne
out of a recovery intervention.

Barangays are also an important source
of information regarding the availability
of and facilitating access to support. The
leadership arrangements of cooperatives
and associations that provide livelihood
support may be influenced based on
personal ties, as revealed during a visit
to one of the enterprises. Furthermore,
there were cited instances where leaders
at the community level are able to
gatekeep resources or are even reported
to withhold assistance. In extreme cases,
local leaders can deter individuals from

economy. Encouraging the transition to
formality becomes a challenge when
businesses are entrenched in practices
that do not align with
regulatory
requirements and standards.

2. Economic and Market Drivers

Marawi City was regarded as the centre
of economic activity in the Bangsamoro
region, wherein goods and services
continuously flowed, were processed,
and exchanged. With the Maranaos’
intrinsic business acumen, the city was
a melting pot of simple to complex
livelihood activities where different
actors within and outside the Province of
Lanao del Sur got to participate. Doing
business within Marawi entails mobility,
thus residents from other municipalities
move toward the city to engage in
labor, trade and back after their day’s
work. Enterprises – both registered
and “unregistered” - interact with each

other freely to be able to fulfil their
requirements. For instance, a registered
business company might be sourcing
from small-scale
their raw materials
unregistered enterprises, and selling
the processed products to their markets.
These interactions make up the market
and business environment in Marawi.
This is why the twin shocks of the siege in
2017 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020
did not just disrupt the local economy –
for the respondents, these also became
a stress test if going formalized and/or
renewing their business permits truly
makes economic sense.

a. Opportunity cost to formalize

Formalization is generally perceived as
beneficial and necessary to improve one’s
economic condition. The respondents
who used to have businesses in Marawi
City pre-siege echoed the opportunities
extended by registration such as getting
recognition through market promotions
and mileages, accessing government
benefits, and “doing the right thing.”
However, the common cited barriers to
formalization are the bureaucratic red
tape and complex regulatory processes,
and convoluted procedures for business
registration, permits, and licenses that
discourage individuals and businesses
from seeking formal status.

the delivery

Expectations
of assistance influenced the decision
of the respondents to continue their
registration or remain in the informal
sector. The respondents went on with
the latter because they had not seen the
advantage of registration thus far, saying
that no assistance has been extended.

As one sari-sari store owner puts it:

"I [used to] have permits—from LGU permits down to barangay permits—because

I believed that having them would give me benefits until it expired. Then the siege
happened, followed by the lockdown measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It
was a horrible and disappointing feeling that I haven’t received support or assistance
from the government. I have heard on the news that there will be assistance from the
government. We waited until we got frustrated. Now I am thinking whether to renew my
Business Permits from the LGU or not. The permit I only have now is from the barangay
because I see that it is just the same whether you have a permit or not.

Cooperatives allow businesses to thrive
while also providing employment and
making activities visible in the community.
However, the principles of cooperatives
differ from the persisting cultural norms
in Marawi City. Livelihood activities are

of the transportation sector wherein
having a driver’s license is critical to
operating and gaining the trust of their

as a tipping point for majority of the
respondents, maintaining that they saw
no benefits to registering and being
formalized, or if there are any, that these
benefits were less than what informality
offered.
Informal businesses often
operate with lower overhead costs such
as taxes, regulatory compliance, or formal
labor standards. This reduced financial
burden and allowed them to offer goods

the respondents was their lost savings

businesses to support their household

was the shortage in the supply of goods

tied down by bureaucratic processes
or formal regulations. The perceived
risk associated with
informality was
also low seeing that they know many
members within their community that are
also informal or continuously operating
their businesses even without business
permits.

The BARMM Development Plan 2023-
2028 considers BNR as the initial step for
MSMEs to access capacity development
support to enhance their products and
services, and likewise, for the government
to be able to track baseline conditions
and monitor progress. Bundled support
during the actual business operations
of an enterprise, such as market
research, will maintain the momentum of
enterprises who participated in business
name registrations. To this end, the
Bangsamoro Ministry of Trade, Tourism
and Investment (MTIT) held the Business
Name Registration (BNR) in 2021, which
resulted in the registration of 8,427
MSMEs, a 161.46 per cent increase from
2020. The period between 2020-2021
saw a registration of 11,650 businesses
in BARMM, and the creation of 31,000
jobs36 generated an
investment of
around 2.5 billion PHP. The observed
uptick in registration was an insight
to the government that there was a
need for enhanced outreach for public
services and its benefits, as well as the
succeeding demonstration of response
and follow-through action to make the
case for business registration. However,
despite the significant increase in BNR,

b. Scarcity of resources and mevans to access financial support and capital

During the height of the pandemic,
respondents shared that there were
days with no buyers or clients visiting
their stores. In the case of businesses
with consumable goods, the stocks were
appropriated for their own consumption,
contributing to the lack of capitalization
to sustain their enterprise.

Accessing loans could have been a viable
option for recovery, however, financial
institutions typically require collaterals,
which many MSMEs had lost or that were
damaged during the siege. This made it
difficult to access formal financing and
pushed them towards informal options
instead.

In both cases, their immediate family
members – locally and abroad – became
major sources of capital to rebuild or
establish a new business. This financial
support is channelled through Palawan
Express, a go-to platform for money
transfers in Marawi City. Another shared

The enterprises mostly operate and make
business to cover their family’s daily
needs, and thus placed the Maranaos and
their businesses in survival mode when
the shocks happened. Stripped of their
livelihood, daily sustenance is the primary
priority to recover. In terms of transitioning
to formality, the ILO refers to two (2)
types, the opportunity entrepreneurs
and the survivalist entrepreneurs. The
former immediately sees the benefits
of enterprise formalization while the
survivalist entrepreneurs are constricted
by among others, the lack of means
and ambition to formalize. Majority of
the respondents interviewed currently
operate as survivalist entrepreneurs.

28

There are mixed responses on whether
registration will be considered once the
enterprise owners and their businesses
have fully recovered. Those who have
a positive outlook on
registration
mentioned that having a business permit
has helped them in the past and they
are thus encouraged that the situation
will be similar in the future. By contrast,
other respondents are perplexed by the
option and would like to concentrate on
using their limited resources to improve
and stabilize their livelihood rather than
on registration purposes.

straightforward –
end-to-end process of getting the raw
materials from producers for use in
processing into products and services
for selling to the target market and
consumers. With the processes and
activities that happen along the chain,
value is created and added. However,
value chains are also influenced by their
context and the interaction of the actors
and enablers. From the interviews, the
respondents shared that economic units
in their upstream and downstream value
chains are not necessarily registered,
and only need to fulfil the need and
requirement of the transaction – opening
the opportunity for the informal sector’s
participation. Entry into these types of
economic activities typically does not
require formal education or specialized
training. In farming, for example, there
are activities that are seasonal and
mostly hire individuals for part-time work.
This provides leeway for the informal
workers to engage in other casual work
during off-seasons and achieve multiple
streams of income.

have been addressed by “pasabay” or co-

example is a youth-led enterprise working
with individual rice farmers in providing

to a government stakeholder, is also a
point of flexibility for the value chains, as
the absence of permits to provide official
receipts enables the informal sector to
offer lower prices to their clients in the
upstream and downstream of their value
chains.

As one of the MSME respondents shared:

informal businesses do not have access

and capacity or skills enhancement that
are provided to the registered enterprises
for long-term benefits and sustainability.

"

Our weavers are from far-flung areas and our perennial problem is the limited
supply of the raw materials in Marawi, especially after the siege. The suppliers
of raw materials for weaving were also displaced and had financial difficulties.
For us to weave, we need to travel to Iligan, Cagayan, and sometimes to Manila
to buy the thread we need. The lockdown measures aggravated the situation,
disallowing us to travel freely. Transportation and transactional costs are added
to our expenditure, which cost us a lot. And now, there has been a steady
decline in orders. We are hoping that the government invests in infrastructures
for us to do our business with ease and bring the raw materials closer to us to
lessen our costs.

d. The business environment landscape and the absorptive capacity of the
local market

With the establishment of a new regional
bureaucracy and with the influx of funds
for BARMM programs and projects, the
government had become a significant
market player, as observed by local
stakeholders. These new programs
and projects have also generated
employment, both directly and indirectly.
The latest available figures from 2021
show that the BARMM economy is largely
comprised of the services sector at 38.9
per cent, of which public administration,
defence, and compulsory social services
comprise almost a quarter of the sector
(23.4 per cent).38 Furthermore, up to 37.9
per cent of expenditures in the region can
be attributed to government spending.39
It is widely acknowledged that the biggest
market for local expansion in BARMM is
currently through public procurement,
which would entail

highlights the need to stimulate financial

However, there is a lack of training

chain. In terms of formal education, the
majority of respondents were either
elementary school or high school
graduates. Some have acknowledged
that this has led to limited opportunities
for employment, whether

micro retail entrepreneurship as viable
entry points for economic participation.

the
respondents, with some even calling it
a “way of life” that has persisted even
before the major shocks of the Marawi
siege and
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Poverty incidence in the province was
at 66.3 per cent in 2015, just two years
the siege. Although official
before
statistics have since indicated a decline in
poverty in the area, several respondents
shared that they experienced greater
difficulties due to these shocks.41

A common framing by respondents is in
terms of “before and after” a particular
shock (e.g., “before the siege,” “before
COVID” etc.). There is frustration about
how these circumstances add to the
burden they already experience prior to
the onset of such shocks, while others
reveal that they were getting along
fine, if not for these crises, highlighting
the diverse outlooks of respondents in
the informal economy. All respondents
also cited sustainability challenges
due to environmental degradation and
changing weather patterns, leaving them
to further grapple with having to

balance economic needs and preserving
their resources. This demonstrates how
external shocks can push vulnerable
groups over the brink, which speaks to
the fragility of socioeconomic conditions
in the community. Such vulnerability can
make it challenging for individuals to
formalize their businesses, as the focus
shifts to immediate survival rather than
navigating bureaucratic
formalization
processes.

the

respondents

expressed a more forward-looking view
of what comes “after” the crises despite
the challenges. While some respondents
share that they hope to even just get by,
even one day at a time, some articulate
that they will be able to fully recover
or that their situation will get better.
A number have also observed their
tendency to be more “conservative”
or mindful in using their resources, as
relayed by a respondent:

"

Before, people were easy-go-lucky (this is based on my opinion) maybe because
they have full coverage of their activities. Now I have noticed that people are more
conservative in terms of their resources. Somehow they work hard, find resources to
provide for their family and even the unnecessary things. They converted to planting
vegetables, conserving their food, and now are quieter and more peaceful.

These behavioral shifts also translate to
incentivizing formalization at an individual
level. For instance, a respondent who has

license, and that his tricycle is registered

the psychological and cultural factors

drawing attention to the
importance

by the respondents is in terms of being
able to contribute to the community, such
as being a more accessible and cheaper

(as one respondent mentions, “I don’t

community.

"

In our community, I am accepted well because my neighbours are my loyal customers. I
am thankful that I belong to this community because everyone has the initiative to help
each other, it is relatively peaceful and has unity. In small things, I contribute to help my
community as they can easily access my store if they need some ingredients for their

c. Preserving cultural heritage

Heritage is an important part of community
life in Marawi, officially called the “Islamic
City of Marawi” and a major centre for
the Maranao people. In this regard, the
damage inflicted by the Marawi siege in
2017 can also be described in terms of
the devastation to cultural assets in the
city, including the Grand Mosque, at least
30 mosques, and 10 madrasas, as well as
the reported looting of cultural artifacts,
antiques, and relics within the battle
zone, and the markets lost for Maranao
products.42

Moreover, respondents have expressed
their pride in their culture and faith.
Morning prayers, for example, are a part
of their daily routine before heading out
to work. For some of the respondents,
the reason they pursued a particular
livelihood is partly based on what they
inherited and learned from their parents,
as well as their advocacy to preserve
and promulgate the Marano heritage
through cultural products. Weaving,
farming, fishing, and even retailing may
have distinct cultural practices related to
local knowledge passed down through
generations. This deep connection
impact
to cultural heritage might
businesses potentially resisting certain
formalization
that may
conflict with these practices. Related to
this, the Bangsamoro Development Plan
2023-2028 recognizes the promotion
and preservation of Bangsamoro identity
as an important aspect of socioeconomic
development in the region.

the challenge in terms of logistics, market

goods and the availability of cheaper
materials from abroad.

Nevertheless, past efforts have seen a
new generation of Maranaos emerge
with
their understanding of and
appreciation for the value chain of local
cultural assets, including coffee or tablea,
presenting the opportunity to engage the
youth more meaningfully, drive heritage
preservation, and enhance recognition
of their cultural identity. More established
MSMEs and social enterprises in the city
have also raised the need for increased
awareness of the social impact and
cultural contribution embodied by their
traditional products, as well as enhancing
information on the provenance of cultural
intellectual
assets and protection of
property.

d. Special groups and access to opportunities

Access to opportunities may also be
defined in part by social identity or
affiliation to a particular social group.
Women and girls, for example, were still
expected to take on the role of primary
caretakers in the household amid the
pandemic lockdowns in BARMM. Based
on the experiences of respondents, it also
appears that traditional gender roles are
still applied even in managing finances or
earnings with the father as the “provider”
and the mother as the “keeper” of the
income. However, there are
family’s
such instances as single parents taking
on both of these roles out of necessity,
regardless of gender. In this regard, the
implementation of the BARMM Gender
(GAD) Guidelines,
and Development
which mandates that 2 percent of the
mandatory 5 percent GAD budget of each
BARMM ministry or agency be allocated
to women’s economic empowerment,43
can support the specific needs of women
and girls in the region.

Discussions with other stakeholders also
brought to light the situation of other
special groups. For example, registered
social enterprises in Marawi City have
employed IDPs to work in their facilities or
shops. Up to 5,000 families are reported
to still be living in temporary shelters and
are yet to return to their homes.

Meanwhile, government stakeholders
have also discussed the reintegration
of former combatants, including those
coming from surrounding areas in Lanao
del Sur. They note that special care
and attention must be placed to ensure
that the criteria for participation in the
programs are inclusive and coherent with
other policies and processes related to
camp transformation and rights of People
Deprived of Liberty who are already
engaged in livelihood programs but may
be unable to register their cooperative
due to their status.

pointed out the lack of representation
of indigenous peoples in discussions

vulnerabilities of indigenous peoples in

framework for member-states to adopt
in supporting the transition of informal
workers to formalization. ILO R204 had
been adopted by the Philippine National
Department of Labor and Employment
and implementation has been rolled
out at the regional offices. Among the
just
recommendations
transition to formality is prioritizing the
reduction of compliance costs of being
formal such as taxes, social security, and
labor protection over reducing the cost
of becoming formal such as timeframes
and corresponding fees to register. The
R204 also includes improving the access
to social security coverage as a critical
benefit component for entrepreneurs
to consider transition to formalization.
Contextualizing its application in the
recovery of Marawi and BARMM’s long-
term growth entails a phased approach,
drawing from the experience of the
informal economy’s recovery in post-
conflict cities captured by UN-Habitat:
immediate post-conflict, transition and

Government partners recognize
an innovative spirit is a prerequisite to

of how an entrepreneurial spirit has been
sparked amid the siege. An innovative
mindset can play a role in bridging
resilience and transitions to formality

attuned to changes in their community
enables actors to anticipate and respond
to market demand. This ability to innovate
by upgrading offers and/or operations
then enhances resilience and prospects
for transitions to formality.

On
this note, examples of social
innovation practices that have been
identified during this research include:

To survive these shocks, informal

the kind of support an informal
business would need, such as
extending microfinance systems
and other services such as

counter to their way of life. Likewise,
respondents perceived that bank

due to abject poverty. This further
drives the need to institute financial

2. Market expansion

Given the limited market within the region,
boosting the productivity of informal
economy actors entails expanding their
market base by tapping the government,
which is currently the biggest market, but
also through vertical integration, both of
which could facilitate the transition to
formality.

The halal value chain presents a strategic

growth
in the region. This requires
collaboration among stakeholders and a
shared commitment to halal compliance
and quality. Business practices must be
aligned with international halal standards
and that
local businesses have the
necessary support to participate in the
halal economy effectively. One way
to do it is to enforce halal certification
and standards that meet international
requirements. This provides a strong
indication of the authenticity and quality
of halal products, which can enhance
