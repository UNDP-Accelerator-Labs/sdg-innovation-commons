> Brief description of the innovation

Vonse Health is a health coaching service that equips people with knowledge, skills, tools and confidence to achieve their health goals. The service is centered around people with chronic conditions e.g hypertension, diabetes and obesity as these are lifestyle based conditions and a health partner  can help these people learn to better manage their conditions as it has statically been proven that despite the availability of primary health care services people still has challenges managing their conditions. Vonse provides one-on-one coaching programs view platforms that are convinient for the patients.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Vonse intends to charge a fee for services rendered, a monthly fee for regular services, or a package fee for the various health coach packages. Vonse Health will contribute immensely to the public health sector as physicians do not have the time to monitor and educate patients due to the high proportion of doctor to patient ratio. The service will focus on patients with chronic illness that result from lifestyle and behaviours e.g hypertension, obesity and diabetes. The prize money would great help towards incoparation of the business and setup costs.

> Technical Feasibility

Vonse intends to use existing platform for the convenience of the patients e.g Skype and zoom for the consultations and google services for patient data management. The patients get a biweekly coaching session via these platforms and health information via SMS and whatsapp services.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Vonse Health will impact the lives of patients living with chronic illness greatly, as they take an active role in healthcare even as we bridge the gap with their primary health care providers. A lot of Zambian live with these conditions and have neither knowledge nor skills to properly self manage.
