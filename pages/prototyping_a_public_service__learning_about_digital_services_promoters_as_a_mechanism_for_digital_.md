## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

B1: If business owners are visited by a "digital services promoter" who offers a predefined menu of digital aids, then entrepreneurs increase their positive attitude towards digital technologies. B2: If business owners are visited by a "digital services promoter" who offers a predefined menu of digital aids, then entrepreneurs trust that they will be able to replicate what they have learned on their own.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

This exercise is located in a pre-experimental phase, prototype known as prototyping. In particular, it seeks to test a promoter of digital services model, who visit tourist centers and offer assistance on how to access a series of digital services co-design with users. For this, the testing of prototypes will be done iteratively and on a small scale. This implementation size allows for quick adjustments, upon a build, learning and improve loop and later evaluation of the scalability potential of such model.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Business owners located in 5 out of 13 tourist centers where the Digi-Chiquihuites project has taken place: Parque Balboa, Puerta de Diablo, Parque Recreativo Apulo, Mercado del Mar y Turicentro Atecozol.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Data on two indicators will be collected on ArcGis Pro - Survey 123 as an aggregate of all the interactions the digital services promoter encounter in which a service is provided (a). Self-reported average gain in digital skills, (b). Aggregate average gain in positive attitudes. Additionally, the prototype iterations will be documented on a logbook, on the basis of offering the service, whether or not a service is requested and delivered.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

5 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
