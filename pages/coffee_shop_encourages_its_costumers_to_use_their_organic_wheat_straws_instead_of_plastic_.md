Coffee Shop In Tashkent went plastic straw free zone by asking and encouraging their customers to support them with this initiative. They found an organic, eco-friendly solution and provide Organic Wheat Straws. Breadly Coffee shop is also encouraging customers to teach their children to be responsible for the environment from an early age.  

 In case any customer that still will want a plastic straw for some reason Coffee Shop will charge for ECOLOGY tax in the bill, this way coffee shop will collect the money to plant trees and flowers.
