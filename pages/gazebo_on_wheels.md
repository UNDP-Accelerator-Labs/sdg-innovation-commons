> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

The innovation is a gazebo on wheels. The gazebo is transferable; it can be placed on locations dependent to the preference of the users.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

The need to have a resting area for students after class that they can move wherever they prefer (under shaded areas or directly beside their classroom). 

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

For the students of DOSCST.  Since there are "covered limited lounging areas" within the campus, the gazebo on wheels is accessible and highly useful during rainy seasons. 

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

Even though there is limited resources (number of gazebos in the area), its utility can be optimized if there is a way to make it conform to what is needed.  Since students are normally mobile, a mobile gazebo which they can use for several locations is highly preferred. 

> Opportunities: What are other opportunities where the solution can be applied?

A mobile gazebo can be fabricated for households who likes their things "portable". 

> Status of the Innovation

- completed / scaled / commercialized

> Signs of Change: Are there changes observed with the innovative intervention? (If YES, answer other and describe the sign of change)

- impact and change is starting to take root
