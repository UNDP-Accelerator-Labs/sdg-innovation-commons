Yatu (our own) Piggery Farm will be located in Chinyunyu Area along Great East Road 25Km form Chongwe town and about 55Km from Lusaka. The Farm will sit on 2.58 acres of land. The primary object of this initiative is to create employment opportunities for vulnerable but viable youths and women.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Statistics have shown that, pork (pig meat) is the most widely consumed meat in the world, followed by poultry and beef. The value of trade in pig products around the world runs into billions of dollars every year and Africa enjoys less than 5 percent of this action. Therefore, our organization will benefit by taking advantage of the available market and become a major force to reckon with in Pig Farming in Zambia.

> Technical Feasibility

The project is phased into two: Phase one; will focus on pig production where we have planned to start on a small scale with the desire to grow our production to 20 pigs per month by 2025 which translates into roughly 50,000 ZMW or 2,081 GBP per month and roughly 600,000 ZMW or 24,981 GBP per year.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project has potential to employ between 5 to 10 full time members and between 10 to 15 seasonal workers. Impacting between 90 to 200 lives directly and hundreds of lives indirectly in the process. 

The primary object of this initiative is to create employment opportunities for vulnerable but viable youths and women within Chinyunyu area Chongwe district, who will be employed to do various work at the farm. Residents within Yatu Piggery Farm catchment will have access to pig meat at affordable prices thereby improving nutrition status in the area. 
In addition, J-TAP SERVICES Zambia strongly believes that, with little support, everyone in society can gain their own Economic Independence. In view of this, J-TAP SERVICES will commit a certain percentage of it proceeds towards empowering underprivileged  women through capacity building in farming, form groups and empower them with startup funds which shall be named “Self-help Start-up Revolving funds (ShSRF)”
