The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
Executive summary

8

This report provides an initial assessment of the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Mauritius.
It was undertaken as part of the efforts to respond
to the UN Secretary General’s call on the UN
system to support countries in responding to the
pandemic. The report utilizes a combination of
household survey data collected by UNDP during
the aftermath of the lockdown, with historical data
on macro-economic and sectoral aggregates, and
key informant interviews with sector experts. The
novelty of this report, in part, pertains to the effort to
capture household behaviour and their assessment
of the efficacy of immediate recovery support, during
and after lockdown, and assessing the impacts on
the poorest of the poor - a segment of the population
often not captured
in national surveys. The
assessment captures the short-term, medium-term
and long-term impacts of the pandemic at macro,
sectoral and household levels.

At the macro level, declining exports and Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI) will continue to affect the
growth in the long term. The World Bank and IMF
project that the main trading partners of Mauritius
will record negative growth in 2020 which will likely
result in further fall in exports and FDI. Real GDP
declined by 33% during the second quarter of 2020
compared to the same period in 2019. The negative
impact on GDP would have been worse, at around
40%, had the Government not intervened with relief
measures. The unemployment rate, that has been
stable during the past five years at an average of
7.1% reached 10.3% in July. The largest effect was felt
in the informal sector where employment during the
lockdown fell by 89,200 compared to 40,200 in the
formal sector.

At the sectoral level, high levels of vulnerability
were observed in manufacturing, accommodation
and
food, construction, entertainment and
recreation sectors. These sectors registered a fall
of 43.6, 98.1, 89.4 and 85% in the second quarter

of 2020 relative to 2019, respectively. Real estate
activities (-1.2%), financial and insurance activities
(0.2%), and public administration (-6.7%) were less
impacted. Without
the Government’s financial
support, the impact on the output could have been
even worse. The fall in tourism would have led to an
additional fall in GDP of around 9% in 2020 relative to
2019 corresponding to 51,000 jobs at risk. Similarly,
a fall in manufacturing exports (excluding food and
beverages) of 10% relative to 2019 would have led
to a fall in GDP by 0.5%, while a fall by 30% would
lead to a fall in GDP by 1.5% , associated to 4,000
and 12,000 jobs at risk respectively. The sectors
such as public administration, education, health and
transport, where the Government is directly involved,
are more resilient and will likely play a critical role
in sustaining a significant proportion of domestic
consumption demand.

At the household level, Government recovery
measures were
in cushioning
instrumental
the population from the severe impacts of the
pandemic. Households are highly satisfied with the
measures introduced by the Government such as
social distancing, mask wearing, hygiene increase,
wage assistance scheme, food pack distribution,
and the debt repayment moratorium, among others.
No major disruption in food supply was observed
after the lockdown, although poor households
in accessing basic
reported some difficulties
provisions. Widespread and timely support from
the Government, civil society and communities to
vulnerable groups have contributed not only towards
building resilience but also to the maintenance of
social peace and harmony.

Nevertheless, there
is a need to monitor the
situation, particularly among the poorest and the
most disadvantaged groups. Overall, households
registered a 25% fall in income with the worst
impact felt in households that largely depended on
the tourism sector – 70% of which survived on less

than half of their usual incomes. People adjusted
to decreasing purchasing power by various means.
Households relied on
less and cheaper food,
used savings, and reduced proportion of meals.
However, the poor households responded to lower
income differently by purchasing food on credit or
seeking assistance from relatives and/or friends. An
attempt to capture the coping strategies of the poor
households, often not enrolled in the Social Register,
revealed that close to 97% of the households spent
all their income on necessities during the lockdown
while about 40% sold assets and 27% purchased
food on credit. Children in 62% of these households
were not able to access online classes in contrast to
85% attendance recorded in the National Household
Survey (NHS); thus, posing significant challenge
in closing the gap in access to education to break
the poverty cycle among the vulnerable. As part of
efforts to close this gap, free internet services and
2,570 tablets are being provided to families in the
Social Register of Mauritius (SRM) by the Government.
The period also registered an increase in incidents
of domestic violence by 33%, with 93% of the cases
perpetruated against women. Unfortunately, most
of these cases were not reported to authorities, with
37.5% of victims having kept it to themselves and
62.5% preferring to confide in other people. Among
the poorest of the poor, the incidence of domestic
violence was 9% being twice as high as among the
respondents in the NHS.

Amidst
its challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic
has created an opportunity for the population and
decision-makers to reflect on the functioning of
the Mauritian society, to identify its strengths and
weaknesses and to build back better. The complexity
of these COVID-19-induced new social dynamics
would require more attention in the coming months.
The risk of job losses and falling income streams are
essentially the main concern of the majority of the
population and precarity can adversely affect social

cohesion. To this end, sustaining domestic demand
and social support will be the key towards recovery.
Continuous efforts to dynamise the economy, in
particular the manufacturing and services sectors,
remain crucial at the moment. In this respect, the use
of innovations in ICTs and digital technologies such
as tele and online medical care, online education,
online shopping and innovative delivery systems,
among many others, could bring new competitive
edge to the industries and impove efficiency of
access
to consumers. Businesses, especially
SMEs and women owned enterprises, would also
benefit from acceleration in digital transformation.
An investment into value chain and smart and
sustainable agriculture that would eventually lead
to the transition into sustainable and green agro-
industry should also be considered.

It is essential to observe the impact on women,
vulnerable groups, and households at different
strata of the society as the economic systems
respond to the new normal, and to ensure
that no one, especially the poor, is left behind.
Protection of jobs in affected sectors, assistance
to struggling enterprises, employability, reskilling
and redeployment of retrenched workers are likely
to grow in importance. The implementation of the
National Training and Reskilling Scheme (NTRS) by
the Government targeting 9,000 unemployed citizens
is therefore in line to protecting jobs and creating new
ones. A national contingency or response plan could
be formulated, with emphasis on the poor and most
vulnerable groups, building on the experience of the
pandemic. The on-going collaboration between the
Government of Mauritius and the United Nations on
the COVID-19 Socio-Economic Recovery Plan (SERP)
provides a good starting point for conversation on
multi-sectoral response to crises.

Introduction

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
11

Following the global directive of the UN Secretary
General to support countries to effectively respond
and recover to the pandemic, this report assesses
the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 in Mauritius.
The novelty of this report pertains to 1) analysis
undertaken at two levels including the first tier that
captures the impact of the pandemic on the macro-
economic aggregates, select sectors of the economy,
and households, and the second that assesses the
resilience of households through articulation of
coping mechanisms in the face of the pandemic; 2)
the use of a household COVID-19 study collected
4 months after lock down that captured household
behavior, impact, resilience and effectiveness of
government
interventions during and after the
lockdown; and 3) an assessment of conditions of
other vulnerable individuals not enrolled in the
Social Register of Mauritius. The selection of these
groups was based on the geographic locations and
was assisted by NGOs. Given the complexity of the
issues, and the collection of survey data, the report
has exceeded the expected timeline. However, the
findings are based on data collected specifically
for this study and provide an assessment which can
inform decision makers.

The report is structured as follows. In section 2,
an assessment of the shocks (during and post-
lockdown) from the COVID-19 pandemic is conducted
on the economy, applying both a macroeconomic
and sectoral analysis. It ends with an impact on
the labour market and employment. This section
uses the IO model and secondary statistics where
applicable. Section 3 focuses on the impact at
household level using the NHS and PHS as well as
qualitative interviews. Section 4 details the responses
and coping strategies of the pandemic at household
level and provides a concise analysis of Government
measures. Section 5 elaborates on pertinent issues at
the level of the community, including an assessment
of the impact of vulnerable groups (children, elderly,
people living with HIV and migrant workers).

inevitable stringent

The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented
global health crisis that has had far reaching
implications worldwide.
economic and social
The
lockdown measures,
coupled with the dynamics at the global scale,
in many
have resulted
countries affecting sectors across the board. The
Republic of Mauritius is not spared. The impacts
of the pandemic in Mauritius are clearly visible on
individuals, communities, and the economy, most of
which are synonymous with the experiences of other
countries globally.

in several constraints

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mauritian
economy was on a steady growth trajectory,
with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate
estimated at 3% in 2019 supported by sustained
household consumption growth, a significant rise in
public investment and net external demand. Within
a well-diversified economy, the construction and
services sector were the main contributors of GDP.
The positive trajectory of structural transformation
of the economy had helped maintain the downward
trend of the unemployment rate from 6.9% in 2018
to 6.7% in 2019. The Balance of Payments recorded
a surplus of Rs 32.8billion in 2019. Higher exports of
goods and gross international reserves coupled with
a lower gross external debt contributed to the easing
of the external vulnerabilities of the economy.

Being a small island economy, whose outward
looking development trajectory has bound itself
to the global economy, Mauritius bears the brunt
of shocks whose impact can be far reaching on
society. While it is clear that the pandemic changed
the entire landscape, with: closure of international
travels and global economic activity
including
tourism on which the Mauritian economy is largely
dependent; restrictions on public, private and
household activities, there is still limited evidence
on the short-term, medium-term and
long-term
impacts
this pandemic may have posed
across sectors.

• The disruption of economic

activities due to the lockdown
had significant impact on output.

• Without the Government stimulus,
the fall in GDP the first quarter of
2020 relative to 2019 would have
been 40% lower instead of the
reported 33%, and almost 51,000
jobs would have been at risk.

• The shock had a direct effect
on accommodation and food
services, textile and other
manufacturing sectors, while
the vulnerability of agriculture,
wholesale and retail trade was
due to the indirect linkages to the
hard-hit sectors.

of the interruptions; the main
effects of pandemic are likely to
be felt in coming months as the

stimulating domestic demand
and social support is essential to
sustain the economy during the
difficult economic situation.

• New sectors such as the ocean

Box 2.1. Methodology

This section utilises the input-output (IO) model to

estimate the inter-sectoral linkages in an economy.

The model allows for analysis of the direct and indirect

effects on output, income, and employment, when final

demand for sectoral output changes. An overview of

this method is provided in Appendix 2.

Box. 2.2. Selective government support measures

Wage Assistance Scheme: Rs1821m from 16 March - 31

March; Rs3,343m in April, Rs2797m in May and Rs549m

in June. The total amount disbursed as of June 2020

was Rs8,626m.

Self-Employed Assistance Scheme: Rs 5,100 per

month paid out to self-employed people who suffered

a loss of revenue. From 16 March to 15 April amounted

to Rs1035m, Rs477m from 16to 30 April, Rs942m in May,

and Rs9m in June. The total amounted to 2.415m by

end of June.

Food distribution: Distribution of basic food

commodities to vulnerable groups: Rs38million

(averaged Rs1,001 per beneficiary). A total of 17,936

food packs were distributed to 7900 households in the

Social Register of Mauritius, while 19,779 food packs

were distributed to beneficiaries of Carer’s Allowance.

Note: With effect from January 2021, until borders are

fully opened, the government has committed to pay an

allowance under the Wage Assistance Scheme and the

Self Employment Scheme in the Tourism sector.

2.1. Macro-economic
aggregates

The immediate economic impacts are demonstrated
by indicators for the first quarter of 2020 which mainly
reflected the disruption in activities for the end of
March, for nearly 11 days. Compared to the 1st quarter
of 2019, GDP at basic prices for the 1st quarter of 2020
recorded a negative growth of 2.6%, a fall in taxes on
products net of subsidies by 6.7% and a fall in Export-
Oriented Enterprises by 6%. The impact was greater in
the second quarter that registered a 32.9% of real GDP
at basic prices compared from the same period in 2019.
This was associated with a fall in taxes on products net
of subsidies by 29.8%.

This impact could have been worse without the
austerity measures that were introduced by the
Government to cushion the economy (see box 2.2 and
appendix 5). Assuming the financial support was fully
spent by household consumption, the consumption
patterns from the Household Budget Survey (HBS)
conducted in 2017 by the Statistics Mauritius can be
used to infer how the injecting of Rs11.4 billion into the
economy from end of March to June 2020 may have
directly or indirectly helped to sustain economic activities
following the immediate economic shock (see figure 2.1)1.

This support helped drive demand of goods and services
to the tune of Rs16 billion, corresponding to a multiplier
effect of 1.4, creating a value-added of Rs7.8 billion
during this period. It also cushioned the economy from a
further 7.2 percentage point decline in real GDP at
basic prices.

1 — The Household Budget Survey (2017) shows that food and beverages,

housing, water, electricity, gas and fuels, and health-related expenditure

amounts to 52% of household consumption expenditure on a monthly

basis. Using this allocation, the assessment assumes that the Wage

Assistance Scheme and the Self-Employed Assistance Scheme are

mainly spent on these items with the following percentages: 71.1% on food

and beverages, 21.5% on housing, electricity, water, gas and fuels and

7.4% on health-related items. Food and beverages are further allocated to

farming, processed foods, and wholesale and retail trade.

While the lockdown has wide ranging economic effects
which extend beyond the devastating health effects,
the economic impacts in the post-lockdown period
reflects multiple shocks to the economy from both the
supply and demand side. The impact depends on the
degree of integration with the world markets and the
inter-industry linkages of the Mauritian economy. This
report identified three main external shocks, including:
1) the immediate impact on the tourism sector is very
visible with a fall in tourist arrivals and earnings; 2)
Mauritius, having strong trade and investment linkages,
is likely to be affected significantly through a reduction
in the production of export-oriented enterprises; and 3) a
decline in FDI is an inevitable shock from pandemic.

Figure 2.3 compares the quarter-to-quarter percentage
change in value-added from 2019 to 2020. The
lockdown led to a fall of 2.9% in agricultural value-added
in the 1st quarter, followed by a further fall of 11% in the
2nd quarter. This was driven by a decline in sugarcane
and food crops production that recorded a reduction of
8.5 and 11.4% in the 2nd quarter, respectively. The food
crops sector is of high interest given its contribution to
food security especially at a time of crisis. Some sectors
such as manufacturing, accommodation and food,
construction, entertainment, and recreation, showed high
vulnerability. These sectors recorded respectively a fall
of 43.6, 98.1, 89.4 and 85% in the second quarter 2020
relative to 2019. Others, including real estate activities
(-1.2%), financial and insurance activities (0.2%), and
public administration (-6.7%), were less impacted.

2.2.1. Industrial sector

The industrial sector is made of the manufacturing,
electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply, and
water supply and waste management, with a value-
added of Rs 64.4 billion in 2019, accounted for 15.7%
of GDP. The manufacturing sector accounts for 12.5%
of GDP and employed 20.4% of labour force. Export-
oriented enterprises, mainly textile products, account for
34.3% of the value-added of manufacturing sector and
29% of the industrial sector. Industrial activity mainly
focused on food processing (36%) and textiles and
apparel (29%), while sectors such as pharmaceuticals
and high-end jewellery and precision engineering were
expected to grow in the future with a push towards smart
manufacturing. In 2019, 52.7% of exports were destined to
Europe; UK, France and Italy represented, respectively,
13.9, 10 and 6.9%. Exports to US and South Africa stood
at 11.8% and 11.5% respectively. Key import sources on
the other hand were India (18%) and China (17%).

The pandemic resulted in overall decline in industrial
output in the 1st and 2nd quarter of 2020 (figure 2.3),
mostly by 65% in textiles, 27.6% in food processing,
and 46.4% in manufacturing. The impact was greater
for export-oriented output that declined by 54.2%
compared to 39.1% for non-export-oriented output2. It is
noted that export-oriented enterprises employed 42,651
in June 2020 and 47.8% were women. The shock on
manufacturing originated from outside the domestic
economy and would depend on the economic situation
of the major trading partners of Mauritius. The World
Bank and IMF project that countries like France, UK, Italy
and Spain would record a negative growth in 2020 which
could result in the significant decline in exports in 2021.
Similarly, the tourism sector will be impacted as France
and Reunion Islands, UK and Germany constituted more
than 50% of the arrivals in 20193.

An attempt is made to estimate the total economic
impact of the fall in merchandise exports (excluding food
and beverages)4, which stood at 52.3% of total exports
in 2019 on the economy. This reduction in exports will

impact not only on the gross output and value-added
of the manufacturing sector, but also on other economic
sectors. As the percentage reduction over the period
is still uncertain, the IO model is used to simulate the
impact ranging from -10 to -80%. Figure 2.5. shows the
outcome. For instance, in case there is a fall of 30% in
manufacturing exports, GDP will reduce by 1.5% relative
to 2019 and taxes of products (net of subsidies) will
decrease by 0.8%.

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius

2.2.2. Tourism

21

The tourism sector contributed 8.2% of GDP in 2019
directly and 23.8% indirectly5. It accounted for 22 %
of employment, 60.3% of services exports and 35% of
total exports. Mauritius is extremely vulnerable given its
high dependency on tourism and the sector is the most
affected one. The total tourist arrivals for the year 2019
stood at 1383,488 with earnings of Rs63,107 million.
The Bank of Mauritius had forecasted Rs65 billion for
the year 2020 without the pandemic. The fall in foreign
earnings from the loss of tourism arrivals remains a major
concern for the economy. Travel bans meant no tourist
earnings from April to October 2020 until the air travel
was eased, yet easing of travel will still not guarantee
recovery in the short to medium term (figure 2.7) given the
second wave of infections in major markets or Mauritius
as well as the mandatory quarantine requirements for
inbound travellers.

In 2019, 34.5% of tourist arrivals originated from Europe,
34.4% from Africa and 28.7% from Asia. The main
countries of origin are United Arab Emirates (19%),
Reunion Island (17.7%), France (15.3%), South Africa
(12.3%), United Kingdom (6.1%), India (4.7%) and Germany
(4.6%)7.

With the fall in tourism from April 2020, the total
arrivals for the year would stand at 310,000 and
tourism earnings would fall to around Rs18 billion in
2019. The direct impact would be felt in sectors where
tourist expenditure was normally distributed. These
were accommodation services (55.1%), followed by air
and sea passenger transport services (12.5%), food
and beverages (8%), land transport services (5.6%),
recreational-based activities (4.4%) and other tourism-
related consumption goods and services8, where indirect
impacts will be felt in these sectors as well.

The fall in tourism expenditure would impact
indirectly on other economic sectors as their demand
would also decrease, thereby creating multiple
round of decreasing output. The value-added of the
accommodation services sector would fall by 77%, air
and water services sector by 30%, food and beverages
by 27%, entertainment and recreational sector by 9% and
land transport services by 9%. The main indirect impacts
were felt in the agricultural sector (-16%), food processing
(-14%), water (-12%), electricity (-11%), business activities
(-8%). The total economic impact of the pandemic from
the tourism sector for 2020 is estimated at 9% of GDP.

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
2.2.3. Labour market

23

The employment situation has been stable during the
past years although marked by some persistent gender
and age disparities in employment and earnings. The
unemployment rate averaged around 7.1% over the
last 5 years, with a modest improved rate to 6.9% in
2019. However, disruptions in the labour market have
expanded due to the impact that the pandemic has
imposed on productive sectors of the economy.

Figure 2.9 depicts the number of men vs. women
employed in each economic sector in 2019. It provides
the basis for estimating the impact on women and the
vulnerability vis a vis COVID-19.

By May, employment fell by 129,400 i.e. by slightly
above 24% compared to the situation in the first
quarter of 2020. In parallel, the unemployment rate
shot up by 3% points from 7.2% to 10.2% by May 2020.
Likewise, activity rates declined sharply by 16.4 % over

the same period. In fact, according to Statistics Mauritius
and World Bank’s first round of the RCMPHS in May
2020, the inactive population increased substantially by
64% from 205,100 to 336,900 of which 1 in 5 reported to
have worked before the lockdown and to have stopped
working because of the lockdown. This work consists
mainly of non-continuous or temporary employment
generally in the informal economy. The main sectors
in which they were employed include manufacturing
(19.2%), wholesale and retail trade (14.6%); construction
(13.6%) and private households (10.4%), which generally
constitute informal occupations. As the following chart
indicates, during the lockdown period, the fall in informal
sector employment was more pronounced as compared
to formal employment. While formal employment fell by
40,200, informal sector employment declined by 89,200
(above 59%).

After the lockdown was lifted, the employment
situation has evolved rather rapidly. By June
employment rose to 366,600 in the formal and 106,500
in the informal sector. Some further improvement was
noted by July (figure 2.10) with formal employment falling
short of Q1-20 by 12,200. Despite a recovery in informal
sector employment there was still a noticeable shortfall
of 31,600 compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. By
July, the unemployment rate was estimated at 10.3%.
In spite of the rise in numbers of employment-related
grievances as a result of the pandemic (table 2.2), the
government should be acclaimed for designing effective
recovery schemes mentioned in chapter 1, that ensured
the living standards were maintained and employment
safeguarded. Overall, the Mauritian economy has been
resilient enough to avert an unemployment crisis thus far.

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
25

According to Trade Union officials interviewed in the
context of this study, there have been many abusive
dismissals and/or non-payment of wages than what
have been registered at the Ministry of Labour, as
some employers found it hard to manage their overhead
costs with their labour costs. The first to have lost their
jobs accordingly were those whose employment was
already precarious and with no formal contracts. Tourism-
related occupations which have disproportionately been
affected by travel restrictions and absence of tourists,
wholesale and retail, construction and, cleaning and
security services are some of the main sectors where
representations had been made with trade unions.
Employees on short-term contracts, mainly women and
youth, had been particularly vulnerable to these
abusive practices.

In the public discourse on the New Normal brought
about by the pandemic, there were many predictions
amongst decision makers and observers that the
country could potentially hit the 100,000 mark in
terms of unemployment (See e.g. Le Mauricien 01 May
2020; L’express Jul 6 2020) which was estimated as
an unemployment rate of above 19%. The fact that the
unemployment rate has thus far been contained to 10.3%
is an illustration that the impacts have at least thus far
been contained. However, the sustainability of business
and the preservation of employment in some of the
occupational sectors which have been the hardest hit
in the medium term are open to question. Supporting
enterprises, jobs and income are particularly necessary
in order to avert a downward spiral which can affect the
economy and society alike.

The impact of a decline in
manufacturing exports

The impact of a decline in tourism

In the worst-case scenario (without the wage assistance
scheme), 30% decline in manufacturing exports could
have led to about 12,000 jobs at risk while a decline of
60% could have resulted in an additional 11,000 jobs at
risk (Figure 2.11).

The employment impact on the tourism sector (without
the wage assistance scheme) is likely to be felt mostly
in the accommodation services (22,000), air and water
transport services (9,700) and food and beverages
(4,300) sector. The total employment (direct and indirect)
at risk without the Government measures is likely to be
51,000 in 2020 (using 2019 as baseline).

Gender dimensions of Covid-19
in the labour market

In Mauritius, an overview of the trends across the
lockdown and in its aftermath reveals a nuanced
picture. At first sight, during the lockdown period, female
employment, did reveal an even more important decline
than male employment as of May 2020. From 215,100
women employed in the first quarter of 2020, this
figure fell sharply to 157,000 by May 2020 as a direct
consequence of the lockdown. However, subsequently,
female employment level increased considerably by 27%
between May and June and modestly between June and
July. The number of women employed as of July was
about 6.5% lower (-13,900) compared with
pre-crisis levels.

In comparison with men, where the unemployment
rate has risen from 5.6% (Q1 20) to 8.8% by July 2020,
female unemployment rate has increased but less
significantly. In this unprecedented crisis, perhaps in
contrast to other economic downturns where women
tend to be over-representative of the first casualties to
make way for men, it can be argued that women have
(at least at this stage – short to medium term) not been
disproportionately affected. While unemployment has
affected both women and men, the change in male
unemployment rate over first quarter 2020 to July

2020 is nearly fourfold that of the change in female
unemployment rate for the same period. With the
exception of the teaching profession where women have
traditionally been predominant and which has not been
affected in terms of job losses, thus far, the main activity
sectors where the employment of both women and
men have been particularly affected are in the service
activities, accommodation and food service activities,
wholesale and retail trade. These services deemed non-
essential and where working from home is not possible
have been particularly vulnerable to the economic
downturn.

Although Mauritius has, since the mid-1980s espoused
a dual-breadwinner model and the aspiration and
access to a job contributed significantly to women’s
financial and social empowerment within the
household as in the wider economy, it remains a fact
that when jobs are lost, the burden of getting back
into employment generally weighs more on male
retrenched workers. Although, at this stage of unveiling
the impacts, it might be premature to come to any
conclusions, there are some emerging evidence that
more women than men have slipped out of the labour
force. Between Q1-20 and July 20, there was a net

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
26

change of (-12,500) in the labour force in contrast to men
(-8,300) over the same period. The number of inactive
employees has also increased by 9,400 for women
in contrast to 1,300 for men. One interpretation of this
trend – which remains to be confirmed with more up to
date data – based on interviews with key informants
who work with women casual workers in informal
subcontracting networks is that, unless women are the
main breadwinners or have dire financial commitments
and limited resources to draw from, they have the
options to delay their search for employment and to take
up informal and non-continuous jobs as and
when required.

whose households experienced more than 50% fall in
income were tourism (-60%), construction (-44.3%), food
processing (-38.3%), manufacturing (-33.9%) and textile
related products (-32.7%), while household in sectors
such as financial and insurance, administrative and
support service, public administration, and education
have been significantly affected. This corresponds with
the previous observation that the significant falls were
registered in sectors like manufacturing, accommodation
and food, construction, entertainment and recreation.
The vulnerable sectors from the NHS are consistent with
the data from Statistics Mauritius on quarter-to-quarter
change in value added by economic sectors (figure 2.3).
While sectors have been hit because of the interruption
of activities during the lockdown, some sectors such as
accommodation and food services, and manufacturing
exports were impacted because of external shocks, while
other sectors were affected because of their indirect
linkages to those hard-hit sectors. For instance, the fall
in income in the construction sector was mainly due to
the interruption of activities during the lockdown and to
a lesser extent by external shocks. Qualitative interviews
with key informants revealed that the sector continued
after the lockdown following projects in the pipelines.
Accordingly, the effect on the construction sector, most
likely, are to be severely felt by June 2021 as FDI will
be impacted.

Women witnessed relatively higher negative change
in income than men in the wholesale and retail trade,
food service, and accommodation and hotel sector
(Figure 3.1). Further analysis on vulnerable sectors,
including women, are provided in section 6.

The impact on purchasing power will be mostly felt
by households whose members have lost their jobs
because of the COVID-19. As such, the NHS has a
specific question on the number of households who
have lost their jobs because of the COVID-19. The survey
reveals that 6% of the households have at least a male
member who has lost a job and is still unemployed while
5% has one female member in this category. The NHS is
not within the scope to estimate the unemployment rate
in neither of its objectives nor in its sample design. The
figures are an indication of the employment impacts at
the household level. Nevertheless, a rough comparison
can be made; from total number of household members
between 16 and 64 (excluding full time students) from the
survey9 and total number of members who have lost their
jobs and are still unemployed10, the NHS shows that 5.2%

Box. 3.1. Approach

This section was informed by a comprehensive

National Household Survey (NHS) conducted

purposely for this study. The survey was conducted

approximately four months (23 September to 28

September 2020) after the lockdown was lifted.

The Survey had a sample frame of 400 households

proportionally distributed to the number of

households per district from Census. In order to

cater for the gender dimension, the sample was

divided into 200 women and 200 men, by household

headship. The survey was supplemented by an

additional survey- the Poorest of the Poor Survey of

70 respondents, following the same sampling process

as the NHS. However, the specific geographical

areas (also well-known over the island as the poverty

pockets) were indicated by NGOs and the National

Empowerment Foundation. See Appendix 3 for

additional information.

of those in employment have lost their jobs because
of the pandemic at the time of survey (September).
According to the WBSM survey (phase 3)11, the
unemployment rate was 10.2% in May, 12.2% in July and
10.3 in July and when compared to the unemployment
rate in the 4th quarter of 2019 at 6.4% , the figure is
statistically consistent within some margin of confidence
with the WBSM.

Households have tried to find other sources of income.
In December 2019, 61% of households had their income
from a paid job; the percentage decreased to 55.5% in
August 2020. In turn, 3.1% of households received their
main income from farming and fishing and this figure
increased to 4.1% in August 2020. Similarly, it appears
that more households had their income in August from a
household business activities (basically informal), selling
of foodstuff produced by the households or support from
other households.

Close to 39% of households had debt, 20.4% of which
were unable to finance them in the coming months due
to COVID-19, while only 40% could only sustain debt
servicing for the next 1 to 2 months. A larger proportion
of female heads of households reported significant
challenges in servicing debt compared to their male
counterparts. It is expected that this effect combined
with other structural and systemic barriers to women’s
participation in paid labour markets may result in an
increased feminisation of poverty in the country.

3.2. Food security and
basic provisions

Mauritius produces a wide range of crops and livestock
but most of its staples such as rice, wheat, edible oils,
meats and dairy products are imported. Only 23% of
local food consumption requirements are met by the
agricultural and food sector. However, the island is
self-sufficient in fresh vegetables, local fruits, chicken
and eggs. The lockdown affected food production. A
comparison between production in January-June 2019
and January-June 2020 shows a drop of 17.8%. Almost all
major foodcrops have experienced a decline. Similarly,
the lockdown has caused a decline in the production of
livestock for the period of January-June 2019 to January-
June 2020.

The above situation may have impacted on access to
food by households during and after the lockdown.
From the NHS, it is observed that the percentage of
households who purchased food from local stores and
markets has declined from 81.6% before the lockdown to
48.8% during the lockdown (figure 3.4). The figure rose to
83.5% after the lockdown (i.e. survey time in September),
showing a positive sign of no major issue as far as food
access is concerned.

34

COVID-19 has severely disrupted the education sector
from pre-primary, secondary to tertiary education.
For the majority of Mauritian students, school, college
and university closures during the lockdown signified
a move of about 94% of households with at least one
student, to remote learning through computers, laptops,
tablets and smartphones, which is consistent with 85%
revealed in the October 2020 SM/WB RCMPHS (Oct

2020) result. Overall, close to 90% of the households
were satisfied with the new mode of delivery. However
only 38% among the poorest of the poor households
accessed these services. Although these results must be
interpreted with caution given the small sample involved,
this result mirrors a critical gap in the design and delivery
of educational programmes that reached poor children.

About 9% of households experienced a deterioration
in their health conditions during the lockdown. The
figure is significantly higher for the PHS at 17%. The NHS
reports that the main health problems relate to anxiety
(61%), sleeping (37%), depression (32%), headache
(32%), emotion (24%) and stomach (11%). The figures are
significantly higher for the poor households, especially
for anxiety and depression.

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
The pandemic has highlighted inequalities in health
care, especially in the lockdown. About 77% of the
households required the services of pharmacies during
the lockdown, 16% of whom could not get access to
pharmacies. The support of relatives and friends were
sought for the necessary medication. Furthermore, 27%
sought services from the health system: 18.5% visited
the public health service, 7% had recourse to the private
health system and 1.2% had online doctor consultation
service.

There is a worldwide concern that resources may be
allocated to fight the COVID-19 to the detriment of
other treatment services. A recent survey of the WHO
in 155 countries during a 3-week period in May, finds
that the COVID-19 pandemic could seriously disrupt the
prevention and treatment services for non-communicable
diseases (NCDs)12. The WHO warns that this situation
is of significant concern because people living with
NCDs are at higher risk of severe COVID-19-related
illness and death. The NHS reveals that households had
difficulties in accessing services related to mental health,
immunization, NCDs, and to a lower extent, infectious
diseases and child health treatments.

It is vital to find innovative ways to ensure that essential
services continue, even as resources are committed to
fight COVID-19.

Domestic violence

Confinement has significantly impacted on domestic
violence as noted from the significant increase in
the number of cases reported at the Family Support
Bureau of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family
Welfare. During the lockdown period 20 March to 30
May 2020, 520 cases were officially reported of which
some 93% were female victims, of which 111 female
survivors left the conjugal roof during the lockdown.

On average, out of the daily number of cases brought
to the attention of the authorities over period January
2018 to May 2020 and contrasted with the daily average
number of cases recorded for the 2 months of April and
May 2020 when confinement was stretching emotional,
economic and social coping abilities, there was an
increase of 33% in the cases recorded daily – that is from
an estimated average of 6 cases recorded daily under
normal times to an average of 8 cases recorded daily
during last two months of confinement. These have only
been reported cases, while the international literature
suggests that reported cases are only the tip of
the iceberg.

have spent more time (37%) or significantly more time
(21%) on household chores as compared to 40% for their
husbands. Only 8% of husbands spent ‘significantly
more’ time preparing meals. The same trend was
observable for childcare and education.

Data from the NHS reveal that some 4.5% of the
sample have experienced some sort of violence
during the lockdown, women being disproportionately
represented. 7.4% respondents experienced violence at
home during the lockdown. Among the poorest of the
poor, evidence from the survey data indicates that nearly
9% of respondents experienced some sort of violence at
home during the lockdown. The incidence of domestic
violence in this socio-economic category appears to
be two-fold that of the mainstream population. The
Chart below shows a breakdown of the perpetrators
of violence against the female respondents from the
NHS, highlighting that while Intimate Partner Violence
accounted for 73% of domestic violence as a classic
gender-based phenomenon, in no less than 27% of
cases, violence has been perpetrated by grand-children
(13%); children (7%); mother-in-law (7%).

In contrast, 1.5% of male respondents have been
victims of violence at home during the lockdown. Given
the small size of this group, further disaggregation is not
suggested. However, for the few records, the perpetrators
were their children and spouse. Verbal assault was the
most common form of violence recorded (6.1%), followed
by economic forms of violence including denial of
money and resources. Physical and sexual assault were
slightly less in the sample but as the adage goes, each
case is one too many. Victims, particularly most female
victims, did not report to the authorities, in part due to the
feeling of shame and fear of reprisals from the abuser.
The majority (62.5%) informed other people within the
community, and 37.5% did not inform anyone.

Distribution of
household activities

The lockdown set in motion several transitional
behaviours and practices to adjust to confinement.
Generally, both women and men spent more time than
usual on domestic and care responsibilities, leisure
and personal and/or household activities. Majority of
respondents (an average of some 72% for both males
and females) spent more household quality time. There
was also was increased use of social media, talking
online/phone, watching TV, indulging in hobby shows
across gender. Overall, women (43%) engaged more in
exercises compared to men, while unhealthy practices
such as drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes were
pronounced among men.

However, several traditional gendered roles, mainly
domestic chores, remained skewed towards women.
58% of married female respondents state that they

• Households rely on less and
cheaper food, using savings,
reduced proportion of means, to
adjust to decreasing purchasing
power, but poor households
have adjusted differently by
purchasing food on credit,
seeking assistance from relatives,
friends, etc.

• Households are highly satisfied
with the measures introduced by
the Government such as social
distancing, wearing of mask and
increasing hygiene.

• Government recovery measures

such as wage assistance
schemes and food packs have
also been highly effective and
efficient. Almost all respondents
in the random survey of the poor
households have received food
packs and they were highly
satisfied with both the quantity
and variety.

Responding to the fall in income

Households compensated for income losses in several
ways including drawing down on savings among
50% of households in the NHS, compared to 34%
of households in the PHS. The low share in the PHS
reflects the lack of savings among the poor. Around 10%
from the NHS reported to rely on less preferred and
cheaper food while 9% reduced expenditure on health
and education, and 8% to purchase on credit and selling
vegetables. Among the poor households, the strategy
involved sale of assets (40%), purchase food on credit
(27%), reduction in the number of meals per day (20%)
and or the amount consumed (14%).

4.2. Risk communication
and sources of information

The nature of a pandemic such as the COVID-19 can
trigger fear or put the population at risk if they are
not aware of the situation. Misinformation and rumours
regarding COVID-19 can mask healthy behaviours (such
as hand washing, social distancing etc.) and promoting

erroneous practices that increase the spread of the virus
and ultimately result in poor physical and mental health
outcomes among individuals13. In Mauritius, rumours have
led to panic buying of groceries and stationeries, which
disrupted the supply chain. Such a situation exacerbated
demand-supply gaps and food insecurities among
individuals with low socioeconomic status and other
vulnerable populations. Risk communication is therefore
critical for developing effective health preparedness
strategies and eradicating unhealthy social perceptions,
in the event of an outbreak. An effective risk
communication, in general, means that all related risk

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
43

messages can be presented and shared to participants in
a risk communication process openly and timely, aiming
to rectify the knowledge gap between the originators
of information and those receiving the information,
and adjust the public’s behaviour to cope with the risk
proactively14. In Mauritius, a Committee was set by the
PMO to inform the population on a timely basis, while the
Ministry of Health had a website and a dedicated line to
respond to queries.

The NHS and the PHS reveals that the main source of
information during the lockdown was television (88%
of NHS and 79% for PHS) and radio (64% for NHS and
54% for PHS). A high percentage of the respondents
from NHS (43%) also reported social media (43%) and
internet sites (21%) as main source of information. A

concern is related to the high percentage of the PHS who
rely on ‘word of mouth’ for information (70%). Still, 23%
of households from NHS also relies on word of mouth.
Word of mouth was defined in the questionnaire to
respondents as information, which being communicated
through relatives, friends, neighbours and colleagues.
While the use of social media and internet sites have
proven effective during the lockdown15, word of mouth,
especially for the poor households increases the risk
of misinformation. A need is felt to develop an effective
risk communication strategy for Mauritius on COVID-19
measures, especially during a lockdown, which could
reach all areas and segments of the population.
Dedicating outreach to women and more specifically to
female headed households is deemed useful.

Almost 10% of households have members moving
around during the lockdown most of the time, and
around 56% reported going out a few times. The high
percentage still prevails for the poor households (44%).

The main reasons advanced by respondents were the
need for supplies, seeking medical assistance and
assistance to others. However, the survey reveals that
almost 17% from the NHS reported that they did not have
sufficient information while 15% believe it was not the
right measure. Almost 31% revealed that they found it too
difficult to be confined.

graphs show the association between the ‘likelihood’ that
a household member would receive assistance and the
characteristics of his/her household. The finding shows
that the wage assistance was particularly provided to the
applicant who was privately or self-employed (for e.g.
domestic workers), whose households’ members were
relatively larger, and his/her total household monthly
income was lower. This means that those in need were
more entitled for the wage assistance scheme16.

4.4. Efficacy of
institutional arrangements

An assessment of the distribution
of food packs during the lockdown

About 86% of respondents in the NHS were satisfied
with the measures instituted by government to combat
the pandemic, namely: total lockdown, social distancing,
disinfecting, and planned scheduled shopping time.
Only 10% remained neutral. The Wage assistance
scheme was highly acclaimed by households given its
comprehensive coverage. 29% of households from the
NHS, and 84% in the PHS applied the self-employed
wage assistance scheme and over 90% were successful.
In order to conduct a crude analysis on the effectiveness
of the self-employed assistance scheme, the following

The remaining either did not ask for it (63%) or were not
aware of the possibility (28%). Around 2.5% of this group

the NHS and PHS, it is observed that a bigger percentage
of poor households have received support (cash, food
and other kinds) from friends, relatives, NGOs, religious
groups, members of political parties, among others.

Priorities and assistance
to households

Restoring key sectors of the economy is a priority for
the households in general. Safety and dignity is a
second priority from respondents in the NHS but is the
priority for the PHS. Maternal and child nutrition is one
area which requires support for the poor segment of the
population. Health is also a priority according
to responses.

There is a general tendency among poor households to
seek assistance on housing rent, workfare programme
and training for new skills. The initiative by the
Government to accelerate housing programmes for both
low- and middle-income families, with special focus on
the needy and vulnerable is therefore commendable.
The NHS, in turn, reveals that households would be
better off if tax payments and loan repayments were
deferred, together with workfare programme and training
for new skills.

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
5.1. A collective account of
common lived experiences
of the pandemic in Mauritius

The build-up to the sanitary curfew: Fear of the
unknown bordering on psychosis and panic-buying.

The early stages, since the official detection of the
first cases on 18 March followed by the closure of
the borders on 19 March were generally marked by a
growing acknowledgement that something serious and
sinister was happening. Popular perceptions prevailing
beforehand that this ‘pandemic lies elsewhere but not
in Mauritius’ and the limited awareness - at the time - of
the pace and dramatic impacts it would subsequently
have globally, started changing fast. Panic-buying not
only in hypermarkets but also in small corner shops
accelerated while pharmacies and filling stations
were also charged upon for not only fuel but also gas
cylinders. The long queues and fast disappearance
of essential commodities on the stalls fed even more
panic. The occurrence of 3 deaths within this same stride
further accentuated the growing panic. With the sanitary
curfew eventually imposed on 24 March, some of the
older participants interviewed even evoked a psychosis,
never experienced in the Mauritian collective memory.
In fact, as one participant argues, Mauritius has been
largely spared of natural or man-made catastrophes
in general and even the worst cyclones in history had
some element of predictability – that they would go
away in a matter of days and even their damages would
eventually be repaired. The fear and anxiety caused by
the curfew imposed during the ethnic strife of February
1999 following the death of popular singer Kaya, in spite
of its fundamentally different reasons and short duration,
were the closest comparable feelings of disarray and
incomprehension evoked, although here the danger did
not have a human face but was a minute and invisible
virus which was increasingly being felt to wreak havoc.

With the explosion of attention of the coronavirus in
the mass media and on social networking sites, there
was a further amplification of the fear of this unknown.
The viral circulation of videos and messages on social
media often fed by unfounded rumours have brought
about several confusions in the minds of people although
Government regularly and systematically gave clear
updates on latest developments. Among some of the
most spread rumours which disinformed and fuelled
further angst and fear were for instance that discovered
cases of Dengue were outbreaks of Coronavirus or that
cases discovered in the community through contact
tracing had contaminated multiple others by having done
shopping in such and such hypermarket or partaken in
religious ceremonies; or that there would be an outright
food crisis.

50

The complete lockdown – Forced
adjustments to the new
Mauritian normal

The complete lockdown at first further fed the growing
fear of a situation getting out of control. The fear of self
or relatives being infected, in a context where society
was bombarded with images of the toll it has on people’s
health across the mass media was rife. The number
of deaths in Italy which were skyrocketing during this
period, the vivid and often crude display of patients
under reanimation and the intervention of the military
were powerful images affecting the social psyche. As
emerged in a Focus Group Discussion in the region of
Camp Pave in Vacoas, neighbours overnight wanted to
stay away from each other although no less than a week
before they were all on the streets in their usual pre-
occupations. Families who had frontline professionals
called to duty were particularly fearful both for the latter
and for themselves. The anxiety and concerns were
far worse for those whose families had members that
were stranded overseas or those chronically sick and
undergoing regular treatment.

With the need to adjust to the lockdown, this fear of
the disease was soon turning to practical concerns
of survival. Concerns over food and essentials, prior
financial commitments and debts, running of the
household, especially for those with limited savings and
resources were becoming at this stage equally high. The
realization that people who passed away (not only those
who contracted the disease) during this period would
not have the customary funeral rites and the absence of
close relatives to provide psychological support further
added to the gloomy nature of this period. Apart from
the continuation of rumours on the spread of the disease
on social networks, there were also the emergence of
messages of disapprobation towards the lockdown, in
certain quarters often with an ethnic undertone. There
were even claims of brewing unrest and organized
attempts to raid a hypermarket. The intervention of
police deterred this from happening.

Marginalized groups who were cash strapped and
whose livelihoods involved day to day jobs including
fishing and construction work, were concerned about

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius

In the agricultural sector, many farmers also
experienced important setbacks. For example, one
interviewee who runs a hydroponic farm explains
that she experienced important losses as her whole
production was coinciding with the lockdown and
the Work-Access Permit which subsequently allowed
circulation was not yet available. She could not rely on
her employees and had to do the harvesting herself
and marketed it over the phone with people in the area.
While normally she has niche markets in terms of local
restaurants and one hotel group, she could no longer tap
into these markets and had to compromise with the price
that customers in the neighbourhood proposed. She
had to deliver on the doorsteps of her customers and
come back later to pick up money wrapped in plastic to
minimize the risks of contamination.

Interviewees employed by the Government, generally,
felt more secure in terms of their jobs and income than
employees from the private sector or the self-employed.
For private sector workers, the Wage Assistance Scheme
and Self-employed Scheme contributed to the protection
of jobs and enabled employees to keep earning an
income. However, by this stage, many employers
in some of the non-essential sectors which were
particularly exposed to the effects of the lockdown were
starting to lay off employees.

Online platforms for the sale and distribution of food
and essential commodities were also a novelty although
there were soon criticisms that there were severe stock
ruptures that orders were not being met in a timely
manner or still that the prices were over-inflated.
Also, pre-packed items despite being rather costly as
compared to pre-covid prices, did not always meet the
requirements of people, for instance not all households
needed nappies.

The opening of shops and pharmacies for people to
buy essentials is an important milestone which many
participants highlighted compounded the spread of the
disease. Initially planned to be organised with strict social
distancing measures, wearing of masks, temperature
checks and hand decontamination, the first day of
shop's opening uncovered a lack of discipline. In spite of
the Government's assurance that provisions and stock
were available, the fear that commodities would run
out lead to panic buying and forms of indiscipline that
had to be addressed. Subsequently, access to shops by
alphabetical order with more rigid disciplinary measures
contributed to salvage the situation – the ability to meet
the basic needs of the population while rigidly containing
the spread of the disease was beginning to work.
An important point which has surfaced has been the
resurgence of the popularity of small corner-shops
which had been largely downplayed in recent times
with the advent of hypermarkets and shopping malls.
Often allowing credit-purchases, these corner shops
have played an important role in facilitating access to
commodities within the local community.

their difficulties to meet their basic needs in the
absence of opportunities to go to work. Having not
been able to shop and stock, the situation was dire. In
parallel, people who were seen outside their homes
were severely reprimanded by police. However, with odd
exceptions particularly in the early days of the complete
lockdown, the population was generally very responsive
to the instructions established.

The organization and distribution of food-packs in the
community to people at the lowest rungs of society
as well as the design and implementation of the
Wage Assistance and Self-employed schemes with
the assistance of the Mauritius Revenue Authority are
widely seen as crucial measures which have cushioned
in many ways the disruptions brought about by the
economic standstill. Many employers and particularly
the self-employed were unprepared for this cease of
business activities. Some interviews with self-employed
people evoke a drastic reduction in their salary often
down to merely 10% of their regular earnings through
the Self-employed assistance scheme. With the need to
service overhead fees without generating revenue, many
employers have found it extremely hard to cope and
were forced to cease their activities. A building contractor
who employs masons and pays them wages on a
fortnightly basis reports that he had to dig into his own
savings to pay his workers as they were totally reliant on
this income for them and their families to survive. He had
to wait for over 6 weeks to recover his money from
his employer.

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
Salient elements of a new lifestyle

52

Confinement brought about a range of disruptions
in social life some more radical than others and
which people had to learn to contend with. The
qualitative data obtained indicates that far from being
a homogeneous experience, there are important
variations in terms of how people according to social
class, occupational group, gender, age, region have
experienced it. An important segment of the population
had to juggle with reductions in income and adopt strict
austerity measures in order to make both ends meet.
Some participants from lower income backgrounds
for instance mentioned that rationing, contenting
with minimum and ensuring that food is not wasted
were common during the time. In the same vein, one
participant explained that in her household, during the
lockdown “it was only on Sunday that they would make
a special meal with chicken or meat as they could not
afford it.” Not many low-income households could save
up based on their earnings as these barely matched the
household living expenses. However, those who lived in
the rural regions could more easily draw from backyard
gardens, and poultry rearing than those from the urban
regions – due to limitations of space.

Employees in some of the worst-hit sectors as well
as workers operating in the informal sector who used
to work as masons, domestic workers, etc. found it
particularly hard to cope and were among those who
were eagerly awaiting a denouement in order to restart
their activities. Coping strategies such as gardening
and mutual assistance with close kins and neighbours
became common.

In fact, in relation to the evolution of the number of
cases in the community and the gradual stability which
Government measures and public cooperation were
bringing, an important coping strategy which began to
emerge particularly in the rural regions, was a renewal
of the spirit of solidarity. In fact, even within the stages of
the lockdown where the spread was under control, there
were in many places concerns that people had started
engaging back in small business activities such as
vegetable, eggs and fruit selling. Farmers were back in
the fields. Some participants even argued that the quality
and variety of the vegetables and even local fruits like
pineapples that they were getting were of much better
quality and taste than under normal times. In fact, one
explanation for this is that under normal times, these
are meant for export or for hotels and restaurants. Some

participants were also critical of the exploitive prices
which farmers were putting on their vegetables in
some regions.

Food vendors of local comfort fast-foods (rotis and
dhollpuris; Chinese noodles and dumplings) which had, in
the words of one participant “almost become delicacies
since confinement” were also gradually getting back in
business albeit in clandestine manners.

In one Focus Group Discussion, one participant
highlighted that in his neighbourhood, a hairdresser living
close by would take appointments on Whatsapp and
go to people’s places for his services. Likewise, another
informant highlights other covert micro-entrepreneurial
activities around food-making and vending through
informal support networks.

These coping strategies were in some ways supporting a
timid but gradual recovery of sustaining livelihoods.

Those on the social register of Mauritius who live in
extreme poverty were provided with food-packs and the
role of NGOs, faith-based organisations and benefactors
in providing further assistance has helped to mitigate
the impacts.

These perspectives contrast sharply with those from a
more comfortable socio-economic background who had
been able to store provisions, and who did not have
immediate financial concerns due to professional and
financial stability. In fact, some interviewees from this
background would allude to life in confinement ‘as the
best days of their lives’ being similar to be on leave from
work. For this social group, the end of the lockdown was
not particularly welcomed. The extensive social networks
of this social group enabled the mutual sourcing and
assistance of fresh vegetables and diary from farmers
who could no longer supply to closed hotels and
restaurants at a rebated price. The experience of going
shopping was not one of taking strict necessities or of
counting their money at the counter to ensure they have
enough to pay – but rather one of abundance and which
as one participant states – “the highlight of the day was
to showcase on Facebook and boast about the meal we
learnt to make following recipes on the internet.”
However, it is also worthwhile to note that many
entrepreneurs and family businesses who were doing
well for themselves had due to lack of orders found

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
53

themselves in serious financial difficulty. One director of
a catering enterprise, for instance, had to return three
company vehicles which he was leasing and could
no more afford the fees of his children at a fee-paying
private school.

Another important paradox is that while in many
households there was a sense of family unity and an
unprecedented opportunity to spend quality time, in
others, tensions and conflicts often compounded by
stress over financial matters and close proximity brought
about important divisions as testified by increases in
cases of domestic violence. In fact, across the interviews
there have been anecdotes of how some participants’
colleagues who had not been able to conceive after
more than 14 years of marriage finally fell pregnant
during confinement and that generally a COVID-baby
boom is expected. Yet, on the other extreme, there
have also been anecdotal evidence of violence and
separation, of how divorced parents were barred by their
partners to meet their children during confinement and
that the law was not being equipped to respond quickly
to these issues. There was also a common consensus
across different interviews and FGDs that domestic
violence also took the form of violence against children
and elderly abuse and these tally with the official
statistics which are gradually emerging.

Another general theme which rallied consensus
among the study participants was that in spite of being
physically isolated in their own homes, the level of
connection with the outside world with internet access
was very high even among the lowest rungs of society
as internet penetration and ownership of smartphones
are high in the country. Many people including those
above 50s and more particularly the elderly who owned
smartphones but did not use them for social networking
started to make use of these functionalities. They could
also partake in the circulation of information in real time
on social networking sites.

Likewise, as in many other parts of the world, there was
also the adoption of remote working and online meetings
transforming the informality of the home environment
into a more formal space. Households where both
husbands and wife had to work online had to contend
with the difficulties to reconcile household with domestic
tasks and childcare – particularly when extended family
support is not available.

Leisure during this period was severely constrained.
Typical leisure activities of the average Mauritians
revolve around attending the plethora of religious
festivals, wedding ceremonies, get-togethers, concerts,
window-shopping at shopping malls, participating or
watching sports – football, horseracing, restaurants
and pubs, beaches and increasingly gyms and physical
exercise classes. The lockdown constrained people to TV
and internet as the main leisure although concerns were
expressed that drinking was more common than usual.
Exercising at home, and as the situation eased up, on the
streets, gradually became common.

Many individuals particularly those of faith have also
used this episode of their lives as a time to introspect
on the deeper meaning of life, of not taking things
for granted as the assumed linearity of life had been
radically put into question.

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
5.2. Preservation
of social cohesion

54

The multi-ethnic fabric of Mauritian society has thus
far come out of the pandemic largely unscathed.
It is widely known that, generally, in the wake of
crises, many countries must contend with racial,
ethnic or communitarian tensions as social groups
dispute inequities in entitlements or access to limited
resources. However, with the exception of a few
isolated cases of outcry from marginalized communities
which at the beginning of the lockdown were using
the social media as a platform to vent their anger and
disapprobation, and which were even followed by
police interventions, there have been no consequential
incidents to report.

Interviews with key informants including officials from
NGOs and social workers who have been particularly
active at reaching out to poor communities around
the island in order to ensure that they do not lack any
essential material commodities, are unanimous about the
spirit of solidarity and connectedness which prevailed.
Although faith-based organisations were active at
collecting and distributing food supplies, their support
was extended to all members of the community, beyond
their affiliation. As summed up by a Muslim social worker
and activist from an NGO based in the South of the
island, “…at this moment in time when we were going on
the field for food packs and vegetable distribution, it was
Mauritianism which came first, hunger has no religion,
we strived to help all those who needed help… In some
regions, there were mainly creoles, in others there
were Muslims or Hindus, we distributed whatever we
could without discrimination.” Likewise, intra and inter-
community mutual help has contributed to mitigate the
disruptions caused, particularly during the lockdown.

Rural vs. Urban Solidarity

Support to the most needy

Solidarity and mutual assistance were argued to be
pronounced not only in rural regions but even in urban
localities despite the generally more impersonal
relationships which prevail in the towns. There is much
anecdotal evidence of how kinship or friendship-based
networks across the island, centred around the social
media, enabled the swift supply and distribution of fresh
produce and dairy products from the villages to
the towns.

Complementing the extensive support of the Government
through the distribution of food-packs to those on the
SRM, persons with severe disabilities and inmates of
Residential Care Homes and Shelters, some NGOs
focused more specifically on their client-base. For
instance, Lovebridge focused on its beneficiaries which
involved some 350 families (1500 individuals including
more than 800 children) in some 65 localities across the
9 districts of Mauritius).

One interviewee who resides in a Flat in Vieux Quatre-
Bornes, for example, explains how the entire community
of residents used their personal networks across the
island to obtain and distribute fresh vegetables and
commodities which were scarce to find as a result
of panic buying. “Many of my neighbours are just
acquaintances, we bump into each other in the lift or
in the car park, we were not very close, each one for
himself…But during the confinement, it was something
else, we all came together… I knew someone who
could provide eggs or freshly baked bread, another
one knew where to get hydroponic products (lettuce,
English cucumber, pepper), another one had contacts
at the filling station for those who needed gas…So by
communicating our needs and helping each other we
never felt like we were in short supply of anything…”

However, there were many other NGOs (including
faith-based organisations) and social workers which
worked relentlessly across the whole Island braving
administrative challenges particularly obtaining of
WAPs and liaison with local forces-vives and community
leaders; practical and logistical concerns including
sourcing of supplies and transportation; while also
ensuring that their volunteers and employees are
adequately equipped to distribute food supplies and
masks. However, there have been criticisms from some
local community leaders that some pockets of poverty
have received more supplies than others. Some NGOs
have in fact acknowledged that based on their locus
of activities, the pockets of poverty which were more
accessible have indeed been treated more favourably
than those which were geographically or road-access-
wise more remote. A more centralized dashboard with
the relevant coordination across well-intended NGOs is
acknowledged to have circumvented this problem and
allows for a more equitable voluntary distribution of
supplies to the needy.

5.3. Crime
during lockdown

56

Nonetheless, in spite of the attempts to support the
community and the needy through the difficult phase of
the lockdown, there were inevitably some people who
resorted to illicit and illegal coping strategies. It emerged
from FGDs and across many interviews, for instance, that
in many places across the Island, vegetable plantations
were being looted. Some interviewees from the urban
regions of Rose-Hill and Beau-Bassin reported that
during the lockdown, there were many cases of people
outside the neighbourhood loitering and neighbours had
experienced the disappearance of different items in their
yards from gas cylinders to bicycles and even fruit trees
and flower pots which they suspect could have been
resold. In the words of a participant, “…At first there were
people we have never seen in the region…They must
be from ‘Cite B…’, and with their masks, even if they
are captured on camera, it is not easy to recognize
them…If you come out and ask what they want they
ask for help…their children do not have food, anything

that can be given they would take…Some of us have
helped…but they would come back…We don’t want to
encourage this…When we don’t give, they come in the
yard and they take…We didn’t want to get into trouble…
They have nothing to lose, we do…We called the police
and they come for patrol but many of us have already
lost stuff which are not necessarily valuable…”

Similar testimonies can be found in other regions of
the Island. In fact, some videos of people stealing
construction materials in houses under construction
or renovation went viral on social media during the
lockdown. However, while many of these cases have
not been officially reported in the words of a participant
“given the hassle to deal with the police and the more so
during this period”, there have been cases which have
been officially recorded as discussed below:

Official records

Officially recorded cases of various forms of crime
by the Police, as shown in the Chart below, indicate
that during confinement there was an increase in
the number of thefts and burglaries recorded which
subsequently decreased after the lockdown was
relaxed. Conversely, the number of cases of robberies
reported, noted a decrease during that period and picked
up after as the lockdown was lifted. The number of
reported assault cases also dipped during confinement
to subsequently note an increase over the months of
May and June.

It is useful to highlight that while the above-mentioned
trends in these categories of crime during the specific
context of confinement seem rather pronounced,
nonetheless when located in longer trends – for instance
within available time series data from police records
over the last 2 years – these trends do not reveal an
unusually higher incidence of crime. In fact, as the Chart
below shows it is only on the case of assaults that there
has been an all-time low which is evident in the sense
that when the mass of the population is confined there is
less risk of assault.

Survey data

The picture emerging from the nationally representative
household survey indicates that 9.5% of the sample have
reported affirmatively to the question as to whether there
‘have been any crimes in your neighbourhood’ (Figure

5.3 a), while 10% feel unsafe in their neighbourhood after
COVID-19 (Figure 5.3b) indicating the impact of these
crimes on their feeling of safety.

From the small-scale survey of those in extreme
poverty, it has also come to the fore that as compared
to the wider population, the feeling of safety is much
less as the Table below indicates. In fact, although
caution needs to be exercised in the inferring from these
figures from a small sample, the indicative picture which
it provides, complemented with insights from the field
from qualitative data suggests that the emerging picture
is a matter of concern.

A host of social problems have worsened as shown
in the Chart below which corroborates the lower than
average feeling of unsafety. It also indicates that risks
of exacerbating social exclusion and being trapped into
chronic poverty are high.

5.4. Vulnerable groups

59

Although there are certainly common experiences
of confinement, it is also clear that the impacts of
confinement are far from homogeneous but rather
different social groups have been impacted differently

according to pre-existing inequalities and vulnerabilities.
This section outlines some of the main ways in which the
following vulnerable groups have been impacted.

The Poor

While it is estimated that 10% of Mauritian households
or roughly 33,600 households live below the relative
poverty line (Lovebridge 2020) those living in extreme
poverty in Mauritius (which is the focus of the Survey
of the Poorest of the Poor) are estimated at 1.2% of
the population. As of April 2020, this social group of
roughly 10,300 households comprising some 40,000
beneficiaries were registered on the Social Register of
Mauritius (SRM). The Social Register is a vital element of
the Marshall Plan against poverty established in 2016 to
scale up efforts to eradicate poverty.

A snapshot of the impacts of COVID-19 on this segment
of the population has been provided by the survey of the
poorest of the poor. Some key highlights are
provided below:

The above revealing statistics confirm that those in
extreme poverty were ill-equipped to confront the effects
of the lockdown. Although, as shown earlier, assistance
has been provided by Government and NGOs to mitigate
the impacts of the lockdown on this social group, limited
access to secure employment and in particular the
inability to save up for times of need make this group
particularly vulnerable to shocks like confinement.
The relatively short spell of the confinement may not
have fundamentally affected the progress made in
terms of poverty alleviation since 2016. However, the
challenges for the social and financial empowerment
of this vulnerable group and their upliftment from the
social exclusion remain high, given the fact that this
group is disproportionately female-headed with limited
opportunities for sustainable wage-employment in
the formal sector. It is noted that due to the outbreak
of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Social Contracts with
SRM families which were to expire in June 2020 were

extended up to Dec 2020. Considering the prevailing
socio-economic situation, Government has approved
the extension of the social contracts of eligible families
up to June 2021 depending on their monthly derived or
assessed income.

Concerns over how far education is valued among this
social group as well as the resort to illicit and illegal
activities which appear to have increased further from
survey findings reported earlier point towards the need
for more efforts to avoid a worsening of the situation of
this community.

Another important concern is the sensitive issue of the
ethnic dimension which extreme poverty and social
exclusion have historically taken which has the potential
to affect social cohesion of a multi-ethnic social fabric if
not properly managed.

Women

Across the world, it is widely acknowledged that
the pandemic has brought about differential gender
impacts with a general tendency that women are
being hit harder (See e.g. OECD 2020; UNDP 2020 ).
In countries where deep-seated patriarchal beliefs and
practices continue to prevail, where gender continues to
be an important mediator in occupational segregation
or job tenure and security, with a bearing on income
inequalities; where domestic roles and responsibilities,
or authority patterns and agency continue to be more
favourable to males; women and girls shoulder a
disproportionate brunt of the pandemic. Even worse,
when gender as a structure of disadvantage intersects
with other characteristics such as unemployment,
poverty and social exclusion, ethnic minority status, age,
disability, among others, this exacerbates both gender
disparities and intra-women inequalities making the
challenge to address these inequalities even
more colossal.

In Mauritius although the female population is higher
than the male population – albeit slightly – and although
girls systematically outperform boys at primary,
secondary and tertiary educational levels, there is an
underrepresentation of women in the labour force, an
overrepresentation of women among the unemployed
– in spite of being relatively more qualified – as well
as inequalities of pay and access to positions of power.
Some stylised facts about women and economic
participation are provided in Appendix 3.

The gendered implications of the pandemic have
been treated across this report looking mainly at the
differential impacts on unemployment, gender dynamics
within the household including gender-based violence
and the distribution of domestic tasks and the care
economy. A summary of the main impacts is provided in
the following explanations:

As evidence from this study indicates, the severity of the
impacts known to be happening elsewhere appear to
have been mitigated in Mauritius. As mentioned before,
the successful handling of the crisis and the relatively
short stalling of economic activities and the recovery
which Mauritius has subsequently witnessed has to a
large extent cushioned the impacts in terms of female
unemployment with the exception of some sectors which
have been particularly vulnerable to the lockdown such
as retail and tourism-related activities.

However, there are important challenges ahead as
women who have lost their jobs or who have chosen to
put job-seeking on hold may find it increasingly hard
to get back into paid employment as they will have to
compete with a larger number of unemployed men.

The older female workforce, particularly in blue-
collar work, is widely known to be averse to reskilling
and are at best condemned to compete for menial
occupations often under precarious conditions. The
encouragement of micro-enterprises has tended to
lead to a mushrooming of low-end products such as
handicrafts, pickles and foodstuffs and with the return
from these activities being unlikely to sustain a decent
livelihood. Limited access to collaterals including finance
and assets have thus far accounted for important gender
inequalities in self-employment. Sectors of employment
which are unaffected, and which are even likely to
expand, including in the Science Technology and
Innovation Sectors, tend to attract male graduates rather
than female graduates. All these limitations require
appropriate social and mindset engineering as well
as relevant technical and financial support in order to
prevent a deterioration of existing gender inequalities in
the labour market.

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius

61

The lockdown period also sheds light on the persistence
of gender inequalities in the distribution of power and
authority as well as care and domestic chores in the
household. In particular, the gross abuse of basic human
rights in terms of domestic violence which many women
have suffered during confinement shows that there is still
much progress to be made in society to curb
this scourge.

Children

Another important aspect of this study has been to
examine the experiences of children through the
episode of lockdown. Confinement has inevitably
affected children in many ways which remain to be
thoroughly investigated as a multidisciplinary research
exercise of its own. As summed up by the Global
status report on preventing violence against children,
‘The COVID-19 pandemic and the physical distancing
measures imposed in response to it have greatly
increased the risk of intra-family violence and online
abuse. School closures have impacted more than 1.5
billion children and youth. Movement restrictions, loss
of income, isolation, and overcrowding have heightened
levels of stress and anxiety in parents, caregivers and
children, and cut families and individuals off from their
usual sources of support. Reports of child abuse and of

children witnessing violence between their parents and
caregivers have increased’17.

The salient features of how children have gone through
COVID have been identified through informant interviews
complemented by secondary data including official
statistics and reports. The informant interviews were
done with children themselves, primary and secondary
school teachers, police officials, officials of Resident Care
institutions, Government officials and social workers,
while the secondary data statistics and reports included
the recently launched Ombudsperson for Children's
Office which has a detailed section on its initiatives for
ensuring that the rights of children are protected during
the lockdown. The findings of the combined sources of
information are as outlined below.

17 – WHO, 2020,p.v5

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius

Violence against children

According to official sources (MGEFW; Government
Information Service [GIS], 2020), there have been
463 cases of child abuse over the period 20 March
to 13 May 2020. The Ministry of Gender Equality and
Family Welfare in collaboration with the Mauritius
Police Force intervened in all reported cases to provide
relevant support and protection to the victims (GIS,
2020). Accordingly, 37 children required placement
into residential care institutions over this period and
COVID-19 testing was carried out prior to their placement.
While more in-depth research is required on issues such
as the nature, profile, causes and consequences of
abuse against child-victims, in general, key informants
report that reported cases are generally from families
where there are a host of problems including broken
families, mal adjustment or rebellion of children against
step-parents and often exacerbated by economic
hardships which have been further compounded by the
impacts of the lockdown as described earlier.

Children in Residential Care
Institutions and Youth Centres

Considerable efforts were also made by all actors,
including the Ombudsperson for Children’s Office,
the Ministry of Gender Equality through the Child
Development Unit, the police through the Brigade pour
la Protection des Mineurs, as well as NGOs in order
to ensure that children in situations of conflict with
the law or who are in Residential Care Institutions did
not lack material, educational and emotional support
during the confinement period. An important challenge
in the early days of the total lockdown was to obtain
WAPs for RCI Managers and staff in order to ensure that
the children were properly attended to. Some RCIs had
some problems to control older children who were not
receptive to the new lockdown arrangements and the
sanitary measures. However, with the intervention of the
OCO through site visits, these situations were resolved.

Children with Disabilities

An important area of concern during confinement
pertained to a gap in terms of support for children with
conditions like autism where the effects of confinement
were particularly harsh. Some representations were
also made to the Ministry of Education, regarding the
exclusion faced by hearing or sight-impaired students
while most students could assist the educational
programmes essentially designed for the mainstream.

37

Children required placement into residential
care institutions and COVID-19 testing was
carried out prior to their placement.

Elderly

Given the lack of quantitative data, specifically on the
socioeconomic impacts of the lockdown on the elderly,
interviews with opinion leaders and 3 FGDs with
different senior citizens associations in different towns
and villages of the island have been conducted in order
to obtain an indicative picture. Among the key themes
which emerged was the overall sense of fear of catching
the disease, particularly in the early stages of the
lockdown, as educational and sensitization campaigns
emphasised that the elderly were particularly vulnerable
to COVID-19.

While socio-economic background determined the level
of economic preparedness and ability to cope with the
effects of lockdown and of getting regular supplies of
necessities, there was an overall consensus that the
efforts made by Government to physically bring the
old age pensions in the community and even dispense
seasonal flu vaccines at their doorsteps were invaluable
in limiting their exposure to risks of infection.
Access to care which is so important for elderly
dependents has been a major concern during the
confinement. In some cases, it is reported that
households who employ elderly-care givers to stay with
chronically ill elderly members in the household have
had to do without their services until the confinement
was lifted often not having the required skills and ability
to perform this task. Those elderly people who relied on
support from relatives or kins for access to basic supplies
such as gas cylinders or food items on account of limited
mobility have been particularly helpless during the total
lockdown period. Given that the nuclear family set up is
the norm, many elders have faced isolation from their
close ones. As one participant argues “The worst for me
was to be away from my grand-daughter… I used to go to
her place to drive her to school and back…talking on the
phone is not the same”.

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
63

“ ”

The worst for me was to be away
from my grand-daughter… I used
to go to her place to drive her to
school and back…talking on the
phone is not the same.

The elderly people who were not conversant with
technology were particularly excluded from the
sense of community which social media and social
networking sites provided during these difficult moments.
Furthermore, it was also a missed opportunity for the
elderly to engage in online shopping at their convenience
without needing to take risks of leaving the house.

The FGDs also revealed that many elderly people who
have smartphones have seen an opportunity to learn
and maximise the potential and functionalities of these
devices for being in touch with what is happening. In
particular, elderly people from middle class backgrounds
upwards who tend to be more IT-literate or educated
have been able to stay connected throughout the
confinement thus drawing on the benefits which ICTS
have – information, entertainment, communication as
well as online transactions.

However, it was also highlighted that many elderly
people were unable to engage in their usual routine
which disrupted their physical and emotional balance.
For instance, some elderly women in one of the FGDs
mentioned that for years they used to meet for religious
chanting and that attending and cleaning a nearby
Kovil- temple was a central feature of their lives but
the inability to do so left them with a void. For senior
citizens who used to go out for footing or other physical
activities, again, confinement was a major problem, some
highlighting the concern that during confinement they
struggled to control their medical conditions such as
diabetes and Hypertension.

There was also a bleak picture for elders, men and
women who were confronted with chronic health issues.
In addition, there have been reports of abuse from the
part of their family members as a result of compatibility
issues. There have been anecdotal reports of tension
and conflicts over trivial matters as confinement over
such a lengthy period of time-tested relationships,
particularly among elderly people and their in-laws,
sapping morale and psychology of the elderly.
Another dark side of the picture pertains to the different
categories of elderly people with the oldest old being
even more vulnerable and dependent on others for
care and support. More particularly, given that the
life expectancy of women is higher than of men, there
have been many elderly widows who have arguably
been particularly isolated and dependent on others for
meeting their practical if not psychological needs.

People living with HIV
and key populations

(Sex workers, men who have sex with
men, people who inject drugs and
transgenders)

Efforts were also made by sector NGOs (PILS, AILES,
Association Kinouété, etc) and Government agencies to
ensure that people living with HIV and key populations
were not deprived of the usual support systems during
confinement.

Interviews with key officials from the above organisations
reveal that in spite of challenges in obtaining Work
Access Permits, there was a strong sense of cooperation
among different NGOs working in this area to liaise
and provide support to this vulnerable group. With the
guidance and assistance of the COVID-Task Force, there
was a continuation in the support services provided.
Apart from food and material support, Methadone
Substitution Therapy and the distribution of medicines
were continued with drug addicts and people on Anti-
Retroviral Treatment.

These initiatives have no doubt helped in limiting the
spread of the disease among this social group while at
the same time exercising a form of social control. It also
shows that no-one was indeed left behind in this fight.

Migrant workers

There is limited data on how the population of migrant
workers have gone through the confinement period and
this warrants a specific study of its own. Migrant workers
have become a quintessential element of the labour
force over the last 20 years. Estimated at 12,100 in 2007,
this figure has reached 48,000 in March 2020 according
to the Ministry of Labour. Garment manufacturing and
Construction are the main employers of foreign labour –

MIGRANT WORKERS IN 2020:

12.100
48.000

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
65

Bangladesh, India, China and Madagascar are the main
countries from which most of these workers come from. A
trend which has been noted recently has been a gradual
defeminization of the expatriate workforce – women
making only 6200 workers compared to 10,000 in 2014.

Preliminary data from one FGD with Bangladeshi workers
employed in construction reveal that during confinement,
they spent their time in their dormitories. They received
their basic salaries and arrangements for their food
supplies were made by their employers. While they
could not send remittances home at the end of the month
of March, they could do so towards the end of April
and May. These remittances are quintessential for the
survival of their families back home.

However, it is also noteworthy that in an interview with
Trade Union Leaders Reaz Chuttoo and Jane Ragoo
from the CTSP (Confederation Travayere Secteur Prive)
it surfaced that the treatment of foreign labour was
uneven. Complaints received at their office, as well as
their own inquiries, indicate that in some companies
employing Bangladeshi workers, there have been some
gross disrespect of these workers’ rights including giving
them just a percentage of their salary. According to the
CTSP, as compared to (francophone) Malagasy workers
who can read and understand French newspapers
which are more commonly available locally than English
newspapers, Bangladeshi workers are not adequately
literate and therefore could not interpret what their
entitlements were.

From the perspective of the participants in this FGD
there were no complaints from themselves or their fellow
workers in their respective companies. However, they
argue that they are aware of other companies where
due to lack of business, their employers have delayed
in giving them their wages. One participant also stated
that Bangladeshi workers have been told to be cautious
of taking food items from volunteers during confinement
because this has in some occasions been used against
the employers as argument that they were not treating
their employees correctly.

This has allegedly led to abuse by some unscrupulous
employers. CTSP further adds that the decline in orders
in some factories which employ Bangladeshis and the
limited revenue in terms of overtime which Bangladeshi
workers rely on to make both ends meet, explain the need
for them to also seek extra work in bakeries, shops or in
domestic work after office hours in the aftermath of the
confinement period.

Conclusions

The Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Mauritius
67

agricultural practices such as community and
backyard gardening could improve food self-
sufficiency especially for the poorest.

4. Promoting the social economy is also vital: While

there are several NGOs, philanthropic organisations
and volunteers that provided support and extended
the outreach work of social services to the most
needy, there are clear avenues for the development
of social enterprises, with the twin objectives of
wealth creation and sustainable development, with
a focus to generate opportunities to SMEs, women,
and youth in the supply chain. It is observed that
a COVID-19 Solidarity Fund has been set up with
objective to assist those affected by the pandemic
and financial support are provided to programmes,
projects and schemes related to COVID-19 including
social entrepreneurship and associated public
health issues.

5. Gender Responsiveness: The response should be
gender-responsive while addressing the protection
of workers, reinforcing social protection measures
towards the poor and vulnerable, addressing
deepening social inequalities and social exclusion.

6. To protect households in extreme poverty, it

is important to develop a real-time monitoring
system that ensures the inclusion of vulnerable
people in planning and response. Building
better data is important for better policy advice.
Multidimensional poverty and poverty mapping
are critical to assist in proper intervention policies
in social protection. Additionally, regular food
insecurity evaluations and mapping of real-time
vulnerability are important to monitor changes and
target the most vulnerable households. In the last
Government budget speech, it was announced
that a National Database for Vulnerable Groups
will be set-up to cover both absolute and relative
poverty cases. This will help in enhancing policy
effectiveness in the fight against poverty.

In conclusion, it is important to note that this study
has provided a snapshot over a limited reference
period. Given the dynamic and evolving nature of this
phenomenon, more particularly the prevailing second
waves in Mauritius’ foreign markets, there is a need for a
close monitoring of the situation and the repercussions
on the local economy. It is also imperative to frequently
monitor the welfare dynamics imposed by the pandemic
to safeguard the population against possible exclusions.

Mauritius has performed impressively in managing
the spread and impacts of the pandemic. By rapidly
containing the virus through closing our border and
implementing a lockdown response, it has prevented
widespread infection, and an overburdened health
system. Strong and immediate government relief
measures have cushioned the economy and enabled
a swift return to normalcy. Overall, the strategy of
putting people first through a prompt and multi-pronged
approach together with the cooperation of the civil
society has also ensured social cohesion. Further, the
confinement heavily impacted individuals who lost jobs
and business, although the impacts would have been
worse without Government recovery support which has
been acknowledged by this report for its effectiveness.

As the country advances its efforts to manage the
impacts of the pandemic, this report recommends
additional reflections in the following areas:

1.

A national contingency or crisis response plan
could be formulated in a participatory and
inclusive manner, with emphasis on the poor
and most vulnerable groups, and building on
the experience of the recent pandemic. Better
outreach strategies for the poor in case of another
emergency or crisis, improving access to the
most needy aid coordination including work and
movement permits for aid delivery agencies,
setting up a food bank, facilitating access to
online education for the poorest households and
building capacity for women to support their kids’
learning, in line with online medical consultations
and e-prescriptions are some of the contingency
planning elements revealed by the study.

2. The continued efforts to dynamize existing

economic sectors, especially manufacturing
and services, remain crucial. The use of ICT
and digital technologies across sectors is the
momentum to bring new competitive edge to
the economy. Businesses, especially, SMEs and
women entrepreneurs, among others, would require
acceleration in digital transformation. The need to
encourage and harness Science Technology and
Innovation in areas such as telemedicine, online
education, online shopping and innovative delivery
systems should be further developed.

3. The Government should continue with efforts in
the development of sustainable value chain and
smart agriculture models which will eventually
lead to a sustainable and green industry. In this
respect a well-structured training and awareness
programme may be envisaged with time-bound
targets that could involve all strata of society.
While grass root initiatives are important, innovative

Annex 2: Input-Output Model

Output and employment multiplier – an input-output approach

Suppose xi represents the output of industry i, which can either be sold to consumers as final consumption, or be
used as ‘intermediate inputs’ to produce other products or services. The proportion which is consumed by consumers
is called ‘final demand’ and, for simplicity, it is denoted by Yi
. There are also a number of industries which will use
xi as inputs in their production. The part which is consumed by a particular industry, industry 1 (or which is sold to
industry 1) may be represented by Xi1
. Hence, in
mathematical terms, industry i output is consumed as follows:

; similarly industry 2 will use Xi2, and industry ‘n’ will consume Xin

Xi= Xi1 + Xi2 + ... + Xin + Yi

This can be written as follows:

n
Xi= Σxij + Yi
j=1

(1)

(2)

Each industry ( j=1...n) which uses xi
consumed, xij
as:

, is proportional to that industry ‘s output17, x j , with a technological coefficient axj

. This can be written

as input is assumed to employ a production technology such that the quantity

Xij= aij xj

Hence, replacing (3) in (2), we have

Xi= Σaij xj+ Yi

n

j=1

Equation 4 is an economy-wide production system involving n number of industries. When there is a rise in demand
for a product in a industry, output in that industry will rise. This is called the ‘direct effect’. It also leads to a rise in
demand in inputs used in its production; this in turn, leads to an increase in demand for output in other industries
which will generate successive round rises in demand for other products and employment, creating a multiplier effect
of input and output requirements. This is referred to as the ‘indirect effect’. Equation 4 can be used to estimate the
output and employment multiplier effect. Using matrix terminology, equation (4) can be written as:

x=Ax+y

(5)

if A is the technological matrix such as

then Equation (5) can be rearranged as follows:

x=(1-A)-1y

The elements of (1-A)-1 provides the direct and indirect effects on output from a unit change in sectoral final demand
in a particular sector. Based on equation (8), the output impact analysis can be calculated:

∆ x=(1-A)-1 ∆ y

(7)

The direct and indirect change in employment potential due to a unit change in a sectoral final demand would be L is
vector of employment coefficients. Given by:

∆ e=L(1-A)-1 ∆ y

(8)

L is vector of employment coefficients

this allocation, the assessment assumes that the Wage Assistance Scheme and the Self-Employed Assistance
Scheme are mainly spent on these items with the following percentages: 71.1% on food and beverages, 21.5%
on housing, electricity, water, gas and fuels and 7.4% on health-related items. Food and beverages are further
allocated to farming, processed foods, and wholesale and retail trade.
