Villagers in the Syrian coastal areas are resorting to their indigenous knowledge to collect rainwater and overcome water scarcity during dry seasons. The tanks are made from rocks and big stones which are found in the coastal area. Special skills and knowledge are needed to build the tanks, these skills are only available to some old villagers who inherited them from their ancestors. The rainwater tanks were made to collect rainwater during the rainy season and save it for the dry seasons. However, because of the viability of public water provided by the government from different resources, people stepped building the tanks, as a result, the knowledge and skills of building stone water tanks were about to be forgotten.  Now because of the longer dry seasons and scarcity of water that is due to climate change, people brought back these tool to collect rainwater.
