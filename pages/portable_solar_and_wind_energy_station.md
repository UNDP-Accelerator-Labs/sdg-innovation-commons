> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The aim of the project is to propose a renewable energy hybrid system. The system includes 1. Solar panels 2. Wind generator. 3 mirrors reflecting sunlight and 4 concentrators receiving reflected rays.  All these components are known and widely used, but our innovation lies in the following: Mostly sunny days are windless and the wind generator itself experiences zero load. A solar reflector of a simple circuit and a high-temperature concentrator are connected to the wind generator. Hot gas flow coming from concentrator hits the blades the wind generator. In this case solar energy is used to power the wind generator and thus an additional generator at no additional cost.
