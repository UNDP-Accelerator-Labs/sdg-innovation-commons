> Type of the Solution

Technology &amp; Management Approach

> Affected Sector

Energy

> Description of the solution

Biomass energy refers to the generation of electricity or heat from organic matter like wood, crops, or agricultural residues. "Sustainable Biomass Energy" emphasizes practices that ensure the long-term viability of biomass resources, minimize environmental impacts, and promote positive air quality outcomes. This can involve using certified sources, maintaining forest health, utilizing efficient conversion technologies, and implementing emission control measures.

> Socio-economic effects

Renewable energy generation, potential for rural development through job creation in sustainable biomass production, potential for improved air quality compared to fossil fuels when implemented sustainably

> Type of Measure

- 3. mitigation measures

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- professional organization

> Timescale of implementation

- long-term (5 and above)

> Other Notes

Multi-Stakeholder Approach (Certification bodies, Businesses, Landowners, NGOs) can lead the solution. Sustainability practices are crucial for biomass energy to be a truly sustainable solution, particularly regarding air quality. Certification programs like the Sustainable Biomass Program (SBP) aim to ensure responsible sourcing and minimize environmental drawbacks. Careful management and ongoing research are essential to ensure the overall environmental benefits of Sustainable Biomass Energy.
