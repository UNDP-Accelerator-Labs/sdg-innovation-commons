The solution envisages obtaining real-time information on the quality of water in rivers, lakes, groundwater, and reservoirs. There are two points: an end node and a central station for collecting data and sending it to the server via the Internet. Then endpoint sensors measure water level, acidity, salinity, temperature, river flow rate, oxygen content, etc. will measure and send information to the central server.  The device is charged with the solar battery.
