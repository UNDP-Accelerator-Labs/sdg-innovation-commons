## What is the challenge?

Community-based village tourism is not a common thing in Bangladesh despite the fact that one of the main beauties of Bangladesh is its villages and rural life. Moreover, community-based village tourism can address several challenges. It is the ultimate form of sustainable tourism. It can help Bangladesh attract travelers who prefer slow and sustainable traveling. It can help local communities and the economy and can take some of the pressure off of the prominent tourist destinations in the country. Many tourists who visit Bangladesh want to taste rural life, want to see nature, enjoy endless views of rice fields, experience the culture and nature but can’t due to lack of options for community tourism. The positive side of community tourism is that it attracts very filtered travelers who respect the culture. Unlike many luxury group travelers who are quite loud and negatively impact the culture, these travelers are usually very experienced and very respectful towards culture, which is very good for sustainable tourism. Many famous tourist destinations suffer from a slow degradation of local culture. They can't offer any local culture. Community-based village tourism can be a counter weight to this challenge.
## What is the solution? How does the solution work? 

In 2020, Jafar Tuhin, founder of Taabu Tours and Ekduaria Village Homestay, a community village tourism initiative, returned to his village Ekduaria, a remote village in Narsingdi. The village is over 100 years old and offers an expansive natural beauty and local culture. Being a passionate traveler himself and being in the world of tourism, Jafar considered all the limitations of conventional tourism and decided to start working on community based village tourism. Eventually, he started a small village homestay program for foreign tourists who want to experience rural life, culture, community, and nature in Bangladesh. The travelers can go to Ekduaria and stay with Jafar’s family and experience village life. Jafar is now working to spread the initiative to a few more villages.

“I had a spare room in my house at the time,” said Jafar. “If I do a village homestay program I thought guests could come and stay at my home similar to what guests usually did in my house in Dhaka. The response was good. Along my home, I worked on another house, renovating it so that a family could stay there.” Jafar now works on two houses. He wants slow and sustainable tourism. “I don't want Bangladeshi village tourism to become as busy as tourist destinations such as Bangkok or Bali,” he adds. The problem with hyper-popularity is that then it becomes a challenge to local culture and sustainability. “That's why I want this to grow slowly and sustainably,” said Jafar. “We have thousands of villages in Bangladesh. I don't want this to happen in my village alone. I want this to spread all across the country.”

Ekduaria Village Homestay is a strong proponent of sustainable village tourism. Jafar says they don’t arrange any special event for tourists, and don't prepare any special food. Travelers enjoy the regular rural life of a village in Bangladesh. They take part in irrigating land, planting paddy, milking cows with the villagers and their host family. They cook on the soil stove. They live that exact life as the villagers. Ekduaria Village Homestay currently has 04 travel guides along with its founder Jafar, which is the only special thing that it offers to tourists. Most people who come to Bangladesh don't understand Bangla, so they need English-speaking guides.

Jafar says he is currently doing it only in Ekduaria village and is working to spread it to a few nearby villages. For Ekduaria village, people in my village are very happy and excited to see foreign tourists. People are usually very inviting, help travelers, teach, and share things with them.
