Hydraulic Machine Co., Ltd. (HMC) developed a technology which converts unclassified solid wastes into a synthesis gas to fuel electricity generation. The transformation process is odourless and smokeless, and more importantly, produces no wastewater or solid residue. During the trial period, HMC successfully generated 10 days worth of power for the lighting system of Dong Van 2 Industrial Park in the northern Vietnamese province of Ha Nam.
