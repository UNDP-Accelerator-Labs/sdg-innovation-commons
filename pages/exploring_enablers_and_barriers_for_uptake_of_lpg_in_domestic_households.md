Exploring enablers and barriers for uptake of LPG in domestic households
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that uptake of LPG for cooking in domestic settings is still very reduced, even in areas covered by LPG distribution networks (urban and peri-urban). Currently, approximately 75% of Mozambican households still rely on biomass energy for cooking, of which more than half rely on a combination of Charcoal and Firewood, despite its health and safety hazards and negative impact on the environment. Additionally, while there is a common belief that limited use of LPG is a result of its high cost, studies show that increase in income only leads to higher levels of energy consumption, and not to the selection of different fuel choices. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Over the last 10 years, the fastest growing cities of Mozambique (Maputo, Beira & Nampula) have seen such a growth in the consumption of charcoal, that the prices have increase by more than 200%. This has raised concerns about the availability of biomass resources, and market ability to meet growing demand in the next 25 years, especially for low-income families. In the southern part of the country, the capital Maputo is currently dependent on charcoal produced in areas up to 400km away, all because no more forests are left in the province, capable of meeting demand. While studies have shown that families who traditionally consume charcoal would be better served with LPG and have begun to show willingness to make the change, high prices of initial purchase remain a key obstacle for mass scale adoption of LPG. Key players in private sector & government have begun exploring alternative business models, but to date, these have yet to yield sustainable and scalable results. Despite the fact that charcoal price has increased to such a point that its monthly consumption is more costly than that of LPG and electricity, there are still no business models that specifically meet the demands of low-income families.

- Maputo City is responsible for approx. 30% of charcoal consumption in the country, but is now dependent on charcoal sourced up to 400km away.  - Informal trade of charcoal is abundant in urban centers and peri-urban neighborhoods, despite the fact that LPG bottles have a lower monthly cost. This is due to the fact that the first (charcoal) allows low-income families to buy very small quantities on-the-go, therefore giving the appearance of being more financially accessible.  - While some studies have been done by LPG producers in the country, there is limited evidence of real strategies to expand distribution networks and adjusting price model to match local incomes. This means, that for the foreseeable future, LPG will remain an energy source for high income families.  - Community workshops with low-income families (run by the Acc Lab) have shown that while initial cost and safety concern are big deterrents to use of gas, families often demonstrate interest in adopting LPG use if initial support is given to overcome these obstacles (training, financial support)

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

We want to explore how difference financing modalities and service offerings can accelerate LPG adoption for low-income families. Initial research has shown that demand for LPG is not a concern, and that the main obstacle remains in developing a supply line adapted to the low-income sector. This would require developing a product and service offering where particular focus is given to forms of payment, sales outlets and product packaging/size that address this segment’s needs. In this context, the Acc Lab proposes that a few trials, where these modalities are tested will give us a more concrete idea of what works for this segment.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We need to find and test the right combination of 2 or 3 factors that will lead low income (urban and peri-urban) families to not only start using LPG, but to have it as their main source of cooking energy.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

- Behavioral insight: through structured interviews with the goal of understanding community insights, bias and preferences regarding cooking energy sources in general and LPG in particular  - Co-creation: with private sector LPG producers and distributors, to develop new value propositions, both in terms of services and products, that meet the financial capabilities of low income communities.  - Minimal Viable Product (MVP): through the testing of the most basic features this service & product combination need to have to be attractive to low income families

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Existing studies on LPG use in Mozambique seems to focus on financial and environmental aspects of the issue, while our in-depth interviews will allow us to obtain behavior insights that will give us a more robust knowledge of the key target demographic- low income families.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Early coordination with the private sector would be key in securing supply lines and ensuring buy-in of proposed business model. If successful, this could mean a significant increase in their customer base, which would be key to long term sustainability. Environmental agencies could link biomass & renewable energy campaigns with LPG awareness, subsequently promoting more sustainable use of energy forms. Some experimental work done locally with carbon credits could also be connected to LPG uptake initiatives.
