Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT. One of the challenges is that there are some tourists who go to camp to the most remote parts of CHT e.g., Marathon mountain to observe sunrise and sunset and live-in tents to do so. But the absence of proper road networks makes it difficult to access these areas. Putting road numbers and creating new road networks between tourist spots such as Bilai chhori Ruma, Thanchi and Cox's Bazar without damaging the eco-system can be potential solutions and these will be useful not only to attract new tourists who want to venture off the beaten path but also to encourage repeat visits.
