As the sun glints off the Mediterranean, Zliten, a vibrant coastal city in Libya, appears peaceful and serene. Yet beneath the surface, a quiet crisis is unfolding. Rising groundwater is turning streets into puddles and making homes uninhabitable. Imagine waking up to find water flooding in your house and the house of your neighbourhood. How would you feel in that moment? What thoughts would cross your mind? Atiyah Jowan, a resident of Zliten, describes how the rising groundwater has affected his community. ‘It started in our kitchen,’ he says. At first, we noticed water seeping in, thinking it was a plumping issue. But soon, homes were flooded, and the foundations of buildings began to weaken.’ What started as isolated cases of increasing basement humidity in late 2023 has now become a pressing environmental issue affecting homes, businesses, farms, and infrastructure across the region.Today, Libya’s landscapes are evolving rapidly, and groundwater flooding in Zliten and Bi’r al Ghanam has emerged as a critical challenge. This environmental crisis is disrupting communities, damaging infrastructure, and posing serious risks to public health. Long ago, the Libyan desert was once covered by water, but today, it is characterized by vast sandy landscapes filled with seashells and fossils that remind us of its past. These changes highlight the connection between natural processes and human activity, reminding us that "change is the only constant" and that our world is always evolving, requiring us to adapt to sustainable solutions. In response, UNDP Libya’s Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with the High Technical Committee for Monitoring the Rise of Groundwater Phenomenon under the General Administration of Environmental Sanitation Affairs in the Ministry of Local Governance (MoLG), has joined forces with local and international partners to explore innovative approaches to uncover the root causes and develop innovative, actionable solutions. These efforts must adopt an inclusive approach, actively engaging women in both technical and decision-making roles, ensuring diverse perspectives that contribute to effective solutions. Collaborative efforts bring together diverse voices – experts, innovators, and locals – aiming to collectively understand the current situation, explore technological solutions, and brainstorm potential aspirations arising from these challenges, and the technical committee played the main the role in understanding the current situation of the phenomena of rising groundwater and Earth-cracks in Libya.Collaborative efforts have led to key insights on addressing groundwater flooding. By focusing on technological innovation, community-driven action, and strengthened policies, experts haveidentified a multifaceted approach to mitigate this growing challenge and see it as an opportunity that can be turned out of a challenge.Understanding the Crisis

The groundwater rise in Zliten has been particularly alarming, with theories pointing to seawater intrusion into coastal aquifers, leaks from the Man-Made River (MMR) infrastructure, poor sewage systems, inadequate urban planning, and irregular groundwater extraction practices. In Bi’r al Ghanam, similar flooding over 180 km away suggests that geological shifts may also contribute to the problem.Dr. Saleh Sadeg, Head of the High Technical Committee for Monitoring the Rise Groundwater Phenomenon highlighted three primary causes, stating: "Our studies indicate rising groundwater levels are primarily related to urban water use, where household wastewater is directed into septic tanks due to the absence of a sewage network. This water flows underground to low-lying areas, introducing biological contaminants. Secondly, leaks in the city's ageing water supply network further exacerbate the problem. Lastly, geological phenomena, such as the presence of an aquifer at a depth of 30 meters, also contribute to the flooding."The effects of rising groundwater are widespread and deeply concerning. Not only are homes and businesses at risk of structural damage, but there are also serious concerns about water contamination from sewage infiltration, which threatens public health and ecosystems. These challenges highlight the urgent need for sustainable and innovative solutions to protect communities and infrastructure.Technological Innovations and Community Engagement

UNDP Libya’s Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with the Qatar Computing Research Institute, is leveraging advanced technologies such as satellite imagery and IoT-based sensors to monitor and manage groundwater levels. IoT-based sensors, which are small devices placed in wells and other key locations, provide real-time data on groundwater fluctuations. This data allows local authorities to detect changes quickly and respond effectively.Dr. Muhammad Imran, a senior scientist at the Qatar Computing Research Institute, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, highlighted how these tools can analyze environmental changes and provide invaluable data for better decision-making:“These technologies allow us to track trends, understand damage, and make informed decisions, enabling proactive responses to groundwater flooding.”Strategically placed IoT-based sensors in wells provide real-time groundwater monitoring, enabling authorities to detect changes swiftly and respond to crises effectively.Beyond technology, community engagement is equally vital in addressing environmental risks. Encouraging women’s participation in community-driven initiatives and technical training programs could significantly enhance the design and implementation of localized solutions. Ms. Yasmin Alahmar, a geologist, emphasized the importance of raising public awareness:“Education and awareness are crucial for encouraging communities to use sustainable water management practices. Simple measures, such as adopting smart irrigation techniques orinstalling rainwater collection systems, can greatly contribute to addressing the challenges posed by climate change.”Building Local Capacity for Long-Term SolutionsStrengthening local capacity is at the heart of UNDP Libya’s approach. Training programs in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), IoT technology, and data analysis equip local experts to monitor and address environmental risks effectively.Dr. Sadeg underscores the importance of integrating modern tools "These initiatives showcased the potential of modern tools to address rising groundwater levels. By integrating these tools into our practices, we can create long-term solutions.”To maximize the impact of these initiatives, actively involving women in key training programs is critical. Their participation strengthens strategic planning and ensures the effective application of modern tools to address the crisis. Including women in policymaking further supports infrastructure upgrades to meet the diverse needs of communities.Collaborative efforts among government bodies, researchers, and local communities can bridge modern technology with traditional practices, fostering long-term solutions. Addressing outdated infrastructure, such as septic systems and wastewater treatment facilities, will further reduce contamination risks and enhance resilience.

Turning Challenges into OpportunitiesEfforts to address groundwater flooding in Zliten have sparked discussions on how this crisis could be transformed into an opportunity for sustainable development. Rising groundwater presents potential for agricultural use, such as creating artificial lakes for irrigation, paddy fields to grow semiaquatic crops, or exploring hydroponic farming techniques.Beyond agriculture, these environmental challenges offer urban planners an opportunity to innovate and design resilient infrastructure that integrates with the shifting geographical landscape. For instance, flood-prone areas could be transformed into public spaces, or even leveraged for tourism by incorporating earth cracks and water features. Additionally, the water could serve industrial purposes, such as cooling machinery in factories. These solutions can address environmental challenges and enhance urban planning to build more sustainable cities.

By identifying actionable solutions and harnessing the power of collective intelligence and technology, UNDP continues to work with local communities and international partners to explore innovative approaches to address disaster risk management. Together, we can turn this crisis into an opportunity for sustainable development, building resilience and ensuring a safer future for generations to come.
