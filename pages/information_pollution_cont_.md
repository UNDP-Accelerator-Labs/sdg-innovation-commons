## Title
****

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Information pollution digital Campaign experiment (Launch)
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that public trust in democratic institutions and mainstream media is eroding, unregulated internet platforms, the exploitation of information for political, ideological, and economic gains, and low public digital and media literacy have created a fertile ground for the proliferation of disinformation.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Information pollution, characterized by the dissemination of false, misleading, or manipulated content, is not a novel phenomenon, but it has gained heightened attention in recent times, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic &amp; recent political events in the region. While the internet has facilitated broader access to information, the spread of information pollution outpaces that of credible sources, undermining the public's ability to make informed decisions, engage in democratic processes, and foster inclusive, peaceful, and just societies. With the current situations in Sudan and specifically Gaza, there is a rise of citizen journalism as previously official "trusted" sources of news have shown clear biases and agendas skewed toward a specific narrative. Adding on top of that the increase of AI generated content, makes it even more important to increase people's awareness on how to engage with information online.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

With the different crises happening in Egypt and especially in the region, social media has been used as a critical tool for both access and spread of information. There has been a surge of citizen journalism, while at the same time a great distrust in official western news outlets.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The accelerator lab is able to test tools and methods that can inform the CO in a short period of time about the information landscape and capture important insights on how to build a bigger portfolio on the topic of information pollution in the Egypt context.

The challenge also requires more innovative approaches to engage people from different backgrounds on the topic and the accelerator lab is best positioned to take on that task and insure that future work from CO like bringing iverify to Egypt is well informed and contextualized before implementation

On the methodological level, running this campaign is supporting the in capturing learnings around running more targeted campaigns that not only share information with the public but also contextualizes and informs behavioral insights for future projects in different areas and topics.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Utilizing behavioral science and digital tools to enable individuals to identify, challenge, and counteract information pollution on social media.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How might we increase individuals awareness to identify and counteract information pollution on social media?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The tools help us learn about different approaches and ways to raise peoples awareness towards information pollution and it also helps us capture some behavioral insights on motivations around stopping the spread of info. pollution 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Data on the information landscape, general personas of information consumers based on basic demographic info and their information preferences.
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The work will benefit the work of the inclusive growth team in the CO who are interested in starting a group of works on the topic and have applied for TRAC 2 funding. It will also build on the collective work of acclabs on the topic since this experiment already leveraged the previous work of Acclab Sudan on the topic
