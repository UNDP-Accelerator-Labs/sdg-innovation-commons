## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

(1) There are many emerging gaps between the policymakers and people on the ground in understanding the impacts and implications of AfCFTA, particularly for hard-to-reach and marginalised groups including the informal sector, which makes those groups hard to take full advantage of AfCFTA.  (2) To bridge the gaps, we held small discussions to engage with the people and found it was effective in understanding the level of understanding and challenges of their everyday lives when trading goods as well as in explaining what AfCFTA is and how it might affect their businesses.   (3) A huge amount of industry and cross-border trading is happening, but they are not adequately captured due to their informality and hard-to-reach locations. Considering these, more focus is required on how to harness AfCFTA more user-friendly and beneficial to them, which is often not necessarily considered as important or neglected by policymakers and programmes/projects of UNDP.  (4) Cost of trading is more expensive within the region than between the continents owing to inadequate infrastructure and transportation network. People experienced difficulties to export their goods to other African countries and it was rather easier to export them to other continents such as Europe and North America. This may hinder the maximum use and potential of impacts that AfCFTA could bring to the continent.   (5) There is a need to work more closely with other players, organisations and other development partners who are already working in the areas, considering the fact that we were able to save an enormous amount of time in finding an entry point to the communities and ecosystem, particularly when we engage with whole new partners.

Video documentary and a photo reportage will be released early 2022. 

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

As we targeted to map implications of the AfCFTA from the perspectives of hard-to-reach and often marginalised groups, we experienced difficulties in both finding them and reaching them physically. We were able to find grassroots innovators, informal traders, etc. with the help of partners such as GIZ, Ghana Innovation Hub Network as well as word-of-mouth from people we met. On the other hand, the communities are often sparsely located which means a long distance from one community to another and poor infrastructure including rough road conditions made them even harder to reach. Those physical barriers would negatively affect their opportunities to be captured and addressed by policymakers. We also faced the challenge of communicating in local languages as it can be a key to building trust in each other and it could involve a significant degree of cultural sensitivity.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There is almost no data available given that AfCFTA is new and people we were trying to address (e.g., informal sector, rural, urban-poor, women, and cross-border communities) cannot be easily reached by surveys and/or online. The collected/generated data addresses the gap in understanding the impact and implications of AfCFTA from the perspective of the hard-to-reach. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

It was necessary for us to take an ethnographic, grassroots approach to fully immerse ourselves in the people and communities and sense the implications that AfCFTA may bring to people through their lived experiences. It enabled us to build trust with communities so that we could understand barriers and opportunities more deeply and touch a bit deeper part of the situation. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with Ghana Innovation Hub Network and Widows & Orphans Movement (WOM). We established the partnership with Ghana Innovation Hub Network and signed MOU. We identified and connected with some informal innovators through the Network. WOM is one of the innovators we filmed for the documentary. WOM shared their everyday experiences and their perspectives, expectations about AfCFTA as an entrepreneur. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We interviewed TAMA, a cosmetics company, and the founder of TAMA. We worked with them to understand from the shea butter value chain to the challenges and opportunities of AfCFTA from the perspective of one of successful companies. Not only a successful case, but we also engaged with small, micro informal enterprises to view AfCFTA from different angles. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ghana Enterprises Agency (GEA) is a government partner that supports MSMEs to grow. We worked with GEA in identifying enterprises both formal and informal for further discussions and sharing the ideas and landscape of the MSMEs’ ecosystem. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Civil Society Organisations and private sector partners mentioned above are the new and unusual partners for UNDP. They are special in terms of supporting us to connect with a wider group of innovators, particularly grassroots innovators, and to explore the AfCFTA from various dimensions. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

GIZ (Not a UN agency, but a development partner) helped us to connect with informal innovators and was instrumental in bridging partnership with Innovation Hub Network.
