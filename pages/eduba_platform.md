The rise of e-learning in the last decade has brought forth a range of solutions to provide high-quality education to people of all ages. Recent COVID lockdowns have inspired people all over the world to learn new skills at home using free and paid online courses. 
But today, the internet services and traditional methods of educational institutions in Iraq have proven to be a bottleneck in accessing e-learning services from home.


The Eduba educational management platform is the first platform that seeks to achieve a comprehensive digital transformation for educational institutions in Iraq. The 6-in-1 system includes:

1- Course management
2- Accounting
3- Human Resources Management
4- Evaluation and Assessment
5- E-learning
6- Video conferencing

In direct challenge to the traditional administration of universities in Iraq that rely on paper-based systems, Eduba is providing a comprehensive and secure virtual environment.
