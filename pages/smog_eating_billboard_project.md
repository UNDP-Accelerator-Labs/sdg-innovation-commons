> Type of the Solution

Technological/Environmental Innovation

> Affected Sector

Improve Air Quality

> Description of the solution

The Smog Eating Billboard project in Monterrey, developed by UDEM students with Daan Roosegaarde, applies photocatalytic coatings to billboards to purify urban air. This innovative approach cleans the air equivalent to the work of 30 trees every six hours and has the potential to significantly reduce air pollution in densely populated and visually polluted urban environments.

> Socio-economic effects

Improves urban air quality, enhances public health, and utilizes existing infrastructure for environmental benefits.

> Type of Measure

- 3. mitigation measures

> Type of sub-measure

- 1. active measures (direct measures for reduction of air pollution)

> Who led the solution

- private sector

> Timescale of implementation

- short-term (up to 1 year)

> Other Notes

The initiative is the successor of the The Smog Free Project by the same buro, executed in partnership with an educational institution.
