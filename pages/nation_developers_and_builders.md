NATION DEVELOPERS AND BUILDERS

> Brief description of the innovation

OVERVIEW
OUR INNOVATION
Global Vision for Change team have found innovative way that can help the nation to develop in the agriculture sector through investing in products that have huge market, some are ease to grow with less input, some may require adequate input but have huge market demand. This innovation will fill an untapped customer need. Ideally, our innovation builds a new market.
Our model of being innovative is likened to the definition of Wikipedia-Innovation is the practical implementation of ideas that result in the introduction of new goods or services or improvement in offering goods or services. ISO TC 279 in the standard ISO 56000:2020 [2] defines innovation as "a new or changed entity realizing or redistributing value". A common element in the definitions is a focus on newness, improvement, and spread of ideas or technologies. According to our model innovation will takes place through the development of more-effective ideas, processes, technologies and business models
Global Vision for Change Foundation strategically plans to invest in the following sectors. The innovation is in agriculture and specific ventures shall be made in the following areas
1.	Legumes(Growing common beans, soya, groundnuts)
2.	Goat Farming
3.	Fish Farming
4.	Piggery(pig value chains)
5.	Mushroom 
6.	Cassava
7.	Poultry(different types)
However the above cannot be achieved without dealing with the following constraints
1.	Capacity: Management capacity is an issue facing much production, value-adding and processing businesses in Zambia. Lack of knowledge and understanding of cultivation practices limits the potential for smallholder farmers to diversify into new crops.
Our vision: Developing and building the nation together with all stakeholders. This is to working with entrepreneurs that are members to the organization and to oversee their growth in both short and long term. Global Vision For Change is community of Companies working together for the common good of developing and building communities

REVENUE GENERATION
We are an organization with membership of 20 companies who have come together in order to develop and build the communities together. The members have individual ideas brought in the pool of innovative ideas in the managerial custody of Global Vision for change Foundation a Non Profit Making Organization acting as mother of all the other companies in order to carry out the innovative collective corporate collaboration. We have put in place means through a network that is made possible through the members of the organization to make enough revenues for the organization as well the companies and be able to pay workers and all statutory payments. The strength lies in doing things together and once we achieve this other business that are not in our network as long are close to our corporate community they benefit directly or indirectly.
TARGET MARKET
We are largely targeting DRC and chain stores in the country for most of the products and the general public in the community traditional markets. The products we have picked have ready market in Zambia and neighboring countries like DRC. 
BENEFIT OF RESOURCE HELP
The challenge prize will greatly and positively impact our community of companies with much needed resources and its members to grow the businesses which in turn will help communities grow their economies.
VALUE ADDITION
The pursuit for value addition is the factor for creating a successful business for the organization and its member companies we also endeavor to ensure that we are eco innovative to attain sustainable development.
Our policy is clear and eco-innovation is vital for delivering Strategy objectives. It is also key to delivering many aspects of the circular economy: industrial symbiosis or ecologies, cradle-to-cradle design and new, innovative business models. 
Our eco-innovation policy generally is aimed at helping businesses and consumers to reduce negative impact on the environment with a positive impact on the economy and society, aiming to:

Integrate eco-innovation in environmental and industrial policies, by focusing on its contribution to economic growth, job creation and industry competitiveness;

Ensure appropriate funding for market replication and demonstration projects, clusters and public-private partnerships, and networks implementing innovative public procurement;

Identify areas where standards and performance targets could have the biggest impact and to propose their development;

Promote global sustainable consumption and production patterns, technology transfer and exchange of best practices with developing and emerging economies to help European eco-innovators access international markets; and

Ensure that the labour force is equipped with the appropriate skills and knowledge to drive forward the green economy transition; and

> Technical Feasibility

Technically operational business is considered technically and operationally feasible if it has the necessary expertise, infrastructure and capital to develop, install, operate and maintain the proposed system, and that by establishing such a system, the business will be able to deliver goods or services at a profit.

Ours is a new innovation in a startup considering a new business, it is important us to consider if there is sufficient access to resources. One of the primary reasons as new business faces is lack of capital or resources enough to keep the our business going from startup until it starts to make a profit. 

•	We have in products chosen and production processes, capacity and raw material sources 
•	We have determined the quantity and quality of the products, labour needed
•	We have calculated the estimates of the total project cost and enumerated the major items of capital cost.
•	We have listed the estimated production and overhead costs that will go into operating the proposed project.
•	Take into consideration the major technological development in the industry which may affect the commercial or technical soundness of the project.

1. Hierarchy of objectives to develop a hierarchy of objectives as a basis for a prototype in which the strategic shortcomings of current farming systems are replenished 
2. Parameters and methods to transform the major objectives into multi-objective parameters and to quantify them subsequently, system technologies are selected which are assumed to contribute to achievement of the objectives 
3. Design of theoretical prototype and methods. The selected system technologies are linked to the parameters on which they have an impact. In this way, the major and minor technologies and the (conflicting) conditions to the technologies become visible. On basis of this analysis, the technologies are further designed -in a logical order and guided by the set of conditions- resulting in a consistent package, a ‘prototype’ 
4. Layout of prototype to test and improve Laying out the designed prototype on experimental or commercial farms to test and improve it in relation to the formulated objectives.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our Social Impact Assessment includes the processes of analyzing, monitoring and managing the intended and unintended social consequences, both positive and negative, of planned interventions (policies, programs, plans, projects) and any social change processes invoked by those interventions. 

The important feature of the said policy
•	The goal of our impact assessment is to bring about a more ecologically, socio-culturally and economically sustainable and equitable environment. Impact assessment, which will promote community development and empowerment, builds capacity, and develops social capital (social networks and trust).
•	The focus of our concern of SIA is a proactive stance to development and better development outcomes, not just the identification or amelioration of negative or unintended outcomes. Assisting communities and other stakeholders to identify development goals, and ensuring that positive outcomes are maximized, can be more important than minimizing harm from negative impacts.
impacts, the analysis of alternatives, and monitoring of the planned intervention.
•	GVFCF believes that good practice of SIA accepts that social, economic and biophysical impacts are inherently and inextricably interconnected. Change in any of these domains will lead to changes in the other domains.
•	While SIA is typically applied to planned interventions, the techniques of SIA will also be used to consider the social impacts that derive from other types of events, such as disasters, demographic change and epidemics.
