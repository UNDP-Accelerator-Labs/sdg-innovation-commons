## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Innovation experiments are successful when the "tester" (the receiving community) gains direct and immediate benefits from the process. For example; the success of the gardening technologies and hence the experiment itself is demonstrated by the fact that the gardens are operational one year after initial installation. Communities cite this success to the fact that the technologies are less labor intensive and easier to maintain than standard agricultural practices, and produced better quantity and quality of produce. In this case, the gains outweighed the effort required to pilot the technologies.

2. Experiment success depends on the innovation need. Example one; The innovative gardens were designed to utilize grey water. We (wrongly) assumed that given the low-income status of the pilot community,  water access would be problematic and therefore water recycling would be endorsed. A year after installing the gardens, it was found that a limited number of households used the "grey water recycling feature". Upon further analyses it was found that 67% of the participating households had access to piped water, 27% accessed natural water resources, 5% used water tankers, and just 0.85% used rain water harvesting. Given that most households had adequate access to water, there was no interest in recycling grey water. Perhaps in this case, where the need does not warrant the use, better information and knowledge sharing on the benefits of grey water recycling would have resulted in better uptake. Example 2:  A year after implementation, ~82% of installed gardens were still operational and supplying food to participating households and the community. When analyzing the socioeconomic status of the area, it was found that per household, there are large families - an average of 6.52 persons per home, and on average, 1.35 persons per household were employed. Based on this data, the gardens' were likely successful because they translated into household income through savings on grocery bills and transport to stores.

3. When testing an innovation, it is import to share the "why we do this" and not only the "what we are doing" with testers! Example - in the trench bed garden, a grey water drip system was used. The drip system purposely employed a pipe that, through the use of ring structures, reduced the flow rate of water to prevent flooding and water waste in the gardens. Some households felt that the low flow rate was a defect of the system, and removed the rings inside the pipe. Had the community known why the flow rate was reduced, this could have been avoided.

4. Another factor that contributed to the success of the experiment was early community buy-in. Community members provided input to the garden design and the livestock options of the project. They were also allowed to choose which garden and livestock types based on their personal preference. This gave community members a sense of ownership and accountability, and encouraged the use and maintenance of the gardens over the entire duration of the study. 

5. Natural scaling and enterprise development: Many participants reported having installed more gardens on seeing the benefit of the experimental installations. One participant, after having received 2 tower gardens and witnessing the improved quality and quantity of the produced crops, and having saved money from not having to buy food and travel to stores, decided to build an additional garden at his own cost with the intention to sell the harvested produce for income. Another participant who is living with a disability, had installed 2 additional gardens at his own cost citing that the garden designs were easy to use and maintain, and used small tools he could carry. A local day care center, having observed the gardens in the locality, requested a community member to build them their own vegetable gardens. The day care sourced all the required material at their own cost and the gardens are now supplementing the diet of the young children at the center. In terms of enterprise development; on average households harvested crops 2-3 times a week and about 34.3% of households sold surpluses at local markets. Some reported making around R50 to R200 extra per week, and others indicated an additional income of R1000 per month. Enterprise creation was observed more in urban then rural areas, as in rural areas many preferred to share their surpluses with neighbors. Indirectly, the gardens were built with locally available materials, and local suppliers of these materials also reported improved income and business growth.

6. Piloting should occur as early as possible during product development as it can result in low cost design modifications that can offer significant benefits. Example: Communities observed that the garden designs attracted livestock which eat and damage crops. To avoid this, communities installed fences/barriers directly onto the garden structure. Interestingly, CD's were hung around gardens to reflect light onto livestock which distracts and deters them from entering the garden. Such design considerations can improve product uptake later on.

7. Indirectly, social cohesion improved during the experiment. The quantity and frequency of crops harvested from the gardens, as well as the eggs produced by chickens was enough to feed participating families and  their neighbors. Many households donated their surpluses to the surrounding community. Additionally, the gardens piqued the interest of neighbors who often reached out to participating households to learn more about how they could get involved.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. As with many UNDP projects, there project time frame was restricted. To meet the targets that had been set, the project had to be implemented rapidly which left little room to focus on aspects such as M&E, capacity building, adequate data capturing, etc. Had more focus been placed on these aspects, more quantitative data would have been possible, and perhaps better experimental results.

2. More pre-research on the status of the community should have been done to ensure better results. For example, had it been known that water access was not an issue in the pilot community, perhaps another community should have been selected to ensure this garden feature was tested, or alternately, more time could have been spent educating users on water recycling so as to ensure uptake of this garden feature.

3. Poor record keeping prevented the generation of strong evidence: communities were not well equipped to keep record of details such as income savings, diet changes, water use, etc. Had this been done, the project team would have had stronger data to demonstrate experimental success.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The data types were chosen as these techniques strike a balance between having an ability to extract the required information but being simple enough to use considering the skill level of the community members.  Observation and focus groups served as key methods of data collection particularly because  community members, especially women, were shy and reserved when it came to responding to one-on-one questioning. Prototyping assisted in encouraging community participation in designing the interventions, which in turn provided a sense of ownership. The gaps addressed through these methods include providing information on local food production methods, socioeconoms status of the locality, pros and cons of current food production methods, challenges faced by locals to inform needs and design considerations, etc. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These innovation methods had the ability to provide the necessary data and input towards creating a food security solution that suited the needs of a community in need and one having little resources. Methods such as citizen science, crowdsourcing and co-creation provided deep insight into the needs, preferences, concerns and considerations of the targeted community for the innovations. Prototyping, pilots and MVPs were methods that enabled us to adapt the design based on the contextual needs, in an efficient manner. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Institute of Natural Resources (INR) - INR served as the key implementing partner. INR trained local community members to build the gardens and manage the livestock, they procured and supplied the necessary materials for the project, oversaw the project implementation and monitored the successes' and failures While not an official CSO, community members were also recruited as project facilitators. Their role, seeing that they are a part of the community, was to encourage others to participate in the project, keep an eye out to ensure project ran smoothly within localities, and importantly serve as the voice of the community. They were also trained of livestock and garden production, serving as the knowledge hub for communities. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

There were private sector small businesses who partnered with the project to supply the raw materials and livestock needed for the project implementation. Local small businesses were purposefully selected so as to promote the growth of their enterprises and improve economic gain within the targeted community. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The local municipalities in Kwa Zulu Natal were involved and provided community access points for certain localities. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The Community facilitators - their acceptance and belonging within the community gave them a certain "power edge" that promoted community involvement in the project. They served as local project champions, alleivating community concerns and airing their views. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

none
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The above methods created a Venn diagram effect, wherein jointly the methods generated data and conclusions which would not have been possible when employing these methods individually. By analysing the evidence from each method in parallel it was possible to draw rich findings that were more plausible.
