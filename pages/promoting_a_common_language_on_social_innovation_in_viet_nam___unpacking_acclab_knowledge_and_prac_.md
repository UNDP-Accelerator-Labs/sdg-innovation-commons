## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Promoting a common language on Social Innovation in Viet Nam - Unpacking AccLab knowledge and practices in local context
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that in Viet Nam there is a lack of common language and understanding of what constitutes innovation, particularly social innovation that’s linked with sustainable development. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The innovation narrative in Viet Nam started with Science and Technology angle, focusing on startups and high-tech companies. Nationally, this agenda has been driven by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), polytechnic universities like HUST focusing on the technical aspect of innovation, finding new and transfer technology from abroad.  Technical innovation tends to have a more robust literature background, but social innovation, on the other hand, is still emerging, there is a precedent of social innovation like tradition in historical and communist legacy, however, there has yet to be a common language that all agree on. This makes it difficult for actors and organizations to collaborate and achieve common objectives. We often used similar buzzwords but mean different things. Social issues are often complex and nuanced, hence the need for a common systematic framework to bring practitioners together.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab from the beginning has position itself as a place where social innovation meets sustainable development. As such we are in a unique and very good position to promote social innovation through sharing our experience and knowledge. The AccLab global Learning Network where Learning is valued, with a rich social innovator practitioners community, based especially in similar conditions (e.g: developing/South-South cooperation) can be highly relevant to developing's countries practitioners.  In Viet Nam, AccLab has already take following action to better position:  - Initiative to promote social innovation practices such as VALC,  NIC, FTU/DNES,  - Share knowledge and lesson learned through knowledge product. Currently through UNDP Website blogs, but can develop beyond based on institutional partners such as NEU/FTU to promote local understanding and application - Organize more Innovation bootcamp/showcase to transfer social innovation practices and know-how with local partners

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

What is and is not Social innovation can be a complex concept for many to wrap around. In Viet Nam, there is an emerging body of initiatives that are closely linked with social innovation, but not many have been able to articulate these efforts into a systematic framework.  Based on AccLab network experience, we wish to promote a common language and tools practitioners in Viet Nam can use in unpacking social innovation.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we create a common language, mainstreaming social innovation knowledge in a way that helps practitioners in Viet Nam collaborate better?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We aim to share, promote social innovation related tools and practices adapted to Viet Nam context in the hope of mainstreaming these knowhow with relevant organizations. Through sharing the rich experience and tools from AccLab network such as Nesta collective intelligence, AccLab innovation framework and more...

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There are relatively few data and literature in Vietnamese on the topic of Social Innovation. Most of what's available is through UNDP own effort in promoting social enterprise or social innovation through Lab network. We wish to address this gap by localizing international materials such as NESTA Collective Intelligence  Playbook adapted to Viet Nam's context and promoted as viable tools for local usage.
