> Technical Feasibility

The business is at a market entrance stage, we have been supplying some goat meat to our close clients who are families and friends. We have been doing this since last year July. This has helped us to have the real taste of the market and we have gotten feedback from our clients. We have been operating below our potential because we do not have enough financial capacity to reach the huge demand in the industry. We have managed to raise $800 which we used to buy the farm where will be keeping our goats. We have also secured a friendly butchery where we will be doing packaging from, this came as a result of the quality meat that we have been supplying to them but in low quantity. our greatest achievement is having ‘ready to buy customers’ who complain when we don’t supply meat to them.
