Edutainment Movies of Change for and by Refugees
The Nakivale Refugee Settlement in Uganda is home to 100,000 people. Many went through traumatic experiences and life in the camp can be tough and opportunities for entertainment are few.
Tucheke Movies Production creates Edutainment Films with and for refugees about sensitive topics and struggles in the camp such as Alcoholism, Sexual Exploitation, Human Rights, Access to Economic Opportunities, etc.
