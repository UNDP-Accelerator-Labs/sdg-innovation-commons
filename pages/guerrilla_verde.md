> Description

The beginning of the initiative was due to the lack of food during the pandemic, where we began to support the women in charge of the popular pots, providing knowledge, supplies and workforce for the realization of their gardens. Over time we saw and experienced the enthusiasm of the children and other families in the communities and decided to work with more people, not just with the popular pots. Thus, managing to train more than 50 women from the north and south bathed communities and places in the interior of the country.
