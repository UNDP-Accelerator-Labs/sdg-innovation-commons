Introduction of alternate business during COVID-19 for long-term sustainability of business.

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?



During COVID-19 outbreak, most of the restaurants in Dhaka were closed. The restaurants in Bashundhara Shopping Mall (one of the prominent shopping mall in the capital) were closed for 88  days. Consequently, around 80% staff moved to the village. 


In the case of a restaurant, it was found that there were 16 staff in total among whom 13 staff migrated to their local area. Observing the potential of long-term effect of COVID, the restaurant owner was worried and thinking about how he can save the qualified staff and at the same time continue his business in the crisis situation. 


After a few days, he started an alternate restaurant at comparatively a remote area where the infection was lower but the demand of foods was higher. He employed 10 of his staff who were experienced and qualified at the new restaurant and continued the business. 


This alternate business helped him to,
- continue earning
- sustain his business amid the pandemic
- maintain the livelihood of his staff
- hold the experienced staff
- made the restaurant confident to fight against a global crisis
- continuing teamwork.


After around 3 months when the COVID situation improved a bit, he was able to return to the previous business at the same shopping mall in Dhaka while may of his fellow colleagues lost their business.


His alternate business helped him to return to his previous business; save the qualified staff and save the lives of those staff and their respective families.
