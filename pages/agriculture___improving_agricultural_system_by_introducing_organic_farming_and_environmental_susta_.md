> Title of the innovation

Agriculture;  improving agricultural system by introducing organic farming and environmental sustainability to all the  farmers

> Brief description of the innovation

Introduction of organic agriculture will make positive contribution to the long term environmental sustainability in many ways. If introduced to all farmers has lots of benefits due to the fact that it's cheap and will gradually eliminate the use of artificial fertilizers and synthetic pesticides both of which can be toxic to many soil micro organisms. This will promote crop rotation and biodiversity and therefore increase the yield of the farm produce, on the other hand produce more raw materials for industries.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income for the under privileged in rural and urban areas. When production is high the market for produce will be high and diversity of crops will be available for consumption. This in turn will improve soil fertility and promote good healthy and a good stardard of living.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed to improve the agricultural system and gradually do away with artificial fertilizers. The implementation plan should be taken by the government and civil society organization for it to be a successful.

> Anticipated Social Impact
