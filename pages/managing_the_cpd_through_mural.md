> [Hypothesis: IF ... THEN ...]

IF information on CPD is transferred to an alternative way of communication -a Mural- THEN it will be easier to make sense and give coherence to the big amount of information on the CPD regarding the systemic strategy of UNDP towards attaining human and sustainable development.

> [Description of the experiment methodology]

For this experiment an inductive analysis was employed through 4 main steps. (1) First we read the CPD in detail in order to identify cause and effect relationships implicitly stated on each paragraph. We considered as "cause" those elements linked to any expected result or effect, including lines of action. As "effect" we considered those elements that are expected to happen in consequence of a cause. It is important to note that some cause and effect relationships are bounded. In other words, some causes have effects which are also causes of other ulterior effects. That is why the categorization of an element as a cause or an effect was given by context and was not by any means absolute. (2) We grouped the cause and effect relationships found according to similarities perceived among the lines of action. From this iterative grouping process a pattern emerged which let us rank the lines of action from those more oriented towards institutional strengthening to those most oriented towards society strengthening, passing through institutional and society coordination. This pattern is not the only one possible, however, it is the one that let us make sense of all the information analyzed. (3) We proposed labels to name the groups of cause and effect relationships. Three main groups were identified, each one having other subgroups. (4) On the basis of the aforementioned main groups a general hypothesis was proposed with three additional derived hypothesis (this will be presented on the results).

- Low risk

> [Key results]

Through the analysis we identified one central hypothesis and three derived hypothesis about UNDP's intended contributions towards development based on the lines of action proposed on the CPD. The central hypothesis identified is: 1. (x1) strong institutions, (x2) institutional coordination, and (x3) strong society influence positively on (y1) development. [x1 + x2 + x3 = y1] From the central hypothesis, three additional hypothesis are derived: A. (x1) Procedures, (x2) technical abilities, (x3) knowledge management, and (x4) technology contribute to (y1) strenghtening institutions. [x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = y1] B. (x1) inter-institutional mechanisms, (x2) mechanisms among national and local level institutions, and (x3) mechanisms among local institutions contribute to (y1) effective institutional coordination C. (x1) dialogue mechanisms, (x2) citizenship participation, (x3) economic empowerment, and (x4) social inclusion contribute to (y1) strong society

> [Key insights]

We consider that this analysis might be useful to make sense of the CPD through a way which is easy to remember and repeat. This can be useful to socialize and help appropriate the CPD both at an internal level in the country office and also at external levels including audiences that are not experts on development topics. On the other hand, from the Accelerator Lab standpoint, this analysis lets us identify more clearly which are some of the assumptions or mechanisms used on the lines of action that can be tested through experiments. Also, this analysis is linked to our learning cycle on knowledge management, letting us learn whether this kind of analysis helps to understand and give coherence to the huge amount of information on the UNDP's systemic strategy to contribute on human sustainable development gathered on the CPD.

> [Notes on the methodology after its use]

As noted on the design, since this analysis was an inductive process it is important to keep in mind that other patterns may be possible.

> [Time it took to implement]

Approximately 3 weeks.

> [Follow up]

We shared the results with the Monitoring and Evaluation Officer at the country office. Right now we have ongoing meetings to discuss it, examine it, answer questions, validate it and identify opportunities to test its usefulness.

> [Name of the portfolio of experiments]

Knowledge management

> [Frontier challenge and learning question]

How to appropiate development knowledge? What makes it easier to base decisions and behaviors on existing knowledge?
