> Title of the innovation

The name of the innovation is entitled as Biochar proccessing out of agricultural waste product, this is the Agriculture based innovation that aims at addressing food shortage  by applying intervention that will manipulate the soil thereby making it conduisive for growing variety of crops with little expenses on input such as fertilizers.

> Brief description of the innovation

Fisrt and fore most I shall briefly decribe what bichar is all about.
Biochar is a carbon rich material obtained from thermochemical conversion (slow, intermediate, and fast pyrolysis) of biomass in an oxygen-limited environment. It can be produced from a range of feedstock, including forest and agriculture residues, such as straw, nut shells, rice hulls, wood chips/pellets, tree bark, and switch grass.The importance of these wastes for the production of biochar is an efficient way to turn waste to useful and value-added substance
Biochar has been described as a possible tool for soil fertility improvement, potential toxic element adsorption, and climate change mitigation. Indeed, several studies have shown that biochar application to soil can improve soil physical and chemical properties, enhance plant nutrient availability and correlated growth and yield, increase microbial population and activities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through Carbon sequestrion. Its impact as soil amendment enhances soil quality and plant growth with increased crop yield. Although, biochar resource, production process, soil type and condition as well as the type of crop to be planted could influence its effectiveness. Production of biochar ranges from the small scale using a cooking stove to large scale using pyrolysis system.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With the background information being given , this will help to reduce the dependancy ratio among the  citizens and youth from the Government. It shall enable me and other volunteer youth to take keen interest in the Agriculture sector , which is on the fast risung phase.
 As such it shall help me and other farmers around Zambia to have technical skills on how to make synthetic fertilizerz. When everything else is done  Biochar shall be introduced to local farmers  these shall greatly be beneficiaries of the information that I shall pass on to them. 
There basically two ways in which I shall raise income by selling out my ideas with prospective farmers like I earlier  stated above. Anotherway in which I shall generate income is by cartying out this all exercise by myself  and look for a piece of land where I can demonstrate my skill and use it to grow some crops like soya beans. My current location is Lusaka but there is some bare family land in Mpika in in the Northern region of Zambia. The land is enough about 27hectare can be manipulated by my innovation to produce more crops with my innovation.

> Technical Feasibility

The design of the experiment will be made possible by means of  creating a kiln this shall be used in the proccessing of Biochar A kiln is a metal like medium that am going to use for Biochar production it is made by means of metal fabrication  in line with Biochar occurrence on topsoil has a substantial outcome on the natural surroundings, depth, porosity, affected texture, structure, consistency and all through the process of altering the pore-size distribution, surface area, packings, particle size distribution and bulk density. It, however, changes the features of soil, which directly affects the growth of the plant. Biochar existence has an effect on permeability, the reaction of soil to water, swelling shrinking, its aggregation and soil-preparation workability reaction to temperature variations. It alters soil physical nature, triggering an increase in the total specific surface area of the soil, which definitely increases the aeration and structure of the soil. Biochar stimulates the workings of mycorrhiza fungi.

> Anticipated Social Impact

As earliear illustrated this innovation will help improve the production of crops. It has a direct benefit to the livelihood of our peopel by means of increasing or rather making food readily available for our people.
In the rural areas for example where the cost of living is percieved to be high, the cost of living can be further scaled down by bringing an alternative to the high cost of chemical fertilizers. 
While in the urban areas like Lusaka the intervetion of biochar as it aims at identitying polluted areas of residues of charcoal and sugarcane residue that are a major source of pollution our major cities today.
