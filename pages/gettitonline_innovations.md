> Anticipated Social Impact

In cities like ours, people have to compromise due to the small shops and a limited variety of products and services available locally. Traditional brick and mortar shops and conventional commerce is not able to satisfy customers in terms of variety. Normally people have to visit 5 to 6 grocery stores in 1 market to purchase 1 type of product, color, price or design problem, etc. And it’s tough for retailers to provide all the variations. That’s why eCommerce is important. It brings in more variety by expanding the boundaries of traditional commerce.

People can visit more than one website that has different vendors selling the same  product but with different prices and sizes in a few minutes, at the same time offering online presence to small business. which is far more convenient than visiting 5 different shops. They can check colors, offers, sizes, models and various details related to the product. And it takes 20 to 30 minutes to decide. With the traditional retail method, you need to spend the whole day if you decide to shop for specific products or anything else at the Mall. That’s why I believe that eCommerce is important to provide a variety of products with speed and that too at home.
