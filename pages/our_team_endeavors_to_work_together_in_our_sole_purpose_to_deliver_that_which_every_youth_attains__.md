> Title of the innovation

Our team endeavors to work together in our sole purpose to deliver that which every Youth attains for and we believe if a team is empowered crimes which results from unemployment and luck of empowerment can be reduced there by creating a conducive environment for all.I thank you.

> Brief description of the innovation

Our innovation is generally based on our abilities as a corrective towards enriching our goals in becoming financially stable.We also endeavor towards making sure we utilize every opportunity such as this one so as to be empowered and uplifted in our dreams.
We also want to develop our ideas so us to glow our global dream towards glowing our goals in sensitizing our environment on the effects of climate change,Health issues, tourism and energy, we believe this can only be achieved if adequate measures are implemented and needed resources are made available. 
We believe many have not been educated on several matters e.g health issues like STDs which are destroying many.
Our goal is also to educate people of climate change and make them aware the negative impacts it brings to the environment. 
In conclusion we would like to reaffirm our commitment towards educating, sensitizing and developing our world with ideas and we welcome any idea so long as it is part our ambition.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We believe by educating and sensitizing people on these measures we will be able to generate income to grow our innovation, through engaging the government through the ministry of Sports and youth development, engage the NGO'S and also our members will be able to develop skills such as artworks, music and crafts to generate income so as to keep our team running.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation is designed in a centralized manner so as to avoid conflict of ideas, we have a team of leaders in charge of Health matters,another team responsible for climate change among others.This team works independently bearing in mind the aim of our innovation. In us much as they work separately we develop one idea out of that .
Currently we do not have a Prototype, however we have a team assigned working on a project for a Range Rover discovery tagged 2023,with unlimited resources available our prototype may slightly delay but will be ready soon.
Our innovation has and will achieve this through partnership and other well wishers who will be able to work with us.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We believe our innovation can improve the lives of others through our team work approach, resolute thinking and always be there when need arises.
Proposed innovation is relevant to the current market,as it does not require so much expenditure but resolute thinking, we are aware of the current economic deficits but we believe we can improve the markets through our corrective ideas.
