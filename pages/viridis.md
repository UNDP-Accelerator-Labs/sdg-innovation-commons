VIRIDIS, consists of the making of tote bags by women in focus in the north, rural areas but also in the south to minimize poverty and allow women to have an income and promote financial independence, which takes us to a standard of living better. These tote bags have a cultural social impact but also environmental, i.e. in the sense that these bags will be made for large surfaces to minimize the use of single-use bags. https://web.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100027452456406
