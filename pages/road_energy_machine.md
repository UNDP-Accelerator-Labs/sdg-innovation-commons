> Brief description of the innovation

The Road Energy Machine is a mechanical machine that uses roads to generate electricity from moving vehicles passing on the road surface. The machine makes this possible by converting the weight and speed of vehicles passing on the road into electricity. The machine needs to be installed on the road and blend in with the road surface. It has the primary mechanical storage system that enables it to continue supplying electricity even after the number of vehicles have reduced. One machine if located on the busy road such as Lumumba road can generate over 1Megawatts of power. Unlike solar, the this kind of a machine can generate electricity for more than 18 hours a day and since it does not rely on water, its not affected by things such as climate change.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We will be selling electricity generated either direct to the consumers or to the power utility companies such as ZESCO and some of the income will be coming from selling the machines as single units.
The electricity generated will be used to power houses, street lights and near by businesses.
Our target markets its busy cities such as Lusaka. These machine have the capacity to make cities self reliant.
So far we have held talks with Andrew Kamanga from Western Power who has shown interest in being our early adopter.
This kind of technology is environmental friendly as it does not produce any harmful gasses. As the demand for more cleaner energy sources due to climate change, this is the way to go.

> Technical Feasibility

The machine is designed in form of a shipping container. It has a road like surface on top which blends in with the road. The machine has has internal components which are designed to convert the weight and speed of moving vehicles into electricity as an end product. It is designed with safety features making it highly reliable.
So far we have a small 500 watts prototype and a patent from PACRA. 
To installed the machine on a certain point of the road, a small hole equivalent to the size of the machine to be installed is excavated on the busy road. 
The machines can either work as a stand alone or as a network of more than one.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The machine will make electricity cheap and highly accessible. This will surely improve the live hood of the users because an access to affordable electricity can make any community very productive.
