✾ The first environmental community group in Jordan led by Jordanian women👩🏻‍💼.

Eco Youth Jordan is the first environmental community group in Jordan led by women from Jordan and has recently grown to include females from Canada and China. It was established in the rural city of Ajloun where environmental awareness was close to non-existent. We aspired to change this statement across the country by creating a team, that consists of females who share a passion for protecting our fragile planet, and who strive to be the voice of women in the fields of agriculture and water.
