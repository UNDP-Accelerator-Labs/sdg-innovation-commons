> Description of the solution

Satellites and Artificial Intelligence for the development of agricultural geoservices (land-crops-water) for the production of agricultural data (Crops and Water) and land (parcellization) and the monitoring of irrigation: Demo Project in the Oum Er Rbia Basin. The project is part of the exploitation of new generations of Time-series of satellite images with high and very high spatial resolutions, WaPOR databases developed by FAO and Deep Learning algorithms for the automatic delimitation and agricultural management of plots, in particular the automatic recognition of crops, monitoring of water needs and drought monitoring.
