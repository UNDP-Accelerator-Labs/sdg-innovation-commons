> Title of the innovation

WaNate's Academic  and Business Consultancy Centre

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation will provide both academic and business Consultancy to individuals as well as well as groups. Taking into account that most Universities have gone digital in offering their services,  which most learners were not prepared for,  the Consultancy firm will enhance the students learning experience by providing support in their academic journey through tutorials and coaching. For the business Consultancy aspect,  the firm will provide assistance to start-up businesses in the preparation of business plans and proposals.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will enable students to complete their studies timely as they will be well prepared for the examinations and not repeat courses. The provision of the academic support will be offered at a fee. Aside from that, so many women in my community join associations such as village banking groups with the hope of accessing financial capital for their businesses,  but I have noticed that they have difficulty in selecting or developing viable business plans and further sustaining their business,  the Consultancy firm will provide them with training at a  fee so that they are able to make informed investment decisions. Other graduates that are academically grounded can be a part of the firm thus creating more employment.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed to offer Consultancy services,  therefore its implementation will not be only in a permanent location but the services will also be offered remotely so as to accommodate as many clients as possible.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will likely bring forth youth and women empowerment through the creation of a highly skilled labour force from the university graduates as well as the creation of employment and knowledge of viable investment planning for the women.
