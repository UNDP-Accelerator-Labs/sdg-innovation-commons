## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Engaging citizens and institutions in core national development processes.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge statement is that: we create an enabling environment for citizens and insitutions involvement and ownership in national development processes that our country office is spearheading in the country.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Can we redesign the way we create, implement, and monitor our public planning strategies and plans? Can we get citizens, national institutions, organizations, and movements, excited and engaged in national development planning processes and their formulation? These are the core questions we asked ourselves, as the UNDP team in Skopje, North Macedonia that started working on supporting our institutions in the development of a 20-year national development strategy for the country. Today we are at a point in the process, where the government of our country has adopted the co-created methodological approach, following a systems approach, one that sees this strategy as a living document, and a framework for experimentation and learning, recognizing the need to formulate the strategy in a comprehensive inclusive process. As an integral part of this process, we developed several avenues that will ensure citizens engagement, participation, and ownership in the creation of the vision for the country. One of those avenues has been an exercise in collective imagination, the ‘Dream Labs’, a series of 30 visioning workshops thought the country where more than 1000 citizens were constructing the vision for our country, and the capabilities needed for its fulfillment.

> 

For our frontier challenge of ‘good governance’ there are many data sources that support the need for interventions in the realm. For instance, North Macedonia has been ranked as a ‘partly free country’ by Freedom House in 2020  and ranks 111th on the Transparency International Index of Corruption raking on the lowest position in the country’s history. Moreover, a recent study by the National Democratic Institute showed that the level of public trust in our public institution, suggesting a lack of confidence in the political and governing leadership in the country. The situation is even more complex now with the ongoing pandemic, the socio-economic impact it has on the country, as well as other emergencies we are facing. This only highlights the added urgency for a change in the approach our public policies are developed, implemented and monitored. If we want the system to create long term policies that will tackle the challenges in unemployment, environment, social affairs etc. we need the public to trust the process, be part of the process, be able to learn about the progress of the implementation of those policies and its implementation.

> 

The public discourse in North Macedonia is fairly divisive and polarized, our country is young democracy and we are still learning the ropes of many processes, including how to build national policy documents that will overshoot the mandate of a sitting government, or how to include citizens, academic, organizations and movements together with national institutions in a systemic manner to collaborate and create these processes together from inception to delivery.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab Team is ensuring three things in this process: we are channeling innovation in the design and the formulation of the core national planning processes; we ensure a holistic approach through working interdisciplinary on the matter, and we are working directly with citizens, organizations and movements to ensure their participation and involvement in the process. Furthermore, when working with citizens, the Acceleration labs team ensures that all unusual suspects are involved in the core national process, such as innovators, startups, students, alumni programs representatives, academics not included in the process. etc

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Getting citizens involved and excited about national development policies.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can we redesign the way we develop, implement and monitor our national strategic planning documents?   Supporting learning questions: Can we enable citizens and institutional engagement in core national development processes?,  Can we incorporate and promote new models of development in our public discourse?   Can we create a system of partnerships and knowledge sharing and that would enable transformative practices and policies to take place? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are using co-creation as a tool between institutions-citizens to design, formulate and implement core national development processes. The NDS process, is a societal foresight exercise, and through the 'Dream Labs' we are trying to ensure that the visioning of citizens is embedded in the development of this document. We are experimenting with crowdsourcing to get citizens aware and engaged in one of the areas where the NDS is focusing on: and that is water & management.  Finally the methodological approach that we are using is built on system thinking and the need to have participatory design in these processes.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

With addressing these data gaps we hope to achieve two things: i) get new valuable information that will inform the process, ii) get people involved and excited about these processes.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

If we prove that public policymaking can be done in a different way than the dominant and prescribed doctrine, we can locate the champions in our country that made the change possible (giving us a map of early adopters and enablers in the ecosystem of public policymaking) and encourage this kind of methodology and process [one that is inclusive and with early engagement of different stakeholders] for the purposes of developing other strategic processes as well.
