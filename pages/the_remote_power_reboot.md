> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

In general case, for remote actions we see in the movies it is all about connected houses. Some households in Africa and most part of the world are wasting energy just because the owner forgot to switch off the power before leaving the place. In France, Out of 250,000 annual fires, 80,000 are of electrical origin. 40% of the victims are children under 9 years old.  So to avoid such kind of problem and taking in consideration that power is very expensive ressource that should be well managed, here is a proposition of Power management with a GSM mobile phone. all you need is to send an SMS of instruction that is going to enable the requested action. So if you have to switch off any electrical component remotely, and you just have GSM coverage, this is yours!
