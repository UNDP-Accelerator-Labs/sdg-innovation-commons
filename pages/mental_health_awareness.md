> Title of the innovation

Mental health awareness

> Brief description of the innovation

Mental health is poorly recognized and as such people due to lack of knowledge on mental illnesses fail to seek treatment for themselves and their loved ones at different clinics and hospitals. Some people seek help instead from traditional leaders. Sometimes people would want to seek treatment for mental illnesses but because of fear of being laughed at and stigmatized they fail to do so. This innovation is aimed at raising mental health awareness for mental illnesses and also reduce stigma towards people with mental illnesses and their families.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Health care workers especially those that specialise in mental health and psychiatry should be deployed. Once these are deployed, they'll then help and work with other health care workers in  the management of mentally ill patient both as inpatient and out patient. Also, these will also help in raising mental health awareness among people, young and old.

> Technical Feasibility

In my opinion, in different communities today, community mental health workers  and those that have done mental health and psychiatry courses should be deployed in different hospital and clinics especially in villages. It is true that there are hospitals that offer mental health services apart from chainama hills college hospital in different places around the, but at these hospitals only departments of psychiatry exist e.g at UTH, Ndola teaching hospital, chipata central hospital e.t.c But people especially those in villages have difficulties in going to these hospitals for treatment and also reviews, hence the increase in numbers of relapses among mentally ill patient. 
  Mental health awareness can be done by means of mental health  sensitization. This sensitization should be not only on mental illnesses but also substance abuse which can be done through radio and television programs, community mental health sensitization especially in communities that are very far from local hospital. Every year on 10 October it's mental health day, the month before the mental health day can be used to raise awareness. But this does not mean that the mental health awareness ends with this years mental health day, even after it should go on.
The ministry of health can work together with the private sector as well NGOS in working towards raising mental health awareness and help reduce the stigma of mentally ill patient and their families.

> Anticipated Social Impact

There are alot of mental illnesses and disorders that exists, by way of mental health awareness, people will be helped to know the causes, effects and management of mental illnesses. The mental health awareness will also help people know how they can recognize people with mental illnesses, where they can seek help from and how they can help Caring for them. Also people nowadays especially the youth are abusing drugs for different reasons without knowing the effects these drugs have on their bodies. The mental health awareness program will lead to people having knowledge about mental illnesses and substance abuse, I believe these will help people seek treatment and will reduce stigma. The stigma towards mental illnesses is due to lack of knowledge on mental illnesses and because people believe in myths such as witchcraft to cause mental illnesses. With the mental health awareness program, people will be helped to know more about mental illnesses. Apart from the general public, health care workers will also be helped to know about mental illnesses and how to care for mentally ill patients. I believe this is so because the stigma towards mental health is not only in the general public but also among health care workers e.g general nurses, clinical officer generals, doctors e.t.c
