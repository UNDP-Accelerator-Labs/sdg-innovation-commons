The software firm Heliant has developed a software product designed to analyze and visualize health data from a variety of sources. The goal is to use the tools in the field of business intelligence and data visualization, to raise the efficiency of the management of health care institutions as part of managing the pandemic. The product is compatible with data coming from the Heliant Health Health Information System, which is used in more than 200 health care institutions in Serbia, in 85 percent of primary health care institutions and more than 70 percent of secondary and tertiary health care institutions, including and those on the front line of response to COVID-19: the Clinical Center of Serbia and its 22 clinics, including the Clinic for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, the Clinical Hospital Center "Dr Dragisa Misovic", the Clinical Hospital Center Zvezdara. In addition, HA is fully adapted for the import and processing of data from other health information systems and in the rest of the state administration, the Ministry of Health and the Republic Health Insurance Fund according to defined formats and protocols. The idea is to enable the institutions that need it the most to use this tool.
