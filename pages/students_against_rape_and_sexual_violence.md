Student Community against Rape and Sexual Violence (SCaRSV) is an organisation founded by A B M Mahmodul Hasan in 2015, which aims to protect the rights of women and girls across Bangladesh. "I was born with male privilege," says Mahmodul. "I wanted to do something to break the gender bias, and an incident of rape at TSC in 2014 was a wake-up call for me." Soon, he gathered students and organised a parade to stand up for the rape victim until justice prevails. The incident inspired him to take a firm stance against rape and sexual violence, leading to the formation of SCaRSV. SCaRSV organises different road parades, protesting against sexual violence and gender discrimination. It also initiated the project, 'Raise Human, Bring Light', reaching out to educational institutions in different districts. It included running awareness programmes at educational institutions against rape and sexual violence, operating a quick response team for any kind of violence against women all over the country, as well as a 24/7 hotline for helping victims from all corners of Bangladesh. Under this project, SCaRSV continues to provide law and technical support as well as raise social awareness across social media. So far, they have reached 850 educational institutions. Furthermore, SCaRSV plans to mark unsafe roads for women, showing where CCTV cameras are absent around the city, under their project 'Safe City for Women'.
