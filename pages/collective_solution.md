## Title
****

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Collective Solution (Needs analysis of PWD’s)


## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Amputated persons of 2023 Kahramanmaras, Türkiye earthquakes are in need of special attention for their quick reintegration with the economic life.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



An early treatment model for the rehabilitation of the 2023 Kahramanmaras, Türkiye earthquake victim amputees was developed and tested on 20 PWD to prevent long-term disabilities. One of the main burning needs was to offer them solutions to enable their economic integration. Employment opportunities in the close proximity of the unemployed PWDs and the necessary skill sets needed for their employability will be explored. This can lead to a project proposal for the donors for the delivery of trainings in business branches that require craft and technical skills.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

There is no official figure for the number of amputated persons of 2023 Kahramanmaras, Türkiye earthquakes and there are efforts to estimate the numbers which ranges from 50,000 to 200,000 persons. This action will not consider the number of people, rather look into potential jobs and the necessary skill sets needed for the employability of physically challenged persons in their localities. The number of businesses and the potential jobs for the employability of the PWDs will be identified as a part of this activity. The study will also identify the skills sets required for those jobs.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

The amputated persons of the 2023 earthquakes are in special need to sustain their economic activity. Some of them are capable to continue their former jobs as soon as their medical and psycho-social support needs are addressed. However, some of them have developed incapabilities due to their conditions and will need to be supported to be employed in their locations. This study will conduct an assessment in the earthquake affected zones to ease their employability to benefit both the victims of earthquakes and also businesses who lost labour force as a result of the disaster.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



There is not an effective mechanism in the country that considers the needs of amputated persons for their economic and social integration. AccLab had developed a model for their rehabilitation in 2023. One of the outcomes of that work was to focus on their needs beyond medical and psycho-social support. This activity will help create awareness for the economic condition of the victims and offer practical solution for their quick adaptability to economic life. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Amputated persons of 2023 Kahramanmaras, Türkiye earthquakes are in need of special attention for their quick reintegration with the economic life.
