Solid Rain (Lluvia Sólida) is a potassium-based, degradable, non-soluble, and non-toxic granular powder that, upon contact with water, expands and is capable of adsorbing up to 400 times its weight in water, *depending on the type of soil, water quality, climate, plant, etc. It is placed at the root and keeps it hydrated without irrigation or rain. It can be used for plants, crops, trees, gardens, pots, hydroponics, vegetables, etc. The plants will take in moisture according to their needs, ensuring stable and healthy growth, reducing irrigation frequencies, and taking advantage of and optimizing rainwater.

With water availability becoming increasingly difficult, Solid Rain aims to reduce water extraction for agriculture. It allows irrigation or rainwater to be used and made more efficient. It also reduces the risk of loss due to lack of water by reducing the frequency of irrigation by up to 90%.
