BROILER FARMING AND POULTRY EGG FARMING BUSINESS. Poultry farming is a very lucrative and established business. Many people  are doing this business in both small scale and commercially for making profits. Generally, the poultry birds which are raised for meat production is called "BROILER". So, broiler poultry farming means "raising meat chicken or other poultry birds for the purpose of meat production". Broilers are just like other common poultry birds. Scientists have developed broiler specifically for producing meat in a short period of time. That’s why broilers are raised mainly for meat production.

> Brief description of the innovation

BROILER POULTRY FARMING
OBJECTIVE: Meat chicken Farming Business 
Broiler poultry farming is a very lucrative and established business. Many people are doing this business in both small scale and commercially for making profits.

Generally, the poultry birds which are raised for meat production is called ‘broiler’. So, broiler poultry farming means ‘raising meat chicken or other poultry birds for the purpose of meat production’.

Broilers are just like other common poultry birds. Scientists have developed broiler specifically for producing meat in a short period of time. That’s why broilers are raised mainly for meat production.

The term ‘broiler’ is mostly used for a meat producing chicken. But actually, any chicken that is used, bred and raised specifically for meat production purpose.

Today, most of the commercial broilers reach slaughter weight between 4 and 7 weeks of age. Although, the slower growing breeds reach slaughtering weight at approximately 14 weeks of age.

Most of the broilers that we see today have white feathers and yellowish skin. Modern commercial broilers (such as Cornish crosses and Cornish-Rocks) are artificially selected and bred for large-scale, efficient meat production.

They are noted for having very fast growth rates, a high feed conversion ratio, and low levels of activity.

Most of the modern commercial broilers are bred to reach a slaughter weight of about 2 kg in only 5 to 7 weeks. Some slow growing free-range and organic strains have been developed which reach slaughter weight at 12 to 16 weeks of age.

Due to extensive breeding selection for rapid early growth and the husbandry used to sustain this, broilers are susceptible to several welfare concerns, particularly skeletal malformation and dysfunction, skin and eye lesions and congestive heart conditions.

Management of ventilation, housing, stocking density and in-house procedures must be evaluated regularly to support good welfare of the flock.[1]

Today, producers are using many advance technologies and system for raising broilers. Therefore i and my brothers took this opportunity to make some extra profits.

Although this is not enough and how far we want our business to be, me and my colleges intend to expand our business into "poultry egg farming". It is a kind of business which involves the production of eggs to meet the daily nutrition for our families, communities and our country at large. For reference purposes i have attached some files showing how to go about the egg farming business.

Our prayer is that we get picked on this wonderful innovation challenge call sponsored by different organisations. Moreover once we stand a chance under agricultural practice of zambia it will be such a great honor for us to fully carry out our business plan on a large scale commercially and diligently without fail.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Poultry farming today is a huge business that is split into several operations including hatcheries, pullet farms for meat production, or farms for egg production.

The poultry industry provides a good employment opportunity for the society such as sales management, advertising, transport and people to do the work at the poultry along with agricultural activities. The poultry entrepreneurs are very much concentrated in utilizing the farm optimally enriching maximum output through selling the eggs and other allied products like feathers, gunny bags and poultry litters etc.

Poultry farming business is highly profitable if it is properly run under the acceptable methods. Each type of livestock farming, poultry included, follows specific operational principles if they must run profitably, but when such principles are ignored by the farm authority, it causes in serious losses.

The over motivation for starting our business is to gain profit. It has become unfortunate. However, many poultry farmers don’t take the time to want to learn why some poultry farmers become failed. It is widely known that most poultry farmers have been forced out of business when they could not be able to operate business profitably. To gain success in the project of poultry farming, a lots of works are involved. According to the expert, “it is not for a lazy man’s business”.

This an employment opportunity for many youths out there who feel they have no jobs 
Our target market: complexs, shopping malls, small retail outlets and markets etc.
The value addition of innovation on environment it will therefore reduce in the buying goods from outside the country hence it will help in maintaining the value of our money and hardwork.

> Technical Feasibility

Well currently our innovation is on a small scale with few resources. our budget its limited per generation of our birds., the storage facility is also not that big hence not allowing us to keep more birds and moreover short of finances too to meet the required needs such as feed, electricity and water bills etc.

 Implementation Plan;
1. needs, more land where we can set and continue and carry out the project 
2. land is quite cheap here in livingstone 
3. infrastructure or building as storage facility 
4. money to pay the workers 
5. transportation to carry our products birds and eggs, two vans  or one can do.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Zambia is a country in Southern Africa where poverty is widespread and the traditional
keeping of local poultry therefore plays a crucial role in improving nutrition. Meat and eggs
from poultry are important sources of protein but also of income. Improving the poultry
production is thereby a method to fight poverty. For poultry, the access to light is an
important factor for both growth and egg production. In this paper, the focus is on the
chickens used for both egg and meat production, how they are kept, their
health and welfare and if the use of a solar lamp will influence their behaviour, growth and
egg production.
