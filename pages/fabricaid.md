## Circular Fashion 

FabricAID is a social enterprise founded in 2016 with the mission of creating a dignified and sustainable second-hand clothing sector in the Middle East. Operating in Lebanon and Jordan, the brand collects, sorts, and redistributes clothing through several initiatives aimed at reducing textile waste and promoting circular fashion. Their projects include affordable thrift stores like Souk Al Khalanj for low-income communities, Second Base for vintage lovers, and “Let’s Make Merch!” which upcycles fabric waste into custom sustainable products. With hundreds of collection bins and retail outlets, FabricAID has supported over 190,000 people, created jobs, especially for marginalized groups, and helped avoid hundreds of tons of CO₂ emissions, positioning itself as a regional leader in ethical and sustainable fashion.
