Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. One of most famous place in Bishkek is the Dordoi bazaar (marketplace). It was one of the biggest wholesale and retail trading zone in the Central Asia which linking China, Turkey, Russia, Kazakhstan and other economies. In Dordoi bazaar you can find everything you need food, clothes, shoes, electronics, auto repair accessories, construction materials, etc. Dordoi is surrounded by new settlements where live people who make business, work or provide services.
Today I went to Dordoi to buy some staff for my car. On the way I saw the salt selling point. This salt is used by local farmers to combine feed for cattle with some minerals. It was interesting that the trading place is installed on the artificial bank which is supported by used tires. You can buy for low price used tires in Dordoi, so the salt seller invented how increase the square of plant right-near to channel slope. The seller tied tires and covered them with soil.
As a result, owner created a new land plant with approximately 25 square meters for generating income from selling salt.
