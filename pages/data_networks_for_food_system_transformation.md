Data Networks for Food System Transformation
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that the largely small holder farmer powered food system in Nigeria is hampered by data gaps which affect crop production/on farm activities, impact post harvest losses due to poor access to markets, connections to processing capacity among other factors. We wish to examine data gaps that could reduce post harvest losses, improve the efficiency of food systems and reduce food insecurity. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Most crop production in Nigeria occurs in rural areas. Limited storage systems, processing capacity and poor transport infrastructure linkages in rural areas among other factors, contribute to significant post harvest losses of up to 60% on some value chains. The high costs of installing hard infrastructure linkages between far-flung production hubs and markets deter governments at various levels from making these investments. Recently insecurity and conflict have compounded this situation as many farms are in remote locations, contributing to more food insecurity across the country and increasing poverty in the farming communities.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Lab is well placed to quickly uncover impactful, low-cost insights in this area, building on the learnings from it's work, engagements and learning cycle on Climate Resilience in small holder farming communities. In addition, it is positioned to offer unusual approaches to stakeholders in this crisis. A wide range of interventions will be required to address the food crisis, however most solutions tend to default to typical approaches around material inputs which do not always address underlying inefficiencies in the sector. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Can data improve the efficiency of food systems and reduce post-harvest losses in Nigeria? How much can it help?

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can we build and leverage integrated data systems to impact food system actors at different ends of the technological and digitalisation spectra? How can we leverage the energy and vibrance of startups in the digital and tech ecosystems in Nigeria for local food systems? Can we minimise post-harvest losses and optimise market access to local and international markets for high-value organic crops (e.g. with block-chain)? How can we harness increased productivity for greater financial inclusion? How do we enable system change around data and evidence-based decision making across the spectrum of actors in the agriculture sector?  Which data gaps will produce significant reductions in post harvest losses if closed? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We aim to leverage data sourced from various stakeholders to map production, processing, distribution capacities and climate risk areas among other data types in the food system. This will form an open source data system for connecting stakeholders to each other and to crucial information. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



These data sources could help map capacities, products and resources which could optimise production and reduce food system losses. These data sources bring together communal knowledge and networks and contemporary public and private sector information. They would bring greater transparency to the sector. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The common man would benefit if food wastage is reduced as food insecurity could be reduced. The government would have better insights on capacity gaps in the food system. Private sector actors could leverage key data to reduce their operational costs and small holder famers could reduce farm level post harvest waste through connections to a range of partners who could access their products or support processing activities.
