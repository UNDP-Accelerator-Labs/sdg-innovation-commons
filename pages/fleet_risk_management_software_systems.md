> Brief description of the innovation

The software helps transporters of fuel to identify critical risk factors associated to transport and safety management. Thus transport regulators and operators will be able to plan prudently to minimize costs associated to transport and safety risks thus contribute to transport efficiency and profits, and jobs. The software systems are in tandem with ISO 39001 Road safety standards and Zambia Bureau of Standards ZS 1215 Fleet safety management standards of 2021.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The supplier will sale the software, conduct training, and provide periodical software support. 

The Regulator will provide basic and periodical Fleet Risk Assessments, Performance Audits for compliance. Train the Fleet Inspectors.

The Operators will establish fleet risk baseline and maintain fleet safety compliance standards to save lives, equipment, road infrastructure, business losses, but improve service delivery.

> Technical Feasibility

The software systems are available for demonstration either virtually or in a boardroom and ready for use. They are designed to be used by both the Transport Regulators such as RTSA, ZABS, ERB, Insurance companies, business corporates, fuel tanker operators, public service operators for passenger and freight, government fleet, etc. 
Implementation plan is to have the systems installed by transport regulators to coordinate and manage all transport operators under their sector. All operators with a fleet either private or public will be required to install the software for periodical internal performance audits compliance. 
The insurance companies will be required to support the regulators in fleet safety compliance systems thus the need to install the systems.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Road traffic accidents have a greater impact on families, communities and country at large. Drivers Competency Risk Assessment help to minimize on risk behaviours associated to lack of driving skills or road safety rules and regulations. Lack of systems to establish risk status of organisations and drivers is not only a risk to the society but the country as a whole.
