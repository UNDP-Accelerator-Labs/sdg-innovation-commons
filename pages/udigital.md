Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to increase the employability of university graduates and facilitate their smoother entry into the job market.




Currently, 40% of young people in Cape Verde face significant difficulties entering the job market, which limits their potential and negatively impacts the nation's future.




Additionally, we encounter several other issues:





Low Student Participation in Entrepreneurship: Due to insufficient resources, there is a low rate of student involvement in entrepreneurial activities.


Gender Disparities: There is a substantial gender gap in the digital sector, which decreases the potential contribution of women.


Institutional Limitations: Universities face administrative and resource constraints that hinder their ability to support students in entrepreneurship.





> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The challenge in Cape Verde arises from the significant difficulties young people face in entering the job market. With 43.6% of the population under 25 years old, there is vast potential for human capital development. However, 40% of these young individuals struggle to find employment, limiting their potential and negatively impacting the country's future.



Current Situation and Undesired Effects




High Youth Unemployment: A substantial portion of the young population encounters challenges in securing jobs, restricting their economic potential and contributing to national economic stagnation.


Gender Disparity: There is a notable underrepresentation of women in STEM fields and entrepreneurial ventures. The program aims to address this by ensuring active participation of women throughout the entrepreneurial process.


Institutional Limitations: Universities may face challenges with administrative support or resistance to integrating entrepreneurship into their curricula, potentially hindering the program's implementation.


Resource Constraints: Limited financial resources may not fully meet the needs for setting up project incubators and supporting the development of winning projects, which could affect the program's reach and effectiveness.





Addressing these challenges is crucial for unlocking the full potential of Cape Verde's youth and fostering sustainable economic growth.

Youth Demographics and Employment:





Population Statistics: Cape Verde has a significant youth population, with 43.6% of its population under the age of 25.


Employment Challenges: 40% of these young individuals face difficulties entering the job market, which significantly limits their potential and negatively impacts the nation's economic growth.





Educational Enrollment and Gender Disparity:





University Enrollment: According to the latest report by the Regulatory Agency for Higher Education for the academic year 2022/2023, there are 9,255 students enrolled in higher education across 11 universities in two islands. Approximately 3,866 of these students are in their final years of undergraduate studies (from the 3rd to the 6th year).


Female Participation: Out of the total student population, 2,405 are young women, representing 66% of the graduates. Despite this high percentage of female graduates, participation in STEM fields and entrepreneurial activities remains disproportionately low.
