> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

Opaw Ice 4 Sale shares their techniques in keeping their blocks of Ice frozen even 2 more days than usual time it stays in solid state inside their Storage Facility.

He said that the secret lies in their piling of the ice. Unlike the practice in the Ice plants and other Storage Facilities, the block are piled vertically upright position, they do it in a horizontal position. Moreover, they pile the blocks side by side, eliminating the space in between them. This prevents air to get in between which speeds up the melting of ice. Considering that the facility is purely constructed from concrete, they cover the ice with layers of plastic bags which also aid in slowing the melting of ice.

This makes Opaw Ice 4 Sale one standout in innovation.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

The need to extend shelf / storage life of ice blocks.

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

For ice retailers who are looking to extend ice blocks shelf life.

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

A. The staff of this ice storage facility are unconscious that they have been applying principles of thermodynamics. This is evidence by their unique way of piling ht e blocks of ice inside the storage room. Unlike the usual practice where the blocks are positioned vertically upright- they pile the ice horizontally. This is done to keep the ice from getting too much exposure from the heat on the room's ceiling. Since the facility is made up of full concrete, the walls and ceilings absorb the sun's energy , hence the nearer the ice is to the ceiling the faster it melts.

B. The usual practice of piling them often creates gaps and spaces in between the blocks. With their innovation, they pile the ice side by side, closely to each other, thereby eliminating the spaces. This keeps air from getting out in between the spaces which speeds up the melting process.

C. Since the facility is made up of full concrete, heat is absorbed and the inside is basically, warm, hot or humid. So, to delay the melting process of ice, they cover the pile with layers of thick plastic bags so as to reduce the penetration of heat. This also more sanitary than the use of rice hulls which was an old practice of delaying the melting of ice.

> Opportunities: What are other opportunities where the solution can be applied?
