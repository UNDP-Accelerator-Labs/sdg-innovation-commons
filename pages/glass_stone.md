Description: This substrate is a 100% natural and recycled growth medium, perfect for vegetables, herbs and flowering plants. The spaces between the recycled glass "rocks" open up more oxygen to the plant roots, while the texture of the rock retains water without drowning the roots. This combination favors the development of the root, which translates into a better absorption of nutrients and water.

In addition, it is a lightweight material and does not dirty the media where it is used.
