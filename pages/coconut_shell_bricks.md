As part of a research thesis, innovator has developed a brick prototype using cocoa husks and mud, for construction use  in Bucay canton, located in Guayas, Ecuador. Several tests have been carried out so that the materials meet the necessary requirements demanded by construction regulations. Farmers from  Bucay discard cocoa shells, since they are only interested in marketing its nut; while the mud is used for the manufacture of handicrafts. The problem is trying to address is the fact that the residential constructions of the sector use materials such as cane and wood and this brick can offer a non-polluting and sustainable construction solution to people with limited resources as well as livelihoods.
