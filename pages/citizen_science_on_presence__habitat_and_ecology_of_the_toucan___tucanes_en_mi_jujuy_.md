Overall goal: Use Toco Toucans as flagship species to raise public awareness about biodiversity conservation in SSJ and contribute to environmentally sustainable urban planning.  Specific goals:  1) Understand habitat use and selection patterns, seasonal migration, diet composition and reproductive habits of Toco Toucans in the city of SSJ;   2) Determine the link between toucan populations and different urban structural features;   3) Engage society in reporting the presence of toucans in different parts of the city and monitoring nest boxes, as a way of raising awareness about the value and protection of this bird and biodiversity in general;   4) Offer talks and workshops in academic institutions aimed at students and faculty to promote environmental education;   5) Prepare a diagnosis of the current situation of Toco Toucans in SSJ, identifying actual and potential threats affecting them, as well as beneficial actions and urban features for these species. 

Description of citizen participation:  Anyone can participate by reporting toucan sightings in different parts of the city, through social media, website and/or mobile app. Although submitting photos and videos is not mandatory, these contributions are also encouraged.   In addition, citizens also participate in placing and monitoring nest boxes to assess whether toucans are breeding in the city.
