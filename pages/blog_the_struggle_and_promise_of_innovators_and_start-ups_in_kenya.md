The Struggle
and Promise
of Innovators
and Start-Ups
in Kenya

Introduction

This publication distills insights on the Kenyan innovation ecosystem from the perspective of innovators and start- ups,

deriving from their experiences as key players in this critical space. It sheds light on their struggles, hits and misses,

triumphs, heartbreaks and, of course, their unlimited potential. We document their journey through the narrow and

winding path of innovation - from ideation, setting up, building the required physical and governance foundations

through to commercialization of their products.

Reading through their testimonies, it is clear that the journey of innovation is not for the faint-hearted. These case

studies bring out not only the ingenuity and richness of ideas in the Kenyan innovation tapestry but also highlights

their indefatigable spirit and will to succeed despite the odds. It is simply inspiring.

The range of innovations highlighted in this document cut across different sectors and regions: from a marine

engineer with several innovations including a UV disinfectant and an oxygen concentrator to a new machine that has

reduced the cost of tea-picking by 75% per cent. There are also exciting digital applications in health, education and

environment, two of which have raised over KSh 400 million in seed funding. Also, an innovator in Kisii is using solar

drying to reduce post-harvest losses, and in the process, he has established a thriving enterprise based on the banana

value chain.

And whereas the innovators and start-ups that form the basis of this publication were randomly selected, their views

- more or less - reflect the status of the Kenyan innovation ecosystem. Though they may not be exhaustive - they are

not intended to be - they provide a window through which we can get a glimpse of the Kenyan innovation ecosystem.

THE CONTEXT

These case studies are part of a broader study on the Kenyan innovation ecosystem commissioned by the United

Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Konza Technopolis. The study set out to map out the ecosystem

with a view to identifying opportunities for collaboration, learning and investment; and to support the growth and

development of local innovators across the country.

The study has mapped out the Kenyan innovation ecosystem by identifying its characteristics, organization (players

and actors), challenges and its key levers while also highlighting emerging themes and opportunities. It was conducted

by the African Centre for Technology Studies (ACTS).

exposure out there,” said Kupalia.

Winning the Health Innovation Award in Nigeria was

a great milestone which exposed his innovation ideas

to the world.

“As a result of the exposure, I had someone offering

me a space in Mombasa for free where I could estab-

lish the e-Funza center; someone in Nairobi offered

me a warehouse to store my products because I didn’t

have a store in Nairobi. Some of these things come

you’re getting through recognition,” he said.

ADVICE TO INNOVATORS

Simon warns innovators not to be so much engrossed

in their innovations and instead focus on the impact.

Also, most investors will only put their money on an

idea that has been tested in the market and have

proven to be viable. This means innovators have to

find a way of getting their own money to start their

business before investors can come on board.

“Most people believe that when you have a beautiful

creation you will get investors. Rarely, would an inves-

tor put in money to a fresh idea that doesn’t even have

a proof of concept or a product. Investors come on

board when you have financial statements showing

you’ve been in the business, you’ve tested the prod-

uct and people are buying the product or services,”

he explained.

KEY LESSONS

Kupalia has learned some key lessons along his in-

novation journey. One of the lessons is that you can

have a great idea but that does not guarantee that it

will work. “Sometimes our innovations are great and

they seem very promising but they don’t guarantee

market success. It doesn’t mean that they’re going to

make it in the market,” he warned.

Continuous innovation is very important. Innovators

must continuously develop new ideas. They must also

invest in research and development.

“We are always trying to look out for new ideas and

fresh solutions that would supplement what we have.

This keeps us in business because after one year or

so, the solution which you’re providing may become

outdated or people are not appreciating it anymore

and you have to give them something better,” he said.

KEY CHALLENGE

One of the key challenges facing innovators is that some

ideas take time to be accepted; people are slow to em-

brace change and prefer to stick to what is familiar.

An oxygen concentrator incorporated with a patient monitoring
system. It can concentrate atmospheric oxygen up to 97%.

“It might take some time for people to learn and un-

derstand the need of some of these products or inno-

vation and why they should be supported. You pro-

pose a solution to the county government, but they

don’t see the necessity of having that. They’d rather

just stick to the tradition of doing things,” he said.

WHAT NEXT?

Kupalia has big plans for all the three innovations

which he has commercialized. For his energy compa-

ny, he wants to expand the factory and venture into

processing plastics to oil.

“I see myself becoming a fully-fledged energy compa-

ny in the next five years. I will be processing different

kinds of waste and extending my market segments,

solving multiple problems related to waste manage-

ment,” he said.

An oxygen concentrator incorporated with a patient

monitoring system. It can concentrate atmospheric

oxygen up to 97%.

For his biotech company, he plans to venture abroad

and set up a manufacturing company in the United

States of America and distribute his products to dif-

ferent countries. He is already working with a partner

to achieve that dream.

He also has big dreams for the e-Funza platform. He

expects to integrate the platform into the school sys-

tem and have it deployed in all public schools and cre-

ate jobs for teachers and content developers.

THE BEGINNING

Paylend was incorporated in 2019 with a significant

part of 2020 taken up building the application, a web

portal and a USSD component. After building the App,

the company conducted tests in early 2021 based on

market demands. In mid 2021, the products were

ready for the market and their operations began.
