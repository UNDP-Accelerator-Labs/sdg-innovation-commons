> Brief description of the innovation

Charcoal burning is the only hope I have been left,what I usually do is I chop down wood into good sized pieces and then put them together using cattle and when am done I start covering it side ways then on top I even add glass on top of it so that the sand doesn't get into the trees,after that's done we put it on fire ad wait for three to four days that's when I start getting the charcoal out of it,I just sell the charcoal out to people who has enough transport I am lacking transport so that I can take it into town

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Bills have now exceeded or they have gone high in such a way the people are now an able to pay electric bills and it is for that reason that I propose charcoal as a means of preparing food ad anything that needs fire people need food and food needs to b cooked

> Technical Feasibility

My plan is to start selling charecoal to the people in towns until I have my own means of transportation

> Anticipated Social Impact

It is not everyone living in this country who is able to cook using electrical appliances some can only. Afford to pay electric bills for lights only,so as a responsible citizen I have my own means or ways for everyone to fit in by bringing charcoal at the market everyone will cook
