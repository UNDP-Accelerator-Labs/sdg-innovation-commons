## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Klariska Moodley

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

14 March 2023

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Nature, Climate and Energy

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Unemployment and poverty

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Can the marine ecosystem provide new sources of income to coastal communities. 

Can these be converted into small, sustainable businesses

Can we tap into the rich abundance available within the ocean to grow the blue/ocean economy in South Africa. 

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

## 
****
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can the marine ecosystem in South Africa be leveraged for innovation entrepreneurship and/or to support livelihoods of coastal communities. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we identify potential innovations from the ocean then we could develop a community of practice that could eventually lead to improved, and sustainable income opportunities for coastal communities. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Assess the marine innovation ecosystem and its key stakeholders, towards building a community of practice. 

Identify potential innovations from within coastal communities

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

number of innovations

number of innovators

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Innovation challenge open call

Setting up of an online platform to support a CoP

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
