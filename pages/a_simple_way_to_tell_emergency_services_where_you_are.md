During the field study in western Ukraine, we interviewed local firefighters who said that the biggest problem is that callers in need do not know the addresses. Apparently, most of the Ukrainian villages do not have street names while street names in many towns were renamed few times over the last 50 years, creating a mess for emergency services call centers and vehicle drivers. Not to mention locations outside of the residential areas.



One of the solutions to address this issue that we found is the British platform What3Words. It ascribes each 3x3 meter square of the our planet a unique name with three words, providing a more user-centered system instead of GPS coordinates. 



Now the platform has a Ukrainian language and the emergency services in the east of the country are preparing for a full-scale test of the solution with UNDP's guidance and support at the end of 2020.
