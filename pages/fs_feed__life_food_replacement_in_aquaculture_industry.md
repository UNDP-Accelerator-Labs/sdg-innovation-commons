FS Feed is a life food replacement for fish and prawn larvae due to limits to life food and high cost of feed. Life food production and quality are unpredictable, which has a negative impact on fish and prawn larvae production, which then affects the aquaculture industry. FS feed is made of 100% organic matter, mainly from fish oil.
