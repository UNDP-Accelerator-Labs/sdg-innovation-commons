Photograph: Red Mesa de Mujeres The organization Red Mesa de Mujeres from Ciudad Juárez is promoting neighborhood support groups and the use of whistles to call the attention, prevent and stop acts of harrasment, violence and potential danger against women, teenagers or children. The whistle is distributed along with flyers and other items that have the telephones of police and authorities. The sound will be an alert signal to call for support and to try to disinhibit the attacker while the authorities are called to 911. The whistle is relevant because often the police can take a long time to answer and alternative means of support are required. "Although we are confined by the pandemic and we wear masks, we must not remain silent when we see acts of violence ” –Isabel Aguilera González, neighbor and promoter of the Riberas del Bravo neighborhood network.
