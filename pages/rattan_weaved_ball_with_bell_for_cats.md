Miniature rattan “sepak raga” balls with bells made by Dusun women from the Misompuru Muru Buru group of Kg Gansurai in Kota Belud, Sabah. These were specifically designed for cats, though the weavers were initially unsure if it would work. Both the versions with bells (RM7.50 each) and plain (RM5) are not varnished and safe for cats to chase, bite & claw.
