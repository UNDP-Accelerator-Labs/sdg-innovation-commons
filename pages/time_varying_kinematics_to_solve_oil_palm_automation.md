In the pursuit of automation in the oil palm industry, the harvesting collection process of oil palm remains largely unresolved as current research in automation would not yield a robot that is as efficient as a human operated tractor. This is due to the lack of research in time-varying kinematics, something a human can be easily trained to do but has not been successfully replicated in robotics.

This project aims to create a custom algorithm, a time varying kinematic solver with a "reflected" trajectory predictor, that when combined with supplementary algorithms, will create a robot that is able to collect object goals automatically - without stopping in its movement. This would replicate the efficiency and efficacy of human operated tractors in the oil palm industry. A prototype mobile grabber will be created for this project to prove its efficiency and efficacy against conventional methods of robotic grabbers.
