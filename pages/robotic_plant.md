> Title of the innovation

Robotic plant

> Brief description of the innovation

The robotic plant is an early warning system designed to help farmers monitor, control as well as protect their farms and investments.
The main purpose of this project is to have an autonomous system that will assist in running the day to day farm activities as well as inform the farmer of all-important information involving the farm.
The aim of the robotic plant is to improve farm productivity by closely monitoring plant growth and health every second and making intelligent decisions autonomously.
Multiple problems occur in farming including poor soil nutrition contents, insects, army worms and many more.
It is important to have knowledge of the changing farms conditions and this is humanly impossible.
Using artificial intelligence, the robotic plant will be learning, hence be able to distinguish the leaves, identifying and distinguishing amongst the different widths and also the colors knowing which one is healthy and which are not, army worms, locusts and other harmful animals from the helpful ones like earthworms.
This will be done by teaching the plant how a healthy sample should look like and then comparing that with the plants in the farm.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

By monitoring  necessary farm parameters, the farmer can make right decision promptly, and this will increase production and reduce costs of unnecessary materials which are normally brought based on human assumptions

> Technical Feasibility

The machine has the following components 
The raspberry camera
The raspberry camera will be the eyes of the device, with functions ranging from;
Enable movement within the farm, view leaves and stem widths and look out for armyworms and insects.
The ph. sensor
The ph. sensor will be located in the legs of the device and will be responsible for checking the soils acidity. 
Temperature and humidity sensors
Also located in the legs of the device, these two sensors will be responsible for checking the soils temperature as well as the humidity (amount of moisture) in the soil.   
LM741 comparator
This component will be function as a mini laboratory within the robotic plant.
It will be taking checking for the important nutrients needed for plant growth ( Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium). 
Raspberry pi 4
This is a microprocessor that will be responsible for interpreting the values obtained by the sensors.
will also be responsible for communications with the owner. 
Solar panel and battery
These will be power supply of the system to enable and ensure continuous functionality of the device.
Servo and dc motor
This will be used to help in the positioning of the solar panel in respect to the sun.
It will also work together with the dc motors in terms of movements. 
Arduino board
This is a micro controller that will be responsible for controlling movements and positioning of the Robotic plant.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Agriculture is the strong hold of the country economy, this project with increase crop production to the highest value possible ...
