Plastic Pollution Challenge:
Viet Nam is in the top 4 countries contributing to plastic waste entering the oceans, especially in Ha Long Bay, with 5,272 tons of plastic waste generated annually.  Only 9% of plastic waste in Viet Nam is recycled, typically for low-value applications and simple use.

Solution:
EcoTech has developed a groundbreaking technology  that turns many kinds of plastic waste into novel, high-value aerogel materials for billion-dollar markets, such as heat and sound insulation, high-temperature garments and oil spill clean up. A pilot has been launched in Singapore with the capacity to manufacture 250,000 m2 per year of aerogels from various wastes, including plastic, paper, textiles, rubber and agricultural waste).

Innovation:
EcoTech has successfully overcome the problem of plastic waste by developing a means to convert them into high-value aerogels for many useful applications – the first aerogel made from plastic waste. Eco-aerogels have practical applications, such as in oil-spill clean ups and heat and sound insulations, providing excellent water repellency, are highly compressible and ultra-low density, and have high-porosity, high absorption capacity and ultra-low thermal conductivity. At the end of their useful life, these aerogels can be recycled again to make other aerogels. Notable achievements to date include: Patented: Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Aerogels, SG Non-Provisional Application No. 10201802587W; Won first place for Sustainable Technologies, Create the Future Design International Contest 2018, Tech Briefs USA; Won TechConnect Innovation Awards 2019 in the USA;  Received world-wide media coverage, with over 2 million views (Reuters, Bloomberg, CNA, Straits Times, etc.).
