## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Communities' understanding of climate change is limited to a few things and do not always draw the connections with natural and human drivers, because then it makes everything connected and complex. 

When thinking about the drivers of the issues,  the community often feels powerless because they feel they have no control over natural factors. For human drivers (like the major island projects that exacerbate negative impacts), the decisions are taken by the powerful few while they have no voice. 

Individual/household adaptation measures take place but community level efforts are less coordinated. There is often a financial burden to the household, like modifications to the house structure, or changes in livelihood activities &amp; practices. 

People have practical life constraints (like job, domestic responsibilities etc) that affect their ability to participate in CI efforts even if they are motivated. more difficult for women. 

Lack of trust in institutions also hinders community participation. Community believes institutions like the local council should be accountable and take the lead in these efforts.



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Our work on participatory mapping was picked by UNESCAP and they are working with us develop a tool/feature to enable local councils to upload gis data collected through participatory mapping to their risk and resilience portal, which will be used by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), councils and other stakeholders.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

 The uniqueness of each island necessitates a localized, or rather a hyperlocal approach, to risk reduction and adaptation. Hyperlocal action requires hyperlocal data, but the data ecosystem for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) is particularly weak at the island level. Many islands do not have accurate, geo-referenced maps, that capture  the built environment. . 



> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

In a dispersed small island geography collecting and maintaining such data is challenging and time consuming.  We used Collective Intelligence method, specifically participatory mapping  as as a method to allow people to contribute spatial data based on their local knowledge ad ground observations. 

 It was necessary to adopt a method that can not only generate the data needed, but also motivate and empower the community to

participate and take action in local DRR and CCA efforts. With the data collected by the community we were able to create GIS maps of the island with layers covering Roads, buildings, key points and critical infrastructure as well as hazard exposure.  Participatory mapping allowed us to generate a hyperlocal and rich

georeferenced base map of the island which was then used to make the Hazard, Vulnerabilities ad capacities Map and the Island disaster Management plan based on the HVCA. 


## Partners

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.

For piloting the CI method, we partnered with Maafaru island council. We worked together onboarding participants, doing the mapping and developing the Disaster Management plan. Shared their existing data and provided resources like space for conducting workshops.
