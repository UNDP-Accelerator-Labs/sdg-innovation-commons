> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Citizen Mr. Royal (a corporate professional), in his free time, stands silently holding up a sign that says in Bengali "only idiots honk without any reason" at some of the busiest streets of Dhaka, in an attempt to catch the attention of drivers and shame them into not honking unnecessarily. He also distributes stickers and fliers with this message for people to use on their windshields, phones etc. and encourages others to join him for short periods on the roads. There is an observable reduction in honking by drivers who pass by Mr. Royal holding the sign, and pedestrians often join for short periods holding up the sign with him (I did too!)

> NEED: What need does this answer?

Sound pollution from vehicles blaring hydraulic horns is a huge problem in the streets of Dhaka, making commuting an almost traumatic experience for both pedestrians and commuters alike, whose situation is particularly exacerbated by the hours of traffic jams they have to tolerate on a daily basis. So there is a need to reduce excessive honking by frustrated drivers, who often do so habitually even when there is a red light.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

The reason this initiative seems innovative and is successful is because it is easy to take part in and replicate, it feels good and empowering to do it, has minimal costs and leads to almost immediate results.
