A product that turns plastic waste into filament that can be used for 3D Printing.

The Problem:

Plastic bottles pollute our environment - Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans and landfills. This pollution has a devastating effect on wildlife, and it's also one of the leading causes of climate change. Nevertheless, there are a few local recycling programs in our governorate, but the overall level of participation is low. This means that there is a lot of potential for improvement when it comes to reducing waste and increasing recycling rates.

The Solution:

There are many ways to recycle plastic, and it's not easy. It can be recycled into new products - we can use them to make new products. This machine can take these bottles and convert them into 3D printer filament to make products. Hence, the solution is about developing a 3D printer filament recycling machine which is a device that can recycle plastic bottles into 3D printing filament. This machine consists of two parts: an electronic part and a mechanical part. The electronic part controls the motor that powers the blade, while the mechanical part contains the blade itself.
