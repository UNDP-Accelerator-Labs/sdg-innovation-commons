> Description

Organization of women from the Santa Librada neighborhood of Mayor Otaño for the support of our children. We produce and sell our own homemade food (specialities: typical dishes, homemade hamburgers, empanadas and milanesas). The initiative -led by two women, single mothers who today already brings together five- began in 2019 as a delivery service. Currently it already has a local, which is being equipped.
