> Type of the Solution

Natural Cooling

> Description of the solution

Urban wetlands, especially for cooler cities are important. Urban planners and policy-makers can focus on mainstreaming the ecosystem services provided by urban wetlands in mitigating urban heat island effect by: including urban wetlands andtheir ecosystem services in the assessment and planning of Urban Heat Island Mitigation. Engaging local residents, community based organisations, NGOs and others stakeholders by sensitizing them, building awarenss and including them in planning or conservation and restoration of wetlands and surrounding green spaces surrounding to maximize UHI reduction. Healthy wetlands with open water surfaces provide a cooling effect.
