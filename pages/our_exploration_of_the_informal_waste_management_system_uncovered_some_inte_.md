## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) Our exploration of the informal waste management system uncovered some interesting value chains for different waste types. We wanted to dive deeper and map companies, entrepreneurs and individuals who are creating innovative uses for waste to better understand the waste value chain, bring light to the less recognized informal sector, and make connections to straighten the market.  We went out on a three-day solution safari to explore the different waste products that are made locally and meet the entrepreneurs behind them to uncover how and why they started their businesses. We focused our attention on plastic, paper, metal, and organic waste since they are the most common types of waste collected. Through this process, we mapped 58 solutions across the city, giving more focus on small business and social enterprises but also a few long-established companies to highlight how they and the sector have evolved over the years.  This solution mapping and safari turned into a solutions fest we organized with Addis Ababa Solid Waste Management Agency. The solution fest showcased the different ways waste is turned into valuable products and created a platform to connect the actors across the value chain. There was a common interest in environmental protection and the need to aid the waste management system from the entrepreneurs. Currently, people seeing the value of waste is a bigger driving force to recycle and reuse than any policy or regulation. Whether it is due to the lack of raw material in the metal industry, or the lack of foreign exchange that makes importing virgin paper products expensive, these factors have created an opportunity and necessity to take advantage of recycling and reusing.   2) Our portfolio of work on solid waste management continued with the issue of downstream waste management, specifically recycling and reusing waste to create new and sustainable products. We noticed that there was a missed opportunity to create market connections between stakeholders within the value chain. There were some promising initiatives from the private sector, but they were fragmented and have not been formally integrated into the waste management system. To address this, the lab hosted a 2-day solution fest and panel discussion.  The solution festival had an exhibition for start-ups and innovators building diverse waste products to display their work, connected with large-scale recycling companies, governments, and development organizations. There were also two dialogue forums, one on The Future of Waste Management: Strategies for Economic Opportunity and Environmental sustainability. Nd another on What opportunities exist. Their role in building a circular economy on waste. The fest saw 25+ companies, 300+ visitors and 85 panel discussion participants. We saw tremendous interest in the topic and appetite from the participant to network and connect on the waste topics.  The futuristic and solution-driven discussions highlighted the need for the proactive creation of economic opportunities through public-Private partnership for job creation and lack of research and data driven approach for a coordinated effort to create an environmentally sustainable waste management system. At a systemic level we need a shared responsibility approach from government, industry, and consumers to tackle the frowning demands of waste management resources. The discussants emphasized the need for end-to-end design thinking in the waste system.    3) Our exploration in Adama and Bishoftu (Oromia regional towns) has shown that the demographic status of residents could make a difference in solid waste management practices at the household level. Therefore, we had designed a behavioral insight study in Addis Ababa’s contrasted locations at the center, transitional and peripheral sites to connect behavioral perspectives with physical accesses to such urban facilities. The study has modeled the likelihood of households practicing improper waste disposal behavior based on their household distance from a solid waste transfer station and the amount of solid waste they produce. The model has generated an insight that could support decisions to be made based on the prioritized factor proved through the model. We have learned that a household’s distance from its nearby transfer station does not determine the household's behavior when it comes to the proper disposal of waste. The size of the generated waste could also affect a household’s decision on whether to dispose of it in the assigned transfer stations or to practice improper disposal. As well considerable share of households still lacks basic knowledge about proper solid waste segregation but households in low economic class neighborhoods are better because they used the waste they generate through upcycling or selling of products showing an encouraging sign the value waste has for them. Transfer stations, where waste is sorted before going to landfill, are unevenly distributed, with more transfer stations available in higher income neighborhoods than others. Therefore, we have concluded that our alternate hypothesis on the improper disposal of solid waste is partially accepted, as solid waste size determines improper solid waste disposal.  4) The lab team have looked at the current waste management system, the role of the informal sector and how waste is recycled and reused. From our explorations, we saw the importance of proper waste collection and transportation for an effective system. Therefore, the team embarked on a deep dive and solutions co-creation exercise for solid waste collection and transport in Bahir Dar. To get a deeper understanding of what the challenges were in waste collection transportation, we have shadowed waste collectors and transporters on their collection routes and spoke with residents and had a behind-the-scenes look at how the collectors and residents interact. It took the team about two hours to collect all the waste from the neighborhood and temporarily store it at collection points. Within a few minutes, a truck arrived, and the collectors emptied the waste bags on to the truck and collected back their sacks/bags. We observed that households don’t segregate their waste and most of the waste is organic waste mixed with some PET (polyethene terephthalate) bottles. We did not see wastes that have market value like metals and PVC plastics in the disposed waste because households are selling such items to the informal waste pickers locally known as Qorales.   5) After the deep dive, we brought together municipality solid waste experts, waste collectors and leaders of waste collecting and transportation companies and associations for a co-creation exercise. The co-creation exercise enabled us to explore the prominent challenges associated with solid waste collection, transportation, the respective potential technological solutions & business models that help to efficiently collect and transport solid waste from a household. Among the recommended solutions reinventing a waste collection cart rated on top. Pushcart is one of the common ways to collect waste from household and transport it to the nearby waste collection points or transfer stations. They suggested some desired features to make the existing pushcarts more efficient and convenient for the users/waste collectors. Based on ideas reflected on the co-creation exercise the lab team designed three prototypes of pushcart with different features to be tested with users. The co-creation exercise, It enable us to  came up with  some hypothesis to improve household sorting behavior which  need some experimentation. “Incentivizing households on waste segregation can improve the households waste segregating behavior”, “An example shared by the actors was free solid waste collection service for HHs segregating their waste as per the requirement” and “ HHs pay 20 Birr/month for waste collection with their water bill”. The other  insight we get from the stakeholders to improve waste segregation in the entire solid waste management  value chain is increasing the number of  transfer stations in the city .  The   rationale behind is  waste is staying longer at transfer stations than  the temporary waste collection points and this will give a time for scavengers and waste pickers  to collect some of the valuable waste elements before it get dumped at the landfill. We have connected this to behavior insight study we led on household waste segregation.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Waste management is still seen as a low priority issue within local municipalities as demonstrated by lack of funding or at least is not shown as much consideration as other urbanization issues like lack of housing. However, the establishment of the Solid Waste Management Agency recently is a promising start and can support solutions to overlooked challenges in the solid waste sector.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Open data:  we used exiting data on waste collection and waste types for sensing the challenges around waste management. We relied on large data sates from the world bank, Addis Ababa Solid Waste Management agency and NAMA compost project to get an understanding of the landscape in a short period of time.  We choose this type because it was easy to access, reliable and some of the data sources covered large geographical areas across the country that we’ able to give us an overview of the urban vs rural waste generation and composition that would have otherwise been difficult to get.     Geospatial data (GIS, GPS, etc.) data: Used to set location for the behavioral insight based on housing types. We also used this tool to map out rivers in the city which are under a large cleaning and reimagining project that we will be scaling our learning from waste management thought.     

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

- The lab team organized a solution fest to showcase the solution Prototypes which use waste as a livelihood method. So, we used solution mapping to map those solutions and organize a learning event and a way to connect actors in the market.   - We have also facilitated a co-creation session for a transportation solution with the waste sorting, collecting, and transporting association in Bahirdar municipality as a follow-up activity plan to experiment with the solution we co-create with them through prototyping.   - We have designed and led a behavioral insight study to look at positive deviance in waste segregation in low-income households become to build a model for encouraging waste segregation across the city through using collective intelligence and ethnography tools to dive in deeply.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Using unusual data sources as well as bringing unusual partners helps the lab team to generate quick insight with a short period of time in different topics as well-diversified learnings from different angles which we will not be able to get if we are implementing in a previous implementation form. It enables us to see different insights which we didn’t see in the normal project implementation ways. It also enables us to use fewer resources since we have done many activities through collaboration with other partners which makes the lab approach less resource incentive method. These methods also help us to accelerate the internal UNDP operation process using partnership rather than a procurement process to save time as well provide evidence in a short period of time for decision making.
