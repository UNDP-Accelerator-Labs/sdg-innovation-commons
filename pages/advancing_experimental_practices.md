 How to

 base decisions and behaviors on existing knowledge



> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

What makes it easier for decisions and behaviors to be informed by existing knowledge?



> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- United Nations agency

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Country office programmatic areas 


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to learn how to reduce barriers to the adoption of

experimentation practices. We think that there is lack of knowledge regarding

what information is needed to design an experiment, and what experiments are

used for. So, we need to see learn if it's possible to encourage the adoption

of experimentation practices if we break down the process so it's more

intuitive for people without training to provide the information needed to

design experiments and use them to test assumptions, improve interventions or

measure impact.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we simplify the information needed to design experiments, then it would be easier to adopt experimentation practices



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We will develop simplified guidelines requesting information

necessary to design experiments. Then, we will share this instrument to see if

it reduces the technical requirements for defining the components of an

experiments, and it provides more opportunities to adopt experimental

practices. 



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Each person with whom the guidelines are shared



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Direct observation, qualitative interviews. 



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

One month



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

We need the time and space to craft the simplified guidelines, and opportunities to share and exchange them with potential users. 


## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Partially proven. 



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We could introduce control groups to compare differences in the adoption of experimental practices. We implemented this activity without clearly understanding what a successful adoption of the instrument would be. 



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Less than a month



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

US$0.00 additional costs 



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. The guidelines to design experiments are needed to transfer capacity and promote the adoption of experimental practices, so we will be improving them as we move forward. 



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Simplifying guidelines can scale to other methodologies, and the use of the guidelines can be expanded to the country office and counterparts. 



> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment did not scale yet
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We learned that people have an easier time answering the question "what action needs to be implemented?" followed by "what is the expected result?" than being asked to state a hypothesis and identify relevant data to be collected. However, people do not necessarily recognize openly that the results of their actions are uncertain, and they have a big need to provide results, limiting space for failure. It is hard to ask to use resources without giving guarantees that it will lead to results. 



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

We are trying to introduce experimental practices among

people who do not necessarily requested them to see their value. 



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Program officers, and practitioners could benefit from adopting this instruments when designing activities with counterparts. Also, other Accelerator Labs who are trying to promote experimental practices.  



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Government and Civil Society counterparts would benefit from increasing their capacity to test the activities they implement. 



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We did need a few iterations to finalize the guidelines before launching and continue improving them afterwards. 



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Create demand for experiments so the guidelines solve a need recognized. Remember what experiments are for: testing assumptions, improving interventions, measuring the impact of interventions. 



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

This experiment is not SDG specific. 



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This was an activity complimentary to mapping and exploration, where each are trying to showcase methodologies to the country office. 



> What surprised you?

It’s surprising that even if experimentation practices are

made very easy to adopt, it's perceived that they will highlight weaknesses

rather than create opportunity for improvements. There is reluctance to

question whether something we are invested in works, rather than looking for

ways to improve it.
