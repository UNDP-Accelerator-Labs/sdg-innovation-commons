[[0:00]] Hello, I'm Ardita Zakiri, Head of Solutions Mapping at the Accelerator Lab in Country Office, North Macedonia\. We are based in Skopje\. Today I want to talk to you about a specific R&D story that we have\. When it's called Data Powered Positive Deviance, we had this methodology\. I heard I was inspired by this methodology a lot by colleagues doing the similar work in other countries\. And then particularly the case of Mexico was very inspiring to me\. And I recruited some of the colleagues from democratic governance unit in our country office and we said OK, let's attend the boot camp and see what we can do from there\. Boot camp in itself in itself was a very interesting journey where we learned about the method, where we learned about what and how we can do that\. And then we said, OK, let's see where do we have data in the our ecosystem\. And unfortunately the data scarcity remains one of the greatest challenges in in the country\. Open data remains one of the greatest challenges in the country\. And we took the data set from the treasury of the Ministry of Finance where we were able to scoop in all payments done by the treasury in the country\. And then we looked at financial data to put this one into a context\. We looked at citizen centered financial management in all of the municipalities in North Macedonia\. There is a lot going on like a public discourse in the media that municipalities, local government units are struggling with financial management\. They are not doing a good job\. They are not really prepared for the challenges that are happening around the communities and they are not able to actually think about resources and allocate resources properly to people's needs in order to cater and provide services for them\. So this was our starting point\. Our interest was intrigued, and we took the whole sample like the whole population was our sample in the study\. We looked at the data, what is going on and how we can actually understand their financial performances\. And of course this is not a 1person job\. We had colleagues from democratic governance unit joining us and in addition we had one UNV sponsored by the Chinese government that came and helped us during the five months with a lot of data mining and data analysis and interpretation about the data, about what's going on with the data and how we can actually read this data in order to be able to withdraw the positive deviant\. It was a multi\-step process where we actually looked first and foremost in the data set and then once we identified couple of possible outliers like positive deviants, then we picked few of the municipalities and conducted A qualitative interview site visit observations and really tried to scoop in what are these practices that make positive deviants stand out\.

### [[3:05]] Thank you very much Ardita, that's very useful\. And please tell us more about the tools and methods that you developed or you adapted along the journey\.

[[tools:Human centered design]]
So in social sciences, positive deviant is a method that has been used for a while\. Accelerator lab together with University of Manchester and GIZ they work to develop this method of data power positive deviance where you are actually basing the initial understanding about the positive deviant based on large data sets\. So this is sort of a prerequisite to start with the methodology itself and it was used in six countries in the world\. We were the 7th one to use and it was never used in the context of North Macedonia\. What I saw there was a very good correlation I would say between a mapped positive deviant and a mapped solution, because the positive deviant is already something that has found the solution in the given ecosystem, how to function and how to work properly with the given challenge\. So for me it was like a double the motivation to see and really look into details about financial management at local level municipalities and how we can actually learn from these good practices, these positive deviants and if we can create actionable knowledge for other municipalities that that they can follow\. So one of the very interesting results of this process was that we were able to identify some aspects of human capital like capacities of financial officers in municipalities, what it requires to be a successfully successful municipality in terms of financial management\. Had to do a lot with human capacities\. Had to do a lot with how the positioning of the financial officer in municipalities is\. Whether this person is able to say to the mayor, no, we can't do this within this current year, but also had to do a lot with how municipalities were looking into planning, programming and spending their budget for the citizens\. So we looked at various levels\. And then another point that came out as a result was that municipalities that were identified as successful, they used some sort of tools for accounting\. They were able to put their budget into the software, use it, make sure that there is different levels of responsibilities, of approvals\. And also transparency is one of the other elements that really spoke us, spoke to us very loudly\. This process was a very rewarding one, especially after we initially published the results\. There were a lot of municipalities being proud of themselves, like providing a lot of things on the media\. We were chosen municipality that does solid financial management in the country and they were actually able to showcase their success in the local media, in the national media and they were able to talk about how this actually their work in the municipality has given them an added value in terms of the work that they are doing\.

### [[6:35]] Wonderful, Ardita\. Apart from diffuse, diffuse in within the municipality, what were the other actors who were interested that you could diffuse, you were able to diffuse and catalyze the solution to them\.

[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
OK\. So we as a country have specific regulations about transparency and accountability of the municipalities especially with regard to financial management and financial data\. What we were able to see is that municipalities have different practices\. Some of the municipalities even though by law they are required to publish their expenditures, their balances every year\. Some of the municipalities did not put it into their website\. They had it somewhere in the office but not in their website\. Some of the other municipalities had it in their website but was not in searchable format\. So it was like APDF photo from a document that is there, it's written, but if you want to do some data mining, you are not able to do that data mining\. And then some of the other municipalities has had proper readable documents that you can download and then do your analysis\. So we saw a lot of levels of practices in this matter and I believe that what we produced as data was useful not only to municipalities itself, but also to civil society organizations\. Because this is a civil society organizations are the ones who are supporting helping watchdog in the municipalities about their performance\. And it's very interesting because the data for capital investments, how much you spent on capital investments and the data on how much you spent for services actually comes to service and then surface\. And then you are able to see these differences\. You are able to lobby\. You are able as a citizen empowered to act upon the next budget discussions into your community\. Because now you are able to see how the divisions are made and whether these divisions are actually something that I can benefit from as a citizen\.

### [[8:54]] Thank you so much\. So what is it that you would do differently if you are given a second chance to do that?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
That's a very interesting question\. Thinking about that, we had a challenge in the process because as we were working with the data, we had the new results of the census coming in\. And because of this, we had to hold on for our in our data for a while on our results for a while until the new data comes in and then we redo our analysis again in order to make sure that we have not done anything wrong in our interpretation\. On top of it, we didn't want our research to be obsolete in like 3 months because once you publish that and then within three months you have new census data coming in and the budgets of the municipalities are divided according to the population there is\. So it was some sort of a moment that we had to wait for three months and sleep over it\. I think what we could do differently next time is look at all possible ways on how we can support municipalities to generate real time data or open up all the existing data\. I think that what we did with this study is like we worked with them throughout\. We scooped a lot and perhaps a next step would be working with this municipalities encouraging them to open up data and be able to share as much as possible about real challenges that are happening\. But also understand about different dynamics that each municipality is having or the amount that they are able to collect from the from the taxation within the given region, amounts that are coming from central government etcetera, etcetera\.So that is something that I could consider that an added value would be would be great\.

### [[10:50]] Amazing\. Thank you so much Ardita for sharing with us\.

Thanks\.
