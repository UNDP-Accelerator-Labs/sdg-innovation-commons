Learning in Uncertainty: Tourism Recovery Across Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles
JUNE 20, 2023
1 Year, 3 Islands, 211 young people – the UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles, powered by its Accelerator Lab, has travelled across Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles and gathered knowledge about the unique tourism pathways, insights and stories of young people into a knowledge product – Learning in Uncertainty: Tourism Recovery across Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles.
This knowledge product outlines the learning cycle of the UNDP Mauritius and Seychelles Accelerator Lab and lessons learnt on tourism recovery in both countries. A special thanks goes to the grassroots individuals and communities involved in the local tourism value chains across Mauritius, Rodrigues, and Seychelles, who shared their roles, contributions, and lived experiences with the Accelerator Lab.
