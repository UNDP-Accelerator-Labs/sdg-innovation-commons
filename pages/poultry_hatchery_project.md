> Title of the innovation

Poultry Hatchery Project

> Brief description of the innovation

The main problem we are trying to solve is a shortage of local poultry products which has led to an increase in the cost of said products e.g. chicken meat &amp; eggs. The shortage stems from an erratic and often insufficient supply of chicks.
-	The only companies that currently supply village breed chicks to Mufulira are ZamHatch &amp; Hybrid whose demand is too high for them to satisfy.
-	To this end we engaged some local experts to help us build a Poultry incubator that has the capacity to incubate 10,000 chicken eggs at once. 
-	In addition we have a secondary incubator that acts as a hatcher.
-	The first incubator will incubate the eggs for 18 days; then for the final 3 days of the total 21 day incubation period, the eggs are shifted to the secondary hatcher where the chicks begin to hatch.
-	The two breeds we are targeting are village chicken breeds, the Sasso breed &amp; the Kuroiler breed which are a natural alternative to the common commercially produced ‘White’ broiler chickens.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

'-	The business is very commercially viable in that the most costly input is electric supply which is a Fixed Cost. So once that is covered profit margins can grow exponentially. Once the local farmers have bought as many of our chicks as they can we can even export the excess chicks to neighboring Congo DR as we ae located in Mufulira which is a border town with the DRC on the Copperbelt Province.
-	For a start we intend to load about 2000 eggs into the incubator on a weekly basis. This will cost about (6×2000) K12,000 for each load.
-	Therefore in a month we can make 3 loads of 2000 each, allowing 1 week every month for maintenance works and cleaning. 
-	This then translates to 6000 eggs @ 70% hatchability rate = 4200 chicks per month.
-	The revenues add up to 4200 chicks @ K 15 each = K 63,000.
-	Monthly costs: Electricity - K4,500; Fuel (for the back-up generator) - K1,000; Administration costs – K15,000
-	Estimated gross profit = K42,500

> Technical Feasibility

'-	Much of what is required is already in place; we have a location, the equipment, the market and partnering suppliers.
-	The areas we may need to address concern the 2 withholding factors;
1.	Provision of a constant non-erratic power supply.
	To combat the erratic electricity supply we will need to buy a petroleum powered electricity generator and connect it to our system of incubators as back-up supply.
	In the long-term (depending on the profit margins we’re targeting 2024) we are targeting to buy big solar panels that can ensure at least 6 hours of electric supply.

2.	A constant supply of well-handled fertilized eggs. (fertilized eggs are ones that are able to hatch once incubated)
	To address this issue right now will require funding to be able to buy eggs from local farmers in bulk.
	In the long-run (the following year – 2023), it will require that we produce our own fertilized eggs that we can closer manage the egg handling and be able to produce an optimum number of eggs for the incubators’ capacity.
	This longer term solution requires that we become more proficient at producing our own feed in bulk.

> Anticipated Social Impact

'-	Well there’s a good number of beneficiaries;
a.	Local Farmers: They will be able to incubate their own fertilized eggs and/or buy chicks to enhance their own poultry rearing business.
-	Currently only ZamHatch and Hybrid supply chicks to Mufulira but not any hatching services.
-	There is also a local partner who produces feed for the village breed of chickens. The long-term vision we have is to eventually grow our own stock of chicks to sell and we would like to partner with the local feed-maker to enhance this project.
-	By making our own feed locally we will need to buy the raw materials e.g. soya beans, maize, dried fish; from our local farmers and traders which further supports our local businesses.
 
b.	Our Company – BioBreed Industries: Will be able to expand our project to commercially viable levels.
c.	Community: Will have a readily available source of incubating &amp; hatching services as well supply of village chicks.
-	In the long-run (the following year - 2023) we hope to grow some of our chicks to supply ourselves with a steady supply of fertilized eggs as well as grow the chicks to sell as chicken meat.
-	Unlike the commercial produced broiler chickens that take 1 month to grow and be ready for sale, these village chicken breeds take at least 3 months to be ready for sale as meat and 5 months to begin laying their own eggs. This shows that the village chicken breeds are a more natural, healthy and nutritious alternative to the white broiler meat.
