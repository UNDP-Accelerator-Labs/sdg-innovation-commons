## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> Hypothesis: IF... THEN....

H1. Data &amp; IT community is willing to utilize its technical and analytical knowledge in order to help better understand the depopulation topic in Serbia. H2: The academic community and community of academic researchers are open to applying new methodologies (data sets and technology) to the depopulation problem in order to further their understanding of it. H3. Without the assistance of UNDP, the multidisciplinary teams needed to adequately address this challenge will naturally arise. H4. Offering incentives to interdisciplinary teams will greatly encourage them to participate in the challenge. H5. The precise results of the successful Data Challenge teams will be very helpful in understanding the subject of depopulation. Meetings and conversations with stakeholders from the data &amp; IT community and academia helped to confirm the first two hypotheses. After teams presented their final project proposals, the third was confirmed, proving that almost all effective applicants had naturally established multidisciplinary teams. A follow-up interview with teams who applied verified the fourth hypothesis and the two final hypotheses. It's important to note that 50 teams submitted applications in the first round. This figure has surpassed even the most optimistic projections, which is remarkable given the complexity of the depopulation issue.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> What is the learning intent of the activity?

UNDP Accelerator Lab strives to enhance collective intelligence and accelerate digital innovation by bringing together a diverse group of people, data, and technology. We think that by harnessing the unique strengths of each component and promoting collaboration, we can develop innovative solutions that outperform any single effort.

> What is the object being tested?

Multidisciplinary teams teams working collaboratively to leverage their diverse skills, knowledge, and expertise in the design and development of data-driven/digital solutions to address Serbian depopulation.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity?

The experimental activity's timeline began with the initial idea and preparation phase, which occurred at the end of 2019. In 2020, the Challenge Call was launched, which called for data-driven/digital solutions to tackle depopulation in Serbia. The year 2021 saw the announcement of the winning solutions at a live event, marking the conclusion of the experimental activity.

> Describe the methodology of the experimental activity. For example, sample size and selection; data collection technique; collaboration; randomization technique; data analysis technique

1. Research phase: The research phase consisted primarily of desk research on depopulation and served as an initial stepping stone in the development of the Challenge Call. The primary goal of this phase was to identify clusters of relevant subtopics in order to comprehend and describe potential thematic areas for teams that should apply for the call. We identified and described relevant local and global datasets that could be used as data sources by teams. This dataset collection was extensive, but it was far from the complete list of all available datasets on the topic of depopulation (and related topics). Finally, we investigated similar global projects centred on the topic of using alternative datasets and, ideally, combining them with traditional datasets to gain a better understanding of population dynamics. 2. Preparatory phase: During the preparatory phase, we established a series of hypotheses, the majority of which were validated during this and subsequent phases. 3. Implementation phase: During this phase, both the initial application form and the full application form were created, and the call was publicly opened and promoted. TypeForm, an online service for creating advanced forms, was used to create both forms. It was chosen because of its customizability and features, with branching being the most important feature we sought. The forms' design is also very sleek, conveying professionalism and attention to detail. All applications were recorded in the TypeForm system and automatically forwarded to a Google Sheet that was created for this purpose. Both phases were subjected to a jury review. Following the jury's comments and insights, video interviews with four selected teams were scheduled via Zoom. InfostudData, PopInsight, Bootstrappers, and Geoanalitiari were among the invited teams (for more information on the winning teams, visit https://www.rs.undp.org/content/serbia/en/home/presscenter/articles/2020/depopulation-data-challenge-winners.html).

> Any observations about the methodology?

On the AccLab website, the methodology used for each data-driven/digital solution that won the Depopulation Data Challenge is detailed. The methods used to develop and implement these solutions are described in detail at https://lab.undp.org.rs/depopulation-data-challenge/. These resources provide valuable insight into the teams' approach and the efficacy of their methodologies.

> What was the total time it took to implement

2020 - 2021 

> What was the approximate total budget used for the experiment (in US dollars)

The approximate total budget used for the Depopulation Data Challenge experiment was around 70,000 USD. This amount covered the costs of implementing the four winning solutions of the Data Challenge, as well as consultants hired for social media and other promotional activities
