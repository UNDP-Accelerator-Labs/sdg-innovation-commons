The Moana Taka Partnership is a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment (SPREP) and The China Navigation Company (CNCo). The partnership allows for CNCo vessels to carry containers of recyclable waste from eligible Pacific Island ports, without charge, to be sustainably treated or recycled in appropriate ports in Asia Pacific.   This helps address some of the issues the Pacific Islands face regarding waste management barriers such as lack of waste treatment/ recycling infrastructure and geographical limitations.  21 countries are eligible for these opportunities: American Samoa, Cook Islands, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna.  How it works: Swire Shipping, the liner business division of CNCo, regularly repositions empty shipping containers across the Pacific, which presents an ideal opportunity to transport recyclable waste out from these islands to other countries with suitable infrastructure.
