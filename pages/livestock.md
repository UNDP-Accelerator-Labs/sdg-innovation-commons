> Brief description of the innovation

Ordering of of domestic animals in rural areas and find market in urban areas. Not only I, myself I will also be involved in raring of domestic animals at medium scale.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This will generate income because I will have a lot of customers buying my domestic animals which I have found it that they are on demand especially in urban area. The prize can help me with funds of which am lacking currently.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation has been designed in such a way I will be connected to the butcheries who may need my livestock in urban and to raise the standard of my products I will also be connected to the the hygiene which will make sure that my livestock is free from diseases. My implementation plan is that once I have the prize I will have to go for nessary orders and start  my business which will include broilers to be supplied in my geographic location since they are on demand but there is lack of provision, goats, pig, and sheep which can be ordered and kept for some few weeks for health purposes and get ready for market in a monthly period

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation can improve the lives others in that I will be able to provide the market for small scale farmers in rural areas who are far from the market places to sell their products. On the other side people who are also in need of my products will be able to find them readily available.
