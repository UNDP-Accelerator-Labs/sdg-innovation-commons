- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

All we ask for is for our president Mr HH to help us youth empowerment money to start managing our own business... since we have been working in booths we know how this business is... it’s very profitable and reliable... so if we have our own booths we can even earn a lot of money to pay for our college fees and become independent women just like our Vice Presidents and all the women who helped fight for this country to make it a better place 👏

Oh god I said the plan in the previous question

If we have our own business as youths... we will be able to pay for our college fees and help our single mothers out there .. and also we will be giving opportunities to our fellow youths.. the opportunity to work with us and later on give them also the capital to manage there booth also
