[[ai_summary:Pierre Antoine, head of experimentation at the accelerated lab in Haiti, discussed various R&D activities conducted in the country, focusing on waste management. A national survey and workshops with stakeholders, including professors, municipalities, and street vendors, revealed a gap in data, which hindered decision-making and waste removal from streets. The research utilized collective intelligence, inclusive approaches, and mapping tools like Cobo toolbox and Kobo. The outcomes of the R&D journey include bridging gaps in data on waste management, developing a community of practice, and identifying local innovators. Pierre Antoine reflected that if starting again, he would focus on launching a national inventory to identify main inventors in waste management, aiming for quicker results.]]

# Haiti Waste Management Accelerated Lab Initiative

### [[0:00]] Tell me your name and title and then say I give consent to this recording\.

My name is Pierre Antoine\. I'm the head of experimentation for the accelerated lab in Haiti\. I give consent to to this interview\.

### [[0:18]] Great\. Over to you\.

### [[\[0:20]] All right\. Nice to meet you\. Pierre Antoine\. How are you doing today?

I'm doing pretty good today\.

### [[0:28]] We're going to talk about some activities related to R&D that you have conducted in Haiti\. Can you tell me more about some R&D activities that you have done there?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
Yes, at, at at first I will, I will consider to start our work on waste management in Haiti\. So when we when we at first we have conducted a brainstorming with the the head of the units, I'm talking about the head of a unit for the, the program UNDP program in Haiti\. And then we identified that waste management was a major issue at first\. We have conducted since making workshop where we, we grouped all the main stakeholders in a room discussing about waste management\. And I'm, I'm talking about the the professors from universities, representative of Ng OS and also, you know, representative of the municipalities\. And we have also even the street vendors in the room discussing about waste management\. And then one of the key element that came out of these of these first initiative of the first step to really deep in a dive deep into the, the the the waste station in Haiti is that we are we find out that there was a gap in data\. There is a there, there was a data gap which was hampering or Hanford the decision making and and the field of of waste\.

### [[2:36]] I see\. So yes\. Can you tell me more about the context of waste management in Haiti, how bad it is or how how it is unique in a sense? Can you tell me more about that?

[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
In Haiti, the waste is very calm, complex issue\. Very, it is very complete complicated because in Haiti, despite all the investments in the field of waste, only around 10 to 20% of waste have been removed from the street by the by the yeah, by the by the public sector, by the government\. So what we we when the situation, so we were trying to see what what is wrong, what is wrong because NT because the donors this invest a lot of of money in the field of waste\. So when we see that there was the, the, the problem was so complicated, then we conducted a national survey\. We have data, we have mapped all the dumping sites and also we have data about the institutions working in the, in the field of waste\. And from there we, we are, we were designing a portfolio actually experimentations you were talking about mapping, you know, the, the hotspot or yeah, waste and so on\.

### [[4:26]] What kind of tool did you do, did you use to do that?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
We conducting the, the sense, making that the sense making workshop, we grouping all the main stakeholders\. Then also we, we, we used as well some, I can call it a concept, a context analysis, but it was an exploratory work\. It analysing the context of, of, of Western Haiti\. And then I can say that we use like or the tools like Cobo toolbox\. And then we have also the, the, the kitcheners, all of them are tools that were, and we have trained data collectors and I think we have the context analysis and then the, the like the, the Kobo toolbox and then the, all the kitcheners, all of them are, are the tools that we, we, we, we used to, to conduct this, this massive data collection\.

### [[5:41]] Interesting\. And how did you make sure that you know the diversity of representation in term of the stakeholders was was was represented and what kind of tactics you used to have everybody in the the room with you\.

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
First, we, we were, we were lucky enough to be to, to, to, to study in our, in our country\. And we know the, me, I have a background in, in Agunumi\. That means in, in my university there is a department called environment and resource in natural resource management\. There is this, this department\. And the first tactic was to, to reach out to, to some of the teachers\. Then from there we have a lot of ideas where where to go and who we should we should we should include in our lease of the main stakeholders\. And also from my knowledge of the local context also I know the municipalities are the one mostly responsible to remove the waste from the street\. So I go to the municipalities and then as UNDP also, you know, doing UNDP is well renowned on the ground\. So as UNDP when someone sees source as UNDP, you know, the the municipality easily opens it their doors to to us\.

### [[7:24\]]] That's great\. Can you tell me more about like the, the principle that guided your R&D in, in term of like how maybe you make sure that everybody's voices are respected, everybody's opinions are respected? Do you do you develop environment that ensure this kind of things?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
First we were trying to, we, we tried as much as we can to use the intelligence, the, the collective intelligence because like you know, we have, we, we have the data\. I was talking earlier about the context analysis\. That means we have the data\. Then also we have the people, we know the people, we know the people\. So when talking about the, the, the, the collective intelligence, we do as much as we could\. So to be inclusive in our approach, if I can say it that way\. So we make sure that even the street vendors, the, the street vendors, the, the, the public market vendors, the, the open public markets, I don't know if you know, if you see what I'm talking about, We make sure that those, those people are representative\. They have a seat in our work\. And then the, the for the intellectual part, the, the, the, the posters from the universities and also NT OS we, we even have representative from the US MB C yes, that's awesome\.

### [[9:03]] So what are the skills you were talking about? You know, the, the fact that you have some networks, you also have some already a background on agronomy, some connections\. What are the other essential skills that was needed to do conduct your R&D personally?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
Me, I have also earlier before joining UNDP, even when I first started in UNDPI started as a monitoring and evaluation officer\. That means I have knowledge in gathering data and data analysis\. So it was not a big issue for me to conduct this work\. And also also I'm, we have someone also from, from external and I'm talking about the head of, of exploration has background and research and, and, and development\. So as a team, I cannot say that I, I did all the work by myself, but as the team we were, we have enough skills and that analysis and conducting research to, to do the, the, the, the work that we have done on, on waste management\.

### [[10:26]] Awesome\. That's, that's awesome\. Like team role research, analytics, data collection and so on, right\. So what was the outcome of this R&D journey? What was the final product that you have done?

[[principles:Data sharing]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Be open by default]]
So I think we can be proud that we have at least bridged the gaps in term of data on waste management\. That's the first thing that we so powered out of it\. And then we we can talk as well\. We can talk as well about data and empowerment\. So not only we, we, we can say that, we can say that we are proud of that we manage to put the gaps internal data in the field of force management, but also we are using our own data to to take actions\. For example, we are developing a community of practice in the field of waste\. And we have identified many stakeholders, many local innovators who are interested in in this\. And we are still, we are in constant interactive with them\. And then we are also working with them to to develop a, a community, a community base with, with management system to test to experiment for two main cities in Haiti\. So I think the work that we have done really direct us where directs us to work this community risk management system that we are now developing for two cities in Haiti building like an ecosystem, yes, that wants to make some positive change\.

### [[12:28]] Exactly, exactly\. And then another question, what would you do differently if you had to start again? Would, is there anything that you would want to change the way that you you conducted this research?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Portfolio approach]]
So I would go, I will be straightforward\. I would go directly on on target because you know as an accelerated lab, we want to be to be faithful to the app, to our approach\. We are very passionate about approach\. Sometimes we are, it takes time to apply all the steps of the approach\. So when we finish with the with the with the data collection, we did not have enough evidence to take actions\. You see what we did, we just launched a, we last year we launched a national inventory, a national inventory\. I think to what I would do differently if I should start all over again\. I would launch at first a national adventory to identifying the main inventors, the main innovators in the field of ways\. This way I would, I would go quicker and the results will come more quickly than than the the ones that we are having now\.

### [[13:58]] Interesting\. Yes, thank you\. The last two questions, I think it's gonna be about like how did the policy makers, the municipality reacted to your work in, in, in, in this area? And also how did you communicate about what you did toward the other stakeholders like the street vendors or the, the, the results of our work is our Bible\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
When we are going to the stakeholders, this is we are going with our work\. We say this is how the situation is and people are very, very interested in, in, in our data, in our data\. And also they they used to build the on the data\. But the before the, the, the, the, the problems that we are having 980, we have a lot of demons, a lot of foot rest and what we were going\. Unfortunately the the problem occurred, but it is what it is\. We had a lot, we have demons from many different municipalities and we have also demand from the, the Ministry of Environment\. So they wanted to build on our on our data\. So when they wanted to like develop projects with our data with, without even the experimentation phase, they wanted to, you know, to, to build on our data to do, to, to try to, to change the, the, the which, or to improve with management in AET\. So I think now as we are having in talking about the stakeholders, talking about the political context, we are having improvement\. I think the, the work that we have done will continue to like influence the decision making in some in one way or the other because you know, we are here, we are on the ground\. We are also advocating to the stakeholders so they can use more data, our data also in their in their in their decision making to improve waste management in Haiti\. Hopefully we get better with the R&D that you have done\.

### [[16:22]] That's the end of the interview\. Thank you very much for your time and your insights and congratulations for the work you have done\.

OK\. Thank you so much for having me for this interview\.
