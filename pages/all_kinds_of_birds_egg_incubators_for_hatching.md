> Brief description of the innovation

Egg incubators is a Birds egg machine by which eggs are hatched artificially, in the absence of an animal. Fertile Eggs are insert inside the machine  before end of 4th day after the bird has produce the egg.  Even if it's artificial it hatch the egg exactly period to the normal animal seated on eggs does.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It generate income in a way where by people who keep e. g chickens bring there eggs for incubation services and they have to pay for each egg to be hatched. Provide self employment by using it. And again it boost the chicken production within short period of time which means they will be no shortage of chickens on the market for people to buy.  Once someone (anyone) buys the machine It can help alot of people to be producers suppliers of different kind of birds. And this can lead to the growth of poultry business on the market. This innovation has no harm to the environment because it uses hydro power and solar power hence anyone can afford to use it and grow there businesses.

> Technical Feasibility

It's designed using iron square tubes and metal  flat sheet (measuring, cutting and join them together to a planed shape e. g square or rectangle. And for  the prototype it was first designed using wood materials which is one of the best design which is less cost.

> Anticipated Social Impact

People will not depend on a job for the daily life survival. Because one having the incubator, will become the supplier of any form of birds  on the market e.g chicken, quails, ducks, turkeys and many more and offering incubation services.( income will be generated). As for the current market alot of people are finding it easy to start any agriculture related business because of high demand for agriculture products in our daily life. Having an incubator which now on demand. is among the best way to of generating income on the market.
