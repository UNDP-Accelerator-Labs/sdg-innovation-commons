The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry is rapidly proliferating in Bangladesh, and in this context, there is a critical need to generate practical and useful evidence on the skills demanded by BPO employers that would enable them to offer various high-end services among international clients. There is a clear lack of knowledge around the current and future skill requirements of the domestic BPO service providers in Bangladesh.  To this end, the Accelerator Lab is conducting a firm level survey titled "Assessment of Skills Demand and Skills Gaps in the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) Industry of Bangladesh" to understand the in-demand skills required by BPO employers in Bangladesh, across various firm sizes (e.g., small, medium, and large). At least 50 firms are being surveyed as part of the study. The survey will also identify future skill requirements by BPO employers in order to boost competitiveness and exports.
