> Title of the innovation

Farmer, farming as business in the fields of gardening and poultry..the idea is to become a center of modern  Innovation and technology for the communities surrounding us to learn..

> Brief description of the innovation

Thank you so very much for allowing me to describe our innovations in our farming as a business as we became employers in our community.
Taking advantage of the technology around the world we are prevaladge ,as we are flexible and allow ourselves to learn new things as they come for as long as they are for the betterness or our firm and the community..
Things like drip irrigation system, rain hose irrigation system.
The use of non chemical fertilizers (organic)this will include the feed will feed our chickens in return community will gain all the minerals and proteins..

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Thank you,we are going to generate an income because we are in business of farming vegetables and chickens..
Therefore we are going to be selling our products,and in return will make money as a firm..on the other side our business is a two way thing we are going to employ the people in the community and be able to do some charity work eg at the clinics and schools..

We are not going to be the employers but we will be a training center in our community and this is going to make the community benefit In therms of knowledge in this will turn into money.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovations are all designed and planed on the foundation laying already..
We are a group of determined and  energetic young men .
We have planned to create employment on our own and that means we do all the work by ourselves in the initial stage ..
Till we start selling and gained more knowledge then will we be able to employ a second set of youths in our community..

And this will go on until everyone in our community is trained and supported to start there own businesses and be able to employ others..
This is how we are going to do it

> Anticipated Social Impact

Thank you once more..in everything we do  when a community has knowledge then we know each individual can easily develop and this is the platform we intend to implement..
Once we have implemented we are assured of success and since people will be able to see our works and be able to be trained more people will improve..
The market is plenty because we are surrounded by three giant mines with a high population that feed of vegetables on a daily basis..
We are targeting the open market as well where our community buy the commodities on a daily basis..
