> Description of the solution

Lof See Company Limited, designed an artificial shade canopy to mimic natural tree branches and leaves. Its advantage is that it provides cooling along with pleasant, dappled sunlight. a research team from Kyoto University in Japan developed what they called a ‚ÄúFractal Shade‚Äù, designed to mimic the cooling properties of natural leaves and branches. Lofsee Co., Ltd. now sells the developed product as COMOLEVI ‚ÄúForest Canopies‚Äù. This design is able to cool the ground beneath it up to 15 degrees Celsius while keeping the shade itself 20 degrees Celsius cooler than building roofs.
