> Title of the innovation

Food supplements

> Brief description of the innovation

The idea behind food supplements, also called dietary or nutritional supplements, is to deliver nutrients that may not be consumed in sufficient quantities. Food supplements can be vitamins, minerals, amino acids, fatty acids, and other substances delivered in the form of pills, tablets, capsules, liquid, etc.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As a supplement provider, my target market will be sports enthusiasts, gym-goers, health gurus, health-conscious individuals, the elderly, those with disabilities, and those who utilize nutrition as a daily health tool. These consumers are typically found at sports complexes, outdoor recreational areas and health provision buildings.
A supplement store makes money by selling sports nutrition products, dietary supplements, health products and health foods. Some supplement stores may sell fresh shakes and smoothies. To make additional money, a supplement store may connect with a local fitness complex. In doing so, they can secure additional premises sales while garnering additional revenue from a complex's courses, sponsorships and memberships. 
Am going to make this business more profitable by starting an affiliate program. I will Promote my products via nearby fitness centers. Then, offer discounts for gym-goers who enter my store via word of mouth. If I will network efficiently, I will design a program capable of sustaining growth. Whenever the chance arises, I will invest in my own product line. In doing so, I will reduce sourcing costs. I will also also create superior products which are well-priced.
Some of the additional value of dietary supplements to the people includes

-Maintain their general health
Support mental and sports-related performance. 
-Provide immune system support
Yet certain individuals may need them especially, including:

Women Who Are Pregnant or May Become Pregnant – Women who may get pregnant should consume 400 micrograms of folate on a daily basis, either from food or supplements, to safeguard against birth defects. Folate is a B vitamin, needed to produce genetic materials, including DNA. It’s available in prenatal vitamins that may also contain helpful levels of iron and calcium.
Older Adults – As we age we may need certain vitamins and minerals more than younger people. These could include calcium and Vitamin D, which are important for bone strength, Vitamin B-6 that helps form red blood cells, and Vitamin B-12 that helps maintain nerves and red blood cells.
People with Food Allergies or Restricted Diets – If you are vegan, have food allergies or an intolerance to lactose, or have difficulty digesting or absorbing nutrients, dietary supplements may provide you with important benefits.

> Technical Feasibility

Supplements can be derived from plant or animal products. A lab will take a fruit and extract a vitamin from it, for example. In the synthetic production of supplements, a vitamin (like vitamin A) can be synthesized from, for example, an organic compound (like acetone). According to How Products Are Made, there is no structural difference between the supplements created by these different methods.

There are many steps in the process of making a vitamin: according to How Products Are Made, a vitamin manufacturer will purchase raw vitamins and other ingredients from distributors, and then they will check it and blend it if need be.

The process contains many steps. The vitamins may go through a wet granulation stage, which helps the vitamin be properly sized. They are weighed and then properly dispensed. For example, at this stage, a specific amount of powder is put into its capsule. They are then polished (cleaned of debris or dust) and inspected. Depending on the kind of vitamin form—be it a tablet or coated—the vitamin manufacturing process may be changed. There is usually a quality control check at several different steps.
