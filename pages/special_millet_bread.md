> Brief description of the innovation

This business idea is developing a ready to eat special millet bread and noodles from finger millet flour. This is a new venture to be undertaken in Zambia as there is no company that is making finger millet bread. The idea is to blend wheat flour with millet flour and produce special millet bread. Finger is among one of the major cereals grown in Zambia. Bread is mainly produced from imported wheat which makes it expensive. Finger millet however, is very good for people who are diabetic and hypertensive hence this finger millet bread innovation. The grain is known to be nutritional and superior to other mainstream cereals like maize and wheat with substantial amounts of iron, calcium and zinc. We desire a assistance that will harness our strengths and abilities and find ways and means to scale up our innovation and assist us solve complex challenges that our people might have. We want our brand to experience growth, be more profitable, and drive customer satisfaction and retention. We want to diversify our revenue streams, hence special millet bread innovation.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The retail bakery industry in Zambia has recently experienced rapid growth. The consumption of bakery products is throughout the year. We aim to offer high quality bakery products at a competitive price to meet the demand of the low to middle - income local market area residents. Bakery products are always in demand. Our aim is to establish a large regular customer base, which will be the dominant target market. This will establish a healthy, consistent revenue base to ensure stability of the business. 
Almost every household make use of products from millet or consumes them in many different processed forms. In essence, special millet bread should be able to sell to as many people. The demand and market for bread is growing very fast in Zambia and is expected to explode in the coming years. Bread is currently selling at K12.00. Bakery business is basically a profitable business and profit margins range from 35 to 47%. We anticipate our sales to grow at an annual rate of 14.5% through the next three years. The special millet bread production will bring in sales of K1, 512,000 annually.

> Technical Feasibility

Already millet flour is a huge success and we want to go further by producing special millet bread from the millet flour that we produce. This product has a target market that is not difficult to define or limited in number, therefore, will not struggle to make a profit. This Innovation is intended to endlessly and relentlessly benefit people who are diabetic / hypertensive and increase the easy availability of nutritious foods. A recent study published in the International Journal of Current Microbiology and Applied Sciences highlighted that millet flour can be successfully incorporated as an ingredient for bakery products as it does not affect the overall sensory acceptability. More importantly it enhances the product's nutritional value that non-enriched wheat flour would not do. We want to implement this project because we will be adding more value to finger millet flour which we produce through the baking of special millet bread. We are going to explore all available means to promote special millet bread.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The success of a business encompasses more than just the financial data that acts as proof of its success. However, the social impact a business has on a community can affect the bottom line of a business and much more. More than 300 small scale farmers will be engaged to grow finger millet thereby increasing their household incomes and food security. Our employment levels will also increase from the current 10 to 30 permanent workers and more than 80 temporary workers. As the business grows, more employees will be engaged. The business model will incorporate smallholder farmers into the agricultural value chain. These farmers will have a ready market for their produce. Once a crop has finished growing and is harvested, we will collect it from the farmers and transport to our processing house. Our operations is expected to result into increased intake of raw materials because of the assured market from rural farmers especially the women and youth, most of whom grapple with the challenge of where to sell their produce. Farmers will receive favourable prices for their produce as we cut off middle men, thereby making our products comparatively cheaper.
