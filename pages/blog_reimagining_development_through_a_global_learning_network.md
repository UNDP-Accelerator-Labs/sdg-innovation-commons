Reimagining Development through a Global Learning Network
JULY 6, 2022
The UNDP Accelerator Lab Network is moving the needle forward towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a new way – by creating and sharing insights to learn what works and what doesn’t in sustainable development.

In 2021, we reflect on a jam-packed year of furthering the Lab Network’s role in achieving the SDGs and surfacing first-of-their-kind ideas on how we can work towards systems transformation. A deeper understanding of the challenges unearthed from the Network indicates that we are tapping into the groundwater of sustainable development.
