## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Employment Formalization
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Identify barriers to the formalization of employment, particularly of female emloyment and in the recycling, construction, domestic work and apparell industries.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In Paraguay, aproximately 70% of employment is informal, meaning dependent workers lack access to social security or self-employed workers do not have tax payer ID status. In general, this is a highly vulnerable population with insecure labor and economic conditions and limited access to resources for development. Concentrating development efforts in this sector can create win-win outcomes where social equity and economic efficiency are enhanced simultaneously.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

A variety of official data are available: the permanent household survey, time use surveys, administrative data from the national tax agency (SET) and the social security agency (IPS), the World Bank high frequency survey executed during the pandemic, original surveys conducted by AccLabPy (to date: n=1200 nationally representative survey of social capital, trust and vulnerability, n=28 survey on trust among informal recycles; planned: n=1600 survey of recycling behavior representative of Asuncion metropolitan area).

We utilize cultural probes, semi-structured interviews, and participatory workshops to systematically collect qualitative data that serves to characterize and contextualize this challenge, map potential solutions. With regards to informal construction employment we discovered that the gendered and class-bounded norms that comprise the informal regulation of the employment construction industry reduce workers willingess and interest to contribute to social insurance. With regard to recycling, we discovered that recycling workers value the flexibility of their work because it allows them to draw an income while also attending reproductive work in their households and investing in their studies, that households are ill-equipped and lack information to adequately sort recyclable waste, and that a lack of trust between households and recyclers is a barrier to improving the system.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The lab brings an interdisciplinary empirical and participatory focus to an issue that is generally addressed through a normative and legalistic perspective. We are able to leverage academic perspectives to generate knew empirical evidence and spur public policy innovation.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

"How can we increase access to social insurance and improve the economic and physical security of employment in Paraguay's informal economy, particularly for women and in the recycling, construction, domestic work, and apparel industries?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These methods form part of an integrated methodology that begins by discovering barriers and opportunities for development with qualitative methods, continues with exploration of innovative solutions, and culminates with prototyping and controlled experimentation.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The informal sector is tremendously heterogenous and so are the barriers to development and improved security within it. These data help characterize and contextualize the challenge and illuminate a development path in a way that would be impossibly costly, using survey data. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This work could lead to renewed approaches to employment formalization and labor regulation within the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and their many allied agencies. The lessons about recycling could also be adopted by municipal government, educational institutions, or the Ministry of Environment.
