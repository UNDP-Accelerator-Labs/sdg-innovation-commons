> Brief description about the identified local solution:

Producing Drinking Water and Creating Livelihood Opportunities in Iraq. The challenge: High level of water salinity in Iraq leading to a lack of access to clean drinking water. The Solution: With their Solar Desalination Module, entirely produced locally, Aquaba aims to tackle the high level of water salinity and contamination in Iraq. The technology is made of stainless steel and glass. It is a simple water treatment method using solar distillation. Each module can produce up to 7 liters of drinking water/day. Aquaba is also creating livelihood opportunities by building the capacity of local Iraqi manufacturers/engineers to produce and distribute the devices in Iraq ensuring localisation of knowledge and local ownership of this solution. A USD 10k grant has been awarded to pilot this solution in partnership with ACF in Iraq. Target Population: Host communities affected by water salinity
