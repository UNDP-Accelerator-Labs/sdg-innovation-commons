## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Economification & Gamification of Home Recycling | Big Bet
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the current economic situation in Syria is resulting in an increase in improper waste disposal sites, a disregard for environmental issues which may become compounded and more complex to resolve if not tackled as well as an increase in informal workers in this sector.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The situation has been worsening over the past 10 years, a general per-occupation with economic and social issues has resulted in environmental issues receiving minimal attention. Yet, an increase in waste related health problems is bringing this problem back to the forefront. Interestingly, Syrian society had a complex societal response to dealing with various forms of environmental waste ranging from recycling used eggshells all the way to old home electronic equipment. Currently, most of this system is dampened in some areas and completely forgotten in others. Due to the working economic situation, the number of informal waste pickers has who are in need of healthy and safe working conditions has increased. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Across different kinds of home produced waste the majority of surveyed households only re-use them and less than 10% fully recycle.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab can really assist in resolving this by engaging all stakeholders in a hackathon event that comes up with a solution to this complex problem. This problem, however, definitely requires some form of economification and gamification to encourage behavior which the Accelerator Lab is best suited to guide the process. By mapping the work of informal waste workers the accelerator lab is creating an opportunity for future work to find ways to organize the work of informal waste workers and protect them from exploitation. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Can solving a home waste recycling problem create ripples of positive change in society? Follow the journey of the Accelerator Lab in Syria who are using economification and gamification to introduce amazing interventions at key pain points in the recycling supply chain.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What current and traditional recycling practices exist? How are barriers preventing people from recycling and what are the motivations?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We really need to understand what factors changed the social behaviours towards the negative.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Motivations and barriers of recycling within households  Accurate data on the location of formal and informal waste disposal sites.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What current reverse supply chains exist that can be tapped into?  Who can be used as a champion of recycling within communities?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We need to use these in order not to duplicate previous work and link to existing networks. Moreover, it is important to understand the opinion of society on how the problem can be resolved.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is minimal recorded data on this topic.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can the design of the collection point affect the amount of recycling? What reward mechanisms will allow for better adoption of improved recycling practices?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We need to use these in order to come up with actual interventions and solutions. It is absolutely necessary to come up with a solution that is embedded in champions within society.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Minimal work done on mapping user journeys and recycling supply chain.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The 100 day challenge will definitely benefit our stakeholders and UNDP staff in creating innovative approaches to resolving this complex issue. However, once we work with our champions (who appear to be mothers and children from our preliminary survey), we will be able to scale this initiative to benefit the entire city of Aleppo as a case study and then move to a national scale.
