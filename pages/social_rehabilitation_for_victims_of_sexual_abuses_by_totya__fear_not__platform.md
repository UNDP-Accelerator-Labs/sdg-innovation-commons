Totya Platform supports victims of sexual abuse overcome trauma and get justice. The Social Problem
In Uganda 78% of the primary school children and 82% of the secondary school students report having experienced sexual abuse at school (UNICEF 2013). According to the Annual Crime Report (2013) of the Uganda Police Force, close to 10,000 cases of defilement were reported in 2013, making it the second leading crime committed in Uganda. Astoundingly, only four percent of perpetrators have been convicted. The number of unreported cases are unknown but are estimated to be as high as even 50,000 per year. Tens of thousands of girls suffer in silence, while the perpetrators are not prosecuted. Like in my own case, it often happens within family settings and this is what makes it so difficult and often impossible for the victims to talk about. They do not want to be responsible for breaking the family apart or they fear the consequences of e.g. not receiving school fees or basic needs. The fear that no one will believe often leaves the victim to blame herself, even hate herself sometimes for the rest of their live or committing suicide. Without being able to speak about the events, girls end up being affected for life about the way they perceive themselves, relationships with men and lack of self-belief. Janet Aguti was one of the girls sexually abused as a child. For 17 years she did not find the courage to tell anyone. She started to see her past as strength rather than a subject of shame and Today, Janet Aguti is the founder and driving force of Totya Platform!

The Solution
Totya Platform provides support to victims of sexual violence through Peer Groups, Life-Coaching- in person and online, as well as medical and legal support of severe cases. Anonymous interactions with survivors of sexual violence, who overcame sexual abuse themselves, enable users to speak about their experiences while receiving emotional care and self-help tools. Our service is free and available to those who were victims of sexual violence – no matter what type or by whom – in their childhood or as youths. Totya supports all questions and problems that have resulted from the sexual violence and its effects as an adult. Coaching sessions are absolutely confidential.
