> Brief description of the innovation

The Feed Pellets Production Mobile Plant is a mobile plant for making feed pellets. The plant comprises of hybrid systems/ machines that are electrically/ manually operated. The plant is made of two (2) Sections; The Pelleting or Granulating section and the Mixing section.
The pellet making section converts feed materials to pellets. The feed materials can be prepared using the other section (machine). The Mixing section mixes all feed materials before converting them to pellets.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Poultry farming accounts for the most meats produced in my country Zambia, and poultry management is challenging when it comes to feeding especially for small scale poultry farmers, so for this reason when we increase the production of feed it will help to make feed pellets available and reduce prices which will then make it easier to manage poultry farming because feed is one of the major cost in poultry production.
When feed production is high it can encourage people to venture in poultry businesses and this can create employment opportunities to some more individuals. This project makes it easier for individuals to manage feed pellets production because it is a mobile plant with necessary machines to make and produce feed pellets.

> Technical Feasibility

The Feed Pellets Production Mobile Plant is made up of 2 machines in 2 sections of different function/ purposes. All machines of this mobile plant have been designed to operate using electrical/ mechanical principles. The Pellet making machine operates using electricity power source and manually. The Mixing machine operates manually. The pellet making machine of this mobile plant operate using 12Volts on Prototype stage, and electricity (single phase) on the implementation/ commercial stage. Furthermore, a functioning prototype of this Feed Pellets Manufacturing Mobile Plant has been designed and made to operate using 12Volts.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This Feed Pellets Production Mobile Plant will encourage poultry/ livestock farmers to make their own feed because it comprises of machines that can work with or without electricity (can work electrically/ manually).
This innovation will benefit many poultry/ livestock farmers especially the small scale farmers who experience difficulties to manage their own poultry/ livestock farming in terms of feeding (animals/ birds) due to the uprising of feed prices, so when they have this mobile plant they can be making feed pellets. This project will also help to produce more animal feed in poultry/ livestock farming and bring about more employment/ business opportunities.
