> Title of the innovation

Zambia police information system

> Brief description of the innovation

This is an information system software I came up with to improve the way the Zambian police deals with information day to day at a station,this is to computerize information for better storage,access and retrieval when need since they still use paper based systems.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

For me,if this information system is implemented it would mean  business for me and employment for others who I can work with if the Zambia police agrees to a contract where I host the system and they pay for use otherwise it would be direct employment for me so we can work together,because I can maintain and enhance the system features.the added value of my system is the it's a multipurpose system from just storing information for convenient use to analyzing data.

> Technical Feasibility

This system is designed to replace the current paper system which may not be as effective as it was in 1970,my system is designed to be installed on computers that will deployed in police stations.they office record cases they will be stored on a local database which will be backing up on a main server,Yes I considered security the local database is level 2 encrypted so the information stored is only readable through the information system and not by the human eye.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This system will enable the Zambia police to effectively investigate,access and retrieve full criminal information about an individual even sourced from far provinces of Zambia,with that.confidence will be restored in the service from the citizens in the long run crimes will reduce.once this system is implemented there will be no more lost files situations time of prosecution,it will provide full information about a case from actual crime photos,voice statements typed statements to bond or transfer information.this is a game changer for Zambia police.
