Innovator: Celine Bareus of Malekula Island

Narrative: Celine Bareus started lending cash to friends about five years ago and it wasn’t a business plan back then, but mostly helping friends out. As days went by, more people started to access her services, proving it difficult to handle the demands of the growing number of clients. She consulted advisors and accountants to help her with a business idea, but she did not find the help that she needed. She thought around, her clients all used mobile phones, therefore the idea of developing an application came to her mind. And so, the CB Vanuatu microfinance business app was created and since then it has helped a lot of people with unstable financial statuses. At present, the business is growing, and every 10% of the businesses profit is donated to the communities around Vanuatu.
