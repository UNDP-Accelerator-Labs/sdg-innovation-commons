Through food production will improve the lives of target people and the rest of the contact society. This will enable the country to have more food and prices will eventually reduced due to more supply. With experience in agriculture as a Technical Advisor expert I will also link my clients to the potential market. This confirms that I personally know the market which completes the production value chain. And with help of good government agriculture policies will increase market for agriculture produce.
