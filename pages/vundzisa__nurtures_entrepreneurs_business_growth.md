Vundzisa (loosely translated to nurture to ripen) helps entrepreneurs nurture their business growth. They help apply the right business tools at the right time for entrepreneurs who need help with managing their enterprises. They support entrepreneurs in financial management, business compliance, as well as sales and marketing. Founded in 2019, Vundzisa, continued to operate along the COVID19 pandemic 2020. Vundzisa mostly helped businesses position themselves online, access simple digital bookkeeping software, and provided free consultations for ~5 businesses to make themselves essential during the unforeseen lockdown. In 2021, Vundzisa continues to help entrepreneurs to grow their businesses. The Vundzisa mission continues to contribute towards the achievement of SDGs 1  & 4  directly.
