Question quest, flash light ,smartphone wallpapers

> Brief description of the innovation

First of all am chatowa musukwa a grade 8 and of age 11 years who knows how to code apps creating smartphone apps have so far developed 10 and which have published 3 on a website called uptodown I failed to publish them on google playstore because I have little or no income so far have earned €21 through google Adsense which is k440 in zambian kwacha am just waiting for the money to reach €25 in which I will be eligible to buy a playstore app license, the apps are question quest it's found on uptodown

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I launched question quest on the internet just within 2 months through google adds it has brought m €21,I think I have the potential to create greater apps even video games that can be played on ps4 or xbox one the only thing is that I would like to have the right equipment and money for me to create this operations I think I can reach at a elite level because i do not only make this apps on a laptop I make them using a another phone because I don't have money for a laptop I have trained myself to create this apps using a phone so I would love if anyone can sponsor me and my talent to reach greater heights in my life, my dream is to create games that can be played on playstation ,xbox and nintendo for me to reach this hights I need international sponsorship to be sponsored abroad to create greater softwares that can change the world my and lastly I think this apps have the potential to give me revenue I earn money through clicks that appear on someone's smartphone who has downloaded my apps either question quest or 4G internet browser app .

> Technical Feasibility

All my apps are designed through coding them I code them using sketchware software since I don't have money to buy a pc or the right gardgets I use my brothers smartphone

> Anticipated Social Impact

All my apps can play a major role e.g question quest is a game that compromises of both school and general question challenge a individual to know and understand questions and my 4G browser app is just browser app that gives a individual experience to search and download variouse  contents on the internet.
