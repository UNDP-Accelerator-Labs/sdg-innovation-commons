INFORMALITY
AND THE
CIRCULAR
ECONOMY

What is the circular
economy?

The term circular economy is increasingly used to

describe activities aimed at reducing waste, optimising

resource use, and regenerating natural systems.

It promotes designing products that can be easily

repaired, repurposed, or disassembled, like modular

smartphones, furniture made from recycled materials,
or single-material packaging.1 Simply put, this approach
mimics nature’s way of ‘living within our means’. By

adopting circular strategies, we can cut down on

material usage, lower harmful emissions, protect

biodiversity, reduce pollution, and address social

inequalities stemming from our current linear
economic model.2

89% in Sub-Saharan Africa

• 71% in Asia and the Pacific

• 68% in the Middle East and North Africa

• 54% in Latin America and the Caribbean

• 37% in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

What role do informal
workers play in the circular
economy around the world?

Practitioners, researchers and other stakeholders widely
recognise that informal workers are the driving force
behind the circular economy in many countries.
They live out circular economy strategies in their

everyday jobs through second-hand reuse, repair, waste
collection, sorting, and recycling.3 For example, in Cairo,
the Zabbaleen community has created a complex waste

collection and recycling system, managing about 80% of
the city’s waste.4 Similarly, in India, numerous informal
workers repair and refurbish electronics, extending the

life cycle of products and reducing e-waste.

‘Informal’ is an umbrella term used to describe
a diverse set of activities and actors. According
to Women in Informal Employment: Globalising and

Organising (WIEGO), a global network focused on
empowering the working poor (especially women) in

the informal economy, the informal economy refers to

enterprises and individuals that are not regulated or
protected by the state.5

Discussions from the learning circles highlighted

that the informal sector is often excluded in circular
economy discussions, revealing a major blindspot.
Existing evidence estimates that over 60% of the

world’s workforce and 80% of businesses operate in
the informal sector.6 Informal employment is hard
to measure, and estimated employment rates
vary across regions, as illustrated in Box 1.7 Many
informal sector workers rely on circular practices for

their livelihoods, known as a ‘necessity-driven circular

economy’. They are seen as either frugally innovative or

eco-innovators but may also face marginalisation
and exploitation.8

What shapes our view of the
role of informal workers in
the circular economy?

The learning circles revealed that circular practices

in the informal economy, especially in the Global

South, are sometimes perceived negatively due to

the challenging working conditions associated with
them. These include long hours, low and unstable
incomes, unfair pay, precarious jobs, exploitation, social
marginalisation, and high health risks.22 These issues
intersect with existing vulnerabilities of workers, such

as high risk of poverty, lack of social protection, and lack
of access to healthcare,23 increasing these workers’ risks
of exclusion. Further, informal activities in the Global

South are often linked to the transboundary movement

of waste and second-hand goods from the Global North

to countries that lack the capacity to recirculate, reuse

or recycle them effectively. This issue is exacerbated by
insufficient systems for upholding or monitoring labour

rights practices by companies. Currently, monitoring

often relies on voluntary reporting and fails to

implement or enforce stricter measures for businesses

that do not uphold worker support in their
supply chains.24

The learning circles also highlighted that informality
isn't just a Global South phenomenon. Research
shows that informal employment has been increasing

in the Global North in recent years, driven by economic

recessions, crises, and evolving work arrangements
like flexible and platform work.25 For example, cities
like London have seen a rise in gig economy workers

who depend on platform-based work for income,

such as delivering food or doing freelance work
online.26 Ensuring fair treatment for informal and less
regulated workers is especially challenging in lengthy
subcontracting chains, which can undermine the
enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.27

Informal employment and circular practices are

common and ‘part of the fabric of life’ in many parts
of the world. Informal waste workers are crucial for
circular strategies, but they are often not recognised

as ‘relevant’ or significant stakeholders on a par with

businesses, industries, national and local governments,
and society in general.28

Who are the main actors
operating at the circularity-
informality nexus?

The learning circles highlighted the presence of

numerous actors working at the intersection of

circularity and informality.

• Informal workers play a vital role in circularity
across the value chain through resourceful and

adaptive practices.

• Social entrepreneurs play an important role in

supporting innovation where circular and informal

economies meet, serving as connectors, employers,

intermediaries or providers.

• Governments are critical in setting the policy

direction and regulatory environment to facilitate

circular practices and recognise the contribution of
informal workers.

• Strategic partnerships and cooperation between

public institutions, including universities,
research centres, industry and knowledge partners,

are essential in disseminating innovations and

developing a deeper understanding of circular

economy practices as well as advocating for the

rights and recognition of informal workers.

• Financiers play a key role in shifting from traditional

to social and circular business models.

• Private corporations can promote wide-scale

adoption of circular practices and leading actions

to integrate informal workers into initiatives,

contributing to the advancement of inclusive and

sustainable communities and societies.

• Consumers, increasingly environmentally

conscious, play a key role in influencing how circular

practices are perceived and adopted across different

regions and economic classes.

• Networks and accelerators can amplify grassroots
solutions and operate as cooperatives, leading to

new value propositions and evolving approaches to

informal and circular economies.

• Local communities have wisdom and Indigenous
knowledge that can often serve as the basis or

inspiration for frontline grassroots innovations.

Circularity & Informality · Redefining narratives8

Figure one outlines the three layers of actors and
their roles in facilitating the integration of informal

workers into circular value chains, covering all stages

from material sourcing to residual waste management.

Together, these layers form a supportive framework

for informal workers in circular economies.

Inner Layer: Grassroots
Grassroots actors, such as informal workers and

local communities, drive circular value chains from

the ground up. They directly create and implement

innovative practices that align with circular economy

principles. Their close connection to local contexts

allows them to address specific challenges and

opportunities effectively, ensuring practical and

sustainable solutions tailored to the informal sector.

Their on-the-ground presence allows them to adapt

and refine circular practices in real-time, fostering

resilience and inclusivity within local value chains.

Second Layer: Intermediators
Intermediaries, such as social enterprises, networks,

Overall, the figure illustrates that:

•

Informal workers play key roles across all stages of

the circular value chain.

• Actors may take on different roles in driving circular

value chains that support informal workers—from

being enablers to intermediators to

grassroots actors.

• Regardless of an actor's proximity to the ground,

each plays a vital role in the system.

The role of social
entrepreneurs

The roles social entrepreneurs play are varied and

multifaceted. Compared to more commercial private

sector actors, social entrepreneurs are often deeply

embedded in the communities where they operate
and serve. When workers in these communities are

grassroots initiatives, intermediaries help integrate

informal workers into circular value chains more

effectively. They ensure that local innovations gain the

visibility and resources needed to make a significant

impact on a larger scale, thus driving the advancement

of circular economy practices that benefit

informal workers.

Outer Layer: Enablers
Enablers, including governments, public institutions,

private corporations, financiers, and consumers,
create the overarching conditions necessary for the

successful implementation and scaling of circular

practices. They contribute by developing and enforcing

policies, providing financing, sharing knowledge,

and shaping trends that promote circular economy

principles. Through their support, enablers facilitate

the large-scale integration of informal workers into

circular value chains by establishing a conducive

environment that supports sustainable practices.

Their efforts help build the infrastructure and systems

needed to support and sustain circular practices,

facilitating the broader inclusion and success of

informal workers within these systems.

• Connectors and intermediaries: social

entrepreneurs may play a role in connecting

informal workers with formal institutions. They

support advocacy efforts to enhance recognition

and access to rights for informal workers.

Additionally, social entrepreneurs provide

platforms for dialogue and collaboration, bridging

communication gaps and addressing other common

challenges. By facilitating these connections, social

entrepreneurs help informal workers access formal

market opportunities.

• Employers: social entrepreneurs may establish their
enterprises and recruit from the informal sector,

providing livelihood opportunities, better wages, or

safer, more stable working conditions for workers.

• Providers: social entrepreneurs may offer benefits

such as training, healthcare, and financial support to

informal workers in the circular economy and their

families, as well as affordable solutions, products or

services to informal workers themselves.

INFORMALITY-
CIRCULARITY
INTERSECTION

In this section, we outline the tensions and dilemmas
that emerged during the learning circles and examine
the key narratives surrounding the intersection of
circularity and informality. Acknowledging that there
are various actors at this intersection, we shine a light
on the unique role of social entrepreneurs in the
overlap between informality and the circular economy,

showcasing their impact through two case studies.

From these discussions, four key dilemmas emerged

outlining how circularity and informality interact

and co-exist:

3·1
STIGMA AND
RECOGNITION OF
INFORMAL WORKERS

Informal work is often stigmatised, leading to
discrimination. Waste pickers, who play a key role in
recycling and resource recovery efforts, are especially

The use of the term 'informal' poses challenges

in efforts to recognise informal workers and the
economic value of their activities. During the learning
circles, a recurring theme emerged: informal workers do

as strictly 'informal' or 'formal' fails to acknowledge

recognised, so waste pickers are typically seen as a
‘social problem’.30 Workers may face health hazards,
exploitation by scrap dealers, and harassment from
local authorities.31 In some cases, like Abuja, Nigeria,
they are even considered illegal despite their crucial role
in waste management.32 This stigma can intersect with
existing vulnerabilities and potentially worsen them.

For example, in Pakistan, some informal recyclers face
additional discrimination due to their refugee status.33

Stigma and recognition are closely connected.

Much informal circular activity occurs in rural

and Indigenous contexts that are currently not
recognised, included or understood in mainstream
social innovation systems. Despite holding deep
circular knowledge, these communities are often

overlooked. Moreover, their practices often stem from

worldviews that differ from the dominant perspectives

of the formal economy. Integrating the perspectives

of informal workers on how to scale circularity in a

meaningful way, rather than through more seemingly

token consultation, remains a significant challenge.

Some participants noted that this challenge is

particularly pronounced in consultations with

waste pickers.

their deep interconnections and interdependencies. It

was emphasised that many parts of the formal sector

rely heavily on informal workers’ labour and that

informal networks, often characterised by reciprocity,

form in response to the failures of extractive formal

institutions, including the state.

Ultimately, the concept of formality versus

informality is shaped by power dynamics that

influence how economic activities are perceived
and defined. The term 'informal' often carries a
connotation that implies a lack of structure and
organisation, which oversimplifies the diverse range

of activities it encompasses. In reality, many informal

enterprises are highly dynamic, efficient, and innovative.

Some informal spaces may even foster collaboration,

inclusivity, and participation more effectively than

formal ones. However, the negative connotations

attached to the label ‘informal’, often perpetuated

by influential actors, can hinder recognition of their

positive contributions, especially in circular economy

strategies. Many participants of the learning circles

argued that informality should be recognised as an

integral and constitutive part of economic activity rather

than something inherently ‘outside’.

FORMALISATION AND

during the learning circles. Some participants strongly
argued that certain informal economic activities should

not necessarily be adapted to fit formal systems. For

intersect with circular economy interventions—
could contribute to job losses for informal workers.37
They might lose access to essential resources, becoming

such as Electronic Waste Africa, support them within

this context.

vendors now face challenges like fixed, less profitable
locations and restricted hours.35 Thus, while the aim
has been to bring street vendors into the formal

economy, it has inadvertently limited their flexibility and

independence, affecting their livelihoods and

economic opportunities.

On the other hand, formalisation can significantly
improve access to legal and social benefits.
Recognising informal workers through formal

institutions is essential for securing their rights, such as

safer working conditions, bargaining power, and access
to essential services.36 For instance, in Brazil, the Micro-
entrepreneur Programme (MEI), launched in December

2008, aims to formalise self-employment. One of its

main benefits is inclusion in the National Register of

Legal Entities (CNPJ), which streamlines tasks such as

opening bank accounts and applying for loans.

C A S E S T U D Y 1 · E L E C T R O N I C

W A S T E A F R I C A ( E W A )

The Ivory Coast is a primary destination of

electronic waste (e-waste) exports from the

Global North. High volumes of e-waste, in

combination with limited waste management

infrastructure, result in hazardous e-waste

being regularly disposed of in landfills and

urban areas. This contributes to a range of

adverse environmental and health impacts,

including exposure to toxic chemicals, which

can also contaminate food supply and water
ecosystems.38 Most e-waste is manually
processed by informal workers, who

collect, dismantle, and recover valuable
materials from these discarded electronics,
which are later sold in local and international

markets, often via several aggregators and
intermediaries.39 These workers frequently
lack education and knowledge of safe disposal

practices, leading to environmental and health

issues and highlighting the broader challenge

of e-waste management. In light of these

environmental concerns, the government has

been reviewing its approach to

informal workers.

In Abidjan, Electronic Waste Africa (EWA) is a
social enterprise addressing challenges related

to e-waste in three main areas: improving safe

end-of-life management practices, advocating

for the inclusion of workers in the e-waste

sector, and enhancing data availability for
better sector understanding. Operating at

the intersection of circular economy and

informality, EWA focuses on reframing

e-waste as an opportunity rather than solely

a challenge, aiming to highlight the valuable

contributions of e-waste workers. They also

strive for equitable distribution of value

throughout the e-waste value chain and have

developed the first comprehensive database of

e-waste stakeholders.

EWA plays the social entrepreneurs roles of

both connector and provider:

• As a connector deeply engaged with local

communities and worker associations, EWA

seeks to meaningfully involve workers in

decision-making processes. In addition, it

provides platforms for workers to voice their

interests and seek collective solutions. EWA

collaborates with government agencies,

NGOs, international organisations, and

private sector stakeholders to advocate for

policies and practices that protect informal

workers while promoting sustainable

e-waste management, as highlighted by a

participant during the learning circles.

• EWA also acts as a provider offering training

programmes to informal workers through

their e-waste academy, an initiative which

also sets up local collection points across

the Ivory Coast to coordinate the recovery

of e-waste before processing it in safer
platforms.40

Overall, EWA's approach focuses on

empowering informal e-waste workers

through training, advocacy, and

collaboration. This will increase their social

standing and professional recognition

within the e-waste recycling sector and
support their integration into the formal
waste management systems. By working
with grassroots organisations and local

communities, EWA strengthens community ties

and empowers workers to advocate for their

own rights and recognition.

sustainability issues. This form of circularity builds

community solidarity through mutual support and

equitable distribution of benefits, focuses on sufficiency

to smaller, localised initiatives that adapt to specific

community needs. This approach often draws on

knowledge from informal settings and highlights the

need to recognise the interconnectedness of the

economy and society, requiring holistic re-learning

alongside technical innovation.

In contrast, ‘top-down circularity’ is technology-driven

and abstract, primarily defined by institutions in the

Global North. While grassroots circularity is viewed as

a lived reality or way of life, top-down (or dominant)

circularity is shaped by theoretical frameworks and

‘expert’ perspectives.

life in contexts where hyper-consumptive and extractive

lifestyles have not been normalised.

C A S E S T U D Y 2 · REDE ASTA

In Brazil, many women engage in artisanal activities

across various sectors, such as crafts, handmade
goods, textiles, and jewellery. These activities are
often ‘informal’ and small-scale, taking place

in local markets and networks rather than
‘formal’ retail outlets. They are often circular,
emphasising the reuse and upcycling of materials

in creative ways. However, traditional artisanal

skills are at risk of disappearing due to factors such

as inadequate formal training, generational shifts,

and economic pressures. Additionally, artisans

often face challenges accessing formal markets

and distribution channels, which hinders their

ability to expand their customer base and maintain

sustainable incomes.

Rede Asta, a social enterprise based in Rio de

Janeiro, supports 52 artisan groups in Brazil, made
up of 700 women,41 to preserve and promote
artisanal activities and skills. Rede Asta acts
as an intermediary, connecting artisans to
broader markets through its showrooms and
online business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-

to-business (B2B) platforms, selling their products
under the unified brand ‘Asta’.42 They partner with
organisations to gather scraps and up-cyclable

waste, enabling artisans to expand their reach

beyond local markets and increase their visibility to

potential customers, nationally and internationally.

Their approach is anchored in building reliance
among artisans. Early on, Rede Asta’s leadership
noticed some artisans becoming dependent

exclusively on their sales channels, leading to

a recognition of the need to diversify artisans’

income streams by connecting them directly to
different buyers.43

Rede Asta also acts as a provider, offering

business training, workshops, and mentoring to
artisans to develop skills in business management,
marketing, product development, and pricing

strategies, enabling them to operate in competitive

markets. The work of these artisans embodies
key aspects of circularity, as well as contributing

to local sustainable economies. Rede Asta bridges

the gap between ‘informal’' circular work and
the broader, more visible circular economy. By
promoting greater recognition of artisans’

knowledge through their upcycling research

lab, they validate the importance of artisanal
skills within circular initiatives. This grassroots
network-building activity exemplifies how the

informal, circular and formal sectors can interact in

ways that are non-extractive and inclusive.

economy. Learning from different perspectives and

experiences is essential for fostering mutual respect,

promoting collaboration, and uncovering aspects of

the system that might otherwise be overlooked. This

broader perspective helps identify interconnected

challenges and opportunities within complex systems,
and a holistic understanding of these complexities is
crucial for effectively addressing and achieving the

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

After exploring the challenges and dilemmas around

this nexus, the key findings can be summarised

as follows:

• The label of ‘informality’ is often an external

categorisation. However, for informal workers, these

activities simply represent their way of life and

means of livelihood.

• The stigma surrounding informal labour presents a

major obstacle to acknowledging and understanding

the substantial economic and circular contributions

of informal workers. It is important to respect the

significance and identity of these workers, moving

beyond negative connotations that don't fully reflect

their reality.

• The complex issue of formalisation highlights the

need for a nuanced approach when addressing

the intersection of informality and circularity.

Formalisation processes can be empowering, but

they can also worsen issues for workers’ when not

approached in ways that safeguard their livelihoods

and rights. Therefore, there is an urgent need for

nuanced and context-specific approaches when

considering the ‘formalisation’ or integration of the

informal sector.

As we move forward, informality and circularity
should be driven by urgency, from addressing
unmet needs and livelihoods to resource scarcity
and the climate crisis. Numerous actors work at the
crossroads of circularity and informality, playing a critical

role in bringing these two systems together. These

include social entrepreneurs, government stakeholders,

public institutions, the private sector, financiers,

consumers/citizens, local communities, networks, and,

most crucially, informal workers themselves. Social

entrepreneurs are closely tied to the communities they

serve, bridging gaps between the formal and informal

sectors by including informal workers in decision-

making, facilitating material exchange, and promoting

recognition of their work.
