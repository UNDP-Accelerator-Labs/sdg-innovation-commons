The Missed Oppor tunity
Ever y year, close to 1 million Filipinos leave the countr y to
work abroad or migrate. In 2009, there were an estimated
10 million Filipinos living overseas in nearly 200 countries,
or over 10% of the countr y ’s total population. In 2010, the
money they sent back to the Philippines as remittances
totalled US$19.76 billion, accounting for an estimated
14% of GDP and representing an impor tant source of
investment in the countr y according to Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas. Based on data from the World Bank, in 2010, only
three countries – China, India, and Mexico – have a higher
total value of remittances.

Remittances have the potential to play a large and positive
role in national development, ser ving as fundamental

In many developing countries, remittances

approaches for consumers to multiply their
impact, we will be able to foster economic

greater and more inclusive local growth. By reaching an

dispropor tionally small.

As a
recent Asian Development Bank study shows,
remittances in the Philippines have not contributed to
growth in demand for domestic products, or statistically
significant increases in spending on long-term investments
like education and health care. While remittances can help
reduce pover ty reduction, the study finds no evidence
that they have helped rebalance growth.

Indeed, there are indications that remittances can, in some
cases, have the exact opposite effect. Governor Imee
Marcos, Governor of Ilocos Nor te – the province with the
highest percentage of Overseas Filipinos in the nation –
warns of “remittance addiction” and “consumeritis” where
people become reliant on remittances and use them to
make super fluous purchases or to live beyond their means.

The question is then, what would be required for the

Targeting the Potential of Remittances
A 2008 white paper prepared by the Economist Intelligence
Unit (EIU) for Western Union, the global leader in money
transfer ser vices, found that migrant worker associations
overseas have a desire to see their remittances suppor t
community development but
the capacity and
resources to identify, invest in, and monitor projects. The
study also found that recipient communities face similar
challenges in their capacity and ability to absorb and use
large amounts of money for development projects.

UNDP has been an active par tner of the Government of
the Philippines for many years, working to reduce pover ty
and achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by
2015. UNDP has worked extensively at promoting policies
and innovative approaches aimed at enabling government
leaders and communities to pursue more inclusive growth
and human development.

The par tnership among the Western Union Foundation,
UNDP and local governments brings together a set of actors
with unique resources, reflecting the synergistic potential
of public-private par tnerships. The OFs-ReD project will

will expand the group of stakeholders involved, bringing

The Project
OFs-ReD is a two-year project that seeks to identify effective
mechanisms to harness remittances for local development,
job creation and entrepreneurship. It will also identify the
policies necessar y for these mechanisms to be successful
and sustainable.

The project will have two major outputs: one, to develop
mechanisms to engage the Diaspora (Overseas Filipinos
and their home communities) to become involved in local
development and ser vices deliver y ; and two, to encourage
the creation of a policy environment that enables and
