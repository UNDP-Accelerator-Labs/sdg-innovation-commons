# Togo's Digitalization of Birth Registry through Accelerator Lab Solutions.

[[0:00]] OK, So my name is Yem Ahiasti from Accelerator Lab Togo, of course on the solutions mapper\. And I would love to talk to you today about let's say birth registry, but digitalizing birth registry and how our Accelerator Lab tackled something that has been done before and something that still needs to be carried out\. But the difference we brought to it, So I think it was back in 2020, sometime during COVID and the aftermaths of COVID, and we were still trying to figure out two things, how to help\. Of course, the women and the young Togolese that were getting born to have an identity in the time where contact was almost prohibited and going to the hospital or into medical centers where it was something that the Togolese didn't want to do for many reasons, by the way\. And at the same time it was the birth of townships, like mayor offices\. We were seeing a trend in this centralization of power\. So, we're having love local governments and they needed to have support from UNDP and the UNDP governance unit\. Of course, digitalizing birth registry is something that has been done since ages, at least tried to be done since ages in Togo\. A lot of development agencies tried it but they didn't quite succeed\. There was always something either policies, either I don't know the tools or even the knowledge they know how\. And I mean not working with the central government, but this opportunity to work with local governments, people that needed to prove something, people that needed to have things done was a great opportunity that we wanted to seize\. And that's what we did, at least we tried to do starting with innovation challenge, we try to figure out, I mean get a sense, a good sense of what were the innovators in that sector, in that domain when it comes to digitalization tools, apps and so on\. But focused on birth registry and civil registry\. And we find someone that had a solution, at least a prototype of a solution, and we give him the opportunity to test it on the ground\. And testing on the ground was of course, setting the right context for him to implement and test his, his solution\. We started with going down into the community of Aniha, observing a lot of participation with community, going to see the midwives, I guess they're called going to see the midwives understanding what they do, how they do it and how they interact with the mayor's office because the mayor's office is actually in charge of delivering the official birth registry, like the ACT\. So yeah, we went down a lot of interviews, a lot of observation\. How were things happening? How are the new mothers going around figuring out how to, you know, get the papers for the newborns? That was what we wanted to do, what we wanted to understand\. And after that we kind of approach and got things going as a pilot, as a test for an app\. We had two aspects of it, one in the mayor's office and another one with, with the clinics, with the hospitals and so on, with the central database\. And do by doing this, we started with the interviews we went on with, of course, you know, everything that has to do with monitoring and evaluations, setting clear steps, designing an agile pattern like where you have quick sprints of the innovators that that the innovator that we're working with, coming up with app modules that are focused on solving a specific aspect of things, be it registering newborns, be it following up within 40 days as prescribed by law with the new parents the whole way to signing the final paper, having them come in into the mayor's office to sign the delivered paper\. So it was iterative and we tried as much as we could to follow despite, you know, everything, the whole UNDP, getting approval for missions, going down on the field and so on\. But we can also thank the use of media of WhatsApp of emails to kind of follow up with things\. And, you know, there was the golden age of Zoom\. So we had a lot of interviews online and a lot of seeing what's going on in the ground online with the mayor's office and with through them with medical facilities and everything\. OK\. So I mean, the main challenges that we kind of went through doing this, the matter of ethics, I think kind of came up having approval to have these, to approach these women, to have them give their personal information into the app and so on\. The matter of duplicity of action also came in because by policy, the medical workers were required to have all the information on paper and we had to emphasize them to also do it on through the app\. So it was a matter of motivation, a matter of interesting them into doing so\. Another challenge that we faced was of course going to the ground\. We had to be there\. We had to get things going, see what's going on\. And for that we required technical skills, you know, in app development and in managing digital projects\. And since we couldn't always go on the ground, it was something a skill that lacks on the ground and it kind of impacts what we did on the ground\. But the good thing is, like I said at the beginning, trying to digitalize birth registry is something that has been tried before is something we did\. And the first, the fantastic thing is where we thought that we were on the ground, we tried something with all the difficulties that we met and everything closing that thing and moving on\. We realized that other agencies like the Germans kind of came and filled the void that we left\. So the continued what we did\. And so that is that was interesting\. I guess it was a good motivation\. It was a good win for us because we knew that we were onto something\. But even the best thing is when in 2023 we got, I mean, we got a e\-mail, no, even a letter from the mayor's office in Lome\. So like one of the biggest circumscriptions in Lome, the big commune in Lome, actually asking us to support them with their app\. And where we went in to look at the, the app to test the thing and everything, we realized that it was greatly inspired by what we did in Aniha like two years ago\. So that is something when it comes to let's say, diffusing, I guess, without even knowing how we did it, just the fact of blazing a trail and knowing that other people are, you know, like coming in, following your footstep, trying to build upon what you did is quite rewarding\. So now I think that what we still need to do now is with the new found knowledge that we have of doing, you know, this Accelerator LAb things for more than four years and you know, the failure and the learning and everything apply that with the new commune\. So the new mayor office that we want to try, you're trying to work with, great thing we already have the tests, the experimentation going into major medical centers\. So now it's just a matter of, I don't want to say empower, but helping them with the tools that they lack, the talents that they lack, getting the consultants, maybe getting the computers, getting the tablets, maybe so that we can actually test this thing and make it even better than what we did in Anejo\.

### [[8:50]] Is there anything you would do differently if you had to start all over again?

[[principles:Time management and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
[[skills:Pitching skill]]
If I had to start all over, I think I'll move my things, I'll pack my things, I'll move my things, and I'll go stay in Anejo\. Because I think, like I said, what really lacked on the ground is technical skill, understanding, to be very precise, JavaScript, understanding view, understanding databases\. And I think it's something that we in our lab, those are skills that we have and skills that we could have brought on the ground and not just rely on the consultant that we took\. So the innovator to do it, because obviously he wanted to prove himself as well\. He wanted to prove to UNDP that he was highly capable and as sometimes he kind of over estimated his capacities\.

### [[9:36]] Yeah\. Finally, what assumptions were proven wrong, if you had any and how did you find out?

[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[tactics:Proof of concept]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
OK, these assumptions, Yeah, the assumptions that was they were proven, they were proven wrong\. Is that first of all, it's impossible to digitalize how to call it birth registries in Togo\. But by doing like a little policy sandbox, by doing a regulatory sandbox, especially in any hall with the help of the of the mayor, the mayor that is very influential\. We're actually capable of at this at most as we could\. We kind of put aside all the cons of the law of the policy in place, meaning you had to put things down on paper, physical paper\. You had to, there are sheets that need to be duplicated, some sent to the tribunal, some sent to, I don't know, the Ministry of Justice or whatever\. But we kind of put that aside and we did, we went with the app\. So a lot of, a lot of children actually had their birth certificate digitalized\. And we work with that\. Of course, you know, under the hood, it's like the The Wizard of Oz other under the hood, people had to, you know, fill that, fill that gap\. So the, the, the papers were filled and everything by some of the people\. But at least we try to do things like we, we, we envision it to be so\.

### [[11:02]] Yeah\.
