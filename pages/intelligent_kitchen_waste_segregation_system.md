Intelligent Kitchen Waste Segregation System via Deep Learning is an innovation product that is capable of segregating kitchen and other types of waste into two (2) categories: (1) compostable waste, and (2) non-compostable waste. Compost is a biodegradable material that can be used in the agriculture field as a form of fertiliser or for soil conditioning. 
This system is equipped with artificial intelligence (A.I.) technology to enable the segregation operation to be conducted automatically. The prototype system encompasses a motor, camera, micro-controller, grinder and segregation board. The micro-controller will identify the category of the waste that has been placed on the segregation board using the camera. The motor will then run and separate the waste according to the appropriate category. The waste will then go through the grinder to be made into smaller sizes. 
This system is suitable for segregating kitchen waste such as canned foods, sauce bottles, lemons, eggshells and the like.
