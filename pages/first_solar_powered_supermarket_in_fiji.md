> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

RB Patel, located in Nadi, Fiji, became the fist supermarket in Fiji to go solar. The installation of the solar system on the supermarket building's roof, by renewable energy company Sunergise, allows for a significant portion of the supermarkets power to be generated by clean power. This not makes the company operations greener, but also drastically cuts cost associated with power generation. Although the supermarket is still connected to the main electrical grid, which it switches to at night, the solar installation reduces the importation of diesel by 200 barrels a year.
