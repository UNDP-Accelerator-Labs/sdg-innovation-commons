> Brief description of the innovation

The world today has seen an increase in the tight schedules of people. And many are finding it harder to dedicate full attention and time to the reading of a hardcopy book from cover to cover. Hence ethe  recent popularity of audio books in the western world especially. However in as much as 
there are many books written by African and Zambian authors. Most of these are available only as 
 hardcopybooks very few if any are available on audiobook format. Most of the books available as 
audiobooks are from the western world but some of the information in western books especially 
business and entrepreneurship books may not be fully and directly applicable in Zambia and other 
African developing economies. Therefore the idea is to develop a website and mobile application, 
that will in addition to providing western content also provide African and Zambian content in form 
of Audio books, Audio newspapers , Audio Magazines ,and other spoken word performances such as 
poetry , stand-up comedy and even podcasts .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Customers will have two options of how to use the site either on a $7.5 subscription plan offering 
unlimited content or a non-subscription plan where customers only pay for content they are 
interested in after listening to a free teaser. The free teasers are meant for attracting more visitors 
to the site. The highbred payment model is an effort to give Orator a fighting chance against 
international competitors such as scribd which also offer unlimited content with a higher
subscription of $9 without much African content and even audible.
Each Audiobook account will also have an advertisement window on which companies can advertise, 
allowing authors multiple sources of revenue on the site.
Furthermore Authors will have a variety of recording studios to choose from on Orators studio-hub. 
Hence providing more customers for studios.
Demographics include individuals aged between 20-65 years, seeking success, wealth and happiness.
Orator will also be able to reduce deforestation due to the lack of paper necessary for Audiobook 
production.
Revenue sources.
1. 15% service fee from Audiobook purchases.
2. subscriptions from customers.
3. 25% service fee from Advertisements on each Audiobook account.
4. 15% service fee from authors working with recording studios on orators studio-hub.

> Technical Feasibility

The content of Orator will be sourced from partnerships with individual authors who self-publish and 
also from partnerships with publishing houses .The basis of the partnership will be to provide a 
greater audience of customers for them and to provide their content to customers in a more 
convenient way that will result in the generation of more money due to increased sales. 
Furthermore in order to enable more authors to have their content recorded Orator will partner 
with a number of recording studios. Enabling authors to record their books at a discounted fee. The 
discount will result from providing the recording studios an increased number of customers. This 
provision will also encourage more authors to upload their content with us. In addition to this the 
site will be self-service friendly enabling authors to upload content that has met specified standards 
onto the website on their own. And even though there will be an opportunity of downloading the 
content for offline listening. The content will not be available for sharing. This is because the 
Audiobooks will be downloaded directly onto the platform and not to an external location. The 
business is currently being tested using the Audiobook website template Meron.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Orator is an online market that will connect African and western Audiobook and other audio 
content providers to listeners worldwide.
The platform will be addressing five main problems these include:
1. Lack of knowledge of many local African and Zambian authors.
2. Unfair advantage that western books and authors have over African and Zambian books and 
authors.
3. Lack of enough time for customers to read hardcopy books from cover to cover.
4. High expense of books.
5. Deforestation, climate change and global warming.
Solutions.
The platform will be able to Increase publicity and provide free marketing to African and Zambian 
authors having their Audiobook on the site by exposing their content to an increased number of 
customers worldwide. By so doing customers who have no knowledge of the existence of certain 
books will know of them as they browse the site or search for a particular Audiobook.
Orator will also Level the playing field between African and western authors due to the fact that
many African authors will also have the opportunity to have their books available not only as 
hardcopy books but also as Audiobooks on Orator giving them the opportunity to be exposed to an 
international market with a greater audience and hence raising the chances of increasing sales.
As a result of Making the books available to customers as Audiobook files. The books will now be 
delivered to busy customers in a much more efficient format which will be of more benefit in terms 
of use to the customers despite their busy schedules due to the convenience the Audiobooks 
provide. Such that even when they are doing some other work they will be able to listen to the book 
or even as they use their electronic devices for other purposes when relaxing they will still be able to listen to the 
books at the same time. 
The Audiobooks will result in reduced operational cost because a single recording will be able to 
generate revenue continuously as opposed to hardcopy books that require more funds for printing 
each book. The reduced operational cost will in turn result in a reduced price of the books for the 
customers .
Orator will also Reduce deforestation due to the lack of paper needed for Audiobook production.The 
reduced deforestation will result in more trees converting carbon to oxygen. This conversion of 
carbon to oxygen reduces ozone depletion which in turn results in a decrease in the rate of global warming.
