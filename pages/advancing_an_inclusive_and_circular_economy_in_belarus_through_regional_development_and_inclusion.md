## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Sustaining of Green Growth needs Green Financing, Green Innovations and Green Consulting. 2. Capacity for Green Financing can be taken from UNDP international experience and transferred to the local level, but Sustainable Financing Architecture provides more complex framework to work with thematic bonds. 3. To develop Green Innovations their significance should be articulated both on the local and republican level. Announcing of Green Nomination only at the republican level isn't enough, as the level of innovations submitted will be low. Adding regional green contests to the startup system significantly increases the level of technologies visible at the republican level. 4. After social adaptation migrants and people from Chernobyl recovering districts are ready to engage local resources for low-carbon production, but Green skills is what they need. However, regions experiencing the lack of educational services they can provide to vulnerable groups, and remote education, remote consulting can help to fulfil this gap. 5. Belarus increased its position in Global Green Economy Index, shifting from 81st position in the world's rating, to 74th. This is rather good result within the existing context. But GGEI 2023 on the way, and corrective measures to the Green Growth vision may be needed.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Lack of inter-ministerial cooperation in the areas of plastic, green financing, circular economy. Capacity gap at the regional and local level in smart technologies for greening.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

As the statistical data became less available, researches and surveys helped to fulfil the data gap. In these circumstances spinoffs from experiments and deep dive interviews allowed to get more data from data carriers.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

collective intelligence - to coordinate stakeholders actions towards system change by pinching the system from different angles. design thinking - to proactively create stable unrollbackable improvements, horizon scanning - to consider very sensitive context, smart cities - to consider best available technologies and spatial data, system thinking - to consider different possible scenarios of development, but keep focused within portfolio of interventions taken onboard.  
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Mogilev Regional Association of Local Councils of Deputies - organizing regional contest of green and circular projects, selecting winners. Belarusian innovation Fund - improvement of methodology of selection and financial support of startups towards more green startups. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

National Academy of Sciences - discussion of National Strategy for Circular Economy-2035 Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Food - food waste and food security Institute of Energetics - energy efficiency measures Institute of Economy - Circular Economy structure, vision, strategy

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Agency "Stolitsa" - assessment of potential of green Economy in Belarus and ways to develop Circular economy

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Natural Resources - Green and Circular Economy activities Ministry of Energy - energy efficiency measures discussion Ministry of Communications - smart cities activities State Committee for Science and Technologies - broadening of application of green technologies, creation of digital catalogues for dissemination of innovations, support of green startups.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Ministry of Communications - smart cities activities

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

ITU, UNICEF
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Green Transition is a widening direction of development. For its broadening the engagement of more and more partners is needed, and engagement goes well if potential partners see benefits. That's why demonstration of results of experiments, discussion of potential market niches, new possibilities for education, available technologies sustains interest to the topic. Otherwise, without the portfolio of supportive interventions, engagement of vulnerable groups, the legislative work alone won't be so successful in promotion of green transition. And this is noted by national partners.
