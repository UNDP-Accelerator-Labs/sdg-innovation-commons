> Brief description of the innovation

Zambia has faced a high deficit in electricity for over five years now and this has led to high cost of domestic energy and high dependency on wood charcoal leading to deforestation. Wood charcoal production has bad effects on our environment, such as air pollution due to smoke and carbon monoxide. Trip-charc brings you a solution of  affordable, clean, smokeless, environmentally friendly energy blocks made from agricultural waste such as banana peels, maize cobs, sugar cane peels grass etc
One block burns for over six hours meaning two meals can be cooked with only one block

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income will be generated through direct sales of energy blocks and deliveries
Target market are restaurants, house holds and poultry farmers
The challenge prize will help us buy machinery needed, and also branding and marketing our product

Our product is eco friendly, it will reduce deforestation due to wood charcoal production, it is smokeless and does not emit carbon monoxide.

> Technical Feasibility

We carbonize the waste and mold it into energy blocks.
We have the energy blocks as a prototype
We started carrying out customer development interviews and the product seems to be exactly what people need with enough funds we plan on giving some blocks for free and see the feedback from customers

> Anticipated Social Impact

With our energy blocks, the cost of energy needed for cooking will be reduced. 
It's a product that can be used indoors as it does not release carbon monoxide and smoke
