## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

This exercise generated lots of insights in the islands of Zanzibar: Waste generation patterns and hot spots Types and composition of waste Collection and disposal systems Waste management infrastructure Potential for waste reduction and recycling Environmental and public health impacts Waste management policies and regulations.

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

When Impacting the system, there are indeed many challenges/barriers that were observed, including: Lack of political will and funding Limited public awareness and participation Insufficient infrastructure and technology Inadequate regulations and enforcement Resistance from waste management stakeholders Limited data and information Culture of illegal dumping and littering.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The Lab generated a novel dataset about the core infrastructure of Zanzibar city, mapping many features such as roads, waterways, buildings and trash sites. The data has revealed the existence of new buildings that had previously not been registered by government officials. This information is being used by the city’s Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority to add waste collection points to serve the previously unmapped informal settlements.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

It took the team less than a month to generate a huge amount of novel data, labeled and validated, using the virtual mapathon method and an existing platform for work allocation. Mapathons, or other short-term 'blitz' methods, are frequently employed in participatory science to assist cover data shortages. If your collective intelligence initiative does not have or require dedicated volunteers, this strategy may be a good fit.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Open Map Development Tanzania- They were responsible for all the technical work.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The State University of Zanzibar which provided working space and its students as volunteers.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Zanzibar City Council offered lots of intelligence related to the project.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

NA

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNICEF became interested to the initiative and together with Acc lab, we later co-designed an initiative to support innovation in solid waste management.
