> Brief description of the innovation

Since Zambia got independence in 1964 all door closers found the country are imported. As a result there is need to design a door closer locally.
 A door closer is a mechanical device that closes a door, in general after someone opens it, or after it was automatically opened. They are used in(i)Fire safety (ii)maintaining room temperature(iii)For security purposes. With the increase of infrastructure developments in Zambia and Africa it’s very useful.The door closers at state house, Levy junction mall,UNZA and KCM corporate offices are all imported.  
Pneumatic door closer is installed on the door jamb. It has a spring, plunger enclosed in a cylinder filled with air. All these should be inside the housing cylinder to reduce slam shut. When the door is opened, the cylinder fills with air. When the door is closing the spring pushes a piston and in turn this will force air out of small hole. This can be adjusted to control the closing rate and if they are leaks, there will be hissing noise.
 DOOR SPEED REGULATION.
There are two ways to control a pneumatic door closer:
(i)	Adjusting the bracket that attaches the closer to the door.
(ii)	Turning the screw on the end of the closer that regulates the rate at which the air is released from the cylinder.
If the door doesn’t close all the way, adjust the bracket:
(iii)	Open the door and slide the stop out to hold the cylinder open.
(iv)	Loosen the screws that attach the bracket to the door and move the bracket further out (toward the door handle).
(v)	Or remove the pin that secures the cylinder to the bracket and move it out to a hole further away.
If the door slams shut or closes too slowly, adjust the pneumatic cylinder:
(vi)	To slow the closing, turn the screw on the end of the pneumatic cylinder clockwise.
(vii)To speed up the closing, turn the screw counterclockwise.
Closers often feature dampers that offer control over the closing force and speed. Such dampers are usually hydraulic or pneumatic dashpots.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will create manufacture companies for door closers and other engineering  components such as cars, ships and planes although the last two are big projects.You know everyone in Zambia wants to drive or travel fast to do business. We expect to export some items outside Zambia. This will provide foreign exchange.In turn ,this  will  create job opportunities to any class in Zambian.To those who have not gone far in education can do packing and counting of items.Engineers will design,Machinists will do their jobs.Production personnel s will do production. Accountants will do their jobs.Sales and marketing personnel s will advertise our products. Lawyers will will defend the legal rights of our products.A door closer is just a starting point.There are many machines  which can be designed and manufactured in this country with the abundance  mineral resources.
 China is second world economy because of product design engineering.My desire is to establish machinery assembling and designing plants.Where Vehicle chassis ,bearings, cables, motor shafts and pipes ,pump shafts,solid couplings,bolts,foundation frames and pipes will be manufactured in our country. Companies and firms such as Scaw Limited(foundry),SKF Zambia(bearings), Zamefa(cables), UNZA TDAU(Frames),E.B.Jones(bolts).These firms and many others can supply  enough spare parts to supplement for the established plants. Where certain parts are difficult to machine, foundry will be used. This will create job opportunities in Zambia.With experience  gained from grass roots at KCM, Scaw Limited,karlsons and Nkana Water.All these show that, I am capable of putting Zambia on technology map. 
Every established firm has environmental responsibilities to the country. Funds will be channeled towards improving climate change. Not only that ,it is a responsibility of every company, to take social responsibilities.

> Technical Feasibility

PROBLEM STATEMENT.
 In product engineering design function , four things are considered in designing a product.
(i)	Design a product to achieve its purpose. The purpose of door closer is to close the door automatic when it is opened.
(ii)	Design a product to meet customer specification. The product should be of high quality. Joseph .M.Juran defined Quality as “fitness for use”. The door closer should be fit for use.
(iii)	Design a product for cost effectiveness. Considering our economy, the product should be affordable locally. The product should have life span of not less than ten years. 
(iv)	Design a product which is easy to maintain and assemble. The pneumatic door closer is easy to do maintenance and assemble.
 PROTOTYPE DEVELOPMENT.
It involves:
(i)	Design. Involves theoretical calculations of forces, velocity and determining dimensions that can give the best perfomance.The best material that can be used and the weight. Furthermore we compare the reality to theoretical.
(ii)	Manufacturing of the components to be used in the making of the door closer.
(iii)	Testing.
The greatest challenge in Zambia manufacturing system is to come up with an affordable door closer that can be manufactured locally. As a result I took this project to sort out this challenge.
    OBJECTIVES.
The objectives of this project were;
•	(I) To design a pneumatic door closer.
•	(ii) To develop the design mechanism.
•	(iii)To design mechanism that will vary closing door speeds.
•	(iv)To reduce the bang of the door.
RATIONALE.
•	The prime objectives of every company are to ensure that they maximize profit and growth. As earlier said in the problem statement there is need to come up with simple door closer that can be manufactured locally. It will have market locally and possibly be exported.
•	Hence the need to come up with pneumatic door closer because they are easy to assemble, install and according to our economical status, they are easy to manufacture.
•	Pneumatic door closer haS fewer components than hydraulic door closer and uses  air which is a free,as a damper.
The door closer must be able to compete on the market as such they must look attractive.
METHODOLODY.
It involves the following stages;
•	 Literature reviews on the available types of concept designs of door closers,Creation of conceptual functional design of the door closer.Production of part prints,Selection of materials.Numerical designing calculations.Actual production of a door closer.
 Conceptual Design.
The prototype conceptual was developed using solid works and microstation power draft. The conceptual design only shows how the overall machine will look and how components will be assembled.    
PRODUCTION OF PART PRINTS.
(i)  Drawings of , Rubber Ring,Door frame bracket,housing cylinder,housing left cap.housing right cap,piston and door bracket. Are done.The project was tested and worked at UNZA mechanical machine work shop.What has remained are funds to implement it.A door closer manufacturing company should be created.furthermore,we also look on how a vehicle can be designed.
CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS.
In product engineering design function we do consider four things when designing a product.
  (i)  Design a product to achieve its purpose. The door closer was able to close the door automatic when it was opened.
  (ii)  Design a product to meet customer specification. The product should be of high quality. Joseph .M.Juran defined Quality as “fitness for use”. The door closer was fit for use. Since the speed of door closer varied and the bang of the door was reduced using a pressure regulating screw.
(iii) Design a product for cost effectiveness. Considering our economy, the product should be affordable locally. The total estimate costs was about K1400,selling it  slightly above or a bit more, Zambians and other people in different countries can afford to buy it .The manufacturing company will be able to maximize profit.
(iv) Design a product which is easy to maintain and assemble. The pneumatic door closer is easy to do maintenance and assembly. It has few components and which are easy to assemble and maintain. 
Despite of the fact that challenges and obstacles were faced; the overall objectives of the project were met which were to design a door closer mechanism. However, it was not easy to acquire the spring, rubber as these are not locally made. 
The branch of design in engineering is tough, it incorporates all disciplines of engineering, drawings were redone to suite the actual design on the ground. Designing materials were selected and changed on the way. Mild steel density of (7850kg/m3), was picked accordingly,for metallic components of a door closer. Material for rubber picked was poly-isoprene. The door closer has been designed according to drawings given in this report. The oil for lubrication was SAE-85W-150.After the assembly of the components, the door closer was mounted onto the door and tested. When the door was left in an open position, the door closer closed the door at various speeds depending on the angle at which the door was opened. However, there was a problem in recording the speed of the door as there was no instrument to use for recording the speed. Hence the practical speeds could not be recorded and compared to the theoretical ones. For speed to be varied effectively, door closer should be sealed very well so that air could not come out easily or be kept inside the cylinder.
The objectives of the project which were to design and manufacture a door closing mechanism were met. A pneumatic door closer was designed and manufactured at a cost of k1400.00 . As the world is switching to automation, the door closer must be automated as it has a huge role to play in the future industries, malls and shopping centers, buses, airports, educational institutions, hospitals and also domestic usage. The pneumatic part will ensure that the door closer is cheaper and has smooth operation compared to other automatic doors.
