Digital Nomads Scanner
SEPTEMBER 10, 2020
This report will help you to gain a better understanding of who digital nomads are, why they choose this lifestyle, what their usual professions are, and also to gain additional information on how Belgrade compares to some other digital nomad destinations.
The 2020 edition is the first edition of the report, and it was created in partnership with the Digital Serbia Initiative, as part of a UNDP Accelerator Lab Serbia project called “Belgrade - digital friendly city”. The main goal of this activity is to understand the user journey.
