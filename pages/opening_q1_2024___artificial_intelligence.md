Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



In Argentina, we aim to contribute to the public conversation about the use and regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This initiative will foster awareness of AI’s potential to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals agenda. We will concurrently work to enhance understanding of the opportunities and risks associated with harnessing AI for sustainable development. Our long-term vision is to leverage collective intelligence to identify future pathways for AI, ultimately aiming for regulations that ensure a balanced approach —maximizing AI’s potential while mitigating its risks. 

 To address this challenge, the Lab plans a portfolio of actions. Knowledge products are currently being developed to explore the impact of AI on development, including its potential benefits, risks and emerging trends. Additionally, these resources will delve into the current state of AI-related regulations in Argentina. Other actions include organizing seminars, fostering AI-related capabilities within our CO, and conducting prospective exercises. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



At the country level, policies and plans aimed at addressing the developments and challenges of AI have been scarce. Since the new president took office in December 2023, there has not been any indication of government plans regarding AI regulation or discussion. Recognizing this critical need, and at the request of the resident representative closely monitoring these issues, we are taking proactive steps to fill this gap.  

 Our Lab actively began addressing this challenge last year. Since then, we have made progress on several actions. We have conducted interviews with a diverse group of stakeholders and experts across the country; from universities and foundations to laboratories and companies. These interviews provide valuable insights into the local AI landscape and our country's current position in AI advancement. This data forms the primary foundation for a report on the challenges and opportunities of AI for development in Argentina, scheduled for publication in 2024. 

 Our work strives to mainstream AI within the CO. This involves fostering conversations, engaging programme areas, and building staff capacity. To achieve this, we have shared key actions and invited senior management to participate in various activities. Additionally, we organized a training session utilizing AI tools for CO staff and consultants. 

 In addition to the aforementioned actions, we have also published two blogs discussing fundamental AI concepts and Argentinian public opinion on the technology. Alongside these blog entries, we published a report and two infographics showcasing the results of our 2023 pilot project integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) into political speeches analysis. 

 Both the infographics and the report feature the findings of using a ChatGPT-based NLP model to analyze political speeches. This project aimed to identify shared issues, ideas and concerns within these speeches. As part of the anniversary of the 40 years of democracy in Argentina, leveraging AI tools, the Lab investigated presidential speeches delivered in Argentina since the return of democracy in 1983. The model successfully identified common topics and values among diverse speeches and established correlations between them.  

 This project served a dual purpose: as a proof of concept for AI’s potential in supporting democratic governance, and as a prototype to explore how language models can foster depolarization. For instance, the learnings could inform the application of these models in future research. Imagine using them to generate fictional text (vignettes) for survey experiments, evaluating voter's ability to distinguish between human-written and computer-generated text. This has significant relevance to studies on the proliferation of fake news during political campaigns. 

 The Lab’s focus on this topic is particularly timely. Deep political divisions and polarization, evident at both federal and state levels, significantly hinder progress on critical issues. This gridlock fuels public discontent erodes trust in governing institutions and fosters anti-establishment expressions. While overall democratic support remains high compared to other countries, these factors create a breeding ground for the erosion of civic values and governmental legitimacy. Dialogue and consensus building are urgently needed to bridge these divides and address pressing challenges. 

 To advance our goal of raising awareness and stimulating discussion about the potential and challenges of AI in development, we hosted a free, open seminar on the topic. The event convened experts, practitioners, and policymakers to explore AI’s potential in sectors like health, justice, government and business. Discussions addressed potential challenges and risks. 

 This well-attended event, drawing over 100 participants, marked a significant achievement in positioning UNDP as a key player in Argentina’s AI conversation. Further extending the reach of our work, Lorena Moscovich, our Head of Experimentation, delivered a TED Talk focused on AI-powered solutions for policy and development, to a capacity crowd of 110,00 spectators. This presentation provided a valuable platform to share the insights and learnings garnered throughout 2023.

To address the rising global interest in how AI impacts various aspects of development, we have initiated a conversation about this transformative technology. This conversation is crucial as AI’s influence on individuals and states is multifaceted. There is concern and uncertainty surrounding AI’s impact on the economy, particularly the labor market. While AI has the potential to significantly benefit the Latin America and Caribbean region through productivity gains (Neil Baily et al., 2023), it could also negatively impact employment. 

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that AI will affect nearly 40% of jobs globally, replacing some roles and complementing others (Georgieva, 2024). The uncertainties surrounding AI's impact on developing countries add to the urgency of the challenge. At the beginning of the AI boom, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) estimated that between 36% and 43% of jobs in the region were at risk due to automation.  Additionally, this outcome was not uniform across all countries; those with lower GDP per capita and higher inequality faced a greater risk of job loss (IDB, 2018). However, in addition to the loss of specific jobs, AI creates new precarious jobs: AI taggers. These workers are subcontracted by large technology companies to "train" AI systems, a tedious job, in exchange for low pay (BBC, 2023). Regardless of the exact figures, AI’s impact on employment and other related aspects, such as poverty and inequality, is undeniable.  

AI also presents exciting possibilities for improving healthcare. It is already being used to accelerate drug development, analyze medical images with greater accuracy, and strengthen preventive medicine efforts (Yoon &amp; Amadiegwu, 2023). In terms of efficiency, AI has the potential to generate savings of 5-10% in healthcare spending (Sahni, N. et al., 2023). However, ethical considerations remain a concern. Questions surround data privacy, bioethics, and the need to build patient trust. For instance, a 2023 Pew Research Center study found that 60% of adults in United States are uncomfortable with the idea of AI being used for medical treatments and diagnoses (Taylor, A. et al., 2023). 

Similar to the ethical considerations, the regulation and governance of AI have become a central focus of discussion. A 2023 study by Stanford University analyzed legislative records from 127 countries and found a significant increase in AI-related legislation. The number of bills containing “artificial intelligence” and passed into law grew from just 1 in 2016 to 37 in 2022. This trend is further supported by an analysis of parliamentary records on AI in 81 countries, revealing a nearly 6.5-fold increase in mentions of AI in global legislative proceedings since 2016 (Stanford University, 2023). 

Image 1: Number of AI-related Bills Passed into Law by Country, 2016-22 [source: Stanford, 2023, p. 267. HAI_AI-Index-Report_2023.pdf (stanford.edu)]

The relationship between AI and political consensus is particularly crucial in the Latin American context. Data from Latinobarómetro, cited by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL, by its acronym in Spanish), reveals a concerning trend in Argentina: declining public support for democracy and trust in governing institutions and political parties (CEPAL, n.d.). 

Image 2:  Argentina: Trends in Public Perception of Democracy and trust in Electoral Institutions, and Political Parties, 2010-2020 (expressed in percentages) [source: CEPAL (n.d)]

Argentina’s political polarization is less focused on specific policy issues and more centered on political parties and leaders themselves. The data indicates that citizen’s support for policies can be conditional on the political party or leader endorsing them. This suggests a potential for consensus building around shared values and concerns.  

However, a significant challenge remains. If people reject proposals based on their source (a specific politician or party), it will be difficult to overcome polarization. This highlights the need for a neutral mediator and facilitator of dialogue. This is where the UNDP sees an opportunity: to initiate these conversations using a tool not linked with partisan affiliations, such as AI.

Using AI responsibly and ethically offers significant potential to contribute to sustainable development and strengthen democratic societies. Insights gleaned from interviews with experts, alongside various sources like podcast, social media, blogs, and academic literature, reveal promising applications of AI across government, education, health, and justice. 

For instance, interviewees shared trends and stories about AI’s role in healthcare, including enhancing early disease detection, analyzing language cues for psychiatric conditions, and utilizing clinical records to identify public health disruptions. Additionally, Argentina's judiciary is exploring AI to improve the identification and characterization of rulings on gender-based violence. Optimizing public services and government procedures also emerged as a potential benefit of AI, as highlighted by interviewees. 

However, to fully harness the potential benefits of AI for democracy and sustainable development, we must acknowledge and mitigate its associated risks. Only by doing so can we maximize AI’s benefits while minimizing its potential harms. Here are some key risks to consider: 

- Concentration of Power: AI’s potential for data and power accumulation by certain actors poses a significant threat. This can undermine democratic principles and the rule of law by granting a select few undue influences over political and regulatory processes. Experts further warn that such concentration can stifle innovation. When research and development efforts align solely with the priorities of powerful AI actors, the field rises stagnation due to lack of diversity and fresh perspectives. 

- Information Manipulation: AI can be used to manipulate information presented to voters, including the spread of fake news and misinformation. 

- Algorithmic Bias: Implicit biases embedded within algorithms can lead to unfair and discriminatory outcomes, such as the exclusion of certain citizens groups. Experts have shared examples of AI used in parole decisions or government assistance programs exhibiting bias towards minorities or specific social groups. 

- Difficulties in Oversight: The lack of transparency in the use of AI can limit citizens' ability to monitor and understand how their data is being used and how policy decisions are being made. This opacity makes it challenging to contest decisions, as interviewees highlighted. Citizens cannot challenge an AI-made decision when the underlying mechanisms behind it are not clear.  

- Privacy Threat: The vast amount of data collected by AI, particularly personal or sensitive data, raises concerns about potential violations of privacy, confidentiality, and image rights. Interviews revealed this as a significant challenge regarding AI use in healthcare and legal matters within Argentina. 

- Geopolitics and AI: Experts worry that rising tensions between countries might slow down progress in AI research and development. 

- Fallibility of AI: The implementation of AI systems, regardless of cause, is susceptible to errors. These errors can stem from technical malfunctions or human intervention. Interviewees emphasized the importance of adopting best practices from highly secure industries like aeronautical and nuclear power, where robust safety protocols are paramount.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Lab, together with UNDP, are uniquely positioned to lead the public conversation on AI use and regulation in the country, while promoting awareness of its benefits and risks for development and democracy. The UNDP’s strong reputation and history of convening stakeholders during critical moments make it a natural facilitator. For instance, during the 2001 economic and social crisis, UNDP played a central role in fostering dialogue and consensus-building around shared priorities. Today, while the context is different, UNDP can leverage its experience to identify common concerns and values that can serve as a foundation for a new national consensus on AI, one that reflects the core priorities of the Argentine citizens. Thus, UNDP is a neutral mediator beyond the political divide.  

Additionally, the recent change in national administration presents an opportunity for the Lab to serve as a valuable partner. Given the limited experience with AI initiatives within the new government, the Lab’s knowledge and capabilities can help bridge potential gaps.  

As a leader in innovation, we have been exploring various AI applications in areas like elections, democracy, and development. We actively share our findings with the CO and aid in enhancing its capacity to leverage the advantages of AI. Furthermore, the Lab has been successful in executing impactful actions, including the pilot project on NLP, the seminar hosted at the end of last year and the TED Talk facilitated by our Head of Experimentation, Lorena Moscovich.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Learning questions that arise from our challenge: 

- What are the elements, process, institutions and models involved in the regulation of AI worldwide? Is it feasible to replicate these in Argentina? Has the country its own laws and experiences on AI? 

- What are the characteristics of AI usage and access in Argentina? Are these compatible with ethical, sustainable, and responsible standards?  

- Who are the main players within the national AI ecosystem? 

To meet this challenge and its related learning questions, the Lab has drafted a portfolio of actions. Within the first quarter of the year, we plan to publish a report on the challenges and opportunities of AI for development in Argentina. This report will synthesize what the Lab has learnt from around 40 interviews conducted with key AI experts.  

In addition to this report, we are putting together a blog post that analyzes the current state of AI-related laws and regulations in Argentina. We are also organizing a new seminar to be delivered this year, focusing on regulatory topics. The report, the blog entry, and the seminar will join the lineup of products and events we rolled out in 2023, which can be checked out in the sections above.  

The Lab will further undertake a prospective analysis to identify signals of change that allow us to explore emerging trends and development regarding the AI for Development Agenda. This analysis will encompass the exploration systematic examination of relevant signals

The action plan on AI employs a comprehensive methodology, including stakeholders mapping, interviews with key informants, blogs publishing, application of AI models, and the convening of seminars. The long-term ambition of this multi-pronged approach is to leverage collective intelligence to foster a deeper understanding of how to regulate this technology, ensuring a balanced approach that maximizes its potential benefits while mitigating associated risks. 

Furthermore, the Lab’s exploration of AI applications within the context of political discourse extends beyond a mere proof-of-concept. It serves as a prototype for testing the potential of AI to contribute to strengthen democratic governance. As previously mentioned, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model using Chat GPT was developed to analyze political speeches. This model successfully identified recurring themes and shared values among diverse speeches, establishing correlative relationships. Additionally, the model processed real political speeches to generate artificial ones. The pilot project serves as a compelling demonstration of AI’s potential to identify unifying elements within a nation’s political history, showcasing a responsible application of this technology that aligns with democratic principles. 

The pilot project holds significant value for further research on the dissemination of misinformation and “fake news” within democratic environments. The extracted insights could facilitate the application of these models in generating fictitious text for survey-based experiments (vignettes) and assessing a voter's capacity to discern between human-generated and computer-generated text. 

Furthermore, the Lab leverages AI-powered analytics to examine social media data, aiming to understand public sentiment and opinions on AI within Argentina. A collaborative effort with Citibeats, a social listening company, resulted in the analysis of nearly 22 million tweets from public accounts georeferenced in Argentina during April,2023. This data provides valuable insights into public perception. 

The Lab’s approach to fostering collective intelligence involves in-depth interviews with a diverse pool of experts on the cutting-edge applications and regulations of AI for both democratic governance and development. These interviews facilitate the gathering of insights and case studies regarding the potential benefits and risks associated with AI. The knowledge acquired serves as a foundation for establishing categories and variables for analyzing AI aspects relevant to the Lab’s core challenge. 

Finally, the Lab hosted a seminar on AI that fostered open exchange with a broad audience. Experts and over 100 attendees engaged in discussions on approaches and models for regulating AI and its impact on development.  

 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Discussions regarding the ethical consideration surrounding the development and deployment of AI are ongoing. However, these discussions often lack focus on critical aspects, such as: 

- Identifying key players and stakeholders within the national AI ecosystem, including their respective roles and agendas. 

- Examining potential regulatory models that can support government authorities in fostering an ethical, responsible, and secure AI development 

- Analyzing the pressing challenges that AI presents for Argentina, particularly in the context of its development efforts 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



As we move forward within our challenge, the Lab will continue to work in fostering an open and inclusive public debate on AI's applications and regulations. We aim to raise awareness and understanding of AI's potential to contribute to development goals, while also evaluating existing regulatory frameworks to ensure they balance innovation, safety and ethical considerations. 

Building upon groundwork established last year, the Lab will leverage the knowledge and data gathered through expert interviews, literature reviews, and analysis of non-traditional resources (blogs, social media, podcast) to illuminate the interaction between AI and development. These insights and conclusions will be compiled and published in a dedicated report. 

Collaboration with experts and partners has proven instrumental in mapping the national AI ecosystem. We hope that the ongoing exploratory conversations officials in Open Data and Public Sector Innovation allow us to foster partnerships to scale up our efforts. With our contributions, we aim to nurture the AI national ecosystem. By highlighting key experts, projects and organizations, and by connecting stakeholders across the ecosystem, the Lab’s work is laying the foundations for a robust national AI landscape.  

The Lab has a successful track record of executing public outreach initiatives, including open seminars and a TED Talk. To further expand our reach, we plan to host another seminar in the upcoming period. 

Last year, active engagement with our colleagues within the CO was a hallmark of our work. We encourage open dialogue and feedback, fostering participation in the challenge. We also organized training sessions to enhance the CO’s capabilities in approaching AI. Building on this success, we will continue to share progress and results with our colleagues, and plan to organize another training session to explore how AI can enrich the CO’s work.
