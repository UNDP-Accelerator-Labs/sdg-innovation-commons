## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Avinash Meetoo

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

1st August 2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

N/A

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Our challenge is to create and/or strengthen connections between local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the tourism sector to enhance business and trade opportunities and, hence, allow them to better recover from the resulting socio-economic impacts of COVID-19

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Connect local micro, small and medium enterprises in the tourism sector for better recovery from the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19.

To address the recurring environmental degradation of soil erosion which has been prevalent on Praslin Island in Seychelles, prompted the creation of Terrestrial Restoration Action Society Seychelles (TRASS). Mr Victorin Laboudallon took the initiative to start planting endemic trees in areas that were degraded and eroded from forest fires and weather elements in an effort to mitigate an environmental catastrophe.

The team in TRASS came up with the idea of using dried “latanier” palm leaves to create natural protective barriers against soil erosion (ultimately, into the sea). Dried palm leaves are collected then tied together as a fence and fitted into the soil.

The Accelerator Lab would like to test whether this natural fencing method works in curbing soil erosion on e.g. the different kinds of terrain and slopes which exist in Seychelles and using different kinds of leaves.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To learn whether dried palm leaves can be used to curb soil erosion in Seychelles.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF a patch of land protected using dried palm leaves is less affected by soil erosion than a patch of land not protected using dried palm leaves THEN this means that the dried palm leaves have been effective to curb soil erosion.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The experiment will be done on slopes with different steepness: very steep and a gentle-moderate steepness. Two patches of land will be identified for each slope. They will need to be next to each other and be on an incline. They will need to have the same kind of soil and level of exposure to rain and sunlight.

Soil erosion plots will be established: microplots of 2 m wide x 4 m long (or smaller e.g. 1 m x 2 m), depending on site homogeneity and options for plot replication) with a catch-pit at the bottom end of the plot, lined with thick black plastic at the bottom to catch the sediment. Palm leaf barriers will be built in one of the plot. Each barrier will be at 1 m intervals. The second plot will not be protected with dried palm leaves (reference/control plot). Each plot will be bordered by solid strips of wood or palm leaf to prevent water from the outside into the plots. At the bottom of the plot there will be a catch-pit of 1 m width and 0.7 - 1 m deep depending on the site conditions to accommodate sediment during heavy rainfall. The two plots of land will be left exposed to the weather and regular measurements of soil erosion will be made. The height of the soil from each plot will be measured every month. At the end of the experiment, the soil will be removed, air dried by laying them on plastic sheet for 3 days and then weighted. From these measurements, the central hypothesis will be tested.

Depending on the site condition 2 or 3 replications may be established to cater for any variations between plots. 

Other plant materials will also be tested such as Cocoplum (Chrysobalanus icaco), Wild tamarin (Leucaena leucocephala), Bamboo (Bambusa sp.) etc.

The experiments will be done at Pasquiere and Pointe Chevalier:
At Pasquiere, we will test the palm barriers on different slope steepness (2 to 4 plots)

At Pointe Chevalier, we will test different plant materials (6-8 plots).

The experiment will be conducted by Seychelles Parks and Gardens Authority (SPGA) and 
Terrestrial Restoration Action Society Seychelles (TRASS).

TRASS will manage the overall project and will provide staff and transportation paid for by the experiment. SPGA will provide palm leaves for the experiment and staff during working hours free of charge.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Volume (cm3) and dry weight (Kg) of soil eroded.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The patches of land will have markers at regular intervals and these markers will be used to measure how far soil erosion has happened relative to fixed markers.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity.&nbsp;**

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Many people rely on tourism for their livelihood and, of course, tourists will only come to an island if the environment is preserved. Given the terrain of Seychelles, especially in Praslin, soil erosion is a major issue and, through this experiment, I learned that both the Terrestrial Restoration Action Society Seychelles (TRASS) and Seychelles Parks and Gardens Authority (SPGA) have the expertise needed to help in mitigating this issue.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

I have never been to Seychelles and all interactions with the implementing partners were done online.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Colleagues from countries with the same kind of terrain and rain patterns.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Partners from countries with the same kind of terrain and rain patterns.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

None.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

To plan the experiment on a longer time period to account for dry seasons with no rain.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. The experiment is general in nature and other plants / terrains / weather conditions can be substituted.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The implementation partners and the idea for the experiment were identified during a Solution Mapping exercise.

> What surprised you?

How nice, serious and efficient the people of Seychelles are…
