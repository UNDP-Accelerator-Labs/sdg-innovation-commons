## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We are trying to create a prototype of brick out of plastic waste which can be scaled in the community.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we offer an affordable and a high-quality plastic brick to the people, THEN they will buy it and use it for construction purpose.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

I will carry out a demonstration in the community to see their interest in such an initiative.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

- Measurement of plastic waste to create the prototype
- Measurement of sand
- Measurement of fuel
- Production cost of one prototype.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

-Weight measurement of each ingredient used
-Receipt of the expenses

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

- 3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
