Bhalo is Bangladesh’s leading farm inputs marketplace and a social enterprise. Bhalo uses a network of digitally equipped sales agents to connect farmers to leading farm input suppliers and financial service providers, and offer curated high-quality farm inputs (seeds, fertilisers, chemicals, etc.), customised advisory and financial services (buy-now-pay-later, insurance, etc.). This increases production and income of smallholder farmers, and sales and market share of partner businesses.
