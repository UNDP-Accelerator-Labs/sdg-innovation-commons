## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that employment opportunities among women and youth are very limited yet there are a lot of women and youth who are engaged in the manufacturing of various products that have no market access. Consequently, 72% of women are self-employed in the informal sector and 25% of youth are also running micro enterprises in the informal sector. Hence our assumption is that if local MSME’s are supported with domestic market access and product promotion and development, then local MSME’s can grow to provide employment opportunities for vulnerable groups such as women and the youth.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Having the launched the “no single use plastic bag” campaign with major retail outlets, the need for reusable bags led to women organizations taking the initiative through the support of UNDP to produce multiple use shopping bags. Given that Eswatini’s economy is integrated to the South African economy, locally produced bags have been competing like all other products with South African bags. This led to the Acc Lab exploring about ways in which local products can be promoted to support local MSME’s with improve market opportunities. Local products are generally overlooked because of several reasons such them being unknown but only known to their own communities. There is also an inherent bias by consumers who prefer South African products because historically it is all they have known. While the product may be good, at times they suffer poor production standards which may be a deterrent to both retailers and consumers. At the present moment, there many local SME’s producing a variety of product but are not known and have not been able to place their products in retail outlets. This unfortunately stunts the MSME development in the country leading to fewer employment opportunities.  As noted above, the Acc Lab has partnered with SEDCO a government established SME development company together with the SME unit from the Ministry Commerce Industry and Trade. Other stakeholders include SWASSA a standards company set up by government to help support MSME’s with standards particularly for those who aspire to be export based. The Lab has also roped in Eswatini Investment Promotions Authority (EIPA) who are also promoting local products for export markets. Further partnerships will be established organizations that represents women and the youth.

QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE - The low contribution of MSME’s to employment creation and contribution of overall economic performance. Currently MSME’s account for 21% employment in Eswatini and this is against the backdrop of low external investment inflow. https://www.uneca.org/storys/eca-sro-sa-supports-validation-draft-financing-model-micro-small-medium-enterprises-kingdom  QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE - SEDCO through its incubation facilities has several MSME’s who are producing a range of products and yet they remain anonymous to the broader spectrum of consumers, particularly in mainstream market platforms such as retail outlets. South African imported products continue to dominate the local market particularly in the retail arena. This implication of this status quo is a stunted MSME sector that results in low creation of employment opportunities, particularly for the youth. At a time where the country is reeling from the impact of corona virus pandemic, coupled with the impact of the economic recession Eswatini has been going through in the last ten years, there has never been a more opportune time for development agents such as UNDP to rally behind governments efforts to resuscitate the economy and further regain the development grounds lost to COVID 19 pandemic. The strategic Roadmap for economic recovery of 2018 is anchored on a private sector led recovery and growth. The local MSME must be supported with market access or penetration so that they can also contribute as a vital cog of the private sector machinery.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Although there is a plethora of initiatives and programmes that different development agents have formulated to support private sector development. Primarily these have been in the rea of business development capacitation often coupled with access to finance. Other programmes have included business incubation and external market access support for SME’s whose products are at an advance development stage for export markets. This approach has been very selective and often leaving a lot of MSME’s whose products are considered underdeveloped for external markets. Our approach primarily targets entrepreneurs who have been excluded because they do not meet the set requirements of support. Furthermore, this intervention focuses on promoting local products within the mainstream domestic markets. Not only will this expose local products to consumers, but it will give expose MSMEs to bigger market opportunities and the requirements necessary for them to penetrate. Through an intensive campaign, this initiative will attempt to inculcate a sense of pride concerning local products. This initiative will serve as a bridge between MSME’s who are currently operating in the peripherals of mainstream local market networks and the full spectrum local consumers, including retailers, individual consumers, private companies, and government. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Eswatini Acc Lab to bring of awareness and promote locally produced products through domestic market linkages. Local products to be exposed through flea markets in strategic s areas while also creating platform for MSME’s to interacts with representatives of market linkages such as retailers while also assisting them meet development standards.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

The intended learning question is that of understanding impediments that inhibit local products from penetrating local market linkages and the support required to that locally produced products can get tractions in domestic and regional markets. The intended learning question is that of understanding impediments that inhibit local products from penetrating local market linkages and the support required to that locally produced products can get tractions in domestic and regional markets.  We need to understand the types of products that are not getting traction in the local market and it would be imperative to have a general quantification of those products in terms of type, the values chains from whence they come from. Furthermore, we need to understand policy gaps that may impede penetration of local products.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Solutions mapping – used to identify existing solutions to the challenge collective intelligence – used to define the problem and to understand the challenge Piloting – to test the solutions to the challenge Sensemaking – understand the ecosystem co-creation – in the event there are no existing solutions to the challenge we work with end-user to co-create well targeted solution to the challenge

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is no full census of different products produced locally by MSME’s disaggregated in terms of the value chains they belong. There is a need for data on consumer trends on the target products by local women and youth.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

SEDCO stands to benefit from this challenge in that it remains their mandate or prerogative to promote MSME’s not only from a business development point of view but also from market linkages. This challenges with present SEDCO with practical blue print of how to promote local products in the domestic market sphere through the  deployment of a variety of interventions listed above that inter alia include market access promotion of local products, standards development for a variety of products to mention a few. SEDCO should then be a in a position to scale up these interventions and roll them out at a larger scale based on the learning outcomes of this challenge.
