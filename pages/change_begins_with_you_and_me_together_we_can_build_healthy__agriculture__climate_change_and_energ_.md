CHANGE BEGINS WITH YOU AND ME TOGETHER WE CAN BUILD HEALTHY, AGRICULTURE, CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY SECTORS

> Brief description of the innovation

I write to enlighten my fellow youths and the Zambians at large on Health, Agriculture, Climate Change, and Energy matters so as to see how together we can improve our country. If we need to improve Zambia we should first ask ourselves questions like: Why do we have poor HEALTH CARES, FEW PEOPLE ENGAGING IN AGRICULTURE, WHY THERE IS CHANGE IN CLIMATE, WHY MANY CHILDREN ARE DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOLS especially girls and many others matters dealing with EDUCATIONAL SECTORS, and lastly how we can face the issue of power shortage when it comes to ENERGY SECTORS. After together finding reasons as to why then together we look forward to see how we can positively handle these matters which ain't only affecting few but the economy of Zambian at large.

HEALTH
Under health sector both us and the government should know that above all else the life of every individual should be valued and cared for firstly above all else because all of the other things we can do as Zambians depends on insuring that the lives of the Zambian people are safe for without good healthy there is nothing one can do we work, we do all things because of being healthy without being healthy we cannot do anything. It is indeed true that we have many healthy sectors that have been constructed and opened in each and every province of Zambia but it is so that there is no drugs in them whereby most of the times we are told go and buy for ourselves drugs which is not good at cause people go to hospitals and clinics so that they can get the medication needed for their improvement and well being which is causing people not to go to healthy sectors when they are sick of which not advisable to treating any form of sickness without proper check up from learned practitioners and it's not everyone who can afford to buy medication meaning that we have people who are dying duel to this problem. Then also the government should sensitize the medication received in hospitals and clinics to insure and approve that they are safe for the community not delivering expired medicines..

AGRICULTURE
There is need to teach citizens on the importance of agriculture and how they can engage themselves in this business especially people in urban areas who mostly depend on being employed instead of creating opportunities for themselves by looking around to see where there is need to work on or anything they can use as the tool for self financial aid. This call the government to make sure they inspiring and innovate citizens by empowering those who cannot afford farming and laying of cattle with things which are needed for them to become capable taking that task and also to providing farmers inputs on times so at to give the support and the courage they need to grow enough food as to fight the bad economy at hand.

EDUCATIONAL
This sector needs to be considered critically and insure that pupils and undergraduate students exercise their rights to education!
Firstly education fees have become to expensive because not all parents have completed their educations and ain't employed some are just doing small businesses such as selling tomatoes and vegetables etc whereby even to put food on the table to some it's a very big challenge, some are vulnerables, some are too poor and some have got large families to take care of and some are single parents because of death, divorce, unwanted pregnants, and rapping those children they have needs to be educated but it's so sad that those who can manage think that everyone are able to do the same also and the institution which exists only exists by names and don't do what they exist for they eat the money which is supposed to be the answer to someone's prayer out there of which calls for the government to step in seriously so as to insure those people who are deprived of this right are restored.
Lastly many girls are dropping out of schools and ending up becoming prostitutes or getting married or only pregnant and lose focus in life not because of their family backgrounds  but because of some senseless teachers, old people and ritualists who take advantage of them and use them sexually for their evil satisfaction when these same people are supposed to be the examples of good morals, positive impact and should be responsible as parents yet they are the ones destroying them without considering what kind of future they are creating for the future generations or imagine how they would feel if it were their children who were sexually abused. I have seen this with my eyes and it hurts me and pains me as I have personally witnessed this and I therefore say this misconduct and evil happening in educational sector should be addressed seriously because not all girls can have the courage to stand for themselves or to speak out for themselves because of being intimidated and scarings while some know too little of their rights and the law henceforth they are left with no opportunity than to give in. In the end many youths are ending up becoming prostitutes, dropping out of schools, getting married prematurely, are infected with HIV and obtain poor results. I solemnly call upon the government to inforce youth groups and clubs that will be to stand against this injustice through educating them and standing for them if it is requiring lawyers to be employed for their sake then it should and should be addressed seriously so that sanity and integrity can be restored in schools.

CLIMATE CHANGE
The reason for the cutting down of many trees in Zambia is as the result of few employment opportunities therefore people end up involving themselves in charcoal burning which affects the climate change badly and no matter what they can be told or advised about the problems which may results in continuous cutting down of trees it will not make sense to them because they want to survive which means that government should strongly work on establishing many job opportunities and on empowering the nation with business capital so as reduce the number of people who involves themselves in deforestation we can not say to stop everybody because our daily activities in homes when it comes to cooking and many other things we use charcoal and woods and in as much this fact still stands there is need of introducing afforestation and reforestation in the place where it is fit so as to cover up.

ENERGY
In Zambia we only have one source of power which is commonly known as Zesico while day after day and year after year things that are demanding for power  increasing like a flood cause by the mighty rains duel to forests and farms given to people as plots, growing of market sectors, and industries such as minings and many more to count which uses power which means that there is in of introducing some other intuitives ways to increasing the energy sectors so that it'll fit the demands of the nation therefore if we need to introduce solar power plants and allowing some other companies that can provide energy come in so that people will not be bearing loadshedding cause this affects businesses and wastes commodities of some business people and there is competition of power supply there will be reduction in the costs of power united and also it bring improvement of services.

The above listed matters will bring in job opportunities, safety, improvement , integrity and sanity in educational sectors and will build the economy of Zambia if they are considered and handled seriously because it is the above things that mostly make citizens to think the government seem as though they ain't doing anything  when it requires all the Zambians to work together with the government in solving the matters that destroys and affects the people of our nation.
