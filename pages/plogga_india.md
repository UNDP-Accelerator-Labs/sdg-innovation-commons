> Description of innovation

 Plogging is an act of kindness towards the environment, where you jog and pick up trash to challenge the everyday use of plastic and understand the journey of waste right from when it's produced to its ultimate disposal. It's a more than 2-year-old sustainability initiative based in New Delhi. It is inspired from the plogging movement that began in Sweden in 2016. It's a pure behaviour change and action-oriented activity that focuses on exercise and promotes the idea of sustainable cities and communities through a transformative act of jogging and picking up trash. The initiative tracks kilometers covered, calories burnt, the amount of segregated trash (recyclable and non-recyclable) picked up during the drive as tangibles to measure impact. The central aim is to build communities through plogging that adopt sustainable waste practices like segregation of waste at source into wet and dry, composting, adopting a single-use plastic-free life, among others. A significant part of this initiative also deals with empowering youth and communities with agency and capacity-building so that they can encourage others societies to rally for cleanliness and proper waste management practices.
