> Title of the innovation

Early marriages mostly in rulo places.

> Brief description of the innovation

Zambian rulo places people don't believe in education, they say even if one gets educated they still can't find jobs,, for that reason they think it's pointless to take their children to school,, instead they get them married as early as 12 to 14 years very young,, so my humble request to the president is that please let's take action and stop these early marriages thing and make sure each and every child goes to school for the better tomorrow, by so doing will save mony young girls from being abused and dieing during labor,, remember they say the growing tree is the forest. Thank you 🙏
