> Title of the innovation

Run off collector (Rainwater collector)

> Brief description of the innovation

Would you rather let the rain water runoff? Water be wasted? Water cause floods?
Exactly,am guessing you would prefer collecting the rain water. My iñnovation is designed in response to flood mitigation, improved rainwater harvest to conserve water for future use.
Bearing the first prototype using readily available materials to test it's practicability as seen in the picture.
Rainwater Harvest can improve water availability in the country, while there is need for a roof to exist inholder to harvest rains.Behold my run off collector does not need a roof, the rain water acts as a catchment, collecting the rains from an open space and transferring into various water storage.
My motivation was  to allow house hold rainharvest in rural areas and places facing water Scarcity,the water can be for gardening or washing.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The run off collector, will help various house holds harvest and reserve water during rainseason.It will help improved availability of water in homes. My target are house holds facing water challenges,rain harvesting companies,mines and water providers. Depending on the customer a different respected size will be designed.Forexample rainwaterharvesting companies harvest alot of water hence the runoff collector needs to be big enough to allow large amounts of water to be harvested.
The prize will help me develop the first ever run off collector and allow me make a contribution to the Geography field.I will make me happy as a Geography Student to help find a way to thrive even with climate change. 2025 ,2030 third part of the world is predicted to face water scarcity.its now or never,ways to use Water prudently is now.

> Technical Feasibility

The run off collector,is a rain catchment designed intiative, allowing collection of Rainwater instead of allowing it to run off. It has a seever after the spread funnel, which blocks particles from entering the run off collector. it the has three pipes acting as water distributors to various water storages.
Due to lack of appropriate reasons the prototype existing uses readily available materials ,ordinary water bottles pipes and clothe net.
Proposed should use plasticated tanker,pipes and server.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will help garders have water for their garden,my friend is unable to have a garden home because they move long distances to get water. Others have poor sanitation and suffer from frequent illness because of poor sanitation.The world at large is looking for ways to use Natural Resources prudently,my run off collector will improve the level of Rainwater in the country.At house hold and National level.
