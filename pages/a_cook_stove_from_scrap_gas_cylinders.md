A man in one of the peri-urban areas (area 23) in capital city of Lilongwe is reusing discarded gas cylinder casings to make stoves that are energy efficient. The stove can be connected to electricity or solar panel to increase its efficiency. Small amount of Charcoal dust or briquettes can be used to make fire in the stove. The stove can cook beans in 30minutes.
