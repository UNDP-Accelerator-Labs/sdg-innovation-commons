## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

From the stage of sense making and stocktaking workshop we found out that climate change is one of most pressing issue that currently our government is working on. Prior to that there was a huge catastrophic incident such as flood, heavy rain and typhoon happened in the past two year. Therefore, our team decided to explore the root causes of climate change issues with flood in Dili the capital of Timor-Leste. So the sort findings were related with mass dense population migrated from rural area to capital, poor urban planning in Dili and most importantly the climate resilient toward building and housing in capital of Dili. With all of these, the green building experimentation activity was a great way of connecting these problem toward the sustainable solution for building construction.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the climate change is an issue that threatening our future generation then the green building and resilient infrastructure should be great solution for future generation

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

1. Conduct stocktaking workshop from public private sector and academia 2. Co-design the green building concept 3. Launch design challenge to youth group 4. Boothcamp to get winning team 5 Stablish technical working group 6. Prototype model 7. Launch for public 8. Reporting result.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Launch green building design challenge for public and select one group of winner to prototype the idea.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Stocktaking workshop, group discussion, individual interview and observation

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 Months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99
- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time for stocktaking workshop, data collection, survey, collaboration with private sector, co-design, prototyping.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

If the climate change is an issue that threatening our future generation then the green building and resilient infrastructure should be great solution for future generation The original of hypothesis was proven with several reason. Firstly, the idea of resilient infrastructure is proven with new concept of design using local available material such wood, bamboo, limestone and palm shaft (Tali Metan). These are material that we think could support proper infrastructure based on the existing context of community need. Secondly, the idea of integrated hydroponic system to support fresh vegetable with 850 net pot which could help to support sufficient vegetable for more 100 household. Thirdly, solar panel with rain water harvesting system install in building as one of great solution to reduce the use of energy and water consumption.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The experimentation method using was prototyping method which led to longer process of construction. This could be the change I think we could make and contribute to the process.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 Months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

10.000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The follow up activity will be observation of building life span with engagement activity with youths and community in prototyping space.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Not sure, depend of the budget and annual activity plan.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

At first we did not expect the process would take longer up to 12 months due to pandemic of covid 19 first hit our country of Timor-Leste. The main learning of this experiment was how the design of green building being implemented and tested with the idea using local available materials. The construction process and design was more intense and challenging because of the contractor expertise and experience of using local material. On the other hand, the initial budget allocation for prototyping was only 6000 USD prepared but during construction phase it was not enough so we have to inject an additional of 4000 USD in order to complete the prototyping process.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The challenges we faced were time constraint. The prototyping process took 6 months to conclude which was unexpected and out of our plan. The activity timeline planned was maximum 6 month from the stocktaking workshop up to launching of green building.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The country office program and project use the space for meeting and gathering.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Community, public/private sector and youth group.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

The advice would be government institutions specially ministry of public work to adopt the green building concept and replicated into public building

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes indeed, but it should be replicated based on the context and societal needs

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Limited exploration but more on sense making during the stocktaking workshop.

> What surprised you?

The outcomes of the space, more people visit to the Green Building space and youth engagement activity.
