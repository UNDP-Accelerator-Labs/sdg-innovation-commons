Author: Samory Araújo, Head of Solutions Mapping, UNDP Cabo Verde Accelerator LabEmpowering the Next Generation Through ScienceScience and technology are crucial in shaping the future, and this bootcamp was designed to inspire curiosity and innovation in young minds. The inclusive nature of the event ensured that participants from diverse backgrounds could explore scientific concepts in a supportive environment. From 4-year-olds getting their first taste of chemistry experiments to teenagers designing intricate 3D models, the bootcamp was a hub of excitement and learning.This Inclusive Science Bootcamp on the island of Sal addresses the growing need to promote science education among children and young people in Cape Verde. While the country possesses significant potential for scientific and technological development, access to quality science education remains limited, particularly for those in rural or underserved communities.By offering this unique opportunity, the Bootcamp aimed not only to equip participants with scientific knowledge and skills, but also to promote personal and social development. By working together on scientific projects, children and young people learned to work in teams, communicate their ideas and solve problems together - essential skills for future success in any field.

Building Bridges, Breaking BarriersThis bootcamp is an initiative to build bridges between children and science in Cape Verde, empowering the country's next generation of leaders, innovators and scientists.The Inclusive Bootcamp is more than just a science camp; it's a space for building connections, breaking barriers, and fostering a sense of belonging. It creates opportunities for young people, regardless of their background, to engage with science and technology in ways that might not otherwise be accessible. By providing an inclusive learning environment, the bootcamp helps to break down socio-economic and educational barriers, ensuring that all children and young people can benefit from the transformative power of science.A journey into the world of physics and chemistryThrough fun, hands-on activities, the children were introduced to the basic principles of physics and chemistry, allowing them to see science in action. Whether it was learning how different chemicals react or understanding the forces behind simple machines, each experiment stimulated curiosity and critical thinking. The bootcamp gave participants the opportunity to ask questions, test ideas and learn by doing - key elements of scientific discovery.

3D modelling: Shaping creativity and problem-solving skillsAs well as experimenting with physical science, the participants were also introduced to the world of 3D modelling. For many of the older children, this was the first time they had worked with 3D design software and they quickly grasped the basics of digital modelling. The hands-on sessions encouraged creativity as they brought their ideas to life in three dimensions, developed problem-solving skills and learned how to turn abstract concepts into tangible models.

The experiments that excited the children the mostMoving Sand - the children discovered that science can be as unpredictable as it is fun when they mixed cornstarch and water to create a liquid that felt alive in their hands.With the Lava Lamp, they saw that science can be as fascinating as it is magical as they watched the difference between water and oil create floating 'lava' effects in a jar.And who doesn't love rockets? In the Flying Rocket experiment, young scientists watched the controlled explosion of a chemical reaction between bicarbonate of soda and vinegar, while watching a small homemade rocket launch!Each of these moments brought a sparkle to the eyes of these children and young people, who discovered that science isn't just theory - it's a world of possibilities, ready to be explored, where there are no differences, promoting gender equality, equity and access to information in a creative and exciting way. This module emphasized teamwork, scientific research and practical experimentation, culminating in group presentations and discussion of the results. By the end of the week, the participants had not only learnt basic scientific principles, but had also developed skills in collaboration and critical thinking about the world around them.

Looking Ahead: A Foundation for the FutureAs the 2024 Inclusive Bootcamp ends, the impact on the participants is clear. They leave not only with new knowledge and skills but with a sense of excitement and possibility for the future. Many of the young participants have expressed interest in pursuing further studies in science and technology, inspired by their experiences at the bootcamp.This type of experience, such as the BootCamp, is essential to get children and young people interested in science and technology from an early age. By providing hands-on contact with tools such as microscopes and the opportunity to observe animal and plant cells, the programme makes science less abstract and more tangible and fascinating to young people.For 13-year-old Deurrick, the opportunity to look at cells under a microscope was more than just an interesting activity; it was a gateway to the world of science, where he could see himself as a future scientist. This type of experience directly contributes to building confidence in each participant's abilities, showing them that they too can be part of great discoveries and innovative solutions.In addition, by fostering critical thinking and curiosity from an early age, the BootCamp prepares future generations to meet the challenges of tomorrow and promotes the transformation of ideas into reality, as he emphasized in his testimony. The belief that with the right tools they can turn their ideas into reality is a powerful seed for the future, especially in a context like Cape Verde, where developing skills in science and technology is key to innovation and progress.

Conclusion This initiative, the result of a partnership between Accelerator Lab /UNDP Cape Verde, Science Houses in Mindelo and Praia of the University of Cape Verde, with the support of ICCA - Instituto Caboverdiano da Criança e do Adolescente, Associação Chã De Matias, TUI FutureShaper House Cape Verde, TUI Care Foundation, was led by dedicated teachers and monitors whose mission was to stimulate curiosity, creativity and scientific thinking in a fun and engaging environment.
