> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If my current business i.e Agriculture sector is expanded, it will help me to meet the ever growing demand of food, not only food, but health food, regular planting of vegetables and fruits trees will help protect the environment. Transportation; Currently I only have one light truck, and engaged in transport, but with increased demand of goods, I fail to meet ever growing demand for goods delivery. If supported my revenue collection will improve, and provide Jobs for supporting staffs.

Agriculture sector has ever increased demand of food as a result of population increase, which has also given demand of transport sector because markets of goods covers a wide Spectra of society. Therefore, this business gives high feasibility. Additionally, agriculture sector is labour intensive, which in turn can provide much needed Jobs for the youths.
