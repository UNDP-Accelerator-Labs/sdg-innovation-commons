Exploring left behind groups to enable inclusive digital transformation in Cambodia
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to explore the characteristics of people who are being left behind in the digital transformation in Cambodia, and how the UNDP Country Office, as an accelerator for inclusive digital transformation, can support those left-behind groups to take advantage of the opportunities and mitigate the risks presented by the digital transformation.

Cambodia launched various digital policies in recent years to move the country towards the digital economy and industry 4.0. This leads to an increase in the adoption of digital technology in government and businesses. Digital transformation presents Cambodia with various opportunities for socioeconomic development and technological advancement; however, there are notable digital divides and digital literacy gaps in certain groups. Many Cambodians, for instance, people in rural areas, are likely to be left behind and vulnerable to the risk of digital transformation underpinned by diverse tangible barriers such as the different quality of digital infrastructure, speed of connectivity, and training and skills required to navigate technology if compared to urban residences.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

After the collapse of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, Cambodia remained a least developed country (LDC) for decades until its graduation from LDC in 2021 to a lower-middle income country. With the total population of 14.68 million in 2013 and the total of 3.16 million households, 2.5 million households were rural compared with 0.66 million urban. This indicated that Cambodia is still highly rural. According to the country poverty analysis in 2014 by the ADB, about 90 percent of the poor live in rural areas. Although, Cambodia has been one of the fastest-growing economies with the average annual growth rate of 7.7 percent between 1998 and 2019 due to garment export and tourism, about 18 percent of the population is identified as poor based on the new poverty line of 10,951 Riel or USD 2.70 per person per day. The poverty rates also vary from one area to another. The rate in rural areas is the highest at 22.8 percent compared to 4.2 percent in Phnom Penh. The imbalance of development growth between the urban and rural area has created a gap in many sectors, especially the access to digital tools, internet and other technologies in the rural area. The World Bank showed that only 32.9 percent of Cambodian population uses internet. Thus, certain groups in Cambodia do not benefit from technological advancement. Digital transformation tends to enlarge the inequality between the rich and the poor even bigger, as those who have access to technology gain more benefits in accessing information, knowledge and other opportunities.

> 

Despite the high rate of digital adoption, Cambodia ranks 102nd of 141 countries in digital readiness. One of the main reasons is the low level of digital literacy. For instance, only 30% of Cambodians have basic digital skills to use digital systems for Internet searches, communications and information-sharing. Further, there is a notable urban-rural digital divide in terms of access to the Internet. In particular, internet and mobile phone subscriptions are mostly in urban centers. As access to the Internet was critical in the pandemic for learning opportunities and for basic services and accurate information, many Cambodian households, notably the most vulnerable, thus likely fell behind. To mitigate potential negative effects, avoid deepening existing social and economic inequalities and ensure no one will be left behind in digital transformation, it is therefore important to define who is left behind and in terms of what.

Internet accessibility, affordability of mobile devices, and the COVID 19 pandemic have accelerated the country’s Digital Transformation seen in booming e-commerce market, delivery businesses, fast adoption of digital technologies such as mobile application. This signals that digital transformation is inevitable. However, this fast digital growth is not benefiting everyone equally and puts them at different levels of exposure to digital risk. The majority of them are using digital technologies without necessary knowledge and awareness of the digital technologies’ risk and opportunity. For many Cambodian micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and small household farmers, this can also pose an existential threat to their survival and business continuity. It is observed that there are less interventions to support PWDs (People with Disabilities) access to digital services and digital public services. The digital services themselves are not being thoroughly designed to include the dynamic need of the disability community.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Accelerator Lab can bring value added in the efforts for inclusive digital transformation by defining and categorizing groups of people in vulnerable situations that are being left behind.

We aim to use and leverage existing data (such as UNDP’s AI for Poverty Mapping and UNESCAP’s LNOB Tree/Analysis) to better understand the needs, barriers, and enablers of left-behind groups, and to inform recommendations for UNDP Country Office and UN Task Team on Digital Transformation to design more effective interventions to reach those left-behind groups.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

With digital transformation underway, digital technologies are more widely available and easier to use. Yet, the advantage, particularly digital banking and e-commerce, seems to be widespread in urban centres. Cambodia Accelerator Lab is exploring left-behind groups to enable whole-of-society digital transformation in Cambodia.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can the UNDP do to include all social groups in the process of digital transformation in Cambodia? Or How can the UNDP do to contribute to narrowing down the gap in accessing digital technologies between the urban and rural people, and other certain groups?

It is important to know the overall economic and development growth, the level of education of different social groups, and their employment and income rate.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Systems thinking approach, particularly the iceberg model, will be used to identify underlying structure and mental model that underpin the exclusion of certain groups from benefiting from the digital transformation. Ethnography will be used to define the characteristics and intersectionality of the left-behind group, while horizon scanning will be used to scan for signals that may positively or negatively impact the target groups and their exclusion. Mapping, through e.g., Geographical Information System, will be used to overlay different layers of data to unpack the geographical characteristic of being excluded and how it links to other characteristics of exclusion. Finally, participatory approach will be used to integrate multiple perspective on what considered as exclusion.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Disaggregated data for different groups considered to be left behind: the new data sources will allow us to define intersectionality and identify geographical and socioeconomic characteristic of the left-behind groups.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This learning plan will benefit the UNDP’s internal programmes including the Country Programme Document (CPD) as digitalization is one of the enablers and portfolios design. This will also contribute to the initiative of UN Task Team on Digital Transformation which UNDP is a lead. Potentially, the result of this learning plan would also contribute to the implementation of the Cambodia Digital Government Policy 2022-2035 by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPTC) as UNDP aim to collaborate with MPTC to conduct a digital landscape assessment as part of this policy implementation.
