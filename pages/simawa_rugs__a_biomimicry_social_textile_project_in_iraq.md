The Solution:

The solution's owner thought of this project as a part of the recovery process after COVID-19. It focuses on developing rug production process in Simawa governorate, especially knowing that this city suffers from poverty, in fact more that 55% of its inhabitants suffer from poverty and that was even before COVID-19. The Rug making (Izar) is an endangered craft, and even more so after the difficult times that our country has faced. We are trying to preserve this craft, by tying it to other individuals, like the people living in the capital Baghdad, or the ones who live abroad. The project’s impact is in providing the artisans from Samawa all the raw materials, developing the Rug making process to help make production easier for them, taking the final product from these poor areas and deliver them to other individuals who are interested in reviving their cultural heritage. This way we can support the artisans, preserve our heritage and make these products available to the rest of the world. The artisans who will participate in this project, are all women from Samawa city. They come from reserved and poor families, and they have amazing skills whether it’s spinning wool, coloring it or embroidery of the Izar. This project is created with the help of Iraqi raw materials, starting from the sheep fleece and ending with the Iraqi artisans. By: Noor Hashim, young entrepreneur
