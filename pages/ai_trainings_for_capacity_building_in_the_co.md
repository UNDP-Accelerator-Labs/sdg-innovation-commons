AI Trainings for capacity building in the CO
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Artificial intelligence technologies not only offer solutions in various fields including development, but also bring up many topics of discussion. Integrating artificial intelligence tools that can be effective in individual, institutional, and sustainable development into business methodologies in the country office initiates a new field focusing on its scope and application areas.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The usage areas of artificial intelligence technologies are expanding every day, and with new tools, time and energy savings are achieved, while they are also being used in brand new research areas. For example, they can be used for decision-making mechanisms, generating participatory policies, and resolving systemic inefficiencies. We have identified the need for tools that portfolios within the CO can include in their projects and expedite processes, and we have determined the necessity of increasing interest and knowledge in relevant artificial intelligence tools and this subject

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



To create a learning process in areas where the evaluation of AI technologies within the CO intersects with the innovation approach and to introduce the artificial intelligence ecosystem. We plan for the use of AI tools to be one of the initial application areas during the preparation process of the new Country Program Document.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



We initiated learning sessions for the use of AI in individual and business methodologies.

The recent AI training I participated in was a valuable opportunity to enhance both my individual understanding and our collective capacity in leveraging artificial intelligence for development. The training not only introduced technical aspects of AI but also provided a broader perspective on how AI is shaping global development agendas, organizational strategies, and everyday operations:

AI is not just a technical topic but a strategic capacity area.

Capacity building efforts, like this training, are crucial to ensure AI benefits are accessible, ethical, and sustainable.

There is a need for continuous learning, as AI is a rapidly evolving field.

Collaboration across teams and sectors is essential to unlock AI’s full potential for development.
We must approach AI with both optimism and critical awareness — understanding the opportunities while mitigating the risks.
