No

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

The purpose of the invention is to ensure the super-intensive production of a number of crops in a controlled environment. Increase productivity up to 100% and save land, water and energy up to 500%. DGSystems is a startup that owns its own innovative technologies in response to a number of fundamental challenges facing the modern greenhouse industry. We have developed innovative systems that allow, compared to the proposals on the market, within the minimum investment (up to minus 300% compared to the analogue), to give the customer the opportunity to get the maximum benefit when cultivating low-growing crops such as lettuce, strawberry, etc.; Using our systems, you will be able to: significantly reduce the cost of energy carriers, maximize the yield on a specific area, reduce the number of support staff and at the same time increase their labor productivity, save water resources, minimize or completely refuse the use of pesticides, etc. Also it allows to use mechanized techniques most effectively.
