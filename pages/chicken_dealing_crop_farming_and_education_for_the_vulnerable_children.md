> Brief description of the innovation

Because of the passion for rearing chickens and crop farming I started raring chickens at the back of my yard. I started small with 100 birds and I've been progressing very well and the numbers have now risen to 200 birds. I am also running a project for vulnerable children in the compound of Lusaka for primary school education. The challenges I have been facing are to do with space for sports and agricultural activities.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It is going to help by educating members of the environment on poultry and small scale vegetable farming. It can also lead to starting a corporative in the community. The goal would be to improve production and begin to supply local and super markets at affordable prices. The main of the project is to educate and equip the youths with agricultural skills.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently the project is run in the backyard and if given opportunity to acquire land this project would need to be implemented on a larger scale.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project will empower the youths and women with knowledge which will lead to reactional activities for the youths  and will boost national development in the long term as the youths will be equipped with skills that will promote agricultural development.
