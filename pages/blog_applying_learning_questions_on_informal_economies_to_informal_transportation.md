1. Introduction

This report by the Global Partnership for Informal Transportation (GPIT) was commissioned
to assist UNDP’s Accelerator Labs with exploring informal transportation.

The first activity of this partnership is to Co-Create an Informal Transportation Policy
Framework for the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network Cities. The project aims to blend
experiential knowledge from the labs with insights from selected academic research. This
work advances the learning questions around informal economic activity and serves to pilot
the learning circle process as an R&D priority. The project launched in October 2021 and will
conclude in September 2022.

The main outputs of the project will be a Glossary on Informal Transportation and a Policy
Note. In the inception period of this project, the consulting team conducted a review of the
most recent and trenchant literature on informal transportation, as well as a series of expert
interviews focused on sourcing knowledge not readily available by other means.

This inception report presents the preliminary analysis conducted through a desk review and
interview with experts to answer the six learning questions on informal economies provided
by the UNDP Accelerator Lab team.

For each question, the team consulted a shortlist of 13 publications and 5 key experts. The
desk review focused on a diverse selection of publications released within the past five years
that conduct comparative research across cities, countries, or regions. These include
publications which identify research gaps, focus on informal transport workers, include
gender perspectives, and position informal transport within broader studies on sustainable
transport and mobility in the Global South.

From November to December 2021, the consulting team spoke with three current experts,
along with two representatives of so-called “super apps” — a new generation of integrated
mobility-, banking-, and commerce apps blurring the line between “formal” and “informal.”
As part of their agreement to participate, the names and affiliations of the latter have been
redacted from this public-facing report.

The analysis aims to shape, adapt, and answer UNDP’s learning questions in the context of
informal transport. Finally, a list of proposed sub questions to raise potential avenues of
inquiry for UNDP teams and help refine the research agenda is presented.

3. Defining Informal Transportation

The terms "informal transportation" and “paratransit” are used to describe a variety of
transportation services around the world. However, there is no widely accepted definition to
describe this type of transportation. Several authors acknowledge that adopting a strict
definition of informal transport is difficult and problematic, since there is a risk of omitting
a service that does not meet the confined definition given the range of services that can be
found (Hein Tun et al., 2020). For this learning track, informal transport refers to all
operations with some measure of informality.

4.1 Learning Question #1: Perceptions and Motivations

Broadly speaking, there are three types of informal transportation workers. The first are
often rural-to-urban migrants who take up driving due to its relatively low barriers to entry,
lack of other opportunities, and relatively high wages. (In Uganda, for example, boda boda
drivers frequently out-earn teachers, police, and other civil servants.) They typically rent their
vehicles rather than own them. (In India, for example, there are some 12 million drivers for 7
million vehicles.)

The second type tend to be rooted in a more urban context and are more likely to invest their
savings in owning a two- or three-wheeled vehicle, seeing it as a productive asset. They may
accrue other assets and businesses — such as a shop or plot of land for farming — and exit
driving after several years.

Both groups tend to organize through informal driver networks and associations designed to
limit competition or fix prices. In Uganda, for instance, boda bodas are frequently organized
into stages with their own identities, defined territories, and pricing, and whose members pay
dues and elect their own leaders. (Shekar, 2021)

A third type of worker has emerged with the advent of platform super-apps such as Gojek,
Grab, and Ola. Whereas the platforms began by aggregating existing vehicles and drivers,
they are now recruiting their own drivers. In Jakarta, for example, Gojek is recruiting from a

7

new pool of un- and under-employed workers drawn from other sectors under economic
pressure, such as manufacturing. They drive primarily for the platforms — which represent a
form of “semi-formalization” explored later in the report — while only dabbling in informal
work outside them.

The advent of a new class of drivers and platform-based business models has created new
tensions. One of the primary motivations for informal transportation workers is a sense of
entrepreneurial independence and agency — with the tradeoff being financial precarity. One
reason to drive for the platforms is the promise of steady, algorithmically-sourced work — at
a cost of control.

Not only is there a tension between these attitudes but also the business models
underpinning them, as the platforms seek to bypass and steadily erode the competitive
dynamics of boda boda stages and similar structures. Anyone working to improve the
efficiency and structure of informal transport — whether through vehicle electrification,
route rationalization, or driving training and safety — must decide whether to work together
or at odds with these networks. Are there local possibilities to reform these networks to
accelerate adoption of best practices? Or opportunities to create new, digital-first
communities outside the totalizing platforms of the super-apps?

“One gap is dignity and respect for the drivers themselves,” says Deepa Shekar, former chief
operating officer and chief product officer of Kampala-based SafeBoda. “How do you help
vocalize what their concerns are and represent their needs at a more formal level? How do
you give them more advocacy and power?”

What might driver-first, digital-native driver associations look like? In India, Three Wheels
United maintains a bustling online community where drivers share tips and sell- or rent
vehicles on a financial platform agnostic as to how they derive their earnings. How else might
we promote communities for scaling learning and bolstering driver solidarity? This is a
different proposition than the outsized political clout historically wielded by driver
associations, which has also come under siege as of late from platforms representing a path
to semi- or even full formalization — potentially at drivers’ expense. (Kumar, 2021)

Proposed Sub Questions: Perceptions and Motivations

1. How do informal transportation workers see themselves?
2. What are their motivations for doing this work?
3. How do they see their vehicles?
4. How do they perceive the benefits and trade-offs of investing in new tools,

tactics, and technologies?

5. How open are they to learning and improving at their trade?

4.2 Learning Question #2: Formalization

The goal should be integration rather than formalization. As the platforms’ technological
capabilities begin to outstrip those of formal public transportation when it comes to booking
and payment, the question is how and where to integrate the two. In October 2020, for
example, Gojek launched GoTransit for seamless multimodal trip planning across its own
services and Jakarta MRT. Will super apps seek to fold formal transportation into their
platforms? If so, who and how will determine public policy for these hybrid entities?

From the platforms’ perspective, cities should be focused on outcomes. Rather than argue
over regulation or which entity owns the transaction, cities should decide where and how
formal-informal integration furthers their larger aims, such as increasing public transit
ridership and overall employment, or reducing the need for private vehicle ownership.
(Raman, 2021)

Offloading capabilities to private platforms might lead to public sector stasis, but the
potential for semi-formalized services to fill gaps in formal networks is potentially worth the
risk. Given that 20% of residents in Latin American cities lack access to formal transport within
a 10-minute walk from their homes — and that 15% of residents in informal settlements lack
any access at all — informal transport can and does play a vital role.

Super app executives argue public officials should identify gaps in urban transportation
networks, create policies and incentives to encourage private sector interest, and effectively
let the platforms fill them. It’s worth noting that Uber and Lyft have made similar arguments
in Global North cities, selectively publishing data on the number of trips originating from
under-served areas. But rather than increase transit ridership through multi-modal trips, the
ride-hailing duo has been found to depress ridership instead. (Graehler, Mucci and Erhardt,
2018)

Drawing on her experience with SafeBoda, Deepa Shekar frames the issue differently by
centering drivers rather than platforms. “How do you connect informal workers and
customers more effectively? Where can data be obtained to do that?” In her opinion, the
public sector should acknowledge the existence of informality and advocate on behalf of
drivers' rights and safety. Rather than formalizing services or platforms, how would outcomes
change if the role of drivers was formalized instead? (Shekar, 2021)

Proposed Sub Questions: Formalization

1. What are the incentives for formalizing the informal transport sector?
2. What are the risks?
3. Do new platforms provide an alternative?
4. What are the barriers to formalization?
5. Who are the beneficiaries?
6. Would formalization be harmful to innovation in the sector, or would it

provide certainty?

4.3 Learning Question #3: Digitalization

The speed and impacts of digitalization over the last two-to-five years cannot be overstated.
From the perspective of scholars and NGOs, the rise of super apps such as Gojek has been so
swift as to be almost entirely absent from the academic literature.

This question is further divided into three sub-themes in order to unpack various aspects of
digitalization. The first explores the structure and operation of platforms, with special
attention paid to the role of digital wallets and to what degree they share characteristics and
portability across cultures and geographies. The next examines how the integration of digital
booking and payment has become a critical pathway for building fintech-enabled credit-
scoring systems to ensure and scale new models of financing. Finally, are there opportunities
to create common infrastructure, interfaces, and communities to ensure interoperability
and enable alternatives to existing super apps?

Digitalization has introduced a degree of formality to informal transport. By requiring
drivers to submit credentials, wear uniforms, and submit to GPS-based tracking and
surveillance, platforms such as Gojek, Grab, and Ola, etc. have clearly instituted some
formalization of the sector, but to what extent is up for debate. Aishwarya maintains the
platforms represent a third category of worker. From policymakers’ perspective, it’s
important to note that while digitalization has made workers more legible to the platforms
themselves, they remain opaque to regulators and the broader mobility ecosystem, as each
platform struggles to maintain its competitive advantage.

11

As noted in Question #1, the platforms have also introduced new trip patterns. By disrupting
hub-based models such as boda boda stages with individually dispatched drivers, the
platforms have tilted trips away from last-mile legs toward point-to-point trips. (Shekar 2021)

Super apps’ killer app is the wallet. What binds platforms such as Gojek, Ola, and Gozem
together are the digital wallets alternately linked to banks, telcos (e.g. Safaricom’s M-PESA),
cash-to-wallet conversions, or earnings stored-and-spent entirely within the app. Wallets
such as Gojek’s GoPay, for example, provide the glue between the company’s mobility
offerings (e.g. GoRide, GoCar), meal- and grocery delivery (GoFood, GoMart), and eventually
the broader e-commerce capabilities from its 2021 merger with Tokopedia, creating the new
holding company GoTo.

Wallets also help these platforms create flywheel effects through horizontal expansion into
new categories, and from leveraging customer data and behavior from each vertical to cross-
subsidize growth across other offerings. Whereas more specialized services might compete
on providing customers with the best experience, super apps tend to focus on expanding the
breadth of services and best integration between them.

Wallet dominance can impede or accelerate mobility offerings. While Gojek, Ola, and Grab
succeeded in part because they moved swiftly to fill a vacuum with their own wallets at a time
when digital payments were accelerating — Three Wheels United’s Cedrick Tandong the
share of digital repayments has risen from 10% to 80% (Tandong, 2021) — the presence of a
strong incumbent can also pose a significant deterrence to growth. In order to compete
against entrenched incumbents such as SafariCom and MTN Mobile Money, new wallets
entering the market like the SafeBoda Wallet need to compete on the costs associated with
using wallets as well as develop additional services such as eliminating transfer fees, offering
interest on savings in the wallet, paying partner vendors via the wallet, and cash withdrawal
from agents. (Shekar, 2021)

Hence there is a strategic need for super apps to own their wallets and the associated
customer data that comes with it. In addition to telcos and super apps, a new wave of
competitors — such as fintech Wave, Africa’s first “unicorn” — are jostling for dominance.

A question raised by the early success of Gozem — an aspiring super app operating in 13 cities
across eight Francophone nations in West Africa, and boasts of having delivered 5 million trips
to 800,000 users to date — is whether the super app model is portable beyond
South/Southeast Asia. Both the established literature and several of the experts interviewed
(Raman, Tandong, Shekar 2021) insist that lessons learned in organizing or formalizing
transport in one cultural/geographic context cannot be successfully transplanted elsewhere.

12

One question for policymakers is whether and how to ensure interoperability across markets
and between players, or even to foster the development of public infrastructure and
interfaces. For example, India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI), launched in 2016, has
helped facilitate the shift toward digital payments noted by Tandong and Raman.

But in most cases, the evolution of super apps required constructing custom, highly
proprietary systems that are not only opaque to regulators, but also possess such an
enormous degree of technical debt that efforts to develop publicly-available alternatives will
never muster sufficient resources.

This is also due to the low (but increasing) rates of smartphone penetration, data usage, and
UX literacy — all of which are taken for granted in the Global North, but pose significant
barriers to both the ambitions of the super apps, and to hopes that platforms represent an
(equitable) path to semi-formalization. (Shekar 2021) For example, Uber’s global aspirations
were essentially defeated by determined competitors in both China (Didi) and Southeast Asia
(Grab), while achieving stalemate at best in India against Ola. And scholars such as Rida Qadri
have noted that even platforms such as Gojek are still reliant on drivers’ local knowledge to
navigate complex urban landscapes. (Qadri, 2021)

The question remains whether it is possible and worthwhile for governments to partner with
private actors and NGOs to create digital public infrastructure that is both interoperable
across platforms and would lower the barriers to entry for non-profit alternatives to the
super apps. For example, how and where does fintech regulation offer opportunities for
leverage when it comes to hybrid formalization?

As noted in Question #2, roughly 90% of India’s three-wheelers are financed, while only 10%
of loans are derived from the formal banking sector. In response, platforms such as Ola, Gojek,
and Gozem — as well as Three Wheels United — are combining the voluminous data points
gleaned from drivers’ wallets, payments, locations, and trips to build their own de facto
credit scores. Ola’s strategic partnership with the fintech startup Avail, for example, aims to
offer vehicle leasing, loans, and medical insurance to the 1.5 million drivers on its platform.
(Raman, 2021)

Cedrick Tandong frames his challenge as applying and scaling microfinancing practices to
mobility. Where formal institutions fail, he argues, is in refusing to tailor standard financing
products to the hand-to-mouth existence of informal workers. “The loan officer wants to
collect payments at the end of the month,” he explains, “but the driver has daily earnings,
and he doesn’t have a savings habit.” Rather than asking for relatively large monthly
repayments (which lead to higher rates of default), Three Wheels United requires small
payments daily. (Tandong, 2021)

13

On the other hand, Tandong notes, traditional microfinance is both high-touch and hyper-
local, requiring frequent check-ins by loan officers and thus leading to higher costs.
Digitalization helps solve these issues through: 1) collecting and correlating finer-grained
data than that typically used in formal lending; 2) machine learning to calculate risk; and 3)
low-cost tools for communicating with or even automatically deducting daily repayments
from lenders. Upon analyzing its loan portfolio, for instance, Three Wheels United surmised
only 20% of its borrowers were at significant risk at default. “We started out thinking every
driver was a defaulter, which is not the reality — 80% actually do pay on time,” he says. This
realization meant that it could focus the majority of its efforts on this narrow slice while using
less frequent, lower-communication (e.g. occasional text messages) with the remainder of its
portfolio. (Tandong 2021)

These practices — which the platforms internalize and which Three Wheels United has
mirrored by partnering with Uber to get number of trips, earnings, and collect cash directly
from these platforms — pose both an opportunity to learn and scale new best practices for
financing, and raise serious questions about the transparency and equitability of their
models. How are these de facto credit scores constructed? How should they be regulated to
prevent predatory lending? Given the reach of super apps, how are these scores carried over
to other forms of lending? Where are there opportunities to institute standards and best
practices across the industry?

Other questions for UNDP to consider:

• How to create new forms of driver communities. While the platforms seek to control their
relationship with drivers, informal digital communities — often mirroring boda boda stages
and their offline counterparts — have flourished in group chats on tools such as WhatsApp.
As Tandong noted, Three Wheels United has developed a flourishing online community in
which drivers trade advice and tactics along with an informal marketplace for renting and/or
selling vehicles. Are there opportunities to create larger, semi-formalized communities
independent from the platforms? (Tandong, 2021)

• Usability guidelines for apps. All five experts interviewed touched upon the importance of
both simplifying and contextualizing app UX design to better accommodate drivers’ dearth of
digital literacy. Are there opportunities to create cross-industry usability guidelines to both
assist drivers with navigating the technology and reducing barriers to new entrants?

• Communicating the consequences of financing. As part of its financing program, Three
Wheels United has streamlined how it communicates with borrowers, emphasizing the
practical consequences of delayed- or non-payments versus abstract finances. For example,
a missed payment might add X number of days in paying off the loan. Is there an opportunity
to standardize and scale this language to assist with similar efforts?

14

• Platform Cooperatives. Although the technical barriers may be steep, are there
opportunities for driver-owned platform cooperatives using digital payments and wallets? Is
there a minimum viable level of publicly-available digital infrastructure necessary to realize
one? If not, which pieces are missing and how might they be built?

Proposed Sub Questions: Digitalization

1. What does digitization mean for operators?
2. What are the most popular uses (e.g. payments, bookings, etc.)?
3. How do they perceive “super app” integrators such as Gojek and Grab?

As threats? As aspirations?
4. What are the alternatives?
5. Are there more operator-friendly models? If not, how might one build

one?

4.4 Learning Question #4: Environment and Sustainability

In its latest annual Electric Vehicle Outlook published last June, BloombergNEF added
projections for two- and three-wheeled vehicles for the first time, noting “some 44% of
global two- and three-wheeler sales and 25% of the existing fleet are already electric.” China
represents the vast bulk of this market, however, and once it is saturated, the consultancy
projects in its status quo scenario, “EVs take longer to spread in India, Southeast Asia, and our
Rest of World countries, where policy support is limited and stripped down, and low-cost
internal combustion vehicles are hard to beat on price.” (BloombergNEF, 2021)

Accelerating the conversion of two- and three-wheeled transportation to cleaner fuels or
electric vehicles — whether private or for-hail, formal or informal — is widely perceived as a
massive opportunity to curtail both greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, which now
kills more people prematurely in Africa, for example, than malnutrition and unsafe sanitation
combined. (OECD 2016). Not only is there an opportunity to use the relatively low costs and
proven economics of two- and three-wheeled EVs as leverage, but a large body of literature
has documented how the age and disrepair of informal vehicles leads to disproportionately
higher GHG emissions. (Cassius, 2021)

“You’re right that two- and three-wheelers will spearhead India’s electric mobility
revolution,” says Ola Mobility Institute director and head of research Aishwarya Raman, who
notes that 12.8% of Indian households possess two- or three-wheelers, compared to 2.3%
owning four-wheeled vehicles. (Raman, 2021). In June, the Indian government reauthorized

16

its FAME II (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and EV) subsidy scheme until 2024,
while also increasing the ceiling for two-wheeler credit by 50%.

That said, there are immediate gaps in the literature that must be filled before mounting any
large-scale campaign to turn over informal fleets in favor of EVs — such as reliable tallies of
the number of vehicles operating in most cities; their age; their fuel consumption; and a
reliable measure of GHG and air pollution. (Kumar, 2021)

Three Wheels United Cedrick Tandong pegs the size of India’s three-wheeled fleet at roughly
7 million, of which roughly 500,000 are replaced each year, meaning that if EV alternatives
were widely available and at a cost parity with current petrol models, it would still take until
2036 to turn over. How can we accelerate similar adoption rates? What are the most
effective tactics, tools, and messaging to encourage driver/owners to switch? To make more
affordable EV models available? And to provide financing? Because as Tandong notes, while
90% of India’s three-wheelers are financed, only 10% of financing stems from traditional
institutions. (Tandong, 2021)

All of our experts agreed direct appeals to drivers on behalf of environmental sustainability
are doomed in the face of precarity. “They only care if it increases revenues or decreases
costs, and that’s a blanket rule for everything,” says Shekar. (Shekar, 2021)

Fortunately, the latest generation of EVs boast half the operating costs and triple the total
cost of ownership (TCO) of their fossil fuel counterparts, helped in part by high post-
pandemic oil prices.

Many barriers to adoption remain, including a widespread lack of charging infrastructure,
drivers’ deep uncertainty about the potential resale market for second-hand electric two-
wheelers — a deal-breaker for households prepared to invest much of their net worth in a
single vehicle — and dispelling fears and misinformation.

But the biggest barrier is financing, given both drivers’ high rates of default and institutional
lenders’ reluctance to offer loans on friendlier terms. Three Wheels United has addressed this
by building its own proprietary credit risk scoring systems to offer financing directly. (The
technical contours of this system will be described in the next section.) Our experts suggested
several other areas, approaches, and potential partnerships to accelerate the financing of
vehicles and infrastructure:

• Increased government subsidies and financing. When India launched the original $1.3
billion FAME subsidy in April 2019, for example, its goals included electrifying 500,000 three-
wheelers and a million two-wheelers. In two years, it achieved only a fraction of each. Now
the government is pushing ahead with a new initiative to put a million EVs on the roads, this

17

time by offering to work through intermediaries such as Three Wheels United and provide
60% of the financing. Cedrick Tandong notes this will cut his interest rates from 16% to 6%
and lower vehicle costs by 20%. (Tandong, 2021)

• Partner with the platform apps to make their ESG commitments a reality. Uber, Gojek and
other platforms have made ambitious commitments to sustainability, with Gojek pledging to
become a “carbon-neutral” company by 2030, with a 100% EV fleet. This pledge is
complicated, of course, by the fact that they do not own their fleets — drivers do. Gojek’s
response was to partner with Gogoro in November to build-and-operate 5,000 e-scooters and
charging stations the company rents to drivers on its platform, and to partner with Indonesia’s
TBS Energi Utama in December on a new a joint venture to manufacture electric two-
wheelers, battery packaging, and battery swap stations, along with financing.

Gojek and its partners are following in the footsteps of Ola, which announced its own electric
scooter designs — the S1 and S1 pro — in August and began delivering them to customers in
December.

There may be opportunities for UNDP, development banks, and other NGOs to provide
advantageous financing to the platform companies in order to speed the rollout of both their
vertical
integration efforts and deployment of both vehicles and public charging
infrastructure. Another suggestion is to fund buyback guarantees for drivers reticent to invest
in EVs.

• Coordinate public-, private-, and NGO players to align incentives. Tandong seconds the
importance of buybacks, noting he is already in talks with the Asian Development Bank (one
of his investors) and World Bank’s International Finance Corporation arm to create similar
programs. As part of that effort, the IFC is departing from its standard (if unwritten) practice
of large block grants ($10+ million) in favor of smaller equity funds that can be deployed more
quickly through organizations such as Three Wheels United. (Tandong, 2021)

Finally, Tandong notes that UNDP and other organizations have a role to play in capacity
building and coordinating with government agencies struggling to implement headline
statistics. (“The guy who is supposed to award the permit doesn’t know which permit to give.
He hasn’t even heard about the process, just the minister’s announcement.”)

One advantage electrification has over digitization (more on which in the next section) is that
informal transportation associations such as Uganda’s stages are not at odds with
electrification as they are with the platforms, and can be recruited to assist with accelerating
EV adoption. (Shekar, 2021)

18

While the rhetoric of sustainability isn’t enough to sway drivers to make the switch, its health
effects and prestige are not negligible, either. Conversations around air pollution, drivers’
health, lower risks of hospitalization, and the total cost of driver downtime may also provide
potential levers of persuasion. (Tandong, 2021)

Electrification alone cannot make informal transport more sustainable. The literature argues
that route rationalization and optimization — through competitive tendering and other
mechanisms — will be necessary to solve the massive redundancy and competition on over-
served popular routes. (Behrens, 2021)

Combined with the questions above and those in the previous section, how can UNDP help
square the massive investments needed in financing, vehicle production, and infrastructure
with drivers’ desires for agency and autonomy? Are they fundamentally irreconcilable, or
are there opportunities to align them?

Proposed Sub Questions: Environment and Sustainability

1. How open and receptive are informal transport workers to upgrading the

environmental sustainability of their vehicles and practices?
2. What technologies do they prefer? (e.g. electric vs. clean fuels)
3. What are their motivations for doing so? (e.g. lower TCO? Higher fares? Less

air pollution?)

4. What programs and incentives have proven most successful in persuading
operators to upgrade their vehicles and adopt other, more sustainable
practices?

4.5 Learning Question #5: Equity

Informal transportation modes place disproportionate risk on vulnerable populations for
drivers and customers alike. Women are in constant danger of sexual harassment, abuse, and
assault; drivers face threats of robbery, assault, and extortion as well as air pollution and other
health risks; disabled passengers have difficulty accessing informal modes successfully, and
nearly all users of informal transportation grapple with a lack of more accessible and more
legible transportation options.

Women are most at-risk in using informal transport. They are clearly more concerned about
personal safety than men — both during using such services, and while waiting to access them
in public space. Although sexual harassment and violence is also a present risk in many forms
of public transport, the anonymity and lack of regulation in informal modes increases the risk
that such violence will go unpunished. (Morales-Miranda, 2021)

Drivers face clear and present dangers to their health and safety. Passengers are not alone
in bearing the threat of violence. In Central America, for example, there are cases of operators
shutting down after repeated violence against drivers made regular service impossible. In
some instances, drivers were subject to an extortionate “war tax” imposed by drug gangs for
transiting through their territories. (Morales-Miranda, 2021)

Drivers are also subject to elevated personal health risks from increased exposure to air
pollution. One study of danfo minibuses in Nigeria found that, in a sample of drivers working
an average of 20 hours per day, 22% suffered from partial blindness, and 99% from
hypertension. (Behrens, 2021). Although insufficient to convince drivers to purchase an

20

electric vehicle, promises of better local air quality and overall improvements in health can
be persuasive. (Tandong, 2021)

Informal transport is often inaccessible and illegible to disabled passengers in particular and
riders in general. As well documented by the Digital Matatus project in Nairobi and in
research from Latin America, informal transportation systems are often incomprehensible to
users beyond familiar routes. (Tun, 2020)

Digitization promises to address informal transportation’s lack of safety through
surveillance. A selling point for super apps has been their pervasive, ambient surveillance of
drivers and riders alike, offering an implicit degree of safety. Methods can range from simple
“selfie authentication” — requiring drivers to take regular snapshots of themselves as proof
of identity — to more sophisticated combinations of GPS-based track and machine learning
to flag drivers’ route deviations or unscheduled stops. (Raman, 2021)

Are the surveillance versus safety tradeoffs worth it? While platform executives attest to the
safety benefits of persistent driver survellance, researchers have documentd how drivers
struggle against opaque, algorithmically-driver monitoring systems. Broadly speaking, there
are two questions worth exploring in subsequent interviews and research with drivers and
passengers alike: is this unprecedented level of surveillance acceptable from a policy- and
regulatory perspective? And is it effective?

For comparison, similar systems have not protected Uber drivers and riders from thousands
of sexual assaults in 2017 and 2018, the details of which it has failed to hand over to
regulators, despite the threat of fines. How is location surveillance of drivers and their
vehicles being aggregated, stored, and shared? How does it conform to local privacy
regulations? What rights do passengers have and should drivers have when it comes to the
mass collection of this data? More research in this area is urgently needed.

Platform work arrangements are more conducive to participation by vulnerable groups.
Aishwarya Raman references Ola Mobility Institute’s studies on women in the platform
economy when she argues that gig work has expanded the number of opportunities available
to women, the disabled, and other vulnerable groups unable or unwilling to safely work
longer hours. While this statement deserves further scrutiny, she proposes public sector
investment and partnerships with NGOs to 1) increase gender inclusivity training for tollbooth
attendants and other ecosystem participants to lay the groundwork for increased labor
participation, and 2) investment in public washrooms and other infrastructure to assist
underrepresented groups in informal labor. (Raman, 2021)

Data sharing has the potential to increase road safety, decrease congestion, and accelerate
digitization. Deepa Shekar makes the case for (aggregated, anonymized) data sharing

21

between platforms and drivers as key to improving road safety at a systemic level. Armed
with this data, regulators might identify the deadliest intersections, riskiest waiting areas, and
other dangers borne by all participants. (Shekar, 2021)

In Mexico, Jetty is an example of a platform company willing to share information on ridership
and revenue with informal operators in hopes it will encourage them to embrace digitization.
The creation of a shared data ecosystem is potentially the first step toward a semi-
formalized mobility-as-a-service system. (Moscoso, 2019)

Proposed Sub Questions: Equity

1. What impact does informal transport have on equal opportunities for

operators?

2. How can investments in more sustainable vehicles or digitalization be

used to increase safety or increase equity?

4.6 Learning Question #6: Policy Models

How to formalize informal transport is a thoroughly explored question, but one that needs
updating for the platform era. The literature considers various options in detail, noting that
a common (failed) approach is to internalize informal operators by making them first/last mile
feeders of a formal network (e.g. BRT routes). Such tendering typically ends in tears, with
“successful” bidders unable to meet their financial obligations despite raising fares and
receiving subsidies, while unsuccessful one rail against public officials at the ballot box. (Tun,
2020)

Other examples include attempts to nominally formalize operators while turning a blind eye
to day-to-day business practices. Chile and Colombia, for example, require operators must be
affiliated with a company legally permitted to operate, while in Mexico, governments grant
individual concessions while negotiating with organized operator associations to define
routes, territories, etc. (Tun, 2020)

In sub-Saharan Africa — particularly Nigeria, South Africa, and Tanzania — hybrid approaches
to regulation tend to focus on the trunk-and-feeder arrangements described above, in an
attempt to leverage the lower fare and operating costs of informal modes to extend network
coverage. Such schemes then try to regulate a perceived oversupply of operators by awarding
route licenses and imposing a capped number of area-based licenses, franchises, and
concessions. (Behrens, 2021)

23

All of these approaches need serious reconsideration in light of the platforms’ technological
capabilities and disruptive business models. As noted in the section above, the question
posed by platform super apps isn’t how to formalize informal modes, but whether and how
public transport will be “de-formalized” by the proprietary booking-and-payment systems of
the super apps. Barring clear and close cooperation and regulation, this a potentially
worrisome development, creating the potential for both regulatory capture and the creation
of a new class of too-big-to-fail private institutions.

Are there open source, publicly-available alternatives to the platforms? Just as India created
the UPI for payments and created new legal classifications for gig- and platform workers
(more on which below), are there opportunities to create new legal- and technical
infrastructure to create inter-operable alternatives to super apps? Just as Berlin has built its
own “mobility-as-a-service” app and infrastructure as an alternative to Uber, et al., what
might an informal MaaS framework look like?

A nascent example mentioned by Raman is the Kochi Metropolitan Transit Authority’s Open
Kochi initiative. Inaugurated on November 1, 2020, the KMTA is India’s (and arguably the
world’s) first digitally-native MTA, tasked with integrating, planning, and regulating different
modes in the capital of southwest India’s Kerala state. Open Kochi is creating an “open
mobility network” powered in turn by a set of open, interoperable protocols named Beckn.
(Raman, 2021)

In this vision, the need for building a digital superstructure is obviated by decentralized
protocols that vastly increase flexibility while lowering development costs. But the platforms’
investments in time and resources have also created both customer expectations and a
competitive moat public alternatives are unlikely to overcome.

Either way, Raman notes that a number of Indian cities have approached Ola Mobility
Institute to help create regulatory sandboxes where new approaches to regulation and
provisioning can be tested. “There is a role civil society has to play here,” she says. (Raman
2021)

Another approach to formality is to focus on the worker, not the service. Raman vehemently
argues that current definitions of “formal” and “informal” uselessly strive to regulate services,
rather than centering the rights and protections of the workers themselves. She points to
India’s new labor codes of 2019-2020, which enshrined the legal status of gig workers and
extended social security benefits such maternity leave, disability insurance, gratuity, and
health insurance regardless of employment status. While these reforms still await
implementation, they hold the potential to transform labor’s relationship with the
government and platforms alike. (Raman, 2021)

24

For example, what is the future of operator associations in a post-platform environment?
What role can they play in brokering between government and industry while also working to
uphold safety standards? The literature review notes gaps in understanding the role of such
associations and how they operate; how can they be a resource in guaranteeing the rights of
platform workers?

Finally, where are areas of opportunity to semi-formalize the public infrastructure used by
drivers and customers alike for pick-ups and drop-offs, etc.? For example, drivers, platforms,
and government alike have a shared interest in streamlining the streetscape in high-trafficked
areas such as Jakarta MRT stations. What kind of partnerships might be forged to redesign
the public realm to be more conducive to the needs of drivers?

Proposed Sub Questions: Policy Models

1. What would a hybrid model (of formal and informal) look like?
2. What is the appropriate level of regulation with regards to safety,

sustainability, etc.?

3. What should the next generation of informal and semi-formal

transport services look like? How can they natively include such
benefits as demand responsiveness, flexibility, and meeting the
needs of urban informal economy/livelihoods?
