## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

By giving our fellow citizens an easy way to find the nearest fountain where they can refill their reusable bottles, we hope to reduce the use of single-use plastic water bottles that only create needless plastic waste. We also hope to stir up a conversation about the design of the public drinking fountains by talking about which designs contribute to water preservation, which one are most accessible to humans and animals of all shapes and sizes, and which ones are easiest to use with reusable bottles.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

1. If we engage citizens in a crowd-mapping exercise, we will raise awareness about the need for proper water management of our public water resources.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We are currently working with two core groups: youth and students to engage them in the mapping process, in addition to the general public engagement plan that we have, to ensure that we map the majority of fountains in the capital city. Once that process is complete we would like to open a conversation about the: mechanisms for water preservation, governance, reduction of plastic, and design of the fountains in the city.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Number of citizens that will participate in the crowd-mapping process.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We are collecting data through an online form, where every citizen can contribute to the map.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

Three months


> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

This is a 0$ experiment, and it only has non-monetary resources. The Head of Experimentation has worked on this challenge alongside the Lab colleagues for approximately 3-6 months.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes it has been. With this initiative we have managed to get citizens directly contributing to the crowdmapping effort, and additional we have managed to mobilize organizations and individuals to talk and raise awareness on the topic. Moreover, we have had national interest from two media houses to report on this story.


> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

I would definitely would use an application, to record citizens contributions, rather than a form.


> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months.


> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

0$

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We are thinking about scaling the initiative to cover the territory of the entire country


> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We are thinking about scaling the initiative to cover the territory of the entire country. We are contemplating teaming up with the Scouts and young people within the country, and design challenges to ensure that we keep people motivated an engaged in the topic.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We now know, that citizens have an interest and engage with development topics, when they understand the challenge, and what needs to be done. They have been enthusiastic about participating, and motivated by the unusual format of engagement [crowd-mapping versus, a public debate or discussion]


> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

I would've loved to have the skills to build an application that would make it easier for people to contribute the geo-locations of fountains they have encountered rather than filling in a form.


> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Three core benefits: a) we have created a database of geo-locations of the majority of fountains in the capital [something that has not been done], b) we have learned that citizens want to participate in initiatives like the one described, c) we now of many potential uses of this data.


> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

City institutions could benefit from this data, and embed it on their platforms; but more importunately this data should be public and a part of ongoing conversations in the space of sustainable water management, and making water accessible to all.


> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

n/a

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Ensure that the experiment is followed with a clear communications strategy/campaign to encourage citizens participation, and understanding of the challenge you are trying to raise awareness of/ tackle.


> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

I believe so, crowd-mapping could be easily replicated for: waste streams, air pollution etc.


> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

We are currently working on mapping sustainable solutions for water management, using rapid ethnographic research. This we believe will feed quite well in the overall treatment of the topic using the AccLab principles.


> What surprised you?

How much media/social media interest the topic/method of work created.
