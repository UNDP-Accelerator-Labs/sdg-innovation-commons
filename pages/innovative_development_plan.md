> Title of the innovation

INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

> Brief description of the innovation

Innovative development plan is an infective group of ideas  which can help build a nation despite of its status and it's resources. It's a well illustrated group of thoughts and imaginations bases on current facts to develop a poor country. This innovative plan is devided into different levels which are; Development Foundation, Formation of a friendly investment ground, Realisation of available resources, and proper utilisation of resources.

This plan has key factors and unique ideas based on facts retrieved from the ancient world and the reformed world of our days. It refers to how the world was reformed to the new world we are observing and enjoying today. By referring to the past and correcting some mistakes that our ancient leaders and citizens of our country made together we can develop and  build our country Zambia.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As we all know that all living things needs food ,this development plan will be based on the production of food products such as eggs, pork and chickens.
We have supermarkets in Zambia which imports this products from other countries instead of them buying locally. Having been realised this I have come up with this plan with a view of supply these products to these supermarkets. 

This innovation will help me generate about k2000 everyday from the  supply of eggs sold at k2 each starting with 100 layers laying 10 eggs everyday. Generating an income of about k60 000 per month.
This will help me meet my everyday expenses such as buying feed and other requirements. 

From pigs after a period of six months I will be able to supply a minimum of 100 pigs weighing 80-100kg. Starting with only ten pigs. Therefore I will be generating a minimum amount of about k30,600 very after six months. This will increase in the next coming months by 35% of the initial income. 

From chickens every after eight weeks i can be supplying 500 chickens.sold at k70 generating about  K35 000
 This innovation requires only ten people to manage .It will help my local people as they are going to find jobs and receive their  salaries by the end of the months .This will enable them to meet their day to day requirements and needs.
After 2 years of business maturity i could have employed 2000 people receiving  k1500 per month.
 it will also  help the local people to buy  products right from their door step.As it will grow and also  cutter for big supermarkets locally and finally international.

> Technical Feasibility

To start this business i will need K30 000 for building the poultry and the pigsty.
I will also need k15 000 to buy hen, chicks and piglets to be reared.
Finally a K10 000 to buy feed for the livestock. Adding up to the total of k55 000 as a starting capital.

> Anticipated Social Impact

As already stated above this innovation will only be started will 10 workers and after one year we will have a minimum of 1000 of which 80% of the workers will be women  getting k1500 . This work doesn't require alot of man power therefore 80% of the workers will be women thereby reducing inequality.   This shows  that innovative development plan has the potential of changing the lives of many people in my local town. 
Not only that but it will also prevent big supermarkets from importing products which can be produced locally. Currently people in my local town are buying these products imported abroad,with the implementation of this innovation they will be buying them locally.
