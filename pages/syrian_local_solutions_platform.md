Syrian Local Solutions Platform
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that local solutions in Syria, which are often innovative and context-specific, remain fragmented and inaccessible. This limits their potential for scalability, knowledge sharing, and broader impact. Additionally, there is no centralized platform to connect solution providers, community members, and global stakeholders to collaboratively address development challenges and drive sustainable change.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The history of our challenge lies in Syria’s protracted conflict and socio-economic crises, which have disrupted traditional systems of knowledge sharing and innovation. Despite these challenges, communities have developed numerous local solutions to address pressing issues like water scarcity, food security, and waste management. However, these solutions often remain isolated, lacking documentation, dissemination, and support for scaling.

Key Drivers:
Fragmentation of Local Knowledge: Due to limited collaboration and weak institutional frameworks, valuable grassroots innovations are often lost or underutilized.

Lack of Digital Infrastructure: Limited internet access and digital tools in many areas hinder the sharing and development of local solutions.

Absence of Centralized Platforms: Currently, there is no dedicated space to map, validate, and amplify these innovations.

Stakeholders Involved:
Local Innovators and Communities: Creators of context-specific solutions to address daily challenges.
Journalists and Bloggers: Key in documenting and promoting these solutions.

Development Organizations and NGOs: Potential supporters and implementers of scalable solutions.
Government Entities: Could play a role in institutionalizing and supporting proven solutions.

International Networks: Provide global insights and connections for scaling successful practices.

Current Situation:
Local solutions exist but are scattered and lack visibility.
Potential synergies between community innovations and international best practices remain untapped.
Key stakeholders, including solution providers and decision-makers, are disconnected.

Undesired Effects:
Missed Opportunities for Scaling: Promising innovations fail to reach a wider audience or gain necessary support.

Duplication of Efforts: Similar problems are solved independently, wasting resources and time.
Limited Impact: Isolated solutions have a reduced ability to influence systemic change and contribute to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Emerging Grassroots Innovations:

Local innovators in rural and urban areas are developing low-cost, frugal solutions to tackle issues like waste management and water scarcity. These solutions, though effective, lack documentation and wider recognition.
Increased Interest in Solutions Journalism:

During recent workshops, participants demonstrated a strong interest in storytelling about local innovations, signaling a growing recognition of the value of these solutions in driving community resilience and change.
Community-Led Platforms and Groups:

Informal social media groups (e.g., Facebook groups in Deir ez-Zor) are actively sharing tips and solutions for preserving cultural heritage and addressing local challenges, highlighting a grassroots desire for connection and knowledge sharing.
Demand for Knowledge Sharing:

Workshop evaluations show that 87.5% of participants believe the skills and knowledge gained will benefit their communities, underscoring the need for a platform to continue such engagement.
Example:
A recent workshop on frugal entrepreneurship revealed innovative agricultural practices like composting using organic waste, which have great potential for scaling but currently remain localized due to a lack of formal support channels.

These signals indicate a critical need for a centralized platform to capture, validate, and amplify these solutions for broader impact.

Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Solutions Mapping Expertise:

We specialize in identifying, documenting, and validating grassroots innovations through participatory approaches, ensuring that local solutions are visible and accessible.

Localized Knowledge with Global Insights:

Unlike other actors, our Lab bridges the gap between global best practices and local innovations, adapting proven solutions to Syria’s specific context while amplifying local solutions to a global audience.

Network Building and Co-Creation:

We foster collaboration across diverse stakeholders—local communities, journalists, NGOs, and international partners—creating a dynamic ecosystem for solution sharing and scaling.

Digital and Behavioral Innovation:

Our experience in digital platforms and behavioral insights enables us to design a user-friendly, inclusive platform that drives engagement, learning, and action.

Agility and Experimentation:

We operate with flexibility, allowing us to rapidly prototype and iterate the platform based on user feedback, ensuring continuous improvement and relevance.

Why Invest?

Unleashing Untapped Potential: Investing in this challenge will transform local knowledge into actionable solutions, driving systemic change and fostering resilience.
Catalyzing Sustainable Development: By connecting and scaling local innovations, the platform contributes directly to achieving SDGs in Syria.
Cost-Effective Impact: Supporting frugal, community-driven solutions offers high returns on investment with sustainable, scalable outcomes.
