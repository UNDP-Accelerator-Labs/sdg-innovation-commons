> Title of the innovation

Kwelani Cashless Payments

> Brief description of the innovation

Mobile money market has opened up avenues to innovate new financial products for the marginalized and underserved markets. Our payments platform has introduced its latest innovation, a multi vendor fuel card product for small businesses in the transportation industry and public sector.
With this fuel card, our Start-Up initially targeted Taxi and bus operators to have access to financial products that they did not initially have. As we did more surveys, our research showed us that a larger market could benefit from this innovation.

Our Card allows Cashless Payments to all participating fuel stations  integrating with wallets from MTN &amp; Airtel, it further allows users to follow budgets, record revenues and learn more about financial records, expenses and basic book keeping skills which is very important in the transport sector as Fuel is their main input cost.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our Product will generate revenues from the transaction fees that are charged to participating merchants that sell fuel and other transport related services (Filling Stations, Motor Vehicle Insurance, Tyre Fitness Centers). We improve operations of the existing businesses by making digital payments easily accepted between merchant and buyer of the product or service.

Our Off takers include private and public transporters, private and public organizations, individual motorists and Fuel Marketing companies.

The Challenge prize will enable us to expand our customer base, improve our technology and widen our merchant base to include smaller merchants.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation is a Based on a Payments System licensed by the Central Bank of Zambia as the regulator in its first phase operating a proto type in sandbox.
our wallet allows users to create accounts, make deposits, payments and transfers including withdrawals within a mobile and web app. 
We incorporated a contactless companion card to each user account, and provided merchants with Point of Sale Terminals who sell products and services, to initiate, communicate and authorize payments using the POS on one side and the card on the other.

-Our implementation enlists Fuel stations as the first phase merchants on our platform
-Distribute cards to taxis and bus drivers, other small operators
-Introduce financial products such as daily advance zero interest fuel financing etc

We plan to grow our platform to include motor vehicle road tax and insurance payments, and other sector related goods and services.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We believe financial literacy remains low in key sector participants of the Zambian economy, The transport sector is one such a sector employing thousands of Zambians who have had little to none formal education of any kind.
our platform will dispense vital information and knowledge on various related topics from time to time educating willing users to learn better financial management skills such as budgeting and saving.
Our app already allows a user such as a taxi driver to calculate their exact fuel usage over a period of time whether daily, weekly, monthly. This type of record keeping will keep our users fully aware of their expenses and how it affects their business and livelihood.
