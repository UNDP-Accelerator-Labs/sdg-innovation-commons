## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

We found that in Karnataka, visual platforms like Instagram and YouTube lack actual conversations about women, instead we see a lot of objectification of women on these platforms. On the other hand, Facebook and Twitter is where actual discourse takes place, but the conversations vary. In the target districts, Raichur and Yadgir, the analysis revealed that gender stereotypes are deeply embedded in young men and boys.

The stakeholder consultations demonstrated the necessity for a mixed methods approach, including both digital and physical (on the ground) nudges as well as offline capacity building and training in skills building projects to facilitate behaviour change amongst boys and men as well as include girls and women in this endeavour.

We also gained further insights on the need to integrate BI methods across UNDP skills building program initiatives on the ground. Further research is needed to identify what are the motivators of barriers for men and boys to take up unpaid care work, and how can that data help us understand who can be an ally?

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Due to the pandemic, this was completely a digital nudge pilot. It is recommended to actually adopt a mixture of on the ground face to face sensitisation measures as well.

## Data and Methods

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The pandemic exacerbated existing gender inequalities including unpaid care work. Measures to mitigate the spread of the virus such as school and day care closures and heightened care needs of elderly led to women and girls having to take up additional unpaid care work.  If we are to prevent a roll back of women economic participation, then addressing the gender gap in unpaid care work must become a priority. 

So the question before us was: How can we use the pandemic as an opportunity to shift the balance on unpaid care work? The second question was: How can we encourage men and boys to become allies for gender equality? How do we engage men meaningfully to transform gender stereotypes and gender roles?  We set out on a journey to better understand behavioural barriers preventing men and boys in engaging in unpaid care work and to see what kind of nudges had the potential to dismantle gender norms and create positive behaviour change. Over the last few years, behavourial science and nudges have emerged as a key tool in tackling persistent developmental issues. We were inspired from the work of Lebanon and Jordan lab and had exchange/learning sessions together.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Quilt AI was our technical consultant that designed and implemented the nudge

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We received immense encouragement from our govt champion (Additional Chief Secretary) in State of Karnataka where existing UNDP Project on skilling and entrepreneurship was being undertaken.  She invited 100+ NSS Volunteers from various districts to attend our gender sensitisation workshop where we also spoke about this pilot.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We teamed up with Inclusive Growth portfolio in UNDP India + the pilot was supported by the RBAP Gender team led by Koh Miyaoi.
