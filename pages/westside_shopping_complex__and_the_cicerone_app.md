> Title of the innovation

Westside Shopping Complex, and the Cicerone app

> Brief description of the innovation

Westside Shopping Complex is the future mall. It addresses matters of Health, Education, and Tourism. It integrates sporting facilities (i.e. indoor &amp; outdoor futsal fields, indoor sports hall), entertainment facilities (i.e. theatre, cinema, etc.), socio-community facilities (i.e. mine museum), convenience facilities (i.e. supermarkets), office space (i.e. office-sharing spaces, corporate suits), and storage facilities all in one location. This shopping complex doesn’t need to be built from scratch. It will sit on the renovations of an old mine mess with already existing but dilapidated sporting facilities that were built during the ZCCM era.
The Cicerone App:  is an online app that integrates digital features with the environment. It’s made up of the database feature (ranks hotels, lodges, resorts, campsites/backpackers, and guesthouses/BnBs based on the reviews of their customers and the number &amp; type of facilities and/or services they can offer), the financial planner tool, and the treasure hunt. The treasure hunt starts with successfully navigating a maze in the art gallery at the Westside Shopping Complex. Then you move on to traveling to tourist attractions all over the country; gaining points and reaching new levels. Each level comes with a prize; reaching the topmost level earns you the grand prize.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The shopping complex will generate income through renting out the office spaces, the storage lockers and depot, the convenience stores, the multi-purpose facility hall, and charging for use of the sporting facilities and entertainment facilities.
The mall offers a wide range of services so our target market ranges from the youth, families, mine contractors, transporters to private companies, just to mention a few. The challenge prize will help us purchase the property, carry out reconstruction, and install the facilities. The value-addition to the environment is that we will be re-purposing an old dilapidated structure into a beneficially functional facility for the community.
The Cicerone app will generate income through advertising - renting out space on the app display interface, but the biggest benefit will go to the tour operators who will receive more customers (as some tour operators will have the treasure hunt beacons stationed at their locations). For future iterations, we’ll have a paid version that users could upgrade to.
The challenge prize will help us build the app, collect the needed information and make engagements with key stakeholders.
The app will also be used as a tool to raise public awareness of wildlife conservation and sustainable tourism.

> Technical Feasibility

THE CICERONE APP has three features; the database feature, the financial planner (it’s more of a financial planning tool where the user plugs in information such as their location, budget, whether they’re alone or with a group, whether they’re with their own vehicle or using public transportation, the type of tourist they are, and their interests; then they get back results showing them where they can go, what activities they can do, what accommodation they can book, what sites they can visit, and what kind of transport they need based on the information they plugged in), and the treasure hunt (beacons are placed at all tourist attractions in Zambia. So when a tourist arrives at an attraction, the app will read that and award them with points. The idea is to travel to as many attractions as possible so that you can rack up points and gain a new level.).
The implementation plan for building the Cicerone app is we need a country-wide mapping tour to place beacons at all the tourist attractions. And we need to engage with all tourism authorities and tour operators so we register info on all natural sites &amp; wonders, and their tour packages, respectively.

> Anticipated Social Impact

THE SHOPPING COMPLEX will help keep the youths busy with working on their crafts and sharpening their talents; all whilst promoting sport and instilling life skills. Thus, keep them from bad vices. There’s nothing this well-integrated being offered to the youths of Kitwe, as a matter of fact, the whole of Zambia. When done, this mall will keep a lot of youths from loitering on the streets. Providing jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities to youths takes a lot of time, resources, and way too many institutions to get it done. But with sporting facilities, particularly this one, the youths will be quickly engaged. That being said, it will also provide its fair share of employment opportunities. This will not just benefit the youths of my community, but the youths of Kitwe, and probably the rest of the Copperbelt. Since time immemorial, malls the world over have not just been cornerstones of the community but hubs for youths to come together and grow their skills and creativity. 
The mall will mitigate storage problems/shortages of traders, transporters, and mine contractors.  It will help provide private companies and start-ups with affordable conducive workspaces. On Sundays, the multi-purpose facility hall (MFH) could be used for free by churches that are struggling to find a space of their own. We could also arrange with the government to have a vaccination canter in the MFH or the car park. The gym will provide different types of workout sessions that will keep the community healthy.
THE CICERONE APP will encourage more travel amongst local tourists, attract foreign tourists to stay longer, and make Zambia their preferred choice of destination. When more people start to travel, this will help restart tourism in Zambia, and grow the domestic market. The app will shine a light on wildlife conservation and promote sustainable tourism.
The world is going digital. Integrating technology in the tourism industry is what’s going to save a lot of tour operators from shutting down, and prevent the industry from crippling. It is imperative that we adapt. And this innovation – the Cicerone app – should be placed at the forefront to drive that change.
There’s a disconnect between potential local tourists and the beautiful tourist attractions their country has to offer. This app puts that information at their fingertips. There will be no need to go out of your way to search for what’s out there or pay pricy amounts to agencies to plan your itinerary. 
Zambia is overshadowed by the prominent tourism industries of other nations on the continent. This app when well-marketed will put Zambia’s tourist attractions on the phone screens of foreign tourists. Hence building that awareness and ease for tour operators to sell their packages without having to necessarily leave the country and attend networking expos.
