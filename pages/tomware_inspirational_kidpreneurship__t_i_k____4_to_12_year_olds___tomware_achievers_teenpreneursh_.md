> Brief description of the innovation

It was in 2013 during my pregnancy and job hunting  of almost 2 years to no avail that I realized I did not want my child to go through this (not having a job). I started thinking how this could be solved and realized our school curriculum teaches us how to get an education and get a job (making it seem as though it is your qualifications that determine your having an occupation or not). 
According to www.statista.com the unemployment rate in Zambia as of 2020 is at 11.43%. ToMwaRe will ensure that we create great innovators who will help create jobs but we also need to ensure that their leadership, time management, teamwork and communication skills are excellent as these are the hiccups I discovered in the corporate world. 
Starting them young will help create a great work and innovative culture.
Our prototype is the an EAGLE as we believe through our innovation to help create jobs, we our moto is flying above the storm like an eagle.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our innovation will generate income through KidPreneurship, TeenPreneurship and University/Organisational trainings. The community is and will continue benefiting as we conduct the same trainings in community schools and orphanages.
 
Target market are international schools, private schools, individual parents and banks . We anticipate over 1,155 ,000 customers will benefit from this solution.
Our Marketing Plan
We strive to deliver our services with excellence which will grow our word of mouth marketing, continue to use social media marketing and planning on soon starting television/radio marketing.
We are and will continue to give practical lessons to the children such as television and radio programs, business expo participation, awarding certificates, having discounts for referrals and loyal clients and help children register their businesses. 
Offline events such as Expos, family fun events and online we will use more of live and uploaded YouTube videos, Facebook and Twitter.
We will utilize schools, television/radio and bank partnerships. 
Our strengths are we start them young, qualified, experienced and offer essential skills to success. We have opportunities to expand through enrollment in schools from primary all the way to university.
Threats are slow adaption and Forex. Weakness is financial capacity. Positive feedback from clients will help overcome threats.

> Technical Feasibility

Our team has six staff
POSITION	EDUCATION
CEO	Masters -Leadership and Wealth Creation
Accountant	Degree – Accounts
Business Development Manager	Degree – Business Development and Marketing
Two teachers	Diploma – Early Childhood Education
Graphic Designer	Degree – Graphic Design

Our team loves children, strive to be excellent, all have had a phase in life job hunting hence understand the urgency of having job creators and innovative market leaders. 
OUR MOTO: flying above the storm helps us to strive hard towards our VISION.  
ToMwaRe has been offering its services since 2019 despite the huge hiccup that we faced due to corona-virus almost immediately after starting. But I trust and believe in my vision and eager to be part of the positive change not only in Zambia but in Africa.
The biggest milestones have partnering with two television stations were our KidPreneurs are running kids T.V programs, three students running registered businesses and participated in the first ever Lusaka Business Expo. So far over 500 children have been trained. 
Our goal is to build our own application where parents and children can subscribe, enroll and access our materials. To have 10 schools, 2 banks via their children's accounts, KidPreneur and TeenPreneur T.V program.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We start them at four years old (grass-root) to discover their passion/talents and brainstorm with them on business ideas. This will help children start at an early age to run successful businesses and create jobs in Zambia and Africa at large.
Our goal is not to impose types of businesses on them but to listen from them what they love. We know not everyone can be an entrepreneur, hence also help them think of innovations in the industry of their passion.
Our unique feature is starting them young and ensuring they get into an industry out of passion and not society influence.  The problem we are solving is mainly addressed with adult trainings.
Our services are both online and face-to-face. We also train community schools, orphanages and also provide individual focused programs where parents require to develop specific skills.
I have positioned myself in international leadership positions through Toastmasters International. My team will often enroll in different courses, join empowering networking institutes, staff should love children and believe in our vision.
