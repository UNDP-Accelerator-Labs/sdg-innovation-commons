Just Energy Transition and skills for jobs

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Just Energy Transition (JET) in South Africa - Coal to Renewables

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Collective Intelligence as a means to inform skills needs for the future for the JET

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Private Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

ISPANI Insights - pvt sector and Seriti - a development facilitation agency (NGO)

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The Just Energy Transition (JET) in South Africa aims to transition the country's energy system toward sustainable and clean energy sources while ensuring social and economic impacts on communities are considered. South Africa is among the top 15 global emitters of greenhouse gases, with coal accounting for 80% of electricity production and the coal mining sector employing around 90,000 people.

This experiment was to assess if UNDP could gather collective intelligence on perspectives regarding the Just Energy Transition (JET) from coal mining communities, particularly related to future job opportunities in the sector, and needs around reskilling coal mining communities to obtain alternate jobs. The geographical focus will be coal mining areas in the Free State, Mpumalanga, Limpopo, and KwaZulu-Natal.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If coal mining communities who will be directly impacted my mine closures (during the JET) can advise on their ideas on alternate jobs and skilling needs, then national level JET plans/frameworks will be community informed (co-created) and therefore more likely to be a success (i.e. adopted by those who it aims to serve).

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Desktop research to select coal mining communities to participate.

Partners on the ground contracted to contact Local municipalities and engag with the Local Economic Development managers to set up site visits and project introduction dates. This is more about informing leadership of project, 

The field data surveyors- recruitment, screening, and contracting per province to be done - local agents appointed for collecting local data.

Co-design survey for community members 

Test survey with some communities to gauge suitability

Establish the profile of key community members to be engaged. 

Youth agents to be appointed and conduct surveys

Complete data analysis and summaries key findings

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

community members

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Digital capture of survey results/interviews with communities

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

pilot phase - 1 year

Scaling phase - 8 months to date

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
