> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

Island Power S.A. 

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

info@ipsa.energy

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

It is a sub-contractor of the energy distribution companies in Panama (ENSA and Edemet)

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

In this case, we are including all the energy systems installed within the Darien province of Panama.

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- No

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Proven implementation of product, service or process at scale

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

It has been diffused in 18 isolated areas of Panama - including the ones in this solution. We could get user-feedback, but it is unclear how. 

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

No, but the analysis could be done. 

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

Yes, as this solution is deployed under a contract from the distributions company, maybe an expansion would require the navigation of the current contract/national regulations and the capacity of the company to expand. However, the equipment they use is imported, it is not manufactured in Panama.
