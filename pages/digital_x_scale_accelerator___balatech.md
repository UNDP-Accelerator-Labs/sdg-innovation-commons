## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Digital X Scale Accelerator - BalaTech (www.balatech.asia)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Low level of digital literacy disables the young generation of Kyrgyzstan to get ready for the future professions. And the ‘learning loss” resulting from the COVID-19 disruption on education forced over one million school students to study online with a significant digital divide. It means that the least fortunate students will become the most vulnerable ones in education & employability.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In Kyrgyzstan, about 80% of students who were assessed by PISA did NOT have a basic competence in the tested subjects. Moreover, COVID-19 severely disrupted children’s learning, and it’s been exacerbating the “digital divide”. Among 6 million population, over one million are school students exposed to learning loss! By 2040, most students will become the mainstream labours. Hence, the learning loss can cause economic loss in nation’s future.  We face triple problems: 1) the low competence of students, especially on STEM; 2) the most-needed skills, including digital skills are absent from formal curricula; 3) learning disruption due to COVID-19. After BalaTech’s piloting in five countries, the similar challenges in the Central Asian region are observed.

In Kyrgyzstan, about 80% of students who were assessed by PISA did NOT have a basic competence in the tested subjects. Among 6 million population, over one million are school students exposed to learning loss, resulting from the COVID-19 disruption on education.   McKinsey report (2020) on the result of “learning-loss” in the United States presents the urgency of this issue: the average K–12 student in the United States could lose $61,000 to $82,000 in lifetime earnings. It equals to a year of full-time work.   By 2040, most of the current K–12 cohort will be in the workforce (Productivity-Loss) Estimated GDP loss of $173 billion to $271 billion a year in the USA.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

AccLab is solving this challenge through collaborating with a local EdTech company, BalaTech. The project is funded and technically supported within the “Digital X” framework of UNDP Chief Digital Office (CDO). This manifests the public private partnership in innovation, that AccLab brings unique values to the partnership. Within UNDP, AccLab itself is an agile team who actively explores digital solutions, experiment various business models, and leverages the global network of Accelerator Labs. These values are highly appreciated by our private sector partners.   In the context of the COVID-19, EdTech is becoming one of the most promising industries in the global market. BalaTech has been already successfully running in Kyrgyzstan reaching over 15,000 users. AccLab is eager to help BalaTech scale to over 10 countries with the total outreach to 50,000 users. This experience will help AccLab learn accelerating existing solutions beyond the country. We have the potential to accelerate a local innovation to a global one!   Last but not the least, AccLab join the first generation of Digital X community, from where we regularly exchange innovative ideas with the global innovators and CDO

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

In collaboration with CDO and BalaTech, AccLabKG is addressing the low digital literacy and digital divide among youngsters in Eurasian region. We are accelerating the gamified solution of learning digital skills to benefit over 50,000 youngsters in 10 countries.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

1. What are the protective/risk factors of engaging youngsters (10 yr – 21 yr) to learn digital skills?  a. How can we reduce the digital divide between youngsters in Urban vs Rural communities?  b. How to empower more Girls in Tech? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Gamification as the application of game-design elements and game principles in educating and empowering children with the digital skills is the key method used in Balatech. The content of the courses is designed with respect to children’s learning cycle. Gamification algorithm enables deeper learning engagement.  Minimal Viable Product - as we plan to develop new features of the platform, MVP will enable us to collect feedback from the early customers for future product development. This will help to avoid potential lengthy and (probably) unnecessary work.   Behavioral Insights – In the form of the UX to support user behavior through usability, usefulness, and desirability provided in the interaction with a product. Considering children key users of the platform it is important to iterate with them on working versions and respond to feedback, challenging and validating assumptions about a product's require ments. Other categories of users whom Balatech is planned to be extended to will be also engaged in the platform development.   Data Visualisation – as Balatech will use conduction of the Olympiad as one of the key stages of product’s promotion, we will be able to use data collected to make assessment of the level of digital literacy among children for planning appropriately further interventions of the CO related to empowerment of youth with digital skills.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Citizen data  - to assess level of digital literacy and provide recommendations to the CO regarding planning further interventions on empowering youth with digital skills.  User journeys – to address gaps related to user experience and make Balatech more user-friendly for different categories of users.

System Thinking - Using the holistic approach to address challenges of Public-Private-Partnership within the complex and dynamic system. We are eager to explore both needs and challenges of UNDP CO & Private Partner in this partnership. With an operational standpoint, we are exploring different partnership modalities (including intellectual property/data policy), and grow this partnership within the Digital X program.  Co-Creating - Within the Public-Private-Partnership framework, we apply co-creation mindsent and practices to scale BalaTech successfully.  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

UNDP Country Office in general lack of strategic partnering experience with private innovators. AccLab as the engagement facilitator will actively explore partnership needs of CO & BalaTech. We are journaling our experience with participatory observation, which is not a common practice at CO.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

BalaTech is the project on Grow/Scale stage. Direct beneficiaries are 50,000 youngsters (aged 10 - 21) in ten countries. They will learn programming skills online. Among youngsters, we have special attention on Girls and kids in rural areas. The role of UNDP KG is to decrease the gender & digital divides in learning programming. Indirect beneficiaries are Schools, Parents, Communities. For AccLab and UNDP, this project provides us valuable experience in exploring Public-Private-Partnership in innovation.
