> Title of the innovation

Genius Learning Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Our platform is an online school for pupils from Nursery School learners, Primary, secondary and A-level learners. It was established as Covid 19 response but has received students even after the pandemic has reduced. It can be accessed internationally but caters for learners under the Zambian curriculum. It not only offers very inspirational and informative content, but we also offer an interactive audience between the learner and tutor. Students can leave a comment after watching a video and our tutors respond, hence creating a very responsive relation between the tutor and learner. Very few of our competitors further offer time quizzes on their platform The quizzes are there after a topic to help the learner have an idea of how much they have covered and how well they have understood. Genius learning further hopes to expand in the future and schedule live classes with students in some subjects and also add stimulative projects for students as the learner.
Our platform was further more nominated under the ZICTA (The Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority )INNOVATION CHALLENGE FINALISTS IN 2020.
