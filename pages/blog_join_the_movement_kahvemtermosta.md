Join the Movement #kahvemtermosta
JUNE 25, 2020
"Join the Movement" welcome pack was developed following the Coffee Cup Experiment conducted by UNDP Turkey Accelerator Lab in December 2019; it supports the expansion of the growing #kahvemtermosta movement which aims to eliminate the use of disposable cups.
It calls on all businesses currently giving out disposable cups to change their own practices as well as encourage their customers to support Sustainable Development Goals with a few simple changes to their routines.
