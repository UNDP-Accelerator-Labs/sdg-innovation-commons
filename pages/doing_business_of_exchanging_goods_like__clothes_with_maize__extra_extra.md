Mmh ok by faith, our innovation can be improved only if we have availability of chemicals needed such as fertilizer, I mean if the prices for chemicals are reduced it can be helpful for us to grow our innovation in agriculture however, the challenges we face are many hence can't manage to display them here duel to word limit but the most challenge is fertilizer couse land is available. Thank you.
