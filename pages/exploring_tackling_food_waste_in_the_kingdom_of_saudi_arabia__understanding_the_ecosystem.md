## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1.There is a need for a food waste strategy (similar to Agriculture and Water)  2.The need for better/clearer regulations, policies and incentives around food waste. ​3.Wedding/events venues are the biggest source of food waste. 4.The need for stronger research programmes on these topics. The quantitative data available is built on estimates, sampling-based method, which does not reflect the reality of food wasted.  5.Need for commercial partners, enabling the ecosystem of the reuse supply chain.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

So far based on stakeholders meeting. There is no direct and holistic ownership of this topic of waste management/food waste. The governmental entity that we were hoping to be champions for this challenge have not taken this on as a priority for the time being (looking for other partners).

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

This data and insights were used to validate and steer our potential areas of exploration. There is still not enough research done on food waste locally. This analysis gave the Saudi AccLab a view of who are the players in the food waste ecosystem? What data is available? What isn’t? What are the challenges? 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Determining key stakeholders and local solutions and fostering relationships for potential partnerships. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

So far, we have not officially worked with CSOs but:  We have met with Etaam (Saudi Food Bank) and have gained insights as well as thought of potential areas of collaboration: Could utilize the annual reports the foundation has been doing with members from the HoReCa sector to understand, analyze and make a case/ influence decision makers. Partner with/request map that the foundation has on food waste in the different districts of Saudi.   We have met with Savola World and have gained insights as well as thought of potential areas of collaboration: Savola can support in identifying and enhancing CSR towards the SDGs in a range of companies; could support in initiatives around SMEs; utilizing Savola’s experience and network in the “Negaderha Alliance with Food NGOs” forum. As a platform to share and brainstom ideas/provide workshops from UN experts. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

So far, we have not officially worked with academia but:  We have met with King Saud University’s faculty, researchers and students relevant to the topic of food waste and have gained insights as well as thought of potential areas of collaboration: partnering with KSU researcher in designing behavioural change interventions; supporting the students initiatives to grow. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

So far, we have not officially worked with the private sector but:  We have met with Edama Organic Solutions (Start-up) and have gained insights as well as applied to the ForTomorrow Platform.  We have met with Almarai (one of the largest food / dairy producers in KSA) and have gained insights.  We have met with the Saudi Investment Recycling Company and have gained insights as well as thought of potential areas of collaboration: The CEO would like to collaborate with UNDP on a co-branded awareness campaign to shift people’s behaviours; see potential in collaborating with them on an innovative competition/bootcamp around food waste. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

So far, we have not officially worked with government partners but:  We have met with a governmental partner to discuss the potential of an innovative competition/bootcamp around food waste. Unfortunately, as of now, it doesn’t seem that they have interest in this. We are planning on looking for other potential governmental partners such as the Innovation deputyship in the Ministry of Energy, Water and Agriculture or the Ministry of Municipal, Rural Affairs and Housing. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All potential partners listed are new and unusual partners for UNDP CO: Itaam: They have access to both the community and the HoReCa sector as well as a heatmap of where food is being collected and where it is being distributed.  Savola: They have experience partnering with other UN Agencies such as UNEP and seem supportive and interested to partner.  King Saud University: One of the first studies on Food Waste was conducted there. It is one of the biggest/strongest universities in Saudi. They have departments and capacities (researchers, students) relevant to food waste.  Edama: They are very aware of the climatic context of Saudi and their composting processes reduces water use and cycle times that perform best in hot, arid climate conditions with ultra-high temperatures.  Almarai: One of the largest food / dairy producers in KSA and have a sustainability department.  Saudi Investment Recycling Company: Could potentially partner with UNDP on raising awareness and shifting behaviours towards more responsible consumptions and production. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Met with UNEP and FAO to see potential areas of collaboration: Shared the AccLab process, current phase in food waste, summary of insights based on meetings with different stakeholders.  UNEP regional office seems interested to support as they are not currently working on food waste particularly in Saudi (they would be happy to share their expertise).
