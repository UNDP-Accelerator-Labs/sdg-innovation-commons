Website designed by youth of Thiban, a small town in the governorate of Madaba in  Jordan as part of an initiative called "Thiban of Beauty and History" مبادرة ذيبان الجمال والتاريخ لتسليط الضوء على الاماكن السياحية The goal of the initiative is to put Thiban on the international tourism map. The website is still in a testing phase. There is a team behind this initiative and website.  One of the leaders of the group is Yazeed Al Khroub. Yazeed has been working on the development of the website. He is a university student of computer science and also taking courses to learn programming and Java. Yazeed was inspired to start this initiative when he was in a meeting with the Ministry of Tourism and learned that Madaba city (only a few km away) is the #2 tourism site in (at the level of Jordan?). He left feeling surprised and driven to given Thiban more attention, with the belief that it is just as worth visiting as Madaba and sad that tourists make it to Madaba but rarely to Thiban.
