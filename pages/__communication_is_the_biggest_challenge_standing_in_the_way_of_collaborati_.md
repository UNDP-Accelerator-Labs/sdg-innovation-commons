## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Communication is the biggest challenge standing in the way of collaboration between nationals and internationals/ operations and programme  - Colleagues don´t know about work outside their unit or cluster  - The initial assumption was that national and international did not get along, however it was in fact the differing work benefits creating tension - The Covid pandemic limited interaction and integration among staff, especially newcomers - Internal communication in the CO is affected by language barriers

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Colleagues resistance about the labs integration in the CO.  Realization from the Labs perspective that this challenge was imposed on us by the RR, making us spend a lot of time outside our frontier challenge.  Time management became a big bottleneck because after the sense and exploration stage, the lab explored many testing stages as opposed to a single one, ultimately affecting our productivity on the actual frontier challenge.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The chosen types of data complemented the Staff Survey (the only existing data) which was general and shallow. Using the types of data indicated above, we managed to dive deeper into understanding the views of the people living closest to the problem. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Behavioral Insights: Using this method we made staff aware of the concerns they may not have vocalized previously, it also helped us understand better how staff actually make choices and why they feel like they do. In depth interviews, helped us to delve into the everyday experiences of the staff. Design Thinking, Human Centered Design: Was necessary to give a structure to our process and helped us approach this complex challenge in an effective way Co-creation, Collective intelligence: Using these methods we managed to capture not only the concerns but also ways forward in terms of solutions and approaches Solutions Mapping: helped us explore and map solutions that had been tried before  Visual Thinking and Mapping: Helped us display our finsings in an includive way
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?



> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?



> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?



> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?



> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?



> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?


## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Working close with the end users form the beginning of the process gave us a deeper understanding of the challenge as well as possible solutions. Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
