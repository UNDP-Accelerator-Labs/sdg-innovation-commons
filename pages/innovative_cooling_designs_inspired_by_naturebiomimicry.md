> Description of the solution

Students from Art University of Isfahan, Iran designed a hot weather structure inspired by desert snails and their naturally cooling shells. The other students were from the University of Latvia who devised a shading system that mimics how flowers and stomata open and close in response to sunlight. Another type of biomimicry: Researchers had proposed that termite mounds maintained stable internal climates by having a physical structure that enables passive internal airflow. While subsequent research on termite mounds has altered our understanding of the function of mound structures, the Eastgate Centre in Zimbabwe still achieves a controlled internal climate with the help of cost-effective and energy-efficient mechanisms originally inspired by termite mounds.
