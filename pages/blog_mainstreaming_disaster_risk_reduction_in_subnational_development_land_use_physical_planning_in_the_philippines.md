Message

The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan for 2004-2010 outlines the

country’s goals of reducing poverty and accelerating development, and specifies
the strategies and action plans to bring about a better quality of life for the citizenry.
But even as these guideposts for development are in place, the attainment of these
goals is hampered by the constant threat of disasters. The frequent occurrence of
natural and man-made disasters in the country does not only take its toll on the
economy, but has implications on our socioeconomic conditions, particularly among
the poor and those in remote areas where access to services become even more
difficult.

The Guidelines on Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction in Subnational
Development and Land Use/Physical Planning is envisioned to improve our capacity
to prevent and mitigate disasters. It is a tool for enhancing regional and provincial
planning analyses by recognizing risks posed by natural hazards and the vulnerability
of the population, economy and the environment to these hazards. By introducing
risk analysis in development planning, regions and provinces can strengthen their
ability to identify areas at risk to disasters, ensure proper siting of development
undertakings, and identify appropriate mitigation measures. This is well within
track of our country’s commitment to the Hyogo Framework of Action that aims to
integrate disaster risk reduction into sustainable development policies and planning.
Ultimately, the main goal is to enable communities to reduce vulnerability and to
increase their capacity to cope with disasters.

NEDA believes that a stronger collaboration with local governments is necessary
to achieve the country’s desired economic growth and development. In line with
this, NEDA formulated the Guidelines as part of its commitment to provide local
government units with the necessary tools that can help them to effectively carry out
their mandate.

Message

Due to its geographic location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines has

always been on the list of the most vulnerable countries to natural disasters
and confronted to their often dramatic impact on physical and human loss. With
new threats like climate change and global warming, the risks of natural disasters are
intensifying and could potentially reverse the gains achieved over the years on human
development and the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals.

The increasing severity of natural hazards like typhoons requires the systematic
factoring of disaster risks into development planning and programming. Conventional
and “business as usual” approaches are no longer sufficient. These new risks call
for the involvement of all actors of society to limit their negative impact. A new
development planning and programming paradigm needs to be adopted at all levels,
centrally and locally, to forestall the dramatic cost of these natural disasters on the
Philippine society and economy.

A very important aspect of this new paradigm is the need to take into consideration
the vulnerabilities of the Philippines to natural hazards. It means coming to terms
with the additional constraints posed by these hazards on the country’s physical assets
like land and its natural resources. This is critical in determining these assets’ most
optimum use and ensuring that development options will not add threats to people’s
lives and property. Managing disaster risks is essential to ensuring the sustainable
development for any country.

Mainstreaming natural disaster risks needs to be undertaken in a systematic manner
and in relevant processes such as development planning. However, this can only
be done efficiently when appropriate tools are made available to those involved in
development planning, hence the importance of these Guidelines on Mainstreaming
Diaaster Risk Management in Subnational Development and Land Use/ Physical
Planning. The Guidelines will be particularly useful in generating risk-based

comprehensive land use plans (CLUPs) at the local level, which are expected to
introduce least cost development options that are also disaster risk resilient.

We would like to congratulate the National Economic and Development Authority
and other national partners for collaborating on these Guidelines. We are very grateful
for the financial support provided by the European Union, through the EC-DIPECHO,
which made this exercise possible. It is excellent support like this from its bilateral
partners that has enabled the United Nations Development Programme to assist more
effectively the Philippines and contribute to its efforts to improve its people’s lives.

We look forward to the Guidelines’ systematic use, continued improvement and
most important, its positive outcome in terms of safer, more disaster-risk resilient
communities!

Message

The European Commission Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO) through its disaster

preparedness programme (DIPECHO) assists vulnerable people living in disaster-
prone regions of the world in reducing the impact of natural disaster on their lives and
livelihoods.

Since 1998, the European Commission has provided funding through its DIPECHO
programme for some 80 projects across South East Asia, with grants amounting to over
20 million euros (approx PhP 1.3 billion). These projects have addressed a large number
of natural disaster risks and have had a significant impact, in particular in the poorest and
most remote areas.

In line with the priority areas of the Hyogo Framework for Action, which the European
Commission wholeheartedly supports, DIPECHO acknowledges the important role
the people and local government units play in the continuing efforts to advocate safer
communities. The present Guidelines give us clear examples of what national and local
authorities, at all levels, can achieve if they work hand-in-hand with communities and
institutions to develop their capacities to prevent, prepare for, cope with and respond to
disasters.

The Guidelines on Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction in Subnational Development
and Land Use/Physical Planning, developed by NEDA through the United Nations
Development Programme, will serve a wide range of purposes, from improved planning and
land management to reduction of risks. Most importantly, the Guidelines will help decision-
makers to elaborate and implement practical actions which will save lives and assets during
natural disasters.

We hope that this tool will be very widely disseminated among local authorities, and that it
will serve as a best-practice reference for the Philippines.

Preface

The Guidelines for Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in Subnational

Development and Land Use/Physical Planning is the major output of the

Technical Assistance (TA) on Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Management in
Subnational Development and Physical Planning in the Philippines. With assistance
from EC-DIPECHO and UNDP, NEDA implemented the TA in line with the National
Land Use Committee’s action agenda that seeks to strengthen disaster mitigation by:
(a) making available hazard maps and relevant disaster information; (b) enhancing
local capacity to institute preventive/mitigating measures; and (c) preparing DRR-
enhanced regional and provincial physical framework plans.

xxi

Consultative and participatory approaches, including intensive review, were
undertaken in the preparation of the Guidelines. NEDA organized the TA’s Project
Board consisting of the NEDA Regional Development Office (Chair); National Disaster
Coordinating Council/Office of Civil Defense; Mines and Geosciences Bureau;
Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration;
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology; Department of the Interior and
Local Government; Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board; and League of Provinces
of the Philippines. NEDA’s Regional Development Coordination Staff provided
technical and administrative secretariat support to the Project Board and coordinated
all project activities.

The TA started with a national consultative workshop and project launching to
promote awareness and generate support for the project from the national and
subnational levels as well as to gather comments and recommendations on the
project scope and framework for mainstreaming DRR. Initially, a draft was prepared
by a team of consultants and subsequently reviewed by a group of experts from the
hazard-mapping agencies and the NEDA regional offices. The Guidelines were later
used as reference material in five batches of training conducted for 281 regional and
local planners and representatives from the national/regional government agencies

EuropEan Commission Humanitarian aid | unitEd nations dEvElopmEnt programmE

and nongovernment organizations. The reviews and trainings generated substantive
inputs that further enriched the mainstreaming DRR framework and methodology.
The relevance, applicability and user-friendliness of the Guidelines were pilot-tested in
Regions 1 and 13 and in Surigao del Norte and, in the process, produced DRR-enhanced
development and physical framework plans. Sixteen desk exercises or case studies on
disaster risk assessment for other regions and provinces as well as two policy studies on
geospatial data and information for disaster risk management and on improving DRR
mainstreaming in subnational planning were also prepared under the TA.

The next step is to popularize the Guidelines and advocate its use by more provinces
and regions. Capacity-building activities are being lined up for planning offices
at the local, regional, and national levels, which are envisioned to take the lead in
mainstreaming DRR in the development processes. Refinements to the Guidelines
may also be done later to include new and emerging concerns such as climate change.

We hope that the use of the Guidelines by planners and decision makers will lead
to the effective integration of DRR in planning and eventually reduce or prevent the
adverse effects of disasters in socioeconomic development.

Executive Summary

The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), with assistance

from the United Nations Development Program and the European Commission
Humanitarian Aid Department, formulated the Guidelines on Mainstreaming DRR in
Subnational Development and Land Use/Physical Planning as an instrument to direct
natural disaster risk reduction efforts in development planning processes.

xxix

The Guidelines support the comprehensive disaster risk management framework of
the National Disaster Coordinating Council. In the global context, the formulation
of the Guidelines is in keeping with the Hyogo Framework for Action adopted in
January 2005 during the World Conference on Disaster Reduction. It serves as a tool
for enhancing subnational (regional and provincial) planning analyses by recognizing
risks posed by natural hazard and the vulnerability of the population, economy and
the environment to these hazards.

The Guidelines direct
natural disaster risk
reduction efforts in
development planning
processes

The Guidelines supplement the 2007
NEDA-ADB Guidelines on Provincial/Local
Planning Expenditure Management (PLPEM),
mainly the volume on the formulation of
the Provincial Development and Physical
Framework Plan (PDPFP). Development
and physical framework plans guide future
land use and physical developments and the
location of programs, projects and activities
in the province and region. The geographic
territory of the province and region are delineated according to the following land
uses: settlements land use, production land use, protection land use and transport/
infrastructure land use. The integration of risks in these plans will result to:

a. Better appreciation of planning environment through the detailed information

on natural hazards, the risks attendant to them and the vulnerabilities of
exposed areas and communities

EuropEan Commission Humanitarian aid | unitEd nations dEvElopmEnt programmE

national EConomiC and dEvElopmEnt autHoritY

b. More realistic projection of demand and supply of land for settlements,

production, protection and infrastructure as development are restricted in
areas prone to natural hazards

c. Better understanding by decision-makers to set development goals, objectives
and targets to reduce loss of life and property from natural hazards as risks of
fatality and property damage are quantified

d. Identification of constraints to development arising from risk factors become

part of the development issues, and the corresponding goals, objectives/ targets
and strategies

e. Appropriate risk reduction measures are included in priority programs

and projects, evaluated vis-à-vis quantified risks, eventually provided with
budgetary resources and implemented

FEATuRES OF THE GuIDElINES

xxx

Risk-based Analysis. The Guidelines provide methodologies for risk estimation
and valuation. These methods assess and quantify disaster event consequences
(consequence analysis) in terms of fatalities or loss of lives and the cost of property
losses or damages, normally categorized as direct costs. Indirect costs, however, have
not been covered in this document and thus form one of the limitations of the risk
assessment as considered and used in the Guidelines.

Recognizing risks as
development constraint
will lead decision makers
to set goals on reduced
loss of life and property
damage

Use of Geographic Information System
(GIS). Another key feature of the
Guidelines is the use of GIS, an objective
and systematic means of carrying out
the risk assessment process using map
overlay techniques. Use of GIS software
is suggested since the processing may
be tedious; however, the Guidelines also
show how computations may be done
through spreadsheets.

Multihazard coverage. The natural
hazards considered in the Guidelines
pertain only to events of geologic and hydrometeorologic origin and do not cover
the biological, technological, man-made and environmental degradation hazards.
However, the Guidelines, having a quantitative comparability feature, is flexible
enough to include all kinds of hazards and concomitant risks.

FOCuS AND APPlICATION OF THE GuIDElINES

Hazards are location-
specific and do not
respect political
boundaries

The Guidelines take the provincial level as the
operational unit of analysis. Hazards are location-
specific and do not respect political boundaries.
Provincial planning will therefore allow for
intermunicipal analysis. Another reason is that the
province’s geographic coverage makes it possible
to identify specific interventions that may not
be done at the regional level. Moreover, the province will be in a position to co-opt
the participation of local governments in both the planning and implementation
stages. The application of the Guidelines however could be extended to the regional
level since the region is the “sum of provinces” or is seen as a “bigger” province.
The methodologies may also be applied at municipal and city levels; although at
these levels, land use planning is more precise as these are translated into zoning
ordinances. The application can likewise extend to interregional and special
development areas particularly in watersheds and river basins.

MAINSTREAMING FRAMEwORk

The conceptual framework for mainstreaming DRM in subnational plans takes
off from the PDPFP planning framework. It describes the steps in disaster risk

Risk estimates are
used to prioritize areas
for further evaluation of
vulnerability

Briefly, DRA involves: a) hazard
characterization/frequency analysis, b)
consequence analysis, c) risk estimation,
and d) risk prioritization. On the other
hand, the entry points in the plan are in
the following: a) analysis of the planning
environment; b) identification of issues and
problems; c)formulation of goals, objectives
and targets; d) formulation of development

as urgent will be further evaluated by assessing conditions of the place and
identifying and describing factors which contribute to their vulnerabilities.
The implications and acceptability of the risks and vulnerabilities will reveal the
development issues and concerns that will be incorporated into the planning,
programming, financing and project development decisions. The sequence for this
stage is: a) analysis of the risk impact to the land use and physical framework; b)
identifying development issues and their translation to goals, objectives and targets
based on the risks identified; and c) specifying DRR measures (strategies and PPAs).

strategies; c) identification of programs, projects and activities.

uSE AND RElEvANCE OF THE GuIDElINES

The secondary aspect of DRR mainstreaming is in the plan implementation stage. This
includes: a) the development of DRR-sensitive criteria for prioritization and ranking
of programs, projects and activities (PPAs) in the investment program and project
evaluation and development and b) financing options for the PPAs.

APPROACH AND METHODOlOGy

xxxii

The main feature of the Guidelines is the four-step disaster risk assessment that
provides for two types of risk estimates: risk of fatality and the risk of property
damage. The risk of fatality essentially estimates the expected number of fatality on an
annualized basis, while the risk of damage is the estimated value of property that may
be damaged on an annualized basis.

The steps in undertaking risk assessment are, as follows:

a. Hazard Characterization and Frequency Analysis – involves identifying and
characterizing the hazards that threaten an area using hazard maps and past
damage and lost data.

b. Consequence Analysis – involves determining the probable effects or

consequences of these potential hazards to exposed population and land
uses expressed by the number of fatalities and cost of property damages,
respectively. The estimates are based mainly on exposure (i.e., location, area
affected by hazard) and best estimates of potential impact to life and property.
c. Risk Estimation - involves estimating the risk expressed as the expected annual
number of lives lost, damage to property for a given area from a particular
hazard. The estimates are used to prioritize areas for further evaluation.

d. Risk Prioritization - areas are prioritized by comparing the risk estimates to the

acceptability criteria and assigning matching scores. The areas identified

The Guidelines is useful in the following:

a. Identifying areas that are highly restricted to human settlements and economic
activities particularly those that: (i) are highly prone to the adverse impacts of
hazards, e.g., flood-prone areas, landslide-prone areas; (ii) need to lessen the
effects of hazardous events, e.g., water retention areas, lahar-playing fields,
buffer zones; and (iii) need to ensure effectiveness of response activities, e.g.,
escape routes and staging areas;

b. Highlighting the use of development criteria or indicators as measures to

identify and describe vulnerability (or resilience) and their integration in the
disaster risk management framework;

xxxiii

c. Making differentiated decisions
on land uses which may involve
specifying acceptable land uses
based on the risk assessment
results, e.g., agricultural use
of flood prone areas might be
allowed but not settlements;
d. Developing disaster risk criteria

Developing disaster risk
criteria is necessary in
land use planning and
zoning

in land use planning and zoning.
The results of the vulnerability and
risk assessment will provide clear directions to cities and municipalities in the
crafting of corresponding preventive and mitigating policies and measures that
address the disaster risks affecting them. These can also supplement decision-
making on matters involving zoning regulations such as the prescription of
more strict building codes like minimum elevation and heights of buildings,
prohibition of basements and use of certain types of roof; and

e. Identifying all other appropriate risk management decisions depending on the

EuropEan Commission Humanitarian aid | unitEd nations dEvElopmEnt programmE

national EConomiC and dEvElopmEnt autHoritY

risk assessment. In general, all DRR measures and options can be classified as
avoidance or elimination, reduction or mitigation, sharing or transfer of the
hazard potential or disaster risk. The do-nothing option thus becomes a purely
management decision.

CONTENTS AND ORGANIzATION

The Guidelines is organized as follows:

Chapter 1, Introduction, acquaints the user with the background, rationale and main
features of the Guidelines. It explains the policy context and linkage to the PLPEM
Guidelines, which remains as the main guide in the overall planning process. The
chapter emphasizes that the DRR Guidelines enhance and do not alter the current
plan formulation methodologies that planners are already familiar with. It concludes
by identifying opportunities and challenges in mainstreaming DRR into planning
processes and next steps.

xxxiv

Chapter 2, Disasters and Development: The Case for Mainstreaming DRR in
Development Planning, establishes the relationship of disasters and development,
and then explains how development planning can be a useful means towards reducing
disaster risks.

Chapter 3, Mainstreaming Framework, discusses the steps in disaster risk
assessment and identifies their entry points in the plan formulation process. The
DRA results become part of the planning analysis and are later used to assess impact
to the land use and physical framework
and become the basis for identifying
risk reduction strategies, programs and
projects.

Disaster risk assessment
should be part of the
planning analysis

Chapter 4, Disaster Risk Assessment,
demonstrates the DRA methodology
showing in detail the computational

and GIS techniques. Indicative look-up tables for return period and factors for
fatality and property damage for various hazard events as well as a methodology for
estimating cost of property damage per type of land use have been incorporated in the
Guidelines. Surigao del Norte is used as case study. The hazard maps produced under
the Hazards Mapping and Assessment for Effective Community-Based Disaster Risk
Management (READY) Project were used.

Chapter 5, Mainstreaming Risk Assessment Results in the Plan, shows how the
results of the DRA are utilized to enhance analyses in the various phases of the plan
formulation exercise: from visioning to the analyses of the planning environment;
identification of development issues, goals, objectives and targets; and their translation
into development strategies and PPAs or what is termed as mainstreaming in the plan
formulation stage. Case illustrations from the pilot DRR-enhanced PDPFP of Surigao
del Norte and RPFPs of Ilocos and Caraga Regions are included.

The Guidelines include
GIS-based disaster risk
assessment

Chapter 6, Mainstreaming DRR in
Investment Programming, Budgeting,
Project Evaluation and Development,
Monitoring and Evaluation, discusses
the secondary entry points for DRR
mainstreaming in plan implementation,
namely: investment programming, budgeting, implementation and monitoring and
evaluation, with project evaluation and development as an added tool to improve
project design and financing. Guide questions for logically framing monitoring and
evaluation during implementation are presented to reveal if planned risk reduction
measures and development programs resulted to the desired outcomes and so further
aid in future planning decisions.

xxxv

The Guidelines also include eight technical annexes as additional reference materials
that can aid in the preparation of the DRR-enhanced plans.

Annex 1, Natural Hazards: An Overview, explains how, why, and when hazards occur.
It familiarizes the users of the Guidelines on the science and behavior of natural
hazards, and enables them to analyze and interpret hazard maps.

Annex 2, Probabilistic Treatment of Hazards, explains the concepts of frequency
analysis, return period and the probability of occurrence of hazard events and their
application in estimating annual risks.

Annex 3, Assigning Return Periods, presents in greater detail how the default return
periods for geologic, volcanic and hydrometeorologic hazards were derived.

Annex 4, Measuring Direct and Indirect Impact of Natural Disasters in the Philippines,
explains the direct and indirect economic impacts of disasters. Direct losses occur

EuropEan Commission Humanitarian aid | unitEd nations dEvElopmEnt programmE

national EConomiC and dEvElopmEnt autHoritY

from physical damage to assets while indirect losses refer to declines in production
capacity, reduced income, and increased costs due to damaged infrastructures and
lifelines.

Annex 5, Deriving Factors for Fatality and Factors for Property Damage, elaborates
the steps and assumptions in estimating the probable proportion of fatalities to the
population and probable proportion of damage to properties from a hazard event.

Annex 6, GIS-based Disaster Risk Assessment, introduces the basic concepts of
GIS, explains the framework and assumptions in conducting DRA under a GIS
environment, and demonstrates the step-by-step procedure in performing DRA, from
hazard analysis to risk prioritization using a sample GIS dataset.

Annex 7, Characteristics of Resilience, summarizes the components of resilience,
characteristics of a resilient community, and characteristics of an enabling
environment.

Annex 8, Selected ODA Disaster Risk Reduction Programs and Policies, lists a number
of programs and projects available to local government units in financing DRR
measures.

MAINSTREAMING DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN SUBNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LAND USE/PHYSICAL PLANNING IN THE PHILIPPINES

Introduction

T

he National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), with
assistance from the United Nations Development Programme and the
European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid Department through its

disaster preparedness program (DIPECHO), formulated this set of Guidelines
on Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) in Regional and Provincial
Development and Physical Framework Plans as an instrument to direct DRR efforts in
development planning processes. The Guidelines introduce a disaster risk assessment
methodology that uses the resulting risk estimates in enhancing planning analyses and
decision making.

This introductory chapter provides an overview and acquaints the user with the
background, rationale and main features of the Guidelines. The rationale for
mainstreaming DRR into the development planning process is discussed in Chapter
2. The conceptual framework or the theoretical underpinnings of the approach are
discussed in Chapter 3 while the application or operational methodology is elaborated
in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 discusses how the results of disaster risk assessment is
mainstreamed into the plan and how appropriate DRR measures are selected. Chapter
6 shows how the risk-sensitive plan is mainstreamed in the other phases of the
development planning cycle, specifically, in investment programming, budgeting and
project evaluation and development.

The NEDA-Regional Development Office, through the National Land Use Committee
which it chairs, adopted in March 2006 an action agenda that aims to contribute to
the reduction of risks associated with natural disasters. Specifically, the agenda sets
to put in place preventive measures to mitigate or totally avoid the damaging effects
of disasters. These measures include supporting mapping activities to characterize
natural hazards in a specific area and delineate their geographic impact coverage,

augmenting development and physical framework plans with analysis of hazard and
potential risks, and enhancing capacity of local government units (LGUs) in instituting
DRR measures.

The Guidelines also provide critical inputs to the National Disaster Coordinating
Council framework (NDCC) (Figure 1.1), which lays out the government’s priorities
to respond and hasten reconstruction/rehabilitation after a disaster, and defines
mitigation and preparedness activities that can reduce damage before disasters happen.

The preparation of these Guidelines complements the Hazards Mapping and
Assessment for Effective Community-Based Disaster Risk Management (READY)
Project of the Office of Civil Defense (OCD), Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical
and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), Mining and Geosciences Bureau (MGB),
and National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA). The
READY Project has three components: multihazard identification and assessment;
community-based disaster preparedness; and mainstreaming of risk reduction into the
local development planning process.

In the global context, the Guidelines were prepared in keeping with the Hyogo
Framework for Action (HFA) adopted in January 2005 during the World Conference
on Disaster Reduction. The HFA calls for the effective implementation of DRR efforts
to substantially reduce disaster losses by 2015 in terms of lives and in the social,
economic, and environmental assets of communities and countries, as an essential
condition for sustainable development. The HFA specifically called on governments
to mainstream risk reduction within development and land use planning, ensure that
scientific inputs influence risk assessment processes and that risk factors are addressed
through sound environmental and natural resource management and social and
economic development practices, among others.

oN proViNCiAL/LoCAL pLANNiNg AND EXpENDiturE
MANAgEMENt (pLpEM)

These Guidelines supplement the PLPEM (Box 1.1), particularly the volume on the
preparation of the Provincial Development and Physical Framework Plan (PDPFP). By
introducing DRR concepts and principles and risk assessment techniques in the plan
formulation methodologies of the PDPFP, planning analyses and decision making are
enhanced.

Box 1.1 NEDA-ADB Provincial/Local Planning and Expenditure Management Guidelines

the plpEm guidelines, developed under phase 1 of the nEda-adB technical assistance
on strengthening provincial and local planning and Expenditure management, consist
of the following five volumes: integrated Framework; provincial development and
physical Framework plan; investment programming and revenue generation; tools and
techniques on Budgeting and public Expenditure management; and project Evaluation
and development. the plpEm guidelines aim to help provinces to plan more effectively
by identifying, preparing and prioritizing critical programs and projects, and raising and
allocating resources to finance these programs and projects. the guidelines also emphasize
the importance of: (a) horizontal linkages that view planning-investment programming-
budgeting as phases of a single cycle; and (b) vertical linkages that ensure that the province
could contribute to the attainment of regional and national development objectives and
could support intermunicipal development initiatives.

C. fEAturES of tHE guiDELiNES

1. RATIONAlE

These Guidelines serve as a tool to enhance subnational (regional and provincial)
planning analyses by recognizing risks posed by natural hazards. The specific
plans where mainstreaming will be done are the PDPFP and the Regional Physical
Framework Plan (RPFP). The PDPFP already merges the traditionally separate
Provincial Development Plan and Provincial Physical Framework Plan. At the regional
level, the RPFP and the Regional Development Plan (RDP) remain separate. However,
the RDP is seen as an implementing instrument of the RPFP, thus, a risk-sensitive
RPFP will be able to enrich the medium-term socioeconomic agenda of the RDP.

Mainstreaming DRR into the PDPFP and RPFP is strategic since both plans provide
the framework for planning and managing land use. The PDPFP, in particular, allows
the provincial government to gather and analyze information about the sustainability
of land for development, so that the limitations of hazard-prone areas are understood
by policymakers, potential investors and community residents.

The integration of risk assessment in these plans will result in:

a.

b.

Enhanced understanding of the planning environment through knowledge on
natural hazards and the vulnerabilities of exposed communities, their social
and economic fragilities and their lack of resilience or ability to cope with or
recover during times of disaster;
More realistic projections of demand and supply of land for settlements,
production, protection and infrastructure. Development, as a matter of policy
that needs to be promulgated, should be discouraged and restricted in areas
prone to natural hazards;

d.

c. Increased awareness among decision makers in setting development goals and
targets on reduced loss of life and property from natural hazards as risks of
fatality and property damage are quantified;
Identification of constraints to development arising from risk factors as part of
the development issues and goals;
Inclusion of appropriate risk-reduction measures in priority programs and
projects as evaluated vis-à-vis quantified risks, and eventually provided with
budgetary resources and implemented; and
Monitoring and evaluation of disaster risks and their corresponding reduction
measures.

e.

f.

2. RISk-BASED ANAlySIS

A unique feature of the Guidelines is risk estimation. This involves estimating and
imputing costs on the possible loss, damage and disruption that may arise when a
disaster occurs. In general, the computations should lead to the identification of areas
of high risks and indicate how a disaster affects the total economy or the society as a
whole.

The Guidelines provide a method to assess consequences of a disaster event
(consequence analysis) in terms of fatalities or loss of lives and the cost of property
loss or damage, normally categorized as direct costs. Indirect costs, however, have

not been covered in this document and thus form one of the limitations of risk
assessment. Examples of indirect costs involve the costs of disruption to economic
activities or the nondelivery of vital services.

The resulting cost estimates should reveal the magnitude of loss and damage when
a disaster happens. They are also useful in the assessment and justification of
interventions that will mitigate and reduce the negative effects of the disaster as well
as the responses to enhance the resilience of communities. Ideally, the costs of such
risk reduction interventions are justified when these are far less than the estimated
costs of damages and losses.

The quantification or estimation of risks therefore will provide the bases for the social
and political acceptability of DRR proposals.

3. uSE OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SySTEM (GIS)

Another key feature of the Guidelines is the use of GIS, an objective and systematic
means of carrying out the risk assessment process that uses map overlay techniques.
The use of GIS for risk assessment has the following advantages:

a.

b.

c.

Puts structure and organization to the complex and numerous input planning
variables as it allows ease in the integration of the various data sets coming
from different sources;
Serves as a powerful visualization and evaluation tool to provide rapid and
concise means of presenting assessment results and hence facilitate decision
making and policy formulation; and
Provides reusable sets of information and data sets that can be utilized for
other planning related purposes.

The methodologies, however, would largely be dependent on the availability of data
sets required, particularly, hazard-related information and maps from knowledgeable
mandated agencies such as PHIVOLCS, PAGASA and MGB.

Normally, the level of analyses in regional planning require map scales of 1:250,000
while at the provincial planning level, the analyses require map scales from 1:50,000 to
1:100,000. Current work in base mapping and hazard mapping by mandated agencies,
especially through the READY project, is producing input sets of information at larger
scales of 1:10,000 to 1:50,000.

For other data sets like socioeconomic attributes, the level of disaggregation may
be up to the barangay level. The availability of this information makes it possible for
regions to undertake analysis at the municipal level and, similarly, for provinces to
pursue barangay level analysis. In any case, combining old and new sets of information
in digital maps at different scales are facilitated with use of GIS mapping utilities.

The Guidelines do not endorse a specific GIS software package and any mention of
names and brands in the Guidelines is related more to their availability and specific uses.

4. MulTIHAzARD COvERAGE

The natural hazards considered in the Guidelines pertain to events of geologic
and hydrometeorologic origin. Among many hazards of such origins, covered are
earthquake-related hazards, namely: (1) earthquake-induced landslide, (2) ground
shaking, (3) ground rupture, (4) liquefaction, and (5) volcanic eruptions; (6) flooding;
(7) storm surge; and (8) rain-induced landslide. These natural hazards are usually
the extreme natural events that occur in any part of the Philippines and posing some
threat to people and their assets. Such events may occur in very short time spans
of seconds (e.g., when it comes to earthquake-related hazards) or weeks (e.g., for
flooding).

Not covered as yet are biological hazards (e.g., outbreak of epidemic diseases, insect
plagues); technological (industrial pollution, dam failures, transport or industrial
accidents like fires, oil spills); or hazards brought about by acts of terrorism, armed
conflict and similar events.

Hazards influenced by climatic variations, such as climate change and desertification,
have not been included in the Guidelines, although these can also pose threats or
trigger the seven natural hazards earlier mentioned. Risk reduction and adaptation
measures related to them can also be part of the long-term intervention that may be
considered.

5. FOCuS ON THE PROvINCE

Hazards are location specific but they do not respect political boundaries. Thus, it
could be more efficient to address hazard issues at the subnational level particularly
at the province rather than at the individual city or municipality. In fact, most hazards
directly affect contiguous areas across several LGUs in a province or some LGUs across
two or more provinces. Analysis at the regional level is necessary in this case, although

MAINSTREAMING DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN SUBNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LAND USE/PHYSICAL PLANNING IN THE PHILIPPINES

11

the “zonation” of common hazards and risk-reduction options should be considered.
Furthermore, province-focused analysis is beneficial since: (a) key lifelines like access
roads, power and communication lines and even hospital services are designed
to cover wider areas; (b) more specific interventions can be designed at this level;
and (c) participation of local governments and communities are critical for key
interventions to succeed.

The application of the Guidelines can be extended to a region, since the region is the
“sum of provinces” or may be considered as a “big” province. The methodologies may
also be applied at municipal and city levels; although at these levels, land use planning
measures are more precise given the zoning powers of these LGUs. The Guidelines
can also be applied to interregional and special development areas, such as watersheds
and river basins.

6. SCOPE AND lIMITATION

The methodologies herein were based on currently available data and information
sets, including hazard maps provided by agencies such as PHIVOLCS, PAGASA and
MGB that identify areas susceptible to a particular hazard.

Probability matrices and look-up tables were prepared based on such available
information, which represent the best estimates to depict hazard events and their
corresponding consequences. The methodology and assumptions used should be
refined as more information becomes available, such as return periods of occurrences
of different hazard events and data on damage to property and loss to life.

7. uSE AND RElEvANCE

The main uses of disaster risk assessment results are the following:

a.

b.

Identifying areas where human settlements and economic activities are highly
restricted particularly those: (a) highly prone to hazards, e.g., flood-prone
areas, landslide-prone areas; (b) needed to lessen the effects of a hazardous
event, e.g. water retention areas, lahar-playing fields, buffer zones; and (c)
needed to ensure effectiveness of response activities, e.g., escape routes and
staging areas;
Highlighting the development criteria or indicators that are used as measures
to identify and describe vulnerability (or resilience) and their integration in the
DRR framework;

c.

d.

e.

Making differentiated decisions or restrictions on land uses such as specifying
acceptable land use types according to the risk assessment results, e.g.,
agricultural use of flood prone areas might be allowed but not settlements;
Developing disaster risk criteria in land use planning and zoning. The results
of the vulnerability and risk assessment will provide clear directions to cities
and municipalities in the crafting of corresponding preventive and mitigating
policies and measures that address the disaster risks affecting them. These
can also supplement decision making on matters involving zoning regulations
such as the prescription of strict building codes like specification of minimum
elevation and heights of buildings, prohibition of basements in flood prone
areas, and the use of certain types of roofing construction in areas covered by
possible volcanic debris fallouts; and
Identifying all other appropriate risk-reduction decisions depending on the
risk assessment. In general, all DRR measures and options can be classified as
avoidance or elimination, reduction or mitigation, sharing or transfer of the
hazard potential or disaster risk. The do-nothing option thus becomes a purely
management decision.

D. Drr-ENHANCED pDpfp AND rpfp

1. PuRPOSE

The Guidelines seek to enhance the planning outputs – the PDPFP, RPFP and by
extension, the RDP. In general, it will highlight how disaster risk assessment is
undertaken and how the resulting risk estimates may be evaluated and used to
improve all aspects of the plans. A DRR-enhanced plan will significantly contribute
to risk reduction efforts and help make societies more resilient to natural hazards,
and at the same time ensuring that development efforts shall not be compromised by
these hazards.

The DRR-enhanced plan will:

a.

b.

Provide a firmer basis for sectoral plans especially those that relate to
the physical aspects of development like land, natural resources, and
infrastructures as well as the socioeconomic dimensions that aim to lessen
vulnerabilities and improve resilience of communities to disasters;
Reconcile and rationalize land use and development proposals among

adjoining localities and with higher level framework plans. For example,
contiguous areas across several LGUs that are hazard prone should be
commonly delineated (e.g., as high risk zones) and the corresponding
complementary risk reduction options identified and mutually agreed upon;
Guide government agencies and private developers, particularly those
undertaking large-scale projects, on the proper project location and the
implementation of the necessary mitigation works; and
Provide a basis for adjudicating conflicts arising from the implementation of
land use plans, development projects, and similar activities that straddle the
boundaries of two or more municipalities within the province.

c.

d.

These features may also be adopted by the enhanced RDPs or RPFPs particularly on
the resolution of interprovincial concerns.

note: the nEda-adB plpEm guidelines advocate the preparation of sectoral action plans rather than sectoral plans per se at the provincial level since the provincial
development and physical Framework plan already captures the sectors and areas relevant to the development of the province.

In general, the enhanced plans are prepared to guide detailed development planning
work, be it in local level planning, i.e., preparation of comprehensive land use plan,
and/or sectoral planning of line agencies. It should be understood that the planning
outputs, enhanced by this mainstreaming approach, consist of policy options and
generalized programs and projects which the next level stakeholders can work on
in their subsequent more detailed planning work. In general, the desired outcomes
should be towards safer and more resilient communities.

The DRR-enhanced plans are also expected to complement and be consistent with the
disaster management plans or contingency plans1 of the provinces or of the regions. The
databases and maps developed for these plans will be useful for preparedness activities
like identifying general locations for temporary shelter facilities, evacuation routes, etc.

In terms of institutional responsibilities and linkages, the DRR-enhanced plans
are prepared within the processes of the Regional and Provincial Development
Councils while the contingency plans through the Regional and Provincial
Disaster Coordination Councils. It is therefore important that the preparation and
implementation of these two distinct sets of plans be synchronized to ensure the
desired complementation and consistency.

In the long-run, however, it is desired that disaster management and contingency
plans are mainstreamed into the development and physical framework plan with the
Development Councils and Disaster Coordinating Councils involved in the preparation.

E. pLANNiNg CHALLENgES

The following are the challenges in mainstreaming DRR into the planning processes:

a.

b.

Limited knowledge on the frequency of occurrence and the consequence or
severity of hazards. Available data are still incomplete or inaccurate. Planners
need to continually consult with engineers, geologists, hydrometerologists,
social scientists and economists to improve planning analyses and decision
making;
Changing risks are difficult to account for. Hazards can change and so could

the communities and the environment that are affected. With climate change,
risks from hydrometeorologic hazards could be compounded and would need
scientific information for adaptation;
Existing land use is often very difficult to change. Land use decisions,
however, must seek a balance between individual needs and the good of the
entire community. For example, the decision to restrict settlements from the
delineated high risk zones would imply the resettlement of affected families
to other areas or the implementation of the attendant structural measures
that should ensure the safety of the rest of the families within the bigger
community;
Lack of integration of jurisdictional boundaries. Dealing with the impacts
of disasters requires the necessary integration of various jurisdictional
boundaries, particularly where cumulative impacts occur. Such impacts are
very difficult to foresee and plan for all possible contingencies; and
Getting local ownership support and implementation. It is very important
that the communities affected are able to know the disaster risks that they
are confronted with so that they are in a better position to decide on the
appropriate mitigation and coping options. At the very least, they can come to
realize the consequences of not treating the risks.

f. CoNCLuSioN

The disaster risk assessment (DRA) methodology introduced in the Guidelines
was developed based on availability of data on natural hazards. The results provide
the initial approximation of the disaster risks confronting a province or region and
become the bases for appropriate measures to mitigate, reduce or totally eliminate
such disaster risks. Definitely, more elaborate and accurate data sets are preferable
in order to better identify and assess disaster risks and have the firmer basis for the
appropriate DRR options. Closer collaboration among various stakeholders (the
affected communities, decision makers, planning professionals, those involved in
disaster coordination, the scientific community and the academe) is thus important
in order to have better estimates and appreciation of the risks involved. Moreover,
the collaborations when institutionalized should lead to continued benchmarking
work and the conduct of more specific vulnerability studies. Workable institutional
arrangements should thus be forged towards a more efficient and cost-effective
disaster risk information generation, sharing and management system.
The ultimate use of the risk estimates is to provide the bases, as shaped by existing

factors and situations, for the corresponding risk reduction options. The results of the
analysis would eventually be used to select and prioritize DRR decisions. The focus
of the estimates should not be on the value or costs per se, but rather on the general
guidance they provide for decision making.

It is evident that disaster risk assessment, particularly its approaches and
methodologies, would benefit from further refinement. Research and development
should be encouraged, particularly in risk and vulnerability assessment and the
development of compatible approaches for assessing the probability of occurrence and
consequence of specific hazards.

In summary, the planning practice benefits from the application of the methodologies
and procedures presented in these Guidelines. Further enhancements can be done in
the future particularly on the following study areas:

a.

b.

c.

d.

e.

Formulation of standard planning nomenclatures in relation to natural disaster
risks, i.e., terminology, notation and symbols, both in texts and on maps;
Establishing common databases on the natural environment, general land uses,
vulnerability parameters as required by the DRA methodology including the
specification of compatible map scales, preferably identical if not the same base
maps among mandated agency generators and users;
Establishing comparable probabilities of frequencies of occurrence and
consequences for various types of natural hazards and their impact on more
specific categories of the different elements at risk;
Establishing levels of tolerable or acceptable risks among communities and
local governments;
Benchmarking and identifying best practices on DRR measures and options;
and

f. More detailed integration of climate change risk reduction and adaptation

measures

The planning frameworks and procedures will be effectively improved with the
mainstreaming of DRR into the PDPFP and RPFP. These DRR-enhanced plans will
significantly contribute to the resiliency of our country’s societies by ensuring that the
negative effects of natural hazards are lessened, if not totally mitigated. In general, the
strategies may relate to the following situations:

a. Increased resilience of the province/region to natural disasters

16

MAINSTREAMING DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN SUBNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LAND USE/PHYSICAL PLANNING IN THE PHILIPPINES

Programs, projects and activities that increase resilience (i.e., poverty
alleviation, food security, access to health services, etc.) may already have been
addressed in the sectoral development goals and objectives, but the importance
attached to their objectives (and related criteria) may be changed in view of
the vulnerabilities and risks, which highlight the role of increased resilience in
DRR.

b. Reduced exposure of populations and assets through appropriate DRR

measures

Programs, projects and activities related to reducing human and property
exposure to hazard (i.e., early warning, preparedness, structural mitigation,
community based risk management, asset protection through insurance, etc.)
are more likely to compete with other interests in the use of limited public
funds. Its importance in the overall development framework will depend on the
value placed by decision makers on risk assessment especially in the way DRR
strategies complement development objectives.

Disasters and Development: The Case for
Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)

This chapter presents the importance of mainstreaming DRR in subnational plans.

It first establishes the relationship of disasters and development, and then explains

how development planning can be a useful means towards reducing disaster risks.

A. DiSAStErS AND DEVELopMENt

Natural hazards act as triggers to disasters and place areas at risk. A natural disaster
results when a natural hazard causes serious disruption, causing human, material,
economic or environmental losses that exceed the ability to cope of those affected.

1. NATuRAl HAzARD EXPOSuRE

The Philippines is one of the countries in the world that is prone to natural hazards. It
recorded a total of 373 disaster events triggered by natural hazards from 1905 to 2006
or about 4 incidents per year (OFDA/CRED, 2006).

The country’s exposure to disaster is largely due to its location and geographic
landscape. Composed of 7,107 islands, it is one of the world’s largest archipelagos.
It has a long coastline which makes it vulnerable to sea-level rise from climatic
conditions. The Philippines is located along the Pacific Ring of Fire, making it
vulnerable to earthquake, tsunamis and volcanic hazards. It has 220 volcanoes, 22
of which are classified as active. It lies along the Western Pacific Basin, a generator
of climatic conditions such as monsoons, thunderstorms, intertropical convergence
zones, typhoons and El Niño. On the average, 20 tropical cyclones cross the
Philippine area of responsibility annually. The damaging elements of tropical cyclones
are high winds, storm surges and floods.

2. IMPACT OF DISASTERS

The impact of disasters in terms of lives lost and damage to property is staggering.
Deaths from natural disasters in the 1990 decade and in 2000-2006 have increased
compared with the 1980 decade levels. A significant number of deaths are caused by
tropical cyclones. The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) has estimated
that an average of 500 people are killed each year due to tropical cyclones during the
period 1970-2002. The high number of deaths in the 90s was mainly due to the 1990
earthquake that struck Luzon and the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption wherein lives lost
numbered about 2,000 and 6,200 respectively. The NDCC recorded a total number of
36,019 deaths caused by natural disasters from 1980 to 2006 (Table 2.1).

The average cost of direct damage from natural disasters from 1970 to 2006 is
estimated at PhP15 billion at 2000 prices (Table 2.2). Direct damage covers damage
to agricultural crops, public infrastructure and private homes. Damage is highest
at about PhP70 billion in 1978 when 15 disasters struck the country. Other major
disasters with high direct damage are the Luzon earthquake in 1990 (about PhP66
billion), the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991 (about PhP33 billion) and the droughts
in 1984 and 1987. As a result, the declines in gross domestic product (GDP) were
estimated at: (a) 1.2 percent due to the 1990 Luzon earthquake; (b) 0.9 percent due to
the Pinatubo eruption; and (c) 0.5 percent average due to typhoons every year.

Natural calamities strain the national budget. Limited budgetary resources meant
to finance basic services such as farm-to-market roads, school buildings, and low
cost housing are instead rechanneled to reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts.
To illustrate, the NEDA Regional Development Coordination Staff estimates that a
calamity fund of PhP1 billion (at 2007 prices) can already construct 2,500 elementary
level classrooms or 2,174 secondary level classrooms or 161.29 kilometers of new
farm-to-market roads or 20,000 core resettlement units or 50,000 household covered

with Level III water supply projects. What further aggravates the situation is the
financing gap, i.e., the difference in the level of annual appropriation of the calamity
fund vis-à-vis the costs of damage (Figure 2.1). Disasters, therefore, erode the
country’s development gains. They do not only result to economic losses, but also
hamper the provision of programs and services that should have improved the living
conditions of communities. The money intended for pursuing planned development
interventions are instead devoted to disaster response as well as to rehabilitation
and reconstruction endeavors. This in turn reduces the capacity of communities or
individuals to cope.

3. DISASTER AND DEvElOPMENT lINkS

Disasters can interrupt the development process just as much as the pathways taken
towards achieving development goals can lead to disaster. Development though plays
a major role in reducing risks by overcoming vulnerability.

Disaster and development links are further explained by Table 2.3.

Disasters set back social and economic growth as development efforts are disrupted by
natural disasters. Frequent disasters increase poverty and affect the achievement of
the Millennium Development Goals (Table 2.4). Injuries and death as well as physical
damage to infrastructure, agricultural crops, machinery and stocks and other livelihood
activities may result in increased poverty and decline in welfare. Limited government
resources intended to finance development activities are diverted to emergency
response and relief leaving fewer resources for rehabilitation and reconstruction.

Disaster risk could also be a product of inappropriate development choices.
Inappropriate land use practices and the lack of preparedness lead to greater
disaster risks. The poor siting or location of settlements, economic activities and
infrastructures, inappropriate use of resources, and rapid urban growth exert pressure
on scarce land and other resources.

Development, however, reduces risks from disasters. An area marked by low levels
of poverty, high employment opportunities, and adequate health care, education
facilities and other basic infrastructures become more resilient or has greater capacity
to cope with and recover from hazard events. The link among hazards, disasters and
development is vulnerability. A natural hazard becomes a disaster when it affects a
vulnerable population. From the vulnerability perspective, disasters result not from
the hazard alone but also for the quality and quantity of elements exposed to the
hazard on one hand and the vulnerability of the population on the other. Vulnerability
of the population may be defined by their geographic location, assets, gender, and age,
among others.

GOAL 1: Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. Extreme poverty and hunger have many consequences for the human
condition in general and specifically in relation to disaster risk reduction. these broadly include the increased likelihood of
population living in more hazard-prone areas, less protection against disaster impact, lowered coping capacity during and after
the hazardous event, and severely hampered recovery period.

GOAL 2: Achieving universal primary education. disasters greatly hamper the education process in many ways, through
human loss and injury, social upheaval, school property damage and closings, and often with children having to leave school in
the recovery period since their families would be needing their help in meeting basic needs.

GOAL 3: Promoting gender equality and empowering women. during and after disasters, women play a primary role in
providing assistance to the family and community in disaster prevention activities. they are frequently, disproportionately and
negatively affected by disaster impact and can also face exploitation in the aftermath of disasters.

GOAL 4: Reducing child mortality (children below the age of five). infants and young children are among the most vulnerable
segments of any given population. Young children became even more susceptible to physical and emotional trauma in the
aftermath of disasters, interrupted basic infrastructure, stretched emergency and health care facilities, the outbreak of disease
epidemics, and the loss or injury of care givers and income earners.

GOAL 5: Improving maternal health. in households where basic needs are hardly met, the pressure of post-disaster impact can
eliminate the possibility of adequate maternal care as stretched resources can only cover immediate survival requirements. in
many cases, gender inequity gives women less access to household income and assets.

GOAL 6: Combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. Economically and socially marginalized and usually highly
disadvantaged infected populations often suffer even greater impact during a hazard event, and in its aftermath, than others
in their community. With basic infrastructure damaged and interrupted, water-borne and insect vector diseases can escalate
rapidly, which severely hampers recovery and development efforts.

GOAL 7: Ensuring environmental sustainability. the link between environmental degradation and disaster occurrence and
impact is well documented. deforestation and soil erosion increase mudslides, landslides and flash flooding. desertification
increases drought. Climate change and variability is one of the causal factors of extreme weather events. degradation of the
resource base leads directly to less access to resource-based livelihoods, migration to marginal and often more hazard-prone
areas, rural-urban migration - often into increasingly more vulnerable urban slums.

GOAL 8: Developing a global partnership for development. mainstreaming disaster risk reduction continues to gain
momentum at all levels with development efforts increasingly including risk reduction considerations – and with risk reduction
initiatives also further incorporating wider development viewpoints.

While natural hazards cannot be prevented from happening, the vicious cycle
of disasters and underdevelopment can be reversed. This can be done through
“mainstreaming” DRR in the development process. The UN-ISDR defines DRR as the
“concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through systematic efforts to analyse
and manage the causal factors of disasters, including through reduced exposure to
hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of land and the
environment, and improved preparedness for adverse events.” DRR therefore has a two-
fold aim: one, “addressing vulnerability in order to be resilient to natural hazards” and
two, “ensuring that development efforts do not increase vulnerability to these hazards.”

Reducing disaster risks is more affordable than repairing damage or totally replacing
damaged structures. The US Federal Emergency Management Authority estimates
that every dollar spent on hazard mitigation generates an estimated four dollars on the

average in future benefits. In the Caribbean, the World Bank also noted that spending
one per cent of a structure’s value on vulnerability reduction measures reduces by
around a third the probable maximum loss from hurricanes.

“Mainstreaming” DRR into development means “to consider and address risks
emanating from natural hazards in medium-term strategic frameworks and
institutional structures, in country and sectoral strategies and policies and in the
design of individual projects in hazard-prone countries” (Provention, 2007).

The lack of disaster risk considerations in the development processes, including
rehabilitation efforts following major catastrophes, leads to investments in
“constructing and reconstructing risks” which perpetuate the conditions for
unsustainable human development. As a result, the achievement of poverty alleviation,
good governance, and other related goals becomes more difficult.

1. DEvElOPMENT PlANNING AS vEHIClE FOR DRR

The aim of planning, both as a profession and as a process, is to make sure that
people are better off, or at least they are not worse off than they were before. In
mainstreaming DRR in planning, one can guide development and allocate resources
toward the protection of life and assets, restoration of productive systems and
livelihoods, regaining market access, and rebuilding social and human capital and
physical and psychological health. Development plans therefore take on a critical role
in disaster risk management.

The development planning process is comprehensive, multisectoral, and integrative in
nature. As shown in the Figure 2.2, the process covers plan preparation, investment
programming, project evaluation and development, budgeting, implementation, and
monitoring and evaluation.

It starts with identifying development strategies based on an analysis of the region
or province. These are translated into programs, projects, and activities (PPAs)
that serve as the main inputs into the investment programming processes. Based
on a predetermined set of criteria, these PPAs are further screened and ranked to
produce the multiyear investment programs and the annual investment program.
The investment programs, aside from ranking the priority PPAs, indicate the year(s)
in which each PPA will be implemented and at what cost. Should available funds be
insufficient to implement a PPA, measures to generate additional revenues to finance

the PPA can be identified. Funds are then allocated and the implementation proceeds
for the target year. Programs and projects are evaluated to determine their costs and
benefits, feasibility and prospective contributions to society, among others. When
implemented, PPAs are monitored and evaluated and the results will be inputs to the
next cycle of planning. (Refer to Volume 2: Provincial Development and Physical
Framework Plan of the NEDA-ADB Guidelines on Provincial/Local Planning and
Expenditure Management for more details).

With DRR assessment conducted within subnational planning, planners may: (a)
take a comprehensive view of the physical, economic, social, environmental and
institutional interrelationships and understand what constitutes the susceptibility of
a region or province to risks from natural hazards; (b) integrate DRR management
decisions in the spatial framework, i.e., risk mitigation, risk prevention, risk transfer
and risk retention; and (c) carry out the DRR-enhanced PPAs in their investment
programs that are:

• designed to contribute to developmental aims and to reduce future disaster risks.

2. OPPORTuNITIES FOR MAINSTREAMING DRR IN SuBNATIONAl PlANS

While existing plans may have DRR components, there is still a need to integrate
disaster risk and vulnerability assessments and more specific DRR strategies and
measures. The existing development planning system and outputs (Figure 2.3) provide
the opportunity for mainstreaming DRR in planning, particularly at the regional and
provincial levels, since it is at these levels where linkages in plan processes are well
defined. Furthermore, the geographic coverage of regions and provinces allow for a
fairly comprehensive analysis of hazards beyond local boundaries.

As mentioned in Chapter 1, the usefulness of mainstreaming DRR in the Provincial
Development and Physical Framework Plan (PDPFP) are as follows: (a) it provides a
basis for other sectoral plans especially those that have something to do with land,
natural resources, and infrastructure facilities; (b) it reconciles and rationalizes land
use proposals among adjoining localities and with higher level framework plans; (c) it
guides government agencies and private developers, particularly those that undertake
large-scale projects, on the proper location of their projects and the implementation
of the necessary mitigation works; and (d) it provides a basis for adjudicating conflicts
arising from the implementation of the land use plans, development projects, and
mitigation proposals that straddle the boundaries of two or more municipalities within
the province.

The same utility may be said of the Regional Physical Framework Plan particularly
pertaining to interprovincial concerns. In general, these plans are prepared to guide
detailed development planning work later, be it in local level planning of the lower
level local government units and/or sectoral planning of line agencies. Planning
outputs can offer policy options and generalized programs and projects which the next
level stakeholders, particularly the municipalities, can work on in their subsequent
more detailed planning work. In general, the outcomes should be safe and more
resilient communities.

This chapter established the relationship of disasters and development, and explained
why DRR should be mainstreamed into the development planning process. In this
context, mainstreaming DRR addresses disaster issues as a cross-cutting dimension
of development and goes beyond hazard impact mitigation to a more comprehensive
analysis of its implications to development. Existing planning structures and processes
provide an opportunity for mainstreaming DRR in subnational development and
physical planning. This is a good venue to identify areas needed to ensure effectiveness
of response activities and to formulate DRR-enhanced programs and projects.

T

he mainstreaming framework involves two processes. The first is disaster
risk assessment (DRA) which analyzes the hazards of a place together with
the risks to exposed elements. The second process concerns how the results

of risk assessment enhance the development planning analysis leading to better
design and prioritization of interventions that are intended to reduce risks to and
vulnerability of exposed population and property.

The framework for mainstreaming DRR is shown in Figure 3.1. It illustrates how
disaster risk assessment (or simply risk assessment as may be interchangeably used
in these Guidelines) is undertaken and how the results of the assessment are used to
enhance all aspects of the planning process: from visioning, analysis of the planning
environment, derivation of development potential and challenges and their translation
into the corresponding goals, objectives and targets, and finally to the specification
of the appropriate strategies and programs, projects and activities (PPAs). These
are the primary focus of the Guidelines and are represented by the light beige boxes
in Figure 3.1. The PPAs derived from the plan formulation stage are the main
inputs into the succeeding phases of the development planning process, namely,
investment programming, budgeting, project evaluation and development, project
implementation and monitoring and evaluation (represented by the orange boxes).
PPA outcomes and impacts that are determined during and post implementation
should be able to reveal reduction in risks to population and property by increasing
resilience or reducing vulnerability of these elements at risk.

Before proceeding any further, it is important to define the fundamental concepts on
disaster, hazard, elements at risk, vulnerability and risk. These terminologies may be
differently used and understood but have very specific meanings in these Guidelines.
Their basic definitions have been adopted from the United Nations International
Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR).

Disaster

A serious disruption of the functioning of a society, causing widespread human,
material or environmental losses which exceed the ability of affected society to cope
using only its own resources. Natural disaster would be a disaster caused by nature or
natural causes.

Hazard is generally understood to be a threatening event such as earthquake or flood.
Natural hazards would be considered a hazard that is produced by nature or natural
processes, which should exclude hazards stemming or resulting from human activities.

Hazard is also referred to as the probability of occurrence of a potentially damaging
phenomenon within a given time period and area. It is mathematically expressed as the
probability of occurrence or frequency of occurrence of a given magnitude of event.

Elements at Risk

The people, buildings and structures, infrastructure, economic activities, and public
services exposed to hazards in a given area.

Vulnerability

Vulnerability generally refers to conditions which define how elements exposed to risk
are affected by a hazard. Vulnerable population may refer to groups of people who
need special care to cope with impacts of natural hazards such as the poor, physically
challenged, elderly, children, women and others.

Physical vulnerability of an area will depend on the exposure of vulnerable structural
elements within an area such as buildings, dwellings, critical facilities, and other
infrastructures; economic vulnerability will come from the area’s wealth, income,
potential for growth, among others; social vulnerability stems from the characteristics
of individuals or groups in the area that determine their well-being in terms of their
income and access to basic services such as education and health; and environmental
vulnerability refers to the state of the environment (UNDP, 2004).

The opposite of vulnerability is resiliency which is the quality that reduces the
vulnerability of people and property. Resilience is not simply the absence of
vulnerability; it is also the capacity to prevent losses, maintain normal living conditions
when damage occurs, and manage recovery from the impact (Buckle, et. al., 2000).

Mathematically, vulnerability is the degree of loss (from 0 to 100 percent) resulting
from a potentially damaging event.

MAINSTREAMING DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN SUBNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LAND USE/PHYSICAL PLANNING IN THE PHILIPPINES

35

Risk

Risk is the expected losses (of lives, persons injured, property damaged and economic
activity disrupted) due to a particular hazard for a given area and reference period.
The unit of measure of risk could be number of fatality or value of damaged property.

Risk is mathematically expressed as:

Risk = Hazard x Elements at risk x Vulnerability

C. DiSAStEr riSK ASSESSMENt

Disaster risk assessment is the process of studying risks caused by natural hazards
and their effects on elements at risk, namely, the people, buildings and structures,
infrastructure, economic activities and public services exposed to hazards in a given
area. More specifically, risk assessment is the process of quantifying and evaluating
risk. Quantified risk may be expressed as the number of elements lost (e.g., fatalities),
proportion of elements affected (e.g., 25% of road network) and monetary value of
damaged property.

The essential prerequisite for DRA is identifying the existing range of natural hazards
and calculating or estimating the measures of risk generated by those hazards. As
shown in Figure 3.1, risk assessment involves four steps: (a) hazard characterization
and frequency analysis; (b) consequence analysis; (c) risk estimation; and (d) risk
prioritization.

a. Hazard characterization and frequency analysis – involves identifying and

characterizing the hazard(s) that threaten an area. Hazard is expressed as the
probability of occurrence or the inverse of return period.

b. Consequence Analysis – involves determining the elements at risk and their

vulnerability. In the absence of damage ratios, factors for fatality and property
damage are derived and applied to actual population and property exposed to
hazard.

c. Risk Estimation - involves estimating the risk (annual basis) expressed as

the expected annual number of lives lost, and annual damage to property (in
monetary value).

d. Risk Evaluation – involves determining priority areas based on risk estimates.
These priority areas are further evaluated by assessing conditions of the place
and identifying and describing factors which contribute to their vulnerabilities.

In the succeeding sections, each of these steps will be covered. The basic concepts in
theory and practice are discussed in the main text while the indented green-colored
text describes how these concepts were applied in the Guidelines, given the Philippine
setting, particularly on the availability of data.

1. HAzARD CHARACTERIzATION AND FREquENCy ANAlySIS

Hazard characterization or hazard analysis is the in-depth study and monitoring
of hazards to determine their potential, origin (i.e., geologic or hydrometeorologic),
geographic extent, hazard impact characteristics including their magnitude-frequency
behavior, historical behavior and initiating (or triggering) factors. For each type
of hazard, specific hazard events are generally analyzed. For example, for flooding,
hazard events may be categorized as 10-year flood or 20-year flood which generally
refers to the frequency or the measure of return period of certain flood events that
exhibited the same characteristics such as depth measured in meters.

Information on hazards generally come from agencies mandated to: (a) collect data,
study and map hazards; (b) monitor and report to the public critical information
relative to the hazard; and (c) recommend and/or undertake actions to minimize
the impact of hazards. Specific sources are instrumental records, historical records,
geologic and geomorphic investigations, geotechnical investigations, modeling,
triggering agent analysis, and experts’ judgment.

Analysis can be carried out at the national, subnational, provincial, municipal or
site levels. It can focus on present conditions, or can extend into the future to
take account of changing environmental conditions (e.g., climate change) or social
conditions (e.g., population growth or new settlements). As a result, both actual and
potential hazards may be identified.

Under these Guidelines, the effects of climate change are considered under
the hydrometeorologic hazards. As indicated by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), frequency and intensity of weather-
related events are likely to increase due to climate change. Using the risk
assessment methodology in these Guidelines, risk estimation of climate

37

change scenarios can be undertaken. Said analysis should be supported
by baseline data for climate change parameters.

However, data limitations may lead to the analysis of susceptibility rather than the
hazard itself. Analysis of susceptibility results in the identification of areas that are
prone to the impact of the hazards but usually does not extend to characterization in
terms of the frequency and/or magnitude of a potentially damaging event. Knowing
that an area is likely to experience hazards is a valuable starting point but, ultimately,
information on hazard magnitude, frequency and expected consequences are relatively
more important for hazard management and risk reduction.

Ideally, hazard maps should already contain information on return
period or frequency of occurrence given the magnitude. However, hazard
maps generated in the Philippines include information only on level of
susceptibility, i.e., areas are classified as high susceptible area (HSA),
moderate susceptible area (MSA) and low susceptible area (LSA); or
prone and not prone. An overview of hazards and hazard mapping in the
Philippines is presented in Annex 1.

As defined, hazard is mathematically expressed as the probability of occurrence of a
threatening event. This is the scope of frequency analysis. Frequency analysis may use
quantitative or qualitative estimation. Ultimately, quantitative estimation provides an
objective measure of hazard that can be compared and evaluated along with similarly
estimated hazards. Where there is insufficient data, it may only be possible to produce
a qualitative estimation, based on analogy with similar areas or by using expert
judgment. Initial qualitative estimates can be augmented by calculated risk as more
scientific evidence becomes available.

Probability of occurrence is the quantitative measure of hazard. The probability of
occurrence is related to the return period, T, by 1/T. An example of quantitative
estimation of hazard, specifically its frequency or probability of occurrence is shown in
Box 3.1.

A detailed discussion on the probabilistic treatment of hazards is
presented in Annex 2.

Box 3.1 Quantitative and Qualitative Frequency Analysis

Frequency with respect to natural hazards is calculated from the number of events of a given size per unit time
(e.g., the number of earthquakes of magnitude greater than 5.9 per 100 years). the reciprocal of frequency is the
return period, the average interval between events of a given size. For example, the return period of a magnitude
6 earthquake may be 75 years (i.e., the frequency is 1.33 per 100 years). this represents an annual probability of
1.33 percent, often expressed in order of magnitude of probabilities, e.g., 1.33 x 10-2.

These Guidelines used quantitatively-derived return periods for
hazards of geologic origin and qualitative estimates for hazards of
hydrometeorologic origin. Both estimates are considered crude or
preliminary as an initial attempt to come up with quantified risks. The
estimates are presented in Chapter 4 and Annex 3.

Occurrence of hazards is generally classified as:

a. Frequent – Many events are frequent over a lifetime
b. Likely - A single event is likely over a lifetime
c. Rare - A single event is rare over a lifetime

The general assumption is that frequent hazard events or occurrences
are of lower intensity or magnitude and conversely for rare events.

2. CONSEquENCE ANAlySIS

Consequence analysis is determining or defining the elements at risk from a given
hazard and defining their vulnerability.

The elements at risk are ideally obtained by survey (or inventory), or by using records
such as census or primary surveys (particularly useful for getting a quick idea as to
economic values). If a measure of economic risk is required, then a value must be
established for the elements (e.g., resale value or replacement cost). This may be
obtained from valuation records or other sources.

Vulnerability is limited to fatality and property damage under these
Guidelines since these are the two indicators that have been evaluated
to be feasible for quantification in terms of probable risks. This is
referred to as a “macro” vulnerability assessment in these Guidelines.
A qualitative and more detailed or “micro” vulnerability assessment
is further undertaken of the high risk areas identified during risk
prioritization as input to the planning decisions and formulation of DRR
measures.

Vulnerability is mathematically measured as the proportion of damage expected
from exposure to hazards and is expressed on a scale from 0 (no damage) to 1.0 (total
damage), or 0 percent damage to 100 percent damage. It is referred to as the damage
ratio in cases of quantifiable loss. It should be noted that these values are usually
unavailable for most hazards in the country.

Under these Guidelines, the above damage ratio is referred to as factor for
damage, specifically, factor for fatality and factor for property damage.
These factors will be applied respectively to the actual population and
property exposed to the hazard in computing the risk.

A detailed discussion on the derivation of factors for fatality and property
damage are presented in Annex 5.

Other aspects that are considered in consequence analysis are:

a. Spatial impact – If a hazardous event occurs, it may only affect some parts
of the study area. Thus, the extent of the spatial impact must be determined.
This can be estimated based on hazard mapping, analysis of historical data and
literature study. The spatial factor is the ratio of the area affected by the hazard
to the study area.

In these Guidelines, the spatial factor (i.e., factor for fatality and factor
for property damage) makes reference only to the susceptible areas

defined in hazard maps. These areas are taken as the entire possible set
of areas from which the risks can be computed. Outside of these areas,
no risks are computed. A first estimate of the risks makes use of the
different susceptible areas using a range of hazard events that are likely
to impact such places. Hence the initial assumption follows this logic:
(a) HSA are affected by frequent events; (b) HSA and MSA are affected
by likely events; (c) HSA, MSA, and LSA are affected by rare events.

In subsequent analysis, spatial factors need to be defined in hazard maps
based on the extent of the affected areas from various degrees of hazard
events to refine the risk estimates.

b. Temporal impact – Buildings are always 100 percent (all day, all year) exposed
to the threats of natural phenomena; people are not. When the elements at
risk are mobile (e.g., persons on foot, in cars, buses and trains) or where there
is varying occupancy of buildings (e.g., between night and day, week days
and weekends, seasonal) it is necessary to make allowance for the probability
that persons (or a particular number of persons) will be in the area affected
by the hazard event. For varying occupancy it is simply a calculation of the
proportion of a year (0 to 1.0) which the number of persons being considered
occupy the building. Methodologies are also available for calculating the
probability of a vehicle being affected by a hazard. Another factor that should
be considered is the likelihood of evacuation or escape. This arises depending
on the location of the person with respect to the hazard area, and whether the
person may have sufficient warning to evacuate or escape the area.

In these Guidelines, the temporal factor is a static figure which assumes
that population and properties are exposed to natural hazards 100
percent of the time.

c. Seasonal occurrence – Natural phenomena may occur within specific seasons
only (e.g., rainy season). Therefore, the factor for seasonal occurrence of the
natural phenomena needs to be ascertained. Expressed in terms of probability,
an estimate can be based on analysis of historical events.

In consideration of climate variability, the seasonal occurrence factor makes
reference to the element at risk. For example, different crops have different
growth stages and may not be harvestable in specific seasons of the year.

41

Hence, it may be assumed that all areas are taken as harvestable (factor of one)
or part of the areas are not (factor less than one).

Under these Guidelines, no factors where developed to consider the
seasonal changes.

2.1 Consequence in terms of fatality
The consequence in terms of fatality is estimated by: (a) identifying the potentially
affected population; and (b) determining the factor for fatality.

To identify the potentially affected population, the population map is overlayed with
the hazard map. Ideally, the population map should have actual plot (or complete
inventory) of houses, buildings and structures together with data on occupancy (i.e.,
number of persons living or working inside the structure).

Under these Guidelines, the population density map at the barangay level
is deemed as sufficient parameter to describe the element at risk for the
calculation of fatalities. Estimation of affected population is based on
hazard exposure and population densities.

The factor for fatality is determined by: (a) exposure and vulnerability of the
population; and (b) exposure and vulnerability of the structure which may bring about
the loss of life of the persons inside the structure.

Under these Guidelines, the factors for fatality, which were developed
based on past hazard exposures, are provided for the estimation of the
probable proportion of fatalities to the population affected by a hazard
event. The factors for fatality, shown using a series of matrices, were
estimated from disaster damage and loss averages at the national level
and from comparisons of different hazard events. As such, the numbers
are basically indicative.

It is further assumed that likelihood of fatality is affected by concentration
of population (i.e., population density) in the hazard prone areas. Thus,
the table will result in less dense areas having lower fatality as compared
to highly dense areas.

2.2 Consequence in terms of property damage
The consequence in terms of property damage is estimated by: (a) identifying
the potentially affected property and the corresponding monetary value; and (b)
determining the factor for property damage.

To identify the potentially affected property, the land use map is overlayed with the
hazard map. Ideally, the land use map should have actual plot of houses, buildings,
roads, bridges, power lines, facilities, crops together with data on the corresponding
monetary values.

Under these Guidelines, the land use map is used to describe the
elements at risk for the calculation of property damage. Estimation of
affected property is based on hazard exposure and land use.

However, since existing land use maps do not reflect the actual plot
and the corresponding monetary values of the structures, crops and
other elements, the monetary values were computed based on the cost
of replacing the elements at risk, particularly the built-up areas and
the agricultural crops only. Other elements and indirect costs such as
disruption to economic activities or the nondelivery of vital services
were not imputed.

The factor for property damage is determined by exposure and physical vulnerability
of the properties. Also, it is based on understanding the nature of damage from
specific hazard events using damage curve studies, observations from past events and
historical damage data.

Under these Guidelines, the factor for property damage were developed
based on past hazard exposures and are provided to allow for the
estimation of the probable “proportion” of damage to various properties
affected by a hazard event. The factors, shown using a series of matrices,
were estimated from “disaster damage and loss averages at the national
level” and from comparisons of different hazard events. As such, the
numbers are basically indicative.

It is further assumed that potential or likelihood of damage is affected
by the aggregate property value of an area. Thus, the table will result in
areas with less property values having lower proportionate damage as
compared to high property value areas.

3. RISk ESTIMATION

Risk estimation involves the integration of the results of hazard characterization and
frequency analysis (or hazard analysis) with consequence analysis to derive an overall
measure of risk. Recall that the mathematical expression of risk is:

Risk = Hazard x Elements at risk x Vulnerability

The estimated risks are expressed in number of fatalities per year and the monetary
value of the damaged properties per year. An example of a quantitative calculation of
risk to property is shown in Box 3.2

Box 3.2 Quantitative Calculation of Risk

an example of calculation of property risk (from the australian geomechanics society, 2000) is as follows:

the problem: calculate the risk of a given highway subject to landsliding

landslides periodically impact the highway. the highway replacement value is estimated at

is hazard; research has shown that there have been five landslide events affecting the highway in
the last 100 years. the average return period of this is one event in 20 years. the chances of this
occurring in any one year are 1/20, i.e., 0.05 probability; in other words, a five percent chance of
occurrence in any one year.
is the spatial probability of the contact of landslide with the highway. in other words, in this
sort of events for example, 30 percent of the highway’s length is affected by landslides, i.e., 0.3.
is the vulnerability of the highway when hit by a landslide. in other words, in the places where
the landslides impact the road, it is the proportion of the affected stretch of highway damaged.
Complete (100 %) damage would be given a value of 1.0. the value in this example is 0.6,
i.e., 60 percent damage to the value.

the risk to property, r(prop), or the annual loss in the dollar value of the highway is calculated as follows:

r(prop)

= p(H) x p(s:H) x v x E
= 0.05 x 0.3 x 0.6 x $10,000,000
= $90,000

source: tonkin and taylor ltd., 2006

In instances where there is paucity of data, qualitative risk estimation may be
undertaken. The general approach for qualitative risk estimation combines qualitative
evaluations of probability of occurrence and qualitative evaluation of consequence.
The hazard is assigned a score to provide an opportunity to rank and compare hazards
and risks. Box 3.3 gives a qualitative calculation of risk. The ranking will give an idea
on areas needing risk reduction.

The advantage of quantitative risk estimation, however, is the resulting values for
gauging gaps between estimated damage and the resources available to the region or

province, prioritizing areas that need urgent attention, and identifying and designing
risk reduction measures. Also, this quantitative method is flexible enough to include
other variables should additional data be generated in the future. This method can be
undertaken through GIS or spreadsheet calculations.

Under these Guidelines, the hazard variable is obtained in the hazard
characterization and frequency analysis step while the variables of
element at risk and vulnerability were computed in the consequence
analysis step. Taking into consideration the adjustments made on
consequence analysis, the Guidelines use the following equations for
risk estimation:

Risk of fatality
RF = P x CF

where RF = risk of fatality (fatality/year)

P = probability of occurrence of hazard event
CF = consequence in terms of fatality per hazard event

CF = PAP x FF

where CF =

consequence in terms of fatality per hazard
event (fatality/event)
PAP = potentially affected population
FF = factor for fatality

Risk of property damage
RPrD = P x CPrD

where RPrD = risk of property damage (PhP/year)

P = probability of occurrence of hazard event
CPrD = consequence in terms of cost of property damage per

hazard event

CPrD = PAPr x FPrD

where CPrD = consequence in terms of cost of property

damage per hazard event (PhP/event)

PAPr = potentially affected property
FPrD = factor for property damage

4. RISk PRIORITIzATION

Resources may not be enough to implement DRR measures in all high-risk areas at the
same time. Thus, risk prioritization is undertaken to guide the identification of areas
needing urgent attention. Risk prioritization can be based exclusively on risk levels.
It can also be based on risk levels complemented with risk perceptions, vulnerability
and/or other factors.

In these Guidelines, risk prioritization uses a composite prioritization
scoring which combines the risk of fatality and the risk of property damage
for built-up and agricultural areas. This prioritization process should
reveal high risk areas which will be subjected to further assessment of
their vulnerability using indicators of population, social infrastructures,
service infrastructures, transport and access, economy and environment
(earlier cited as “micro” vulnerability assessment).

The first step in prioritization is to compare the estimated risks to acceptability criteria
and assign a matching score.

For some hazards (e.g., landslide in Australia, industrial safety in European countries),
standards are available for establishing the acceptability of risks. The most common
approach is represented by the ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) principle,
which involves weighing a risk against the effort, time and money needed to reduce it.
In graphical form, the concept is presented in Figure 3.2.

Negligible risk

The diagram identifies an upper threshold above which risks are generally
unacceptable, and a lower threshold below which risks are generally acceptable and
require no action. Between these two thresholds is a region where risks are tolerated
only on the basis that they are kept As Low As Reasonably Practicable.

In these Guidelines, the risk acceptability criteria for risk of fatality
are conceptually based on the ALARP principle. Computed risks are
categorized into high to very high/moderate/very low to low and are
given corresponding risk scores. The lowest acceptable computed risk
is in the order of 10-5 which is higher than the internationally accepted
standard of 10-6.

For risk of property damage, risk acceptability criteria were based on the
National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) criteria for declaring a
state of calamity but simplified and limited to: (a) when at least 20 percent
of dwelling units are damaged and dwelling units will be represented by
the residential floor area value; and (b) when at least 40 percent of the
means of livelihood are damaged and agricultural crop values will be the
base for estimating damage to livelihood.

A composite score for both risk of fatality and risk of property damage
will be the basis for determining very high/high risk areas needing
urgent interventions.

The prioritization approach is discussed in detail in Chapter 4.

The urgent areas will be assessed further using vulnerability indicators of population,
social infrastructures, service infrastructures, transport and access, economy and
environment (earlier cited as “micro” vulnerability). The “micro” vulnerability will
provide details why such areas are urgent than others and reveal the other factors that
contributed to the risk.

The plans contain the following information: vision, analysis of the planning
environment, development issues, goals, objectives and targets, strategies and PPAs.

The risk assessment results could first be treated as part of the individual sectoral
analysis in describing the planning environment or in the land use and physical
framework portion.

By definition, the physical framework sets the spatial parameters by which future
growth and development, including PPAs, can take place. Hence, the disaster
risk estimates may be used as bases in specifying where developments should be
encouraged or discouraged as well as where PPAs could be better located. The
procedure will entail identifying high risk or priority areas that would require
corresponding DRR measures to be instituted. For each of the high risk areas,
factors that contribute to the risks or to the vulnerabilities of the place are examined.
The implications and acceptability of the risks and vulnerabilities will reveal the
development issues and concerns that will be the subject of planning.

The sequences for this stage are:

a. analysis of the risk impact to the land use and physical framework;
b. identifying development issues and their translation to goals, objectives and

targets based on the risks identified; and

c. specifying DRR measures (strategies and PPAs).

1. ANAlyzING THE RISk IMPACT TO THE lAND uSE AND PHySICAl

FRAMEwORk

The risk assessment results or the risks information become more meaningful if they
are placed side by side with the development framework of the province or region.

Two queries can be made, as follows: Should a development strategy be pursued
despite the risks revealed by the risk analysis? What changes may be adopted so that
the development strategy will be worth pursuing?

Specific planning considerations may be adopted such as the rethinking of the
roles and functions of the settlement or development clusters and hence land uses,
and the need to make alterations to the service and facility requirements given the
renewed roles and functions that respond to the attendant risks. Another important
planning concern given the risks is to ensure the functionalities and linkages (physical
and economic) within and among the development clusters as well as with key
development areas outside the region or province (i.e., to neighboring provinces,
regional hierarchy, national system). Likewise, a key planning consideration is to
look at how the disaster risks impact on the socioeconomic fragilities of the areas or
elements at risk, or how the risks affect specific vulnerable sectors and population
groups (e.g., the poor, the elderly, women and children).

The output of this phase should be an enhanced or revised land use and physical
framework which presents the spatial features of the desired settlements, production
and protection land use, and major infrastructures supporting the desired
development scenario of the province or region.

2. IDENTIFyING DEvElOPMENT ISSuES, GOAlS, OBjECTIvES AND TARGETS

BASED ON THE RISkS

Development issues and concerns are derived from the analysis of the risk impact to
the land use and physical framework. These issues serve as basis for the specification
of development goals, objectives and targets and the eventual identification of DRR
measures that aim to reduce the threat of natural hazards.

The development issues and concerns that are derived may either be existing or
potential land use conflicts attributed to the risks (e.g., settlements in high risk areas,
production systems or critical infrastructures located in high risk areas) as well as

the impact of the disaster risks to the overall development scenario of the province or
region that will require intervention measures.

Again, the aim of DRR mainstreaming is to ensure that the plans formulated
contribute to disaster risk reduction which aims to reduce (if not to eliminate) the
attendant risks, make societies become more resilient to natural hazards, and ensure
that all development efforts being pursued do not increase the risks and vulnerabilities
to these hazards.

Since the vision will serve as the overall guide to the planning process, then this
is where integration should first take place. To do this, one should appreciate the
DRR goals of reducing disaster losses (lives, properties, livelihoods, etc.), building
resilience of communities to hazards, enhancing socioeconomic development and not
contributing to increasing risks are very important and critical to the development
of the province or region. Once this is accepted, then the vision statement should
contain the desired state reflecting such features. As an example, the vision statement
may include some phrases about having safe, prepared and resilient communities
against natural hazards.

Aligned with the vision and derived from the development issues and concerns, broad
statements that respond to the general problem and more specific focus of objectives
and targets are set. This step should enhance the development goals and objectives by
making the treatment of disaster risks a development prerogative.

The output of this stage is an enhanced set of development issues, goals, objectives
and targets. It should also be noted, however, that at the regional or provincial
development framework level, it may be very difficult to be very specific and hence
detailed objective setting or target specification may not be possible at all unless the
data sets available for analysis allow it.

3. IDENTIFyING DRR MEASuRES

Once the significance and priority of the risks are ascertained and the manner by
which they should be responded to as elaborated by the goals, objectives and targets,
the next step is to identify the corresponding DRR measures or intervention approach
or option in order to treat or control the disaster risks.

51

The DRR measures may be classified into four major categories and their
subcategories as follows:

a. Risk avoidance or elimination - removing a risk trigger by not locating in the
area of potential hazard impact, not purchasing vulnerable land or building; or
denying a risk by creating an activity or simply refusing to engage in functions
that could potentially be affected by risks;

b. Risk reduction or mitigation - reducing the frequency of occurrence or the

severity of the consequence by changing physical characteristics or operations
of a system or the element at risk. It can take on the following subcategories:

• Risk prevention;
• Risk or loss reduction by mitigation;
• Risk or loss reduction by preparedness;
• Segregation of exposure by duplication or redundancy; and
• Segregation of exposure by separation.

c. Risk sharing or risk transfer – shifting the risk-bearing responsibility to

another party, often involving financial and economic measures particularly
the use of the insurance system to cover and pay for future damages. In some
literature, the segregation of exposure by separation is considered as a risk-
spreading or risk-transfer option; and

d. Risk retention or acceptance - this is the “do-nothing” scenario where risks

are fully accepted and arrangements are made to pay for financial losses related
to the hazard impact or to fund potential losses with own resources

It has to be noted that DRR is wide-ranging, and there is potential in mainstreaming
it in every development sector. Depending on the types of risks, one can provide for
a range of options to respond to such risks. The choice of DRR measure or approach
to adopt will depend on the decision-making process of the province/region. The
selected DRR measure or approach shall be the result of a participative process
involving all stakeholders particularly the communities and people that are affected by
the risks and the eventual implementation of the DRR measure.

E. SECoNDArY ENtrY poiNtS for MAiNStrEAMiNg

Mainstreaming of DRR does not end in the plan formulation process, but should be
promoted towards plan implementation stages, that is, the remaining stages of the
development planning cycle, as follows:

investment programming;

a.
b. budgeting/financing;
c. project evaluation and development; and
d. project implementation and monitoring and evaluation

Financing through the budget and other alternative schemes must also be studied
carefully to ensure that DRR PPAs are financed and implemented. Monitoring and
evaluation will provide the tool for measuring reduction in risks and vulnerability in
succeeding planning cycles. These are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 6.

f. CoNCLuSioN

Understanding the causes of risk and severity of impact from natural hazards has
changed significantly with scientific advances in the study and monitoring of hazard
events. While there may be incomplete data for perfect quantitative calculation of
risks, the Guidelines provide a starting point for estimation of hazards (expressed in
probability of occurrence), vulnerability (expressed in factors for fatality and property
damage) and risk (expressed in number of lives lost and monetary value of damaged
property). Quantification allows for a more objective analysis, comparability and
measurability in terms of risk reduction and net benefits of risk reduction PPAs or
PPAs that have internalized risks in their design.

Hazards covered by these Guidelines are categorized into two types: geologic and
hydrometeorologic. For internal geologic processes (e.g., earthquake and volcanic
related), the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) is
the agency mandated to collect information, generate maps, and monitor hazards.
For external geologic processes (e.g., landslide and erosion related) the Mines and
Geosciences Bureau (MGB) is the lead agency, while the Philippine Atmospheric,
Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) is the lead agency
for hydrometeorologic hazards (e.g., storm surge). These agencies should be able to tell
what hazard threatens the concerned region or province.

To prepare the inventory, get the hazard maps prepared by those mandated agencies.
Hazard maps can be obtained in paper or electronic form, usually through a written
request. Some agencies charge a minimal fee to cover cost of printing or reproduction
of digital copies.

The hazard maps not only show what hazards affect the region or province, but
also the extent of impact in terms of area coverage. Table 4.2 shows the various
levels of susceptibility the region or province may have for each type of hazard. For
purposes of estimating risks, these Guidelines have adopted a common reference for
susceptibility of areas to hazards, as follows: high susceptible areas (HSA), moderate
susceptible areas (MSA), and low susceptible areas (LSA).

in table 4.2 (under Hazard Characterization and Frequency analysis) High susceptible areas
(Hsa), moderate susceptible areas (msa), and low susceptible areas (lsa) have been
delineated.

the level of susceptibility of each province or municipality is defined by the intensity of the
earthquake-related hazard affecting a province or municipality, or by frequency of occurrence
of rain-induced hazard.

For hydrometeorologic hazards, it is assumed that frequent hazard event will affect Hsa area
only, while a likely hazard event will affect Hsa and msa areas, and, a rare hazard event will
affect all Hsa, msa, and lsa areas. the categories of frequent, likely, or rare, are based on
considerations on relationships of basin size, time of concentration, intensity, duration of
rainfall and frequency of events experienced in the country.

For earthquake-related hazards, earthquakes of magnitude 4.9-6.1 are assumed to affect
Hsas; magnitude 6.2-6.9 affect, both the Hsas and msas; while magnitude 7 and above
will affect all Hsa, msa, and lsa. the general assumption in earthquake-related hazards
is that Hsas are more frequented by earthquake-induced hazards, but of lower intensity
or magnitude. in low susceptible areas, hazards occur less frequently, but the magnitude
(or intensity) is higher. to illustrate, earthquakes occur frequently in the order of intensity
5 or lower. Earthquakes close to magnitude 7 (or higher) are rare; but can be strong and
damaging. the three range of values and intervals of earthquake magnitude were devised
based on groupings by thenhaus et. al., 1994 for various seismic zones in the country.

in the province of Surigao del Norte (i.e., high, moderate and low susceptibility). From
the map, the following can be observed:

• Municipalities of San Francisco, Malimono and Alegria have greater areas that

are highly susceptible to rain-induced landslides;

• Southeast portions of Sison have areas that are moderately susceptible to rain-

induced landslides;

• Municipality of Placer and Surigao City have greater areas that are least

susceptible to rain-induced landslides; and

• Areas with possible accumulation zones are areas that are likely to be affected

by transported landslide materials.

From these observations, the inventory can now be prepared.

1.2 Prepare hazard inventory matrix
Follow the format in Table 4.3. Indicate in the last two columns the levels of
susceptibility given in the hazard map and the areas covered. These High, Moderate,
and Low Susceptible Areas (HSAs, MSAs, LSAs) will be used later when assigning the
return period and computing for the risks.

Notice that the second to fourth columns derive their information from the hazard
map (i.e., source, scale and format/date/reference). These information are important
so that it would be easier to catalogue the maps and build the database later.

For maps in digital formats, list the following: source, datum/geographic reference,
projection, data file format (e.g., shape files, jpeg, etc). These information are
important so that maps can be viewed, and modified with several layers of information
under a geographic information system (GIS). The risk assessment procedures
described in these Guidelines are GIS-based (see Annex 6 for details).

the Hazards mapping and assessment for Effective Community-Based disaster risk
management, or the rEadY project, produces maps at a 1:50,000 scale for earthquake or
volcanic hazards and a 1:10,000 scale for floods and rain-induced landslides. rEadY maps
indicate the susceptibility of the area to a given hazard. in the absence of rEadY maps, use
similar hazard maps prepared by mandated agencies. However, hazard maps need to be
revalidated by the mandated agencies as to their accuracy and limitations.

maps produced prior to the rEadY project may have different formats from maps under
the rEadY project; however, they would more likely have the same content but may require
updates from their source agencies. For areas without hazard maps, assistance in production
should be requested from mandated agencies.

ndCC-oCd serves as repository of the maps and resulting database.

2. ASSIGN RETuRN PERIOD FOR EACH HAzARD EvENT

The second important component of understanding what hazards affect a locality is to
know the frequency or how often hazards of a particular event occur in the region or
province. This will not only help anticipate or plan out an emergency response better
(at least for some hazards), but will also provide information on return periods which
is required to estimate risks.

Ideally, hazard maps should already contain information on return period, intensity,
magnitude and levels of susceptibility. However, hazard maps generated in the
Philippines, including those under the READY Project, include information on level

of susceptibility only. In the absence of this information, these Guidelines suggest
a methodology for estimating return period for volcanic/geologic hazards and for
hydrometeorologic hazards. Return periods for earthquake-related hazards could be
estimated depending on the location of a particular province but return period for
hydrometeorologic hazards are suggested default values.

note: Consult mandated hazard mapping agencies (i.e., pHivolCs, pagasa,
etc.) in assigning return period values specific to an area. the default values
are suggested values.

The return periods were estimated based on magnitude or intensity in the case of
geologic hazards, and frequency of occurrence in the case of hydrometeorologic
hazards. An elaboration on how these return periods were derived is in Annex 3.

In order to use the default values, which will be derived in the next section, the
following information should be available:

a.

Areas that fall under HSA, MSA, and LSA (which should be derived from the
hazard maps); and

b. Frequency of occurrence of hydrometeorologic or geologic hazards or

magnitude of earthquakes that affect the HSA, MSA, and LSA.

In most cases, however, item b) is not available. How then can one determine what
magnitude of earthquake affects the HSA, MSA, or LSA? How does one determine
how often rain-related hazards impact HSA, MSA, or LSA? The following steps will
help derive this information to be able to assign return periods.

2.1 Estimating Return Period for Earthquake-related Hazards
The return periods that will be assigned for the HSA, MSA, and LSA will depend on
the peak ground acceleration (PGA), most commonly known as the g value, and on the
earthquake zone generator or zone, nearest the area. The concept of g value and zones
is explained in Annex 3.

a.

Identify the g value of the province in Map 2, PGA Amplitude Map for Medium
Soil. For a region, analysis will be per province. It is assumed that the zone
where province is located is also the source of the earthquake.

Example: Surigao del Norte g value is 0.4

b. Using Table 4.4 identify the equivalent magnitude of the value (if g value is

greater than 0.21 or less than 0.36, use 0.36-0.53 g value).

c. Identify in which earthquake zone the province or region is located from Map
3, Seismic Zone Map. If the area overlaps within two or three seismic zones,
choose the zone which corresponds to higher return period (Table 4.5).

Example: Surigao del Norte is located in Zone 3.

d. Now that the magnitude for the province and the seismic zone are available,
look for the corresponding return period in Table 4.5. If the magnitude
overlaps in two ranges in Table 4.5, use the upper value in the magnitude
range.

Example: Surigao del Norte, located in Zone 3, and g value of 0.4 equivalent
to Magnitude 6.2-6.9 (Table 4.4). The corresponding return period therefore is
13.4.

Map 3 Seismic Source Zones of the Philippines

If the area comprises two susceptible areas HSA and MSA, the damage estimates
have to be done for both the areas. If the area comprises three susceptible areas, i.e.,
HSA, MSA, and LSA, the damage estimates should be done for these three areas. In
case of Surigao del Norte, the READY hazard map shows three susceptible areas thus
consequence analysis should include HSA, MSA, and LSA and using a corresponding
return period of 51.4 years.

To fill up the return period of the lower intensity hazard event, refer again to Table 4.5.
Using the upper value of the magnitude 6.1, the return period (Zone 3) is 5.

To fill up the return period of the higher intensity hazard event, refer again to Table
4.5. Using the upper value of the range Magnitude 7.3Ms<8.2, the return period (Zone
3) is 51.4.

2.2 Estimating Return Period for Volcanic Eruptions
Volcanic hazards arise from active and potentially active volcanoes in the Philippines.
Active volcanoes are those that erupted within historical times (within the last
600 years) such that, accounts of these eruptions have been documented. Further,
volcanoes that erupted within geological times (less than or equal to 10,000 years) are
also classified as active volcanoes. Potentially active volcanoes are morphologically
young looking but with no historical records of eruption. An inactive volcano has no
recorded eruptions in the last 10,000 years. Volcanic hazards may be coming from
various possible activities like those resulting from eruption: ash falls, ballistic bombs,
pyroclastic flow, subsidence, fissures, rolling incandescent rocks and other wind and
rain-induced movements, like ash curtains and lahars.

Based on information from ndCC-oCd and pHivolCs, some volcanic activities have longer
return periods. iriga volcano in Camarines sur only had a single eruption since 1628, which
makes it 380 years dormant. mt. Banahaw in Quezon, laguna has only erupted once since
1730, which makes it 278 years dormant. mt. pinatubo had erupted in 1991 after more than
600 years of dormancy.

there were 52 recorded eruptions (1616-2006) from mt. mayon in albay, Bicol region. mt.
Bulusan, in the same region recorded about 15 eruptions with the latest in 2006-2007. mt.
Kanlaon in negros oriental has shown regular volcanic activities from mild to strong eruption
at least once in a decade. taal volcano in Batangas had 33 eruptions with the latest in 1977.

Using the definition of active volcanoes as the condition to identify rare events,
the matrix shown in Table 4.7 is divided into frequent (300 years and below), likely
(300-600 years) and rare (above 600 years). The assignment of the return period and
the coverage of susceptible areas will depend on specific areas where volcanoes are
located, as earlier described. Compared to hydrometeorologic hazards, the susceptible
areas under volcanic hazards are typically more confined near the source of eruption.

2.3 Estimating Return Period for Hydrometeorologic Hazards
In flood maps, areas may be defined simply as susceptible and not susceptible. In
this case, a return period will be assigned to the susceptible area. Other rain-induced
hazards have three defined susceptible areas.

Rainfall distributions as recorded in available Rainfall Intensity Duration Frequency
(RIDF) tables such as for Surigao del Norte as shown in Table 4.8 were used to guide
in developing return period intervals.

In the rainfall intensity duration frequency table shown, the highest rainfall intensity
(in mm/hr) occurs in short durations (e.g., 5 min, 120 min) while low intensity rainfall
occurs over longer durations (e.g., 12 hrs, 24 hrs). Further, it is noted in the RIDF
table that the intensity of rainfall (mm/hr) increases with increase in return periods
(25 yrs, 50 yrs, 100 yrs).

a. For flood hazards, when the duration of the rainfall is equal or longer than the

travel time of surface flow water from the farthest point up until an outlet point
(e.g., a downstream point), most areas of the drainage area contributes to the
peak flow. In big drainage areas, longer duration rainfall creates this condition,
while in smaller drainage areas, short duration but intense rainfall can produce
this condition. As the event becomes rarer (i.e., higher return period of say 25,
50 or more years), the volume of rain increases and flood volume increases
and reaches wider areas. Hence, we initially assign smaller rainfall return

periods (below 10 yrs) with smaller drainage areas (e.g., urban drainage areas,
100 hectares or so) as HSA in hazard maps where higher flood flows can be
expected, and higher return periods (above 10 years) to cover wider areas
defined by all susceptible areas, i.e., HSA, MSA, and LSA. This size may vary
from 100 hectares to flood plain sizes 10,000 hectares and beyond (Ponce).
b. For rain-induced landslides, the return period depends on the return period
of rainfall and site conditions. Steep slopes are more susceptible than those
areas with moderately steep slopes or flat terrain. Nonetheless, 150 to 200
millimeters of rainfall per day, in general, may be enough to trigger landslides,
based on an investigation by PHIVOLCS and PAGASA.

c. An intense, short duration rainfall is likely to create landslides in HSAs; and
longer duration rainfall is likely to increase landslide occurrences in wider
areas (i.e., MSA and LSA).

1/ the figures for geologic hazards except volcanic eruptions are for surigao del norte. Each province should compute for their return periods based on their g value and
zone, as described in these guidelines.

2/ these are only applicable to areas prone to flooding as reflected in flood susceptibility maps or flood hazard maps. it will be up to the planner to assess flooding in the area
based on past occurrences to determine whether they are frequent or likely events with the corresponding return period of ≤10 or >10, respectively. in the computations for
surigao del norte, where floods are likely events, a return period of 100 years was used.

Objective: given the hazard characteristics (type, intensity, frequency), estimate the

consequence in terms of fatality and property damage.

Output/s: Estimated fatality and damage to property (in tabular and map forms) per

hazard

Process: the working equations for Consequence Analysis are:

For estimating fatality: CF=PAPÎ FF

where CF = consequence in terms of fatality per hazard event (fatality/event)
PAP = potentially affected population
FF = factor for fatality

For estimating property damage: CPrD=PAPrÎFPrD

where CPrD = consequence in terms of cost of property damage per hazard

(php/event)

PAPr = potentially affected property
FPrD = factor for property damage

1. determine the potentially affected elements (PAP and PAPr) for every hazard (e.g., flood) and

corresponding hazard event (e.g., 5-year flood, 10-year flood, 50-year flood).

2. Compute for the consequence in terms of fatality and cost of property damage per hazard

event by multiplying the potentially affected elements (PAP and PAPr) and the factors.

3. Step 2 is repeated for other hazard events. and, the entire iteration (steps #1 and #2) is

repeated for other hazards.

In hazard characterization, one is able to know what hazards affect a region or
province, where, and how often. The next step is to know who and what are affected,
or the elements at risk.

Elements at risk refer to the population, aggregated built-up areas (residential and
nonresidential) and agricultural areas. These elements at risk formed the bases of the
estimation of fatality and cost of property damage.

The use of aggregated groups (e.g., population instead of families and land use
categories, such as built up areas instead of individual buildings or household plots)
are deemed sufficient for framework planning, and more detailed sets of information
will be needed for city or municipal planning.

For each hazard event, two parameters are calculated in the consequence analysis: (1)
the potentially affected elements (i.e., potentially affected population for estimation of
fatality and potentially affected properties for estimation of property damage); and (2)
the estimated loss (i.e., fatality and cost of property damage).

use of gis software is suggested since the processing may be tedious; however,
presentation herein shows how computations may be done through spreadsheets.

1. DETERMINE THE POTENTIAlly AFFECTED ElEMENTS

1.1 Determine the Potentially Affected Population (PAP)

a. Compute for the population density of the concerned region or province.

Density is computed by dividing the total population by the total land area.
The latest NSO population census data should be used to allow for aggregation
of figures in higher level plans. Locally-generated data may be used, but the
Guidelines make use of official population counts. In any case, do not forget to
indicate the source of data.

For regional plans, the municipality is the basic unit of analysis while the
barangay is used as the unit of analysis for provincial plans. The working table
for this exercise is as follows:

b. Prepare the population density map.
This map is produced by overlaying the administrative boundary map which contains
the size of each municipality or barangay, and the population map which contains the
number of person per unit area (sq km) in each administrative unit.

For consistency, it is encouraged that the administrative boundary map (at 1:50,000
scales) of NAMRIA be used. At the minimum, regional map scales of 1:250,000 and
provincial map scales of 1:50,000 are sufficient for analysis.

c. Determine the Potentially Affected Population (PAP) for every hazard
Potentially affected population will be calculated based on the intersection of the
overlays of the hazard map and the population density map. The table prepared
for assigning the return period may also be combined. The specific activities are as
follows:

(i) Overlay the population density map on a hazard map. The intersections in

the composite map will indicate the affected areas for each susceptibility level
(HSA, MSA, LSA), as well as how many people are potentially affected by the
hazard in each of the three levels of susceptibility;

(ii) Following the format in Table 4.12, calculate the size of the area that fall under

HSA, MSA, and LSA and reflect the figures in columns F, G, and H;

(iii) Calculate the potentially affected population (PAP) for each hazard event by

multiplying the population density of all municipality or barangay (depending
on the unit of analysis), and the size of the area affected in HSA, MSA, and
LSA.
•

for a Frequent hazard event, the PAP is the product of the size of the HSA
(column F) and the population density (column E);
for a Likely hazard event, the PAP is the product of the size of both HSA,
MSA (columns F + G) and the population density (column E); and
for a Rare hazard event, the PAP is the product of the size of HSA, MSA
and LSA (columns F + G + H) and the population density (column E).

•

•

(iv) Repeat steps b) and c) for all other hazards. A table of potentially affected
population, PAP, should be produced per each type of hazard. Mapping for
potentially affected population may be helpful for visualizing its spatial
distribution.

1.2 Determine the Potentially Affected Property (PAPr) for each type of hazard
The potentially affected property is estimated indirectly using the value established for
each land use category. Under this approach, each land use category will be assigned a
value reflecting the cost of replacing the lost asset or property.

The land area per municipality planted with specific crops has to be determined. If
the total land area in a province devoted for a crop type is known but its distribution
across municipalities is unknown, a proportionality factor equal to the ratio of land
area of the municipality to the provincial area may be used.

a. Prepare a property valuation table to establish the unit cost of each property

category, i.e., built-up areas, agricultural areas.

The numbers in Table 4.13 serve as proxy values to estimate replacement costs
for properties in the different land uses in Surigao del Norte. They are further
explained in Annex 4. Each province is expected to come up with its own
estimates.

For example, in the case of Surigao City, rice, corn, fruits, coffee and cacao and fruits
were the main annual crops planted and harvested. However, only provincial data
for areas planted to fruits, coffee and cacao are available. Thus, the share of Surigao
City area to Surigao del Norte was computed at 260.41 hectares/ 2,017,000 hectares
or 0.000129. This serves as the proportionality factor. This factor is to be multiplied to
the province’s area planted to each crop to get the area planted for Surigao City. The
derived values are shown in Table 4.14.

The unit cost for built up areas (PhP7,509/sqm) was based on the average cost of
building construction per unit floor area in Surigao del Norte as provided by NSO
for 2007.

The unit cost for agricultural areas was computed using the cost of producing crops
(Tables A4.8 to A4.11 in Annex 4). About 90,000 hectares (BAS, 2007) were devoted
to coconut in Surigao Del Norte; however, it was not included here since coconut is a
perennial crop and its growth stages vary across areas. It was assumed that impact by
floods and rainfall induced landslides are indirect damages.

Municipal distribution of root crops and vegetables and fruits, coffee and cacao were
not available. Their aggregated harvest areas (provincial) were estimated to be about
3,956 hectares.

The built-up area is approximated by the floor areas comprising the

total floor area (TFA) of construction for all type of buildings, generally
categorized as residential floor area (RFA) and nonresidential floor area
(NRFA).

The residential floor areas (RFA) reflect a composite floor area comprising
different types of residential construction covering single detached, duplex
type/quadruplex, apartment, accessoria, residential condominium and
other buildings with related functions. The nonresidential building floor
areas (NRFA) reflect a composite floor area comprising different types of
residential construction commercial areas, industrial areas, institutional and
agricultural buildings and others. Table 4.15 is the working table.

• Overlay hazard map with the land use map. The intersections in the map
overlay would represent the affected areas in each susceptible area (HSA,
MSA, LSA), as illustrated in table below.

In Table 4.16, the area values in column (2) represent the smaller built-up
areas in Surigao City obtained in a land use cover map. When added up
(3.85 sq km), it amounts to the total built-up area in Surigao City. It may be
possible that not all built-up areas in a municipality are affected by a hazard.
In the example below, only built-up areas 3 and 4 were affected. The overlay
will show you if built-up areas 3 and 4 are under HSA, MSA, or LSA. The
size of the built-up areas within the susceptible areas must be estimated. This
would vary under a GIS platform but would need approximation in a manual
alternative.

However, since not the whole of built-up areas 3 and 4 have existing structures
or buildings, the share of the TFA in these areas must be obtained. For
example,

Built-up area 3 = (0.29/3.85) x 1.04 = 0.08 sq km

2. COMPuTE FOR THE CONSEquENCE IN TERMS OF fatality AND cost of

property damage

No matter how strong a hazard is, it will not be strong enough to wipe out the
entire population, or destroy all structures in the region or province. Even in High
Susceptible Areas, only a portion of the structures will be damaged.

Having computed for the potentially affected population and potentially affected
property in the region or province, the next step is to know what proportion of that
population will die, or what percentage of all properties will actually be damaged
from a hazard event. The operational question is: If flood happens in the province,
how many will likely die? Or, in an earthquake of Magnitude 6, how much damage to
property will be incurred?

2.1 Compute for Consequence of Fatality
The equation for estimating fatality is:

CF=PAP

ÎFF

where CF = consequence in terms of fatality per hazard event (fatality/

hazard)

PAP = potentially affected population
FF = factor for fatality

a. Following the format in Table 4.20, multiply the potentially affected population
obtained in step 1, with the factor for fatality. Note that the unit of analysis for
consequence of fatality is the barangay.

The factor for fatality is a multiplier from 0 to 1 that indicates a proportion of
the total affected population that has the probability of dying as a consequence
of a hazard event of a specific magnitude.

The factor for fatality can be obtained using a series of matrices developed for
these Guidelines (see Table 4.21 to Table 4.25). The factors were developed
based on hazard event exposures of the country and serve to provide indicative
estimates of the “proportion” of fatalities out of the total population affected by
a hazard event. Annex 5 explains in detail how these factors were derived.

In GIS, the computation can be done by using the SELECT/QUERY and
MULTIPLICATION functions. The QUERY is meant to identify areas in which
the factor for fatality is applied. See Annex 6 for details.

other hazard types, represents the likely event; the third row, magnitude of > 7.0 for
earthquake- related hazards and rare for the other hazard types, represents the rare
event.

a. Following the format in Table 4.26, multiply the potentially affected property

with the factor for property damage. Note that the unit of analysis for
consequence of property damage is the subarea affected in the municipality.

The factor for fatality is premised on the principle that highly dense areas will have
higher fatality as compared to less dense areas. Therefore, the factors will be dependent
on the population density of an area. If the population density of an area is less than 250
persons per sq km, the third column should be used. For areas with density of 250 to
500 persons per sq km, the fourth column will provide the factor. And the last column
is used for areas with population density of more than 500 persons per sq km.

To the extent feasible, local data/value (especially local historical loss data) must be
used to refine the factors. In the revisions of the factors, mandated agencies should
be consulted, e.g., NDCC-OCD and their Regional and Local Disaster Coordinating
Councils.

2.2 Consequence in terms of property damage
The working equation for estimating property damage is:

CPrD=PAPr

ÎFPrD

where CPrD = consequence in terms of cost of property damage per

hazard (PhP/hazard)

PAPr = potentially affected property ( PhP of affected area)
FPrD = factor for property damage

the factor for property damage can be obtained using the series of matrices developed for
these guidelines. similar with the approach used for factor for fatality, the factor for property
damage was developed to allow for the estimation of the probable “proportion” of properties
damaged by a hazard event. given that the factors are determined from event damages
without disaggregation of each component areas, the numbers are basically indicative.
annex 5 explains in detail how the factors were derived.

• If the property is in the HSA, write the factors for the frequent, likely and
rare corresponding to the value of the property in the table of factors.

• If the property is in the MSA, write the factors for likely and rare
corresponding to the value of the property in the table of factors.

• If the property is in the LSA, write only one factor.
• Property areas in HSA are affected by all events, areas in the MSA are

damaged by likely and rare events and areas in LSA are affected by rare
events.

Note that not all areas will be affected. For example, in Surigao City, only four
subareas were found to be in the different susceptible zones.

• For frequent hazard event, the consequence in terms of property damage is the
product of the property values in HSA area (column H) of Table 4.26 and the
factor (column K of Table 4.26).The results are shown in Column (N).

• For likely hazard event, the consequence in terms of property damage is the
product of individual property values in HSA and MSA areas (columns H
and I) of Table 4.26 multiplied by the property factor (column L Table 4-34).
as shown in column (O) of Table 4.26.

• For rare hazard event, the consequence in terms of property damage is the
product of the individual property values in HSA, MSA and LSA areas
(columns H, I and J) of Table 4.26 multiplied by the property factor (column
M of Table 4. 26) as shown in column (P) of Table 4.26.

• The CPrD of the individual subareas is obtained in each cell (N), (O), (P).
• The consequence of damage (CPrD) of the aggregated properties to a

municipality is obtained by adding vertically, the damages from frequent
(CPrD =sum column N), likely (CPrD= sum column O) and (CPrD =sum column
P) rare events.

b. Repeat procedure for all other areas and hazards. In GIS, the computation
can be done by using the series of SELECT/QUERY selection and
MULTIPLICATION commands. The SELECT/QUERY is done to choose the
particular event for which the factor of property damage is applicable. The
MULTIPLICATION is used in computing for CPrD . See Annex 6 for details.

valuing the various categories of the land uses to represent replacement costs.

The use of the factor is premised on the principle that areas with high property values
will have higher proportionate damages as compared to less valued areas. Therefore,
the factors will be dependent on the affected property value of an area.

tables 4.27 to 4.33 present the factors for property damage. if the property value of an
affected area is less than php10 million, the column (<10m) should be used. For affected
areas with properties in mid-range values (10 to 100 million), the fourth column provides the
factor. the last column is used for high value areas (more than php100 million in property).

the factors for damage for earthquake-related events are only applied to built- up areas. no
damage is assumed for agricultural areas. there are two sets of factors for property damage
under hydrometeorologic conditions, one for built-up areas and another for agricultural
areas.

damages are generally higher for agricultural areas arising from a wider coverage of floods.
given that in likely events, such as 25 -100 year floods, it may be assumed, as a first estimate,
that the crop areas suffer 100 percent loss. the rest of the factors are proportioned linearly.

similarly, landslide affects agricultural areas such as localized damage to fields of crops and
production forests. as a first estimate, loss is taken as 75 percent of the areas affected under
rare occurrences.

1/ these factors can be applied to provinces with similar g value as metro manila. refer to map 2. However, using this default value will overestimate for the provinces of
Cebu, Bohol, negros oriental and siquijor in region7 and provinces of Cagayan, isabela, and Quirino in region 2. Further the same default value will underestimate for the
provinces of davao, Compostela valley, and davao oriental in region 11 (.56 g value).

ideally, estimating the damage must be based on damage and loss functions developed or
used by other agencies (e.g., dpWH for critical infrastructures, da/pCiC, for crop damages).
the direct damages and losses that one obtains for a certain bounded area (say a Barangay,
municipality, province or region) are then aggregated to obtain the total value. to the extent
feasible, local data/value (especially local historical loss data) must be used to refine the
factors. in the revisions of the factors, mandated agencies should be consulted e.g., ndCC-
oCd and regional and local disaster Coordinating Councils.

damages to individual buildings or structures that arise from ground shaking come from the
interaction of the hazard magnitude (or intensity), exposure and a combination of factors
related to building characteristics and site conditions (e.g. material composition, ground
condition, among others) which determine their vulnerability. For aggregating damage
effects to an area, the damages of similar structures may be generalized to establish damage
functions relating magnitudes and probabilities with percentage damages with reference to
certain characteristics (e.g., building material and their behavior).

For example, studies and experts’ experience may reveal that masonry construction for
earthquake intensity X with a specified return period would experience 100 percent collapse,
and that for intensity iX, 20 percent collapse and 80 percent badly damaged; with reinforced
concrete (rC), new structures may survive collapse but old rC structures may not under
intensity X.

in terms of monetary loss, a function relating percent damage with repair costs or replacement
costs need to be determined. in case of loss of life, a loss function related to the damage
may need to be obtained or devised from simple rules defined by hazard and disaster risk
experts. For example, a collapse of a structure may be taken as resulting to loss of lives, while
varying degrees of damage may result to injuries. other considerations in the assessment of
damages and risks include temporal factors such as daytime or night time population being
exposed, preparedness aspects, building and structural codes used, quality of construction
(among others). it is important that these factors be considered in assessing risk reduction
from ground shaking impacts.

Compositing of different variables (e.g., structural types, materials used, configuration,
method of construction) to establish relationships of vulnerability, damage and loss with
different degrees of seismic hazard may need to be performed. this level of analysis may be
pursued through further studies.

C. riSK EStiMAtioN

Objective: to estimate the risk of the hazard in terms of fatality and property damage.
Output/s: Estimated risks of fatality and damage to property (in tabular and map forms)

per hazard.

Process: the working equations for Risk Estimation are:

For risk of fatality: RF= PÎCF

where RF = risk of fatality (fatality/year)
P = probability of occurrence of hazard event (the difference between

reciprocal of return periods of two incremental hazard events)

CF = consequence in terms of fatality per hazard event

For risk of property damage: RPrD= PÎCPrD

where RPrD = risk of property damage (php/year)
P

= probability of occurrence of hazard event (the difference between
reciprocal of return periods of two incremental hazard events)

CPrD = consequence in terms of cost of property damage per hazard

the procedure is:

event

1. get data on return period from frequency analysis in the hazard characterization step.
2. get data on estimated fatality and property damage per hazard event from consequence

analysis.

3. Compute for risk in terms of fatality and property damage.
4. repeat process for other hazards.

With the results of the frequency and consequence analysis available, risk estimation
can now be performed. In principle, the risk is obtained by multiplying the probability
of occurrence and the consequence.

In terms of fatality or loss of life, the Guidelines use the barangay as the area of
analysis at the provincial level since the barangay is the smallest administrative unit
with population data. This will enable the planner to pinpoint in greater detail (vis-à-
vis municipal or provincial level data) the population exposed to risk. As regards the
property damage, these have been computed at the municipal level.

The last stage of the DRA process is risk prioritization across municipalities. The
weighted average risk of fatality for a municipality will be computed using barangay
risk estimates weighted against the ratio of the barangay area to the municipality area.

The calculation of risk at a geographic level assumes that the contributions of all
events (or hazards) are additive.

Note that risk estimates are calculated for all the levels of hazard events (e.g., 5-year
flood, 25-year flood, etc.). The total risk for a hazard (e.g., flood) is the sum of the
risks from all of the hazard events considered (frequent, likely, rare). Finally, the total
risk is the sum of risks from all hazards. This principle is illustrated below.

zone, as described in these guidelines.

2/ these are only applicable to areas prone to flooding as reflected in flood susceptibility maps or flood hazard maps. it will be up to the planner to assess flooding in the area
based on past occurrences to determine whether they are frequent or likely events with the corresponding return period of ≤10 or >10, respectively. in the computations for
surigao del norte, where floods are likely events, a return period of 100 years was used.

3. COMPuTE FOR RISk IN TERMS OF FATAlITy AND PROPERTy DAMAGE.

3.1 Risk of Fatality
The working equation for estimating risk of fatality is:

RF=PÎCF

where RF = risk of fatality (fatality/year)
P = probability of occurrence of hazard event (the difference
between reciprocal of return periods of two incremental
hazard events)

CF = consequence in terms of fatality per hazard event

The first step is to transpose columns O, P and Q of Table 4.34 from row data to
column data and add a column on return period and another column for probability of
occurrence (or the inverse of the return period). The risk of fatality is then computed
(product of the consequence and probability of occurrence) and the results are placed
in the last column. Table 4.36 reflects the process.

The risk of fatality, RF is the product of consequence (CF) of the higher event and the
difference between reciprocal of return periods of two incremental hazard events
(i.e., difference in the probabilities of occurrence of frequent and likely hazard events
and that of likely and rare hazard events). This difference in probabilities is further
explained in Annex 2.

The risk of fatality for each barangay would be the sum of the risk for frequent, likely
and rare events. Thus, for Barangay Taft, its total risk for fatality/year is
0.20590+.05792 = 0.26382.

The risk of fatality for a municipality is the weighted average of risks of all barangay
using the area (of the barangay) as the “weights”. As seen in Table 4.37, the barangay
risk is multiplied with its individual area. The sum of the products is divided by the
municipality area to obtain a municipal risk, i.e., 2.433 x 10-1/ 39.31 = 6.189 x10-3
fatality/year for the municipality of Tubod.

3.2 Risk of Property Damage
The working equation for estimating risk of property damage under these Guidelines is:

RPrD = PÎCPrD

where RPrD = risk of property damage (PhP/year)
P

= probability of occurrence of hazard event (the difference
between reciprocal of return periods of two incremental
hazard events)

CPrD = consequence in terms of cost of property damage per

hazard event

The first step is to transpose columns N, O and P of Table 4.26 from row data to
column data and add a column on return period and another column for probability of
occurrence (or the inverse of the return period). The risk of property damage is then
computed (product of the consequence and probability of occurrence) and the results
are placed in the last column. Table 4.38 reflects the process.

The risk of the property damage for each subarea would be the sum of the risk values
obtained in last column.The risks to other subareas are similarly computed. The risk of
property damage to a municipality is aggregated from the risks from these individual
areas.

For example, for the affected built-up areas of Surigao City, the total risk would be
from two areas: RPrD =2,401,378.2 + 1,889,459.5 = PhP4,290,837.70/yr.

4. REPEAT PROCESS FOR OTHER HAzARDS

The entire process shall be repeated for all other hazards and for both risk of fatality
and risk of property damage. The final results should tally with the number of hazards
characterized, e.g., if three hazards were characterized, three sets of risk estimates
should be obtained (or, three risk estimates for fatality and three risk estimates for
property damage).

In addition, in computing for the total risk, due care must be undertaken to avoid
“double counting” of fatality or property damage. In order to avoid this error, a
correction should be applied to the total risk (i.e., the sum of the several risks).

In areas of the barangay where the two or more hazard maps overlap (i.e., intersection
of the hazard maps), the lesser of the figure(s) should be deducted from the total risk.
The summary table for the risk estimates shall be as indicated in Table 4.39 and Table
4.40. Risk maps are shown in the succeeding pages.

D. riSK prioritizAtioN

Objective: Based on risk estimates, determine priority areas and assess vulnerability of

these priority areas (micro vulnerability analysis).

Output/s: maps and summary tables of priority areas based on a composite score.

Process:

1. determine “priority score” for each municipality.

• Determine risk prioritization score for fatality.
• Compute for the proportion of damaged property and determine risk prioritization

score for property damage.

• Combine prioritization scores for fatality and property damage to obtain the composite

prioritization score.

2. assess vulnerability of sectors

• On population
• On social infrastructures
• On service infrastructures
• On transport and access
• On economy
• On environment

The main objective of risk prioritization is to determine which areas should be
given attention considering the extent of risks in the area as quantified through risk
estimates.

To enrich the risk prioritization process, further vulnerability assessments (based
on the various planning sectors) are taken in conjunction with the risk ranking
exercise. In particular, further vulnerability (i.e., social, economic, infrastructure and
environment related aspects) analysis is undertaken for high risk areas.

Vulnerability and exposure aspects of infrastructure include utilities (e.g., solid waste,
power, water, and sewerage), road network and transport system of significance to the
province or region.

Here, focus is on strategic utilities, economic activities (e.g., main industries, mining),
services that are critical to regional and provincial development (e.g., roads, power

plants, airport). This may be done also for areas where critical buildings and activities
are located, (e.g., government center, ecozones) or where critical resources are located
(e.g., watersheds and its subareas).

1. DETERMINE “PRIORITy SCORE” FOR EACH MuNICIPAlITy

1.1 Determine risk prioritization score for fatality
Having completed the risk estimation step, risks in terms of fatality are computed per
barangay and municipality and risks in terms of property damage at the municipal
level are obtained. The following steps will provide the method of combining
the various risk estimates to obtain a prioritization using composite scores. The
computations of risk of fatality reflected in Table 4.39, for rain-induced landslide for
Surigao del Norte will be used to illustrate the process. Table 4.41 will be used as
prioritization criteria for risk of fatality.

1.2 Determine risk prioritization score based on property damage
A threshold refers to a value above which priorities should already indicate
nontolerance, specifically, for risks to property damage. In these Guidelines the
threshold value shall be adopted from the NDCC concept of declaring disaster /
calamity in the Philippines.

“a state of calamity may be declared, through a resolution, by the sangguniang
panlalawigan (provincial legislative council) or the sangguniang panglungsod/Bayan (city/
municipal legislative council) of an local government unit (lgu) when there is an
epidemic or at least two or more of the following conditions apply for at least four days:

• 20 percent of the population are affected and in need of assistance, or 20 percent of
the dwelling units have been destroyed;
• A great number or at least 40 percent of the means of livelihood such as bancas
(small wooden boats used for fishing and transport), vehicles and the like are destroyed;
and
• Major roads and bridges are destroyed and impassable for at least a week, thus
disrupting the flow of transport and commerce.”

For Column (F), if risk exceeds the 20 percent threshold value, a score of 3 is
provided and taken as urgent; otherwise, a score of 2 is given and is taken as
priority.

Damage on built-up areas exceeding millions of pesos may be found in
Malimono, San Francisco, Tubod, Alegria, Surigao City but none of them meet
the 20 percent of residential property value threshold. These areas are taken as
priority. Note however, that there could still be further screening of areas after
field validation of actual conditions in the area.

For purposes of risk prioritization under these Guidelines, the following thresholds are
adopted:

b. Prioritize Affected Agricultural Areas

• 20 percent of the dwelling units have been destroyed will be taken as 20

percent of the residential floor area value.

• Widespread destruction of fishponds, crops, poultry and livestock, and other

agricultural products will be interpreted as damage amounting to 40 percent of
agricultural crop values.

a. Prioritize Affected Built-Up Areas

Table 4.43 presents all built-up areas in Surigao del Norte affected by rain-
induced landslides. In column (B) the risk computed earlier (Table 4.40) is
reflected. In column (D), reflect the product of column (C) x 5,534 PhP/sq m
(unit value of residential structures presented in Table 4.13) and 20 percent.
Source of Column (C) is Table A4.7 in Annex 4. Reflect the percentage in
column (E) by dividing values of column (B) by column (D).

The yearly estimate of the damage is compared with 20 percent values.

Table 4.44 presents all agricultural land areas in Surigao del Norte affected by
rainfall-induced landslides. Column (B) reflects the risk to agricultural areas
from Table 4.40 while column (C), reflects the value of affected agricultural
areas.

In column (D), reflect the product of column (C) and the threshold value of 40
percent. Similarly, reflect the percentage in column (E) by dividing values of
column (B) by column (D). Give risk scores based on these values.

For Column (F), if risk exceeds the 40 percent threshold value, a score of 3 is
provided and taken as urgent; otherwise, a score of 2 is given and is taken as
priority.

Table 4.44 reveal that the municipalities of San Francisco, Placer, Malimono,
Bacuag, Claver and Surigao City are priority areas although they did not
exceed the suggested 40 percent threshold value for agricultural areas. Even

1/ the values are computed by multiplying the area of affected agricultural lands by the value derived from tables 4.13 and 4.14 (sample for surigao City) and the area of
affected agricultural lands in table 4.19 applying the necessary conversions.

so, the risks presented in column (B) may be significant to the province
considering that these run in millions per year. A 5-year aggregate of potential
losses for Malimono will be about PhP22 million pesos.

The numbers are simply estimates and past records on natural disaster losses
may help confirm the values shown.

1.3 Combine prioritization scores for fatality and property damage to obtain the
composite prioritization score
This is the last step to rank and prioritize areas based on the previous scores on fatality
and damages. Here a composite score will be obtained to help identify municipalities
where further vulnerability assessments will be made.

a. Copy the scores for risk of fatality in Table 4.42 and risk of property damage

from the last columns of Tables 4.43 and 4.44 on built-up areas and agricultural
areas, respectively, under the headings in Table 4.45.

b. To prioritize municipalities based on property and crop loss and risk to life,

obtain a composite score by adding the scores in columns (B), (C), and (D) and
reflect in column (E) of Table 4.45. In column (F), indicate priorities following
the rules:

Composite Scores for Prioritization
scores of 7 and above: urgent
scores of 4 to 6: high priority

2. ASSESS vulNERABIlITy OF SECTORS

Having prioritized the areas, further identify, describe, and assess vulnerability of
sectors in high risk municipalities or contiguous/cluster of municipalities identified as
urgent or high priority.

At this stage, the “how and why” some sectors (or its components) are more at risk
than others with respect to a hazard should be understood and factors that contribute
to the vulnerability need to be revealed so that appropriate DRR measures and PPAs
are proposed.

Table 4.46 provides a list of these factors and their indicators. A map of these elements
at risks overlain in hazard maps or risk maps will help visualize the exposures of these
specific sectors. See Maps 12 and 13.

hazards

site conditions (e.g., number, being in a catchment area, poor
drainage, distance from a hazard source or path -i.e., fault line, 4 km
eruption zone) which create the unsafe conditions of these areas

The assessment should not end with a mere inventory of existing mitigation measures
and organizations with hazard mitigation responsibility. It should also help in
understanding why certain policies may or may not be effective at mitigating hazards.

For example, extending public facilities into hazard-prone areas may attract more
people to settle or promote activities in these areas. These increase the exposure of
populations and hence weaken mitigation efforts.

The placement of levees as a flood mitigating structure provides a false sense of
security to those immediately behind the structure. The levees in fact serve only to
protect up to a certain depth (or design return period) of water and runs the risk
of meeting higher return periods or stronger events for which the levee may fail.
Development behind the levees may pose greater risk without regulation of land use/
development.

The assessment should also help identify areas where no policy exists and therefore
new policies are needed to reduce current and future risks of hazards.

In the table, the risk issues are listed based on the quantification of risks (i.e.,
estimated number of fatalities per year and potential damage costs) of affected
areas or clusters. A summary of the risk scores for each hazard helps determine
the priority areas. Further assessment of the conditions and factors contributing to
the vulnerability of high risk areas help explain the impact of hazards to an area’s
development and physical arrangements. The table provides the basis for DRR
interventions to reduce risk and vulnerabilities.

The outputs of the DRA are the following:

Inventory of hazards that affect the planning area;

•
• Estimates of risks for each hazard type;
• Risk maps derived from the hazard maps;
• Overlays of important facilities on risk maps;
•
• List of priority areas/Prioritization map for risk reduction focusing on areas
with high estimates of fatalities/year and cost of damages/year using the
procedures described in these Guidelines.

Mainstreaming Risk Assessment
Results in the Plan

120 MAINSTREAMING DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN SUBNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND LAND USE/PHYSICAL PLANNING IN THE PHILIPPINES

Mainstreaming Risk Assessment Results in the Plan

T

his chapter shows how the results of disaster risk assessment are utilized
to enhance the outputs of the various phases of the plan formulation
process. The main purpose for mainstreaming disaster risk assessment is
to determine high risk areas and the conditions that contribute to the risks or to
their vulnerabilities. From there, disaster risk reduction principles and measures are
incorporated into development goals, objectives, strategies and programs, projects
and activities (PPAs).

These Guidelines supplement the Guidelines on Provincial/Local Planning and
Expenditure Management (PLPEM), particularly Volume 2 on the formulation of
the Provincial Development and Physical Framework Plan (PDPFP). The context,
coverage, outline and planning logic of the PDPFP are thus adopted.

121

The procedure for mainstreaming results of the disaster risk assessment into the plan
include the following steps: (a) analysis of the risk impact to the land use and physical

objectives and targets; (c) specifying disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures in the

A. ANALYSiS of tHE riSK iMpACt to tHE LAND uSE AND

pHYSiCAL frAMEWorK

Objective: to ascertain the relevance and significance of the identified risk issues and

concerns to the planned development of the region/province.

Output: an enhanced/revised land use and physical planning framework

Process: From the high risk areas and vulnerabilities derived from risk evaluation, analyze
how these might affect the land use and physical framework

the worksheet below may be used:

Risk Evaluation

Hazard

single or
multihazard

Risk Estimates and High
Risk Areas

numbers in terms of
fatalities and damages to
property

ranking and prioritization
of areas at risk

vulnerabilities

Example:

urban center is located in a
high risk area

poor condition of roads
and bridges

(see Chapter 4 on the
identification of risk and
vulnerability factors, and
annex 7 on characteristics
of resilience)

Implications

What are the implications
to the land use and
physical Framework? (e.g.,
identification of alternate
urban center, and the
corresponding economic
activities)

identification of alternate
transport routes or maintain
present routes but rehabilitate
or improve them

The boxed illustration above shows how the risk estimates are used to enhance
planning analyses. In general, the risk analysis becomes more meaningful if it is
evaluated vis-à-vis its implications to the development framework of the province or
region.

In the case of Surigao del Norte, development strategies are based on the province’s
comparative advantages and the potentials of clusters of municipalities (see Figure
5.1).

The following queries can thus be made: Given the results of the risk analysis, should
an existing development strategy still be pursued? What changes can be made so as to
still pursue this development strategy?

These questions may be answered by:

a.

b.

c.

Considering options to avoid high risk areas and transferring settlements
and service functions to safer or relatively lower risk areas. This may also
necessitate redefining the roles and functions of the settlement or development
clusters and the resulting land uses. The alteration of roles and functions imply
corresponding changes in service and facility requirements which aim to
ensure that attendant risks are reduced;
Allowing the improvement of the physical and economic interactions within
and among key development areas and clusters, even the linkages of areas
outside the province (i.e., neighboring provinces, regional hierarchy, and
national system); and
Determining the impact of disaster risks on the socioeconomic conditions of
the area, particularly on the fragilities of key elements at risk.

Cases from the DRR-enhanced plans prepared under the National Economic and
Development Authority – United Nations Development Programme – European
Commission (NEDA-UNDP-EU) Technical Assistance on Mainstreaming Disaster
Risk Management in Subnational Development and Land Use/Physical Planning
illustrate these points.

CASE 1: ClAvER-GIGAquIT-BACuAG DEvElOPMENT CluSTER IN SuRIGAO DEl
NORTE

Risk Estimates and High Risk Areas

vulnerabilities

Risk Evaluation

Barangay poblacion of Bacuag is most
susceptible to all the four hazards
having an estimated fatality ranging
from 1 or more in 10 persons to 1 to
10 fatalities in 1000 persons a year.
the other 7 urban barangays and 25
rural barangays are also exposed to
the hazards.

the estimated property damage due
to flooding:
Claver - php6.6 million
Bacuag - php6.1 million
gigaquit - php2.8 million

about 80.22 sq km of prime
agricultural areas are prone to
flooding. another 198.94 sq km
of land are estimated to be with
high susceptibility to rain-induced
landslide. Coastal communities prone
to flooding are also exposed to storm
surge.

prime agricultural areas are
susceptible to flooding. these
are low-lying areas which require
adequate drainage to minimize
overflow of run-offs to the urban
center.

almost all areas in gigaquit are
planted to rice; about 40 percent
in Bacuag and a small portion of
Claver are susceptible to flooding.

portions of settlement areas in
this cluster that are susceptible to
flooding are also exposed to storm
surge.

areas suitable to mixed farming
and agroforestry are susceptible to
rain-induced landslide, portions of
which are in Claver where there are
mining activities.

Implications

the risks (as revealed by
estimates on fatalities and
property damage) could
considerably disrupt the
cluster’s economic activities
when a disaster occurs since
it plays a significant role in
rice, coconut and aquaculture
production and mining.

the goal of Claver to become
a large town may be imperiled
by its susceptibility to flooding
as this may discourage
investments.

the risks could mean loss of
income to majority of families
as the primary source of
income is farming. secondary
sources of income are mining
and mining-related services.

Risk Evaluation

Risk Estimates and High Risk Areas

vulnerabilities

Butuan City ranks 1 in terms of
risks to fatalities and damages to
properties in 4 out of the 5 hazards
(except storm surge);

surigao City ranks 1 in terms of
fatality risks from storm surges,
second in terms of risks to flooding,
and ranks 3 in ground rapture risks;
and

Bislig City ranks 1 in terms of
risks to property damages from
storm surges, second in terms of
liquefaction and ground rapture
risks, and 8 in terms of flooding risks.

the three cities are
the most populated
areas in the region;
socioeconomic
conditions are
characterized by high
poverty incidence, poor
health and nutrition
status, and other
aggravating conditions
that contribute to the
already high exposure to
risks and may result to
greater negative impact
when disasters happen.

Implications

the high risks and vulnerabilities of
the three cities adversely affect their
roles:

Butuan City as regional center and
major trading, processing, commercial
and service center of Caraga, also
the show window of history and
culture in mindanao;

surigao City as commercial and
trading center in the pacific rim of the
region, special zone for mineral-based
industries; and

Bislig City as the agri-forestry and
aquamarine processing center and
agri-industrial center.

CASE 3: IlOCOS REGION

Table 5.3 Risk Impact to the Land Use and Physical Framework: Region 1

Hazard

rain-
induced
landslides,
earthquake-
induced
landslides,
liquefaction

Risk Evaluation

Risk Estimates and High
Risk Areas

more than half of the
region’s total lands are at risk
to rain-induced landslides
(58%) and earthquake-
induced landslides (52%)
which may result to some
php23 million and php181
million of property damage,
respectively.

While only one-fifth of the
area is prone to liquefaction,
this hazard accounts for
74 percent of the risks
attributed to the three
hazards. the urban areas are
at greater risks with property
damage amounting to some
php667 million or 85 percent
of the total damages that
may occur.

vulnerabilities

areas susceptible to rain- or
earthquake-induced landslides
are those with steep slopes
particularly in mountainous
municipalities abutting the
Cordillera and the Zambales
mountain ranges. most of the
at-risk uplands communities are
poor, and where socioeconomic
conditions are relatively worse
than their lowland counterparts.
the susceptibility of the areas are
worsened where the forest and
vegetative covers are degraded
and where kaingin is commonly
practiced. areas prone to
liquefaction, on the other hand,
are mostly those areas located in
the flood plains of major rivers
and where soil conditions make
them more vulnerable to this
type of hazard (see Figure 5.4).

Implications

the more problematic susceptible areas
are those having strategic roles in the
regional hierarchy of settlements or those
considered as key growth centers (KgC) and
identified as having relatively larger highly
susceptible areas to the hazards (area
figures shown are in sq km):

kGC Area
alaminos 6.09
narvacan 2.77
agoo 1.59
Candon 0.93
san Fernando 0.45

vulnerability assessment for the KgCs and
their satellite municipalities and influence
areas should be undertaken to specifically
identify their socioeconomic fragilities and
pinpoint vulnerable situations which will
be the basis of specifying corresponding
responses and interventions.

Hazard

Flooding,

deposition

Risk Evaluation

Risk Estimates and High Risk
Areas

For the porac-gumain river in
the pasac delta, the following
consequences were estimated for
at least three flooding events :
• a 2-year flood will have an

inundation depth of 0.3 to 0.4
meters affecting some 47,100
hectares for about 9 days;

• a 5-year flood will have a depth
of 0.3 to 0.6 meters and covers
some 49,600 hectares for as
long as 18 days; and

• a worst scenario case (20-
year flood) will result to an
inundation depth of 1.5 to 1.8
meters affecting some 51,900
hectares in 45 days.

annual direct losses include:
php198.96 million damage
to properties; agricultural
production losses of php411.82
million; business disruption
resulting in foregone income in
php1,127.07 million.

For the san Fernando flooding,
the worst case would result
to an inundation depth of
0.3-0.6 meters lasting for 18
days. damage to properties is
estimated to be php590 million.

vulnerabilities

as an aftermath of typhoon gloria
in July 2002, actual flooding was
recorded, with worst cases as
follows: inundation depth of 1.2
meters maximum at the town center
of guagua; 1.0 meter maximum
at the poblacion of sasmuan; and
average of 0.6 meter in the urban
areas of lubao. greatly affected
were residential and commercial
areas. agricultural areas most
affected were ricelands and
aquamarine areas.

the urban core of san Fernando City
was affected by flooding: inundated
area of 124.19 sq km and affecting
16 barangays mostly residential,
commercial, industrial and
institutional areas; and inundation
depths greater than 0.6 meters, and
lasting for more than a month.

perennial flooding may be
attributed, not only to excessive
rainfall, insufficient channel
capacities, and high run-off
coefficients in areas affected; but
also to human activities, particularly
the indiscriminate dumping of
garbage along rivers and creeks,
increasing informal settlers and
illegal structures along waterways
and improper construction of
drainage systems.

Implications

serious and long-duration
flooding will be experienced
in the affected areas if the
drainage problems are not
solved. this would greatly
affect san Fernando City as the
regional center of Central luzon.
guagua and lubao are big
towns with populations of more
than 100 thousand.

Flooding will also affect
economic interactions between
metro manila and the north
luzon since the north luzon
Expressway and the manila
north road passes through san
Fernando City.

Economic linkages between
manila and the industrial areas
of subic and Bataan will also
be affected every time the
guagua and lubao sections
of the gapan-san Fernando-
olongapo (gso) national road
are flooded.

The importance of the risk estimates is best appreciated in the analysis of the planning
area, particularly in determining relatively risk-free or safe areas where developments
can be encouraged or directed to. In the case of Region 1, the following planning
challenges and opportunities are revealed by the disaster risk assessment (see also
Figure 5.5):

oBjECtiVES AND tArgEtS BASED oN tHE riSKS

Objective: to identify development issues, goals, objectives and targets based on the risks

Output: Enhanced set of development issues, goals, objectives and targets

Process:

From the matrix on risk impact to the land use and physical framework, identify
development issues and the corresponding goals and objectives/targets that
need to be attained

1. IDENTIFyING DEvElOPMENT ISSuES AND CONCERNS

Based on an analysis of the risk impact to the land use and physical framework,
development issues and concerns are identified. These are either existing or
potential land use conflicts attributed to the risks (e.g., settlements in high risk areas,
production systems most likely to be affected by disaster since they are in a high risk
area, or critical infrastructures threatened) or possible adverse impact of the disaster
risks to the overall development scenario of the province or region which will require
intervention measures.

2. SPECIFyING DISASTER RISk REDuCTION GOAlS, OBjECTIvES AND TARGETS

Having known the risk-related issues and concerns, the goals and objectives/
targets in the plan are redefined, guided by the vision of the region or province. The
possible changes may be in relation to timeframes, target areas or population groups,
downscaling or refocusing of goals, objectives and targets, among others. It is also
possible that new goals, objectives and targets are formulated to directly address risks.
What is important is that these are reformulated taking into account the constraints
posed by the hazards and that these are realistic and attainable.

At the regional or provincial development level where plans are indicative
frameworks, it may be difficult to be very specific hence detailed objective or target
setting may not be possible unless the data available allow for such analysis.

C. iDENtifYiNg iNtErVENtioN MEASurES to rESpoND

to tHE DiSAStEr riSKS

Once the significance and priority of the risks are ascertained and the goals, objectives
and targets are set, the next thing to do is to identify the corresponding intervention
approaches or options to address the impact of the disaster risks. The measures may
be classified into four major categories, as follows: (a) risk avoidance or elimination;
(b) risk reduction or mitigation; (c) risk sharing or transfer; and (d) risk acceptance or
retention.

a. Risk avoidance or elimination – removing a risk trigger by not locating in the

area of potential hazard impact, not purchasing or making use of vulnerable land
or building; or denying a risk by not creating an activity or simply refusing to
engage in functions that could potentially be affected by risks;

b. Risk reduction or mitigation – reducing the frequency of occurrence or the

severity of the consequence by changing physical characteristics or operations of
a system or the element at risk. It can take on the following subcategories:

•

•

•

•

risk prevention – instituting measures so that the hazard does not turn
into a disaster, or at the very least reduce the impact of the hazard;
risk or loss reduction through mitigation – reducing the severity of a
hazard impact through appropriate actions prior to a hazardous event
such as by preparing the people, protecting property and ensuring that
all facilities or systems are functional. Strategies and PPAs under this
option include structural and nonstructural measures, those that reduce
the socioeconomic vulnerabilities or improve coping mechanisms of
communities at risk, and those that impede triggers to disasters;
risk or loss reduction through preparedness – reducing the severity of
hazard impact by improving capability to rescue, salvage, and recover
through actions completed after hazard impact. Strategies and PPAs may
include the installation of early warning systems; information, education,
and communication (IEC) programs; and evacuation plans and programs;
segregation of exposure through duplication or redundancy – increasing
system sustainability by providing back-up support for systems or
facilities that may become nonfunctional after the hazard impact (concept
of spare tire or stand-by generator); and

•

segregation of exposure through separation – increasing system capacity
and robustness through geographic, physical and operational separation
of facilities and functions (decentralizing services or functions).

c.

Risk sharing or risk transfer – shifting the risk-bearing responsibility to another
party, often times involving the use of financial and economic measures
particularly insurance systems to cover and pay for future damages. In some
literature, the segregation of exposure by separation is considered as a risk
spreading or risk transfer option; and

d.

Risk retention or acceptance – this is the “do-nothing” scenario where risks are
fully accepted and arrangements are made to pay for financial losses related to
the hazard impact or to fund potential losses with own resources.

DRR can be applied to almost every aspect of development. Depending on the types
of risks, one can provide for a range of options to respond to such risks. The choice as
to which final DRR measure or approach to adopt will depend on the decision-making
process of the province/region. Ideally, this should be the result of a participative
process involving all stakeholders particularly the communities affected by the risks.

One can also refer to Annex 7 for an enumeration of the characteristics of resilience,
whether they pertain to a disaster-resilient community or to an enabling environment.
As depicted, resilience is classified into seven major components, namely: environment
and natural resources; health and well being; sustainable livelihoods; social protection;
financial instruments; physical protection; and planning regimes. The Annex also
serves as a checklist of desirable conditions along the seven resilience components. The
lack of these conditions or any deviation from the desired state may point to the need
for the appropriate interventions to improve resilience and reduce disaster risks. For
example, on environment and natural resource management, the risk concern covers
not only those pertaining to natural resource capital but also climate change adaptation.
A notable characteristic of a disaster-resilient community is one that adopts sustainable
environmental management practices that reduce hazard risk. Such practices include
soil and water conservation, sustainable forestry, watershed management to reduce
flood risk, the conservation of mangroves as buffer against storm surges, maintenance
of water supply and drainage system, among others.

Table 5.5 provides examples of risk reduction options and strategies by type of risk. A
list of DRR-related PPAs in terms of structural and nonstructural categories is given in
Table 5.6.

risk treatment and control through land
use planning and management is among
the best drr approaches and all provinces
and regions are encouraged to devise
their own development schemes for the
proper use and management of land. it
may involve the specification of a land
use code of practice similar to the case of
switzerland. Here, hazard-prone areas are
designated as red zones where buildings
are strictly prohibited; less hazard-prone
areas are blue zones where buildings and
facilities are allowed to be constructed but
with restrictions and safety requirements;
and safe areas or yellow zones areas where
developments are encouraged to take
place without any restriction.

Codes of Practice in land use Planning*
(the Case of switzerland)

Red zones – buildings are strictly prohibited

Blue zones – buildings are possible but
with restrictions, provided certain safety
requirements are met

Buildings exposed to hazards have to be
designed corresponding to the hazard’s
possible impacts

to minimize fatalities, the establishment
of warning systems and evacuation plans
by the communities are required

Events involving large numbers of people
have to be avoided as much as possible

in the case of the national land use plan of
lebanon, land development restrictions
are specified and strictly followed (see
Figure below).

yellow zones – buildings are without
restriction

Risk Management via land use
Planning
(The Case of National land use Plan of
lebanon)

in zones susceptible to flooding, the rules
of land development must necessarily be
restrictive:
• reduce construction
• banning housing projects

the

for

purpose of real estate development
• no installations intended for public use
• no obstruction of river watercourses
• prohibition of closed fencing and the
obligation to reserve at least 80 percent
the land for use of gardens, lawns,
orchards or vegetable gardens

In many cases, once the extremely high-risk areas are identified and the logical policy
recourse is to prohibit or restrict occupancy or any developments in those areas, then
resettlement becomes an inevitable option for the affected population.

For a resettlement to be considered effective, a study made on the Mt. Pinatubo
Rehabilitation Options by MB Anderson (1993) suggests the consideration of at least
four basic factors, namely:

a.

b.

c.

Livelihood – the people to be resettled must, within a specified period of time,
be able to earn a stable and secure livelihood through their own production
efforts and/or employment;
Social and political involvement – the people who will be resettled must be
in full charge of their own social and political activities within a short and
specified time, which means that in addition to the economic viability of
the resettlement, there must also be a viable community in which people
participate in the management of their social and political life;
Integration into surrounding economy/community – an effective settlement
is one that is integrated into the economies of the surrounding (host)
communities so that there would be no intergroup or intercommunity tensions;
and

d. Low vulnerability to disasters – an effective settlement is one in which there is
minimal vulnerability to a new disaster; the site should be as safe as possible
from the type of disaster that caused the initial dislocation and from any other
natural disasters and that the settlement should not, by its own existence,
increase the area’s vulnerability to environmental or ecological disasters.

The Anderson document also mentioned that many resettlement schemes that were
designed and constructed at great costs now stand abandoned by their inhabitants
because the groups they intended to house never developed into viable and organic
communities. The reasons for this are covered in the ten lessons outlined below:

a. People who need assistance to resettle are those who have limited capacities;
those who do not self-resettle (and in many cases oppose being resettled) are
those who lack material resources and social mechanisms of psychological
strength for taking initiatives;
Resettlement is very stressful. A move to a new resettlement represents a loss
of power and because they have just experienced extreme powerlessness in
relation to a cataclysmic event, any additional loss of control over their own

lives like planning and livelihood is particularly hard to face. The second issue
that is derived from the difficulties that disaster victims face when they have to
move involves a tendency to adopt “conservative” rather than open-ended or
adventuresome strategies immediately after the move;
Resettlement programs have built-in characteristics which tend to increase
dependency on outside assistance on the part of people being resettled rather
than supporting their independence and self-sufficiency;
The single most important factor for recovery from a disaster is the
reestablishment of a secure source of livelihood;
The physical arrangement of a settlement is the second most important
factor that determines the likelihood of its success. The poor choice of site,
unsatisfactory layout or design, and housing design and construction that do
not meet the settlers’ needs and expectations are three of the most often cited
causes of failures of resettlement schemes;
The roles and responsibilities of men and women very often change under
the circumstances of resettlement. When communities are displaced, the
economic activities that people were engaged in also change and this very often
causes a shift in the gender-based division of labor and social roles;
When governments focus resources on the creation of new settlements, groups
who have significant material, social and psychological capacities may elect to
join because they see it as a promising option for getting ahead;
Integration of the physical infrastructure and the population of a new
settlement into the economic and social systems of the neighboring
communities or the bigger community or municipality where the resettlement
is located affects the success of any settlement;
Settlements always have an important impact on the environment and ecology
of areas in which they are placed; and
Settlements require a combination of community-based, cooperative actions
and private, individualized actions.

Also, a study undertaken by NEDA Region III (1996) shows that there are as many as
ten resettlement arrangements which can be considered, each having its own merits:

a. Standard new resettlement sites. As provided under the Mt. Pinatubo

Commission (MPC) program (standard lots and housing units with community
facilities including road system, water and electric services, public markets
and productivity centers; and with social, recreational, religious facilities);
the national government agencies and local government units (LGUs) are the

developers. These are typical MPC lowland resettlement areas - new town
centers with 500 to 1000 housing units, all with urban facilities and services;

b. Basic new resettlement sites. With basic facilities and services only (with
water and electricity, barangay hall, health station and elementary school);
nongovernment organizations (NGOs) are the developers in cooperation with
LGUs and beneficiaries;

c. Conversion of evacuation sites to resettlement sites. By joint efforts of

beneficiaries/ occupants, LGUs and NGOs;

d. Private developer moderate-standard residential subdivisions. With various

lot sizes, improved to basic standards. Open to all Mt. Pinatubo victims. With
some contractor mass-built houses, including houses built by various builders.
Government mortgage loan programs (nonsubsidized/subsidized, individual/
community). Building material loans and guidance/supervision of construction
for self-built or mutual-built houses. Key inputs are LGU assistance in
site acquisition, access road and offsite utility line extensions, and national
government cooperation with required regulatory approvals and housing loan
programs;

e. Barangay/municipal assimilation. Existing sale or rental housing, houses built
on individual lots, small-medium subdivisions, with self-built and contractor-
built houses. As incentive to host barangay or community, some public facility
extensions and upgrading may be required. Use would be made for existing
schools, health clinics and other public buildings and services of the barangay/
municipality;

f. Community resettlement on self-selected, may be government or

nongovernment aided but developed on a self-help basis. Development
standards would be determined by the resettlement group together and/or
individually according to their needs and resources;

g. Rehabilitation of lahar-devastated community. Either incrementally by the
affected families who choose to stay or return; or as a government or NGO-
sponsored project with “right of first refusal” to displaced owners and other prior
occupants (after lahar is depleted or lahar flows ceased to occur, dike projects
already make the area safe, or for other reasons future lahar risk had become
minimal). Development requirements would vary widely depending on degree
of devastation and decisions of participants;

h. Frontier resettlements. Remotely located land for farming, agriforestry,

ranching, agri-industry, including a small town center with shops and services
and some houses, constructed to moderate standards with a minimum of basic
services;

i. Recycling of resettlement sites. Sites are permanent; beneficiaries are

accommodated for a maximum period (say up to three years with rare extensions
for specific causes). Emphasis on preparation for and assistance with livelihood.
Assistance is provided in obtaining a house, homestead or farmstead. These
sites could also serve as evacuation centers if houses were vacant at the time new
families displaced were seeking accommodations; and

j. Cash vouchers (one-time cash payments) to be used only for permanent

resettlement of families with self-selected locations, house/lot, farm, etc. Thus
the family or families meet their resettlement needs in the real estate market
place wherever and however they choose. This scheme had also been adopted in
the “balik-probinsya” program to encourage slum dwellers in cities to go back to
their province of origin.

framework matrix, the examples of which are shown in the following cases:

One need not disregard previous analyses but simply enhance them by seeing to it that
DRR concepts and principles are integrated. The next two matrices show how this is
done by making use of the same examples in the Volume 2 of the NEDA-ADB PLPEM
Guidelines, on the PDPFP (Tables 22 and 23 in pages 111 and 112, respectively).

In the first example (see Table 5.11), all the entries are retained but enhancements are
made such that the same strategies and PPAs will contribute in increasing resilience
of the target poor population and in ensuring that the proposed interventions will
not inadvertently increase their vulnerabilities. In the second and third cases, the
strategies and PPAs that address the high dropout rate in the elementary level and the
lack of affordable housing are enhanced by implementing interventions in hazard-free
areas.

In the same manner, the issues shown in Table 5.12 on urban encroachment into
prime agricultural lands and environmental degradation are responded to by the
same sets of goals, objectives, strategies and PPAs, but with enhancements in the
interventions, particularly the inclusion of sustainable environmental practices to
reduce hazard risks.

Relative to the flooding problem in Table 5.12, the objective of relocating or
discouraging settlements in flood-prone areas actually aims to reduce flood
vulnerability by avoidance while the objective of protecting households in flood
prone areas seeks to mitigate its adverse effects. The corresponding structural and
nonstructural measures are specified to address the flooding problem.

This is the first attempt to introduce disaster risk assessment methodologies in the
development planning process. Planners are encouraged to keep on enhancing
the methodologies and document experiences in applying them, with the aim of
sharpening planning analyses as basis for sound decision making.

In general, the risk assessment should lead to:

1. More defined disaster mitigation goals and objectives/targets to reduce and

avoid long-term vulnerabilities to identified hazards; and

2. Improved identification and analysis of hazards towards an appropriate

disaster mitigation strategies and PPAs.

Risk reduction programs are more likely to be implemented as part of bigger
development projects rather than as stand-alone projects. Incorporating DRR
concepts and measures into project designs or proposals at an early stage will reduce
the project costs in contrast to its introduction when the project is in an advanced
stage of preparation.

Furthermore, by integrating DRR concepts into developmental activities, huge losses
from disasters could be avoided. Resources invested in risk reduction can easily be
justified when one considers the probable costs of emergency, recovery, repair, and
reconstruction works.

In conclusion, planners should strive to prepare DRR-enhanced plans that significantly
contribute to disaster risk reduction which aims to make communities and societies
become resilient to hazards and ensure that development efforts do not increase
vulnerability to these hazards.

Mainstreaming DRR in Investment Programming, Budgeting,
Project Evaluation and Development and Monitoring and
Evaluation

he plan formulation stage ends with the list of programs, projects, and activities
(PPAs) that address the development challenges of the province as well as meet
the development goals, objectives and strategies. With mainstreaming, it is

expected that the final PPAs include those measures that reduce risks from disasters and
vulnerabilities on the population, economy, and environment.

T

This chapter discusses the secondary entry points for mainstreaming after the plan
formulation stage of the development planning cycle.

A. poSt-pLAN forMuLAtioN MAiNStrEAMiNg

153

The results of the risk assessment enrich the analysis of the planning environment, the
formulation of the land use and physical framework and the identification of development
issues, goals and objectives. As an end result, if the risk assessment reveals that the Local
Government Unit (LGU) or province is susceptible to natural hazards, disaster risk
reduction (DRR) measures will be identified along with other development programs,
projects and activities.

After plan formulation, the next stages of the development planning cycle are investment
programming, budgeting/financing, implementation and monitoring and evaluation, with
project evaluation and development as added tool to improve project design and financing.
These are represented in the orange boxes of the mainstreaming framework described in
Chapter 3.

a.

Investment Programming. These PPAs from the Provincial Development and
Physical Framework Plan (PDPFP) are then programmed to come up with the
Provincial Development Investment Program (PDIP). By definition, the PDIP is a
prioritized list of PPAs, the year or years in which each project will be implemented
and the annual expenditure for each project. The annual slices of the PDIP, referred
to as the annual investment program (AIP), are determined based on an iterative
process of prioritization and matching of financial resources.

d.

Project Evaluation and Development. Ideally, all projects in the PDIP and
the AIP should undergo project evaluation and development to enhance: (i)
knowledge and nature of the PPAs; (ii) identification and understanding of
project outcome and outputs; and (iii) financial and economic viability.
Budgeting/Financing. Evaluated PPAs in the AIP are the main inputs into the
budgeting process.
Project Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation. PPAs provided with
budgetary and other financial resources are then implemented, monitored and
evaluated to determine the project outcomes and impacts that will serve as
inputs to the next risk assessment and planning cycle.

B. iNVEStMENt progrAMMiNg

The list of proposed PPAs derived in the PDPFP goes through the process of
prioritization and matching with financing sources. The end product is the six-year
PDIP. It is important that all DRR PPAs are part of the PDIP since this will be the
tool that provinces use for budget preparation and fund sourcing. The main reference
for investment programming is Volume 3, Investment Programming and Revenue
Generation, of the NEDA-ADB Guidelines on Provincial/Local Planning Expenditure
Management (PLPEM).

There will be DRR projects that will require financing sources which might be
relatively large compared to the annual budget and would therefore compete for
resources from other local priorities especially those that address basic needs. The
following are proposed initial project screening approach:

a.

b.

From the list of DRR PPAs, determine projects that national government
agencies are mandated to implement, such as large flood control projects of the
Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and watershed and river
basin management projects of the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR).
DRR PPAs that cannot be funded from the provincial budget may be packaged
for external financing. It is important that the LGUs exhaust first local
resources and utilize their revenue raising powers to meet shortfalls as an
indicator of good governance.

Risk-sensitive development challenges, goals and objectives also influence the
prioritization process, particularly in defining criteria and assigning weights that will

be adopted by the PDIP Committee of the province. This will enable DRR measures to
compete for resources against other development projects.

C. BuDgEtiNg

Financing will come from the budget of the province, city or municipality where the
DRR measures will be implemented as well as other financing schemes offered by the
national government, private sector and the Official Development Assistance (ODA)
community.

1. 20 PERCENT lOCAl DEvElOPMENT FuND

Section 287 of the 1991 Local Government Code (LGC) requires each LGU to
appropriate in its annual budget no less than 20 percent of its annual internal revenue
allotment for development projects. Eligible projects under this fund are those
directed towards meeting the social and economic development objectives of the
locality as well as for environmental management. Thus, DRR projects which address
social, economic and environmental fragilities would qualify.

2. lOCAl TAXES

Annex G of Volume 3 of the PLPEM presents a local revenue toolkit which identifies
taxes, fees and charges that LGUs may use to raise additional revenues to finance its
investment programs, as defined in the 1991 LGC.

Land-based taxes such as land development permit fee and taxes on sand, gravel
and other quarry taxes may be set at a level that an LGU may be able to recoup
investments in ensuring safe use of these resources.

Infrastructure-based taxes such as special levy on lands specially benefited by public
works funded by LGUs may be seen as a cost-recovery mechanism especially if these
public works are designed to withstand onslaught of disasters.

3. lOCAl AND NATIONAl CAlAMITy FuNDS

LGUs are mandated under the 1991 LGC to set five percent of their estimated
revenue from regular sources as calamity fund. To specify conditions for use of these

funds, the Department of Budget and Management and the Department of Interior
and Local Government issued Joint Memorandum Circulars dated 20 March 2003
and 24 July 2003 allowing the use of the fund for undertaking disaster preparedness
activities and measures such as preparation of relocation sites/facilities, disaster
preparedness training and other pre-disaster activities. These also allow for spending
on rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructures after a disaster. This is a
significant entry point for DRR by ensuring that risk factors are also imputed in
rebuilding infrastructures.

Apart from the LGU’s own calamity fund, augmentation can also come from the
calamity fund of the national government and other LGUs through the NDCC and the
Disaster Coordinating Councils of the other LGUs.

The National Calamity Fund refers to the appropriation in the annual General
Appropriations Act which is available for aid, relief and rehabilitation services
to communities and areas affected by calamities including training of personnel
and other predisaster activities as well as repair and reconstruction of permanent
structures including capital expenditures for predisaster operations.

The fund availment process for the National Calamity Fund can be accessed at the
NDCC website, http://www.ndcc.gov.ph.

4. INTER-lGu AND lGu-NGA COOPERATION

LGUs sharing the same hazards can go into cofinancing or cost-sharing for the
implementation of DRR measures, even if hazard treatment facility is located within a
specific LGU.

While there may be no documented cases yet of inter-LGU cooperation in the
financing and implementation of DRR measures, there are cases of successful
cooperation between LGUs and national government agencies, foremost of which
are the cooperation among the Office of Civil Defense (OCD); Philippine Institute
of Volcanology and Seismology (PHILVOCS); Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical
and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA); Mines and Geosciences
Bureau (MGB); National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA);
and Department of Agriculture (DA), DPWH, DENR, among others, for disaster
preparedness advocacy, training, hazard mapping, and projects such as installation of
early warning systems.

5. RISk SHARING/TRANSFER FINANCING

Insurance is the most widespread existing risk transfer mechanism offered by private
and government sector companies.

5.1 Government Insurance Facilities

a. Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)

The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) is the state insurance
company of the Philippines. One of the funds that it administers is the General
Insurance Fund (GIF) established on 1 September 1951 under Republic Act
No. 656, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 245. The GIF is mandated
under the said laws to indemnify or compensate the Government for any
damage to, or loss of, its properties due to fire, earthquake, storm, or other
casualty. “Government” refers to the national, provincial, city, or municipal
government, agency, commission, board or enterprises owned or controlled by
the Government.

b. Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC)

Agricultural insurance is implemented and managed by the Philippine
Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC), a government-owned and controlled
corporation created by virtue of Presidential Decree 1467 issued in 1978. Its
charter was later revised to give it some legal impetus to expand and to adapt
to current circumstances and is now operating under RA 8175, known as the
“Revised Charter of the Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation Act of 1995”.

Calamity funds earmarked by the government shall include a certain
percentage for crop insurance and shall be released to and administered by the
PCIC. Ten percent of the net earnings of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes
Office (PCSO) from its lotto operation shall also be earmarked for the Crop
Insurance Program. Regular insurance programs are as follows:

i.

Rice and Corn Crop Insurance - insurance protection available to
farmers against loss in rice and corn crops due to natural calamities as
well as plant pests and diseases; eligible borrowing farmers - for those
availing of production loan under the government supervised credit
program; self-financed farmers - optional, provided they agree to place
themselves under the supervision of a PCIC- accredited agricultural
production technician;

159

ii.

High-Value / Commercial Crop Insurance - an insurance protection
extended to farmers against loss in high value/commercial crops, due to
natural calamities and other perils such as pests and diseases. The list
of high value/commercial crops includes asparagus, banana, cassava,
sugarcane, tomato, peanut, potato, garlic, onion, and industrial trees;

iii. Noncrop Agricultural Assets Insurance – an insurance protection

extended to farmers against loss of their non-crop agricultural assets like
warehouses, rice mills, irrigation facilities and other farm equipment due
to perils such as fire and lightning, theft, and earthquake;

iv. Aquaculture / Fisheries Insurance - an insurance program designed
to protect fish farmers/growers against loss of their crops/stocks in
fishponds, fish cages, fish pens and other aquaculture projects prioritized
by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources due to natural disasters
and other perils that may be covered on case to case basis; and

v. Tobacco Industry Insurance - with the National Tobacco Administration,

the PCIC can extend insurance protection to tobacco farmers/
stakeholders against losses of tobacco crop due to natural calamities as
well as other perils.

5.2 Private or Commercial Disaster Insurance
Private insurance companies cover property such as buildings against flood, storm, or
other specified environmental peril. The Philippine market is served by total of 119
domestic and foreign-controlled direct insurance companies in 2007. The directory
of private domestic and foreign insurance companies for nonlife and life insurance is
available at the official website of insurance commission, i.e., http://www.insurance.gov.
ph/htm/_nonlife.asp.

6. INTERNATIONAl SOuRCES

Recent developments have encouraged humanitarian assistance to become embedded
in development projects, particularly as risk assessments and DRR are taken into
account. DRR is becoming a critical issue due to the increasing need to put investment
in preparedness at the national and subnational levels. Countries seek international
assistance when their own institutions are not able to cope with increasing cost of
disasters. Nongovernment humanitarian organizations and as well as governments
through their official development assistance are able to respond.

Annex 8 presents the table of official development assistance (ODA) available for DRR
financing.

D. projECt EVALuAtioN AND DEVELopMENt

Project Evaluation and Development (PED) links planning and investment
programming with financing. Recall that PPAs identified in the PDPFP undergo
preliminary screening and ranking to arrive at a six-year PDIP, which in turn, is
broken down into six single-year investment programs or AIP. All PPAs identified in
the PDIP/AIP will be subjected to basic PED. The main reference for PED is Volume
5, Project Evaluation and Development of the NEDA-ADB PLPEM Guidelines.

DRR should be factored into the overall project development cycle, which includes
project identification, preparation, appraisal and financing, detailed engineering and
design, implementation, operation, and evaluation. DRR is especially important in the
detailed engineering and/or design phase that is usually required for projects involving
the construction of hard infrastructure. The subject of PED however is the thorough
project preparation and appraisal that will look into all relevant issues affecting a
project such as natural hazards.

DRR may be mainstreamed into PED following its four stages: (1) knowing the project;
(2) understanding the project; (3) analyzing it thoroughly; and (4) judging it fairly
(Table 6.1). Projects that will go through comprehensive PED are those: (a) requiring
external funding; and (b) projects costing greater than the provincial internal revenue
allotment divided by number of municipalities in the province.

Entry Points

Actions/Considerations

These PED procedures cover many tools that can be used to mainstream DRR with
little or no modification. Examples of these tools are analyses of market situation,
technical feasibility, financial and economic viability, risk and sensitivity, and
externalities. The project identification undertaken at the planning stage, the stages of
PED procedures, and the development of the logical framework and project proposal
are the key entry points at which disaster risk issues can be factored into PED. These
are shown in detail in Table 6.2.

in order to produce the same outcomes to mitigate disaster risks?

Market Analysis
• What is the market situation of the project’s output? How will hazards/disasters affect this market

situation?

• How will demand for the project’s output be affected by hazards?
• How do hazards affect the current supply of good similar to the project’s output? How does disaster

Economic Analysis
•

in the case of drr projects, establish economic demand or need for the project and grounds for public
sector involvement.

•
• Explore what size of error in the estimation of disaster risk would make the project economically

unviable/non-sustainable or require further action to strengthen resilience.

• Explore potential shifts in hazard vulnerability between groups (e.g., towards lower-income groups) as a

consequence of the project.

• take into account both cost-efficiency findings and other non-economic factors in selecting the

preferred project alternative.

the following questions may also be considered in the analysis:
• How will disaster risk be factored in the true cost of the project to society?
• How will disaster risk affect the cost of the good at the project site?
• How much is the benefit of the project truly worth to society prone to natural hazards?
• Will the economic benefits of the project outweigh its economic cost, which includes disaster risks?

Analysis of Externalities
• Will any of the project’s activities and outputs pose a hazard to the environment?
• What are the potential risks to other people’s health, lives, and property?
• What are the potential risks to various population groups (e.g., women, physically challenged, children)?
• How can these hazards be mitigated and if possible, prevented?

EVALuAtioN

The PPAs and their DRR project components need to be monitored during
implementation using the selected performance and risk indicators and make any
adjustments in inputs, activities, targets and objectives as may be necessary. The
logical framework or logframe should be used as basis for monitoring and evaluation.
Some key questions are:

• Were disaster risks and related assumptions accurately assessed during the

implementation?

• Were disaster risks appropriately and cost-effectively addressed by the project?
• What are the benefits and achievements of any DRR components?
• Were the selected disaster risk-related performance and risk indicators sufficiently

relevant and informative?

• How did the impacts of any disasters occurring over the course of the project

•

affected its outcome and achievements?
Is the sustainability of the project’s achievements potentially threatened by future
hazard events?

Project outcomes and impact will provide information if risks have been reduced
in terms of increased resilience (or decreased vulnerability) of population and
property. This information should feed into the next cycle of the risk assessment and
development planning process.

Annexes

ANNEX 1
NATuRAl HAzARDS: AN OvERvIEw1

Planners are not expected to become experts on hazards, but they should have
sufficient understanding on how, why, and when hazards occur. This annex shall
familiarize the users of the Guidelines on the science and behavior of natural hazards,
and enable them to analyze and interpret hazard maps.

The natural hazards considered in the Guidelines pertain to events arising from geologic
and hydrometeorologic processes that have the potential of causing deaths, injuries and
damage to property. Hazards from these two main groups may occur independently of
each other or may result as the consequence of one event or a chain or series of events.
For example, rainfall and a volcanic explosion are separate events and the occurrence
of one may not be triggered by the other. However, strong rainfall occurring over areas
covered by sediments and ash from a recent volcanic eruption may cause lahars (mud
flows) raging down slopes of areas and through natural courses of water, which may
subsequently cause flooding and deposition of materials in low-lying areas.

While the Guidelines estimate risks based only from a single hazard event, it should
not prevent the planner from determining which events in the hazard chain are likely
to cause more damage or loss. With the help of hazard experts, planners should be
able to identify, describe and assess the hazard events in the chain that will most likely
result in greater risks to life and property.

In a chain of hazard events, it is difficult to assign probabilities of occurrence and the
fatality and property damage risks, since it is likely that sufficient information may not
be available to pinpoint which event in the chain had caused the damage.

A. gEoLogiC HAzArDS

Geologic hazards result from geologic processes acting on or beneath the earth’s
surface. These include movement of plates in the earth’s crust or from local
concentrations of heat and are a source of hazards to people and their natural and
built-up environment on the earth’s surface (Kramer, 1996).

development and physical planning conducted in 2008 as part of the process for the preparation and review of the guidelines.

Geologic hazards covered in the Guidelines are limited to two classifications: those
caused by earthquakes (ground shaking, ground rupture, earthquake-induced landslide,
liquefaction) and those caused by volcanic eruptions.

1. EARTHquAkE AND EARTHquAkE-INDuCED HAzARDS

An earthquake is a weak to violent shaking of the ground produced by the sudden
movement of rock materials below the earth’s surface (L. Bautista, 2008). Earthquakes
are caused either by the sudden movement along faults and trenches (tectonic), or by the
movement of magma beneath volcanoes (volcanic). Faults are fractures in the earth’s
surface where rock movement has taken place and earthquakes produced.

Two tectonic plates sandwich the country – the Philippine Sea Plate to the east and the
Eurasian Plate to the west (Figure A1.1). Between these two plates is found the Philippine
Fault Zone, where the country’s most active faults are located, namely, Abra River Fault,
Tubao Fault, Digdig Fault, Central Leyte Fault, Mindanao Fault, Mati Fault, and the West
Valley Fault. Figure A1.2 shows the location of active faults and trenches in the Philippines.

Movements along the active faults are responsible for the present-day high seismicity
of the Philippine Archipelago. Earthquakes generated by movements along faults are
all shallow-seated (from 0 to 70 km deep). Very destructive earthquakes may originate
from fault movements occurring at less than 30 km. If strong shallow earthquakes occur
under the sea and displace parts of the seabed, tsunamis are oftentimes generated.

Earthquakes trigger hazards that cause destruction to lives and properties. Hazards
associated with earthquakes are commonly referred to as seismic hazards, such as
ground shaking, ground rupture, earthquake-induced landslides, liquefaction and
tsunamis. The following sections briefly describe these hazards and their possible
impacts.

1.1. Ground Shaking
The main hazard created by seismic earth movements is ground shaking. This term
is used to describe the vibration of the ground during an earthquake. During an
earthquake, seismic waves travel rapidly away from the source and through the earth’s
crust. Upon reaching the ground surface, they produce shaking that may last from
seconds to minutes (Kramer, 1996).

Earthquake strength is measured in terms of either its magnitude or intensity.
Magnitude measures the total energy released at the earthquake’s point of origin
(below the earth’s surface) based on information derived from a seismograph. It is
typically reported in Arabic numerals (e.g., 6.3, 7.2). Table A1.1 provides a description

of strength of the different earthquake magnitudes.
The other measure of earthquake strength is intensity. Intensity is the perceived
strength of an earthquake based on relative effects to people and structures on the
earth’s surface. The intensity scale consists of a series of certain key responses such
as people awakening, movement of furniture, and finally - total destruction. It is
reported as Roman numerals. Note that assigning intensity levels generally does not
have a mathematical basis; instead it is an arbitrary ranking based on observed effects.

The severity of the impact of ground shaking at any point depends on a number of
factors, including magnitude of the earthquake, distance from the rupture and the
local geological conditions, which may either amplify or reduce the earthquake waves
(Kramer, 1996). One general observation is that damage is usually more severe for
buildings founded on unconsolidated material than in rock (Kramer, 1996).

Typically, the nearer one is from the epicenter, the greater is the magnitude and the
intensity. As one moves farther from the origin, the intensity decreases (Smith, 1996).
Most of the memorable images of the 1990 North Luzon earthquake are the damage
from structural collapse (e.g., low and tall buildings, towers and posts that tilted, split,
toppled or collapsed, broken foundation of roads, railroad tracks and bridges, dislocated
water pipes and other utility installations, and other forms of mass movement) which
had resulted in a great number of fatalities and extensive economic loss.

1.2. Ground Rupture
Ground ruptures are new or renewed movements of old fractures along faults. The
presence of ground rupture is evidence of an active fault. If it is in an area near a fault

line, then a strong ground shaking may result in damage. If structures rest on the fault
line, they may be sheared off along the direction of the fault.

Neither damage nor loss of life is likely from a ground rupture unless houses, schools
and other buildings are on top of an active fault. A buffer zone of at least 5 meters away
from the fault trace is one mitigation measure to avoid loss or damage.

1.3. Earthquake-induced Landslides
The severe shaking in an earthquake can cause natural slopes to weaken and
fail, resulting in landslides. Depending on the degree of ground shaking, level
of susceptibility and soundness of structures, landslides can cause damage to
infrastructure, such as cracking, toppling and even collapse; burying of settlements; or
flooding in downstream areas due to deposition. Earthquake-induced landslides can
be divided into three main categories: disrupted slides and falls, coherent slides, and
lateral spreads and flows (Kramer, 1996).

Disrupted slides and falls include rock falls, rock slides, rock avalanches, soil falls,
disrupted soil slides, and soil avalanches. These happen when earth materials are
sheared, broken, and disturbed. These usually occur in steep terrain and can produce
extremely rapid movements and devastating damage. Rock avalanches and rock falls
have historically been among the leading causes of death from earthquake-induced
landslides (Kramer, 1996).

Coherent slides generally consist of a few coherent blocks that translate or rotate on
relatively deeper failure surfaces in moderate to steeply sloping terrain. They include
rocks and soil slumps, rock and soil block slides, and slow earth flows. Most coherent
slides occur at lower velocities than disrupted slides and falls (Kramer, 1996).

Lateral spreads and flows generally involve liquefiable soils. Sliding can occur on
flat slopes and produce very high velocities due to the low residual strength of these
materials.

Occurrence of landslides during an earthquake is determined largely by local
conditions. Many factors, including geologic and hydrologic conditions, topography,
climate, weathering and land use, influence the stability of slopes and the
characteristics of landslides. In general, landslides are likely to happen when the
following conditions are present: thick soil cover or highly fractured soils, weathered
rocks in the slopes, weak soils, steep slopes, highly saturated soils and strong
earthquakes (Bautista, 2008).

Information on the susceptibility to landslides of a region or province has been mapped
out by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources’ Mines and Geosciences
Bureau (DENR-MGB), an example of which is shown in Figure A1.5. The map shows
areas in Surigao del Norte that are prone to earthquake-induced landslides, mainly in
the municipalities of Alegre, Gigaguit, Claver, Sison and Mainit and Surigao City.

Information on landslides can be obtained from previously published documents such
as geologic maps, soil survey and /or agricultural maps, topographic maps, natural
hazard maps, and geological and geotechnical engineering reports. Other sources of
information may include aerial photographs and other forms of remote sensing.

In the absence of maps, field scanning may be conducted to observe tell-tale signs
of a landslide-prone area, although the final findings should be verified by hazard
experts. Features such as scarps; tension cracks; bulges; hummocky terrain; displaced
ditches, channels and fences; cracked foundations, walls, or pavements; and leaning
trees or poles can be identified and mapped as evidences of instability. The locations

Figure A1.5 Earthquake-induced Landslide Hazard Map

of streams, springs, seeps, ponds and moist areas as well as differences in vegetative
cover can provide evidence of altered or disrupted water flow caused by slope
instability (Kramer, 1996).

1.4. Liquefaction
Liquefaction is a process where particles of loosely-consolidated and water-saturated
deposits of sand are rearranged into a more compact state. This results in the
squeezing of water and sediments towards the surface in the form of “sand fountain”
and creating a condition resembling “quicksand”. In this phenomenon, the strength of
the soil is reduced to a point where it is unable to support structures (Kramer, 1996).

Liquefaction commonly occurs in areas that are water-saturated (shallow water table),
low-lying and situated in typically loose (unconsolidated) foundation or in sandy or
silty deposits. Typical examples of these areas are river banks, abandoned rivers, flood
plains, coastlines and swamps.

The liquefaction encompasses several related phenomena, among which are lateral
spread, subsidence and sand boils.

Lateral spread involves the horizontal displacement of surface blocks as a result of
liquefaction in a subsurface layer. Characterized by incremental displacements during
earthquake shaking, it can produce a variable range of displacements. It can produce
damage in the abutments, foundations and superstructures of bridges, pipelines,
bridge piers and other structures with shallow foundations, especially those located
near river channels or canal banks on floodplains (Kramer, 1996).

Loss of bearing strength usually occurs when a shallow layer of soil liquefies under
a building. Large deformations within the soil mass (e.g., settling arising from
rearranging, to loss of water pressure, compaction) cause structures to settle and tip
arising from compaction.

Level ground liquefaction does not involve lateral displacements but is easily identified
by the presence of sand boils produced by groundwater rushing to the surface.
Although not particularly damaging by themselves, sand boils indicate the presence of
high ground water pressures whose eventual dissipation can produce subsidence and
damage differential settlements (Kramer, 1996).

1.5. Tsunami
A tsunami is a Japanese term for “harbor waves”. This is a series of waves generated by
various geological processes typically originating from vertical displacements of the
ocean floor associated with a strong and shallow earthquake (Intensity VI and above).
Though possible, less common sources of tsunamis are coastal or submarine
landslides, infrequently by submarine volcanic eruptions and very rarely by meteor
impact. Tsunamis may travel as fast as 880 kilometers per hour (kph) with wave
heights of less than a meter in deep ocean. It slows down to around 80 to 45 kph
near shorelines with much of its energy transformed to height increases of 10 to 30
meters. Given its speed coming from a nearer source, it may provide little warning and

and drag forces can move houses. Flooding can turn floating debris, such as boats
and vehicles, into projectiles and smash into other structures. Strong wave currents
undermine harbor foundations and can lead to the collapse of bridges and sea walls.
Fire and pollution often result from the spillage of oil and other toxic materials
in storage places such as ports. A quantification of the risks from these different
destructive events requires more documentation on local tsunamis in the country and
was not included in the computation of risks in these Guidelines.

2. vOlCANIC HAzARDS

Volcanic hazards arise from active and potentially active volcanoes in the Philippines.
Active volcanoes are those that erupted within historical times (within the last 600
years) such that, accounts of these eruptions were documented by man. Volcanoes
that had eruptions within geological times (less than or equal to 10,000 years) are also
called active. Potentially active volcanoes are morphologically young looking, but with
no historical records of eruption. An inactive volcano has no recorded eruptions in the

last 10,000 years.
Volcanic hazards may come from various possible activities, such as eruption and may
come in the form of ash falls, ballistic bombs, pyroclastic flow, subsidence, fissures,
rolling incandescent rocks and other wind- and rain-induced movements, like ash

Figure A1.7 Volcanic Hazards

curtains and lahars.
Volcanic hazards can be classified into primary and secondary phenomena. The
primary phenomena include pyroclastic flows, air-fall tephra, lava flows and volcanic
gases. Secondary phenomena include ground deformation, lahars, landslides and
tsunamis and seiches.

Primary volcanic hazards are associated with the products ejected by the volcanic
eruption. Explosive volcanic eruptions are usually accompanied by pyroclastic flows.
The literal meaning of pyroclastic is “fire broken” (Smith, 1996). These flows result
from frothing of molten magma at the vent of the volcano when gas bubbles expand
and burst explosively to fragment the lava. Eventually, a dense cloud of lava fragments

is ejected to form a turbulent mixture of hot gases and pyroclastic material (volcanic
fragments, crystals, ash, pumice and glass shards) which then flows down the flank of
the volcano (Smith, 1996).

Airfall tephra comprises all the fragmented material, which is ejected by the volcano and
subsequently falls to the ground. The materials spewn may range in size from so-called
“bombs” (>32mm in diameter) to fine ash and dusts (< 4mm in diameter). The coarser,
heavier particles fall out first close to the volcano vent, while the finer dust may be
deposited as far as hundreds of kilometers away depending on wind directions (Smith,
1996). The degree of a hazard created by an air-fall tephra varies greatly. It can result
in breathing problems for people; poor visibility; damage to roofs; damage to vehicles
and utilities; and injury to grazing animals especially if tephra contains fluorine or other
toxic chemicals, which can contaminate pasture and water supplies (Smith, 1996).

Lava flow is characterized by a quiet emission of fluid from the crater. This flow is
channeled along gullies connected to the crater. The advancing flow may fill up these
gullies and channels and eventually create new pathways. The flow may terminate at
mid-slopes or at the base of the volcano depending on the fluidity and supply of lava.

Lava flows pose the greatest threat to human life when these emerge rapidly from
fissure eruptions rather than from central-vent volcanic eruptions. The lavas may
be fluid or viscous and are determined by its chemical composition, especially the
proportion of silicon dioxide. Thick lava blankets sterilize the land for many years,
creating food shortages and possibly famine (Smith, 1996).

Volcanic gases are released by explosive eruptions and lava flows. The gaseous mixture
commonly includes water vapour, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
hydrogen sulphide, sulphur dioxide, sulphur trioxide, chlorine and hydrogen chloride
in variable proportions (Smith, 1996).

Among the secondary volcanic hazards, ground deformation arises from the volcano
growing from within by magma intrusion and as layers of lava and pyroclastic
material accumulate on surrounding slopes. It may result in overloading and over-
steepening of slopes that may eventually lead to mass movement (landslides) or
failure of volcanic edifices.

Lahars or volcanic mudflows occur widely on flanks of volcanoes. Lahars may occur
in association with any volcanic event, whether explosive eruption or effusive lava

flow (Smith, 1996). The widespread accumulation of volcanic ash in lowland valleys
commonly results in an increased threat of river flooding and sediment redeposition.
Lahars can be more devastating than other hazards because these can affect low lying
and populated areas far from the volcano (PHIVOLCS, 2008).

It is important to map volcanic hazards so that proper measures, such as evacuation,
are put in place should eruptions happen. In the case of Mayon Volcano, PHIVOLCS
has designated a 6-km radius permanent danger zone where settlements and economic
activities are not allowed or are restricted. This zone is reflected in Figure A1.8.

The map in Figure A1.8 also shows three levels of susceptibility from ashfall from Mt.
Mayon medium–scale eruption events. The red circle shows the first danger area, i.e.,
permanent danger zone while the red dashed outline indicates additional areas highly
susceptible to pyroclastic (air-borne volcanic debris) and lahars (lava flows) and liable
to be evacuated during eruptions. Settlements on the flanks of volcanoes and lying in
the historical paths of mud and lava flows are naturally in danger. Also contributing to
risks are structures with roof designs not resistant to ash accumulation, the presence
of combustible materials, and the lack of evacuation plan or warning systems.

B. HYDroMEtEoroLogiC HAzArDS

Hydrometeorologic hazards are natural processes or phenomena of atmospheric,
hydrologic or oceanographic nature, which may cause loss of life, injury,
property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation.
Hydrometeorologic hazards can be single, sequential or combined in their origin and
effects (United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, 2004).

Hydrometeorologic hazards include: floods, debris and mud floods; tropical cyclones,
storm surges, thunder/hailstorms, rain and wind storms, blizzards and other severe
storms; drought, desertification, wildland fires, temperature extremes, sand or dust
storms; permafrost and snow or ice avalanches.

Of the hazards under this origin, three were covered by the Guidelines, i.e., storm
surge, floods and flashfloods, and rain-induced landslides.

Typhoons, cyclones, tornados are considered as hazard triggers, much like
earthquakes that trigger ground shaking. The impact of typhoons, for example, is

manifested by damage or loss caused by the flooding after extreme rainfall, or by rain-
induced landslides. Wind-related damage from typhoons is not included in the risk
assessment because of the complexity of establishing relationships of wind magnitude,
duration, impacts and frequency for local conditions. These are subjects of further
studies and readers are referred to mandated agencies, e.g., Philippine Atmospheric,
Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) and NDCC, for
consultation on loss and damage assessments. While damage from typhoons (wind-
related impacts) are important, records of past damage can qualitatively describe areas
affected and corresponding impacts from each event can be considered. Hence, it is
important to keep incident or damage assessment reports for each municipality as
these can be useful for establishing correlations with hazard character and frequency.

1. STORM SuRGE

A storm surge is an offshore rise of water associated with a low pressure weather
system, typically a tropical cyclone. Here, high winds push on the ocean’s surface and
causes water to pile up higher than the ordinary sea level. Storm surges have been
known to damage nearby coastal structures as a result of wave impact and debris
(e.g., boulders, corals) carried by the surge. It can also cause coastal flooding which
is especially enhanced when surges happen during high tides. Storm surges are worst
when the seafloor slopes gently.

Figure A1.9 is an example of a Storm Surge Hazard Map prepared by PAGASA. From
the map, one can conclude that storm surges affect most of the eastern coastlines
of Surigao del Norte. Damage and loss in these areas generally arise from stronger
tropical cyclone affecting shallow coasts, and possibly from the rise in sea level that
can cause flooding and damage in low-lying coastal areas, particularly when the
approach of the storm coincides with the occurrence of high tide.

Having settlements in storm-surge zones, lack of resistant buildings as well as timely
warning systems and evacuation plans, and low public awareness of destructive forces
of storm surges are likely to increase vulnerabilities to this hazard.

2. FlOODS AND FlASHFlOODS

Floods are characterized by a rise in the water level when a body of water, such as a
river or lake exceeds its total capacity. Having a slow build up and usually seasonal,
floods have many causes. Heavy rains, whether sudden or prolonged, may create several

Figure A1.9 Storm Surge Hazard Map

scenarios of flooding and its impact depends also on artificial or human interventions.
Although their rise may be gentle and slow, high tides may create floods near shores
or lakes but do not cause much damage. The occurrence of high tides may be regularly
predicted and hence their impact can be avoided.

Coastal floods occur when strong onshore winds push the water inland, causing a
rise in sea level and flooding the low-lying coastal areas. Worst cases may occur if
heavy rains coincide with the occurrence of high tide. Factors affecting the force of the
hazard may include height of rise of water and velocity of incoming waves.

Riverine floods are typically caused by excess overland run-off and stream discharge,
where the main channel capacity has been exceeded and hence overtops river banks
and flows through its adjacent flood plains. Water rise varies with discharge, but flatter
areas typically have higher depths of flow.

Flashfloods occur under various conditions. For example, these occur over steep

river channel slopes, on areas with abrupt changes in elevation, and in narrow valleys
or river areas which restrict flow of water resulting to damming action. A sudden
discharge results in the possibility of accompanying debris materials. Typically these
manifest sudden occurrence of floods that abruptly stop. Flashfloods are known to be
damaging or destructive.

Other factors that may cause flood flows are dam breaches; blockages of channels
arising from deposition of sediments, debris and the like; and the narrowing of
sections along waterways like canals, bridges, and culverts which create fast waters
in main canals and floodplains. Flooding also affects the land cover, e.g., agriculture,
built-up areas, tree canopy, among others.

Figure A1.10 is an example of a Flood Hazard Map for Surigao del Norte that shows
the different flood prone areas, typically in floodplains. Most of the areas are located
downstream areas of rivers, such as Surigao City, Placer, Taganan, and Bacuag as well
as in areas surrounding Lake Mainit. As shown in the map, flood area extents (in

Figure A1.10 Flood Hazard Map

modified from source: pagasa, 2008

red) spread laterally and adjacent to these river outlines. This may be caused by river
overflow when run-off exceeds the capacity of the channels or when depression results
in the flooding of the adjacent low-lying areas (e.g., floodplains).

3. lANDSlIDES

Landslides (or mass movement) are downward and outward movements of materials,
including rock and soil due to various causes such as excessive rain, earthquake, volcanic
eruption, rapid undercutting by rivers, waves or man’s activities.

Areas prone to landslides typically include old landslide deposits along, near or
beneath steep slopes and downslope of streams and creeks; thick soil or fractured
rocks; those along or on top of cut slopes; and developed steep slopes with no
appropriate drainage. Human activities sometimes contribute to the susceptibility
of areas to landslides. Building structures around or on top of slopes, pipe leakages,
septic system and irrigation discharges, and vibrations from machinery and from
blasting can increase pressure and weaken the soil.

Rainfall thresholds for landslides, based on worldwide comparisons and trends,
reveal that about 100 mm of rainfall per day could trigger a landslide. Based on
this observation, independent studies by PHIVOLCS and their experts reveal that
the amount of rainfall that triggered landslides in Southern Leyte (2003) and in the
Northern Quezon and Aurora (2004) was more than three times the worldwide
threshold (Figure A1.11). Mt. Mayon lahar flows showed about 200 mm rainfall per
day and Mt. Pinatubo lahar flows were experienced under 100 mm rainfall per day.
These figures reveal that rainfall thresholds vary from place to place.

A study by Matsushi (2006) further reveals that although the rainfall in excess of the
threshold is necessary, it is not a sufficient condition for landslide occurrence. Other
site-specific factors need to be considered as well, such as strength of slope materials
or hill slope hydrological processes.

Matsushi’s study on shallow landslides on soil-mantled hill slopes with permeable and
impermeable bedrocks reveal that the critical combination of rainfall intensity and
duration for the permeable sandstone slope recurs with a decadal return period (3 to
200 years), whereas the impermeable mudstone slope has a threshold with a yearly
recurrence interval (1.1 to 3 years). The rainfall thresholds incorporate geotechnical
soil properties and slope hydrological processes in each hill slope. The longer return
period of the threshold implies the lower potential for landsliding, which corresponds

to the lower landslide activity in the hill slopes with permeable bedrocks. The study
thus concluded that it is possible to relate the critical rainfall intensity-duration
relationship of the type of soil to the rainfall intensity duration frequency information
(RIDF) to develop the recurrence interval of the landslide-triggering rainfall.

The analytical procedure in the study for determining the site-specific threshold is
applicable to any region where geotechnical soil properties and a certain amount of
hydrological data are available. Given this information, residents living in the vicinity
of hazardous areas may be able to evacuate following the warnings based on the site-
specific critical combination of rainfall intensity and duration.

Figure A.1.12 is an example of a Rain-induced Landslide Map. Large areas in the
Province of Surigao del Norte are prone to varying degrees of rain-induced landslides,
especially those within moderate and steep slopes such as San Francisco, Malimono,
Alegria, and Gigaguit, among others.

DENR-MGB has set four possible levels of susceptibility to landslides (Table A1.5). Each
level was defined based on characteristics of slope, cracks, and recent landslide activities.
Even without the benefit of a map, one can still identify active landslide areas by
looking for cracks or scars, surface depressions, disturbance of the drainage patterns;
hummocky topography; and ear-lobe like bulges near base of slopes.

Table A2.1 is used herein as the working table. Hypothetically, the numbers represent
the volume of water discharged from a river resulting in flood and taken to mean that
each represents a hazard event (e.g., 38.50 million cubic meters hazard event in 1935
or simply 38.50 event). The material for this hypothetical example was expanded from
an example of V.T Chow’s Applied Hydrology (1988) on Frequency Analysis.

Table A3.4 shows that earthquakes with Ms 5.0 or lower generally do not cause
significant damage. However, intensity VI - VII (MMIS) (i.e., Ms 4.9 – 6.1 and
corresponding to g value ≤0.21) is capable of only slight to moderate damage in well-
built structures but considerable in poorly–built structures. Ms 7.0 and higher are
already devastating.

Thus, in the context of these Guidelines the magnitude interval of 4.9 – 6.1 is
considered as the lower limit of the magnitude range. Further more, the upper
limit of the magnitude is assigned as > 7.0 because the Philippines has encountered
earthquakes of the size magnitude 7.5 in many areas. In between those ranges are the
moderate events.

Table A.3.5 shows the assignments and correspondence of values of different scales.
This will be used to determine the return period for each magnitude interval along all
the seismic zones in the Philippines. The range is further calibrated into three classes

With this information, the range of magnitudes to high, moderate and low susceptible
areas can thus be set. It is assumed that moderately strong but potentially damaging
events to strong events affect high susceptible areas. Furthermore, only very strong
events can create greater coverage which may include all susceptible areas defined in
the hazard maps. Thus, magnitude intervals are assigned for each susceptibility area
(Table A3.6).

These intervals are generally consistent with the principle adopted by Thenhaus et.
al., where Ms 5.0 was not included in their analysis as is does not generally cause
significant damage. A maximum magnitude of Ms >7.0 was maintained for all seismic
source zones because: (a) earthquakes of Ms 7.5 have occurred in many areas of the
country; and (b) the inventory of seismogenic faults and active geologic structures is
incomplete for most areas.

It is emphasized that these assumptions are made solely for obtaining risk estimates
for prioritizing large areas such as those covered by regions or provinces, and
therefore may not apply for city/municipal or site-specific planning.

2. ASSIGNING RETuRN PERIODS: SAMPlE CASE

In Chapter 4, the procedure on assigning the return period for earthquake-
related hazards was presented with Surigao del Norte as a case. The Peak Ground
Acceleration Value for Medium Soil and the Map on Seismic Source Zones of the
Philippines that were included in Chapter 4 are again included here in Annex 3 to
facilitate referencing. Additional maps in this annex are Peak Ground Acceleration
Value for Soft Soil and Peak Ground Acceleration Value for Rock.

Here is another example of a stepwise procedure on how to assign return periods.

Step 1. Identify the g value of the province or region in Figure A3.1, the Peak Ground
Acceleration Value for Soft Soil. For a region where there is more than one g value,
analysis will be per province. It is assumed that the zone where the province is located
serves also as the source of the earthquake.

Example: Pangasinan has a g value of 0.6

Step 2. Using the table below, identify the equivalent Richter Scale Magnitude of the g
value (if g value is between 0.21 and 0.36, use 0.36-0.53 g value)

The concept of developing this matrix in three classes can be used to develop the
matrix for other hazards. However, the magnitude or intensity interval corresponding
to return period of other hazards must be derived from their historical data or inquiry
from mandated agencies. Furthermore, it is suggested to use the same classes of
magnitude interval in developing the factor for fatality and property damage matrix.

Figure A3.1 Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) Value for Soft Soil

Step 3. Identify which earthquake zone the province or region is located from Figure
A3.4, on the Seismic Zone Map. If the area overlaps two or three seismic zones,
choose the zone which corresponds to higher return period to avoid underestimation.

Example: Pangasinan is located in Zone 8.

Step 4. Now that the g value and seismic zone have been identified, the corresponding
return period in Table A3.2 is then determined. If the magnitude overlaps in
two ranges in Table A3.2, use the upper value in the magnitude range to avoid
underestimation.

Example: Pangasinan, located in Zone 8, and g value of 0.6 use Magnitude >7.0.

Step 5. Assign the return period of all hazard events following this template.

The return period obtained from step 5 will be the worst case scenario. Meaning, in
the case of Pangasinan, its worst case scenario is a >7 magnitude earthquake, with a
158-year return period. Areas affected are HSA, MSA and LSA.

To fill up the return period of the lower intensity hazard event, refer again to Table
A3.2. Using the upper value of magnitude 7.0, the return period (Zone 8) is 22.

Finally, to fill up the lowest intensity hazard event, refer again to Table A3.2. Using the
upper value of 6.4, the return period (Zone 8) is 8.

The return period and corresponding area matrix can be developed for any other
province or capital city using the above-mentioned procedure.

Recall definition of active and inactive volcanoes in Annex 1. Volcanic hazards arise
from active and potentially active volcanoes in the Philippines. Active volcanoes
are those that erupted within historical times (within the last 600 years). Volcanoes
that erupted within geological times (less than or equal to 10,000 years) are also
classified as active volcanoes. Potentially-active volcanoes have no historical records
of eruption. An inactive volcano has no recorded eruption in the last 10,000 years.
Volcanic hazards are ash falls, ballistic bombs, pyroclastic flow, subsidence, fissures,
rolling incandescent rocks and other wind- and rain-induced movements, like ash
curtains and lahars.

Based on information from national disaster Coordinating Council-office of Civil defense
(ndCC-oCd) and pHivolCs, some volcanic activities have longer return periods. iriga volcano
in Camarines sur only had a single eruption since 1628, which makes it 380 years dormant.
mt. Banahaw in Quezon, laguna has only erupted once since 1730, which makes it 278 years
dormant. mt. pinatubo had erupted in 1991 after more than 600 years of dormancy.

there were 52 recorded eruptions (1616-2006) from mt. mayon in albay, Bicol region. mt.
Bulusan, in the same region recorded about 15 eruptions with the latest in 2006-2007. mt.
Kanlaon in negros oriental has shown regular volcanic activities from mild to strong eruption
at least once in a decade. taal volcano in Batangas had 33 eruptions with the latest in 1977.

The definition of active volcanoes was used to identify rare events. Table 4.7 (from
Chapter 4) is divided into frequent (300 years and below), likely (300-600 years) and
rare (above 600 years). The assignment of the return period and the coverage of
susceptible areas will depend on specific areas where volcanoes are located, as earlier
described. Compared to hydrometeorologic hazards, the susceptible areas under
volcanic hazards are typically more confined near the source of eruption.

C. EStiMAtiNg rEturN pErioDS for
HYDroMEtEoroLogiC HAzArDS

Chapter 4 already discusses in detail the estimation of return periods for
hydrometeorologic hazards. The methodology was guided by Rainfall Intensity
Duration Frequency (RIDF) with Surigao del Norte as case. Information that may be
generalized from the RIDF are as follows:

a. For flood hazards, when the duration of the rainfall is equal or longer than the

travel time of surface flow water from the farthest point up until an outlet point
(e.g, a downstream point), most areas of the drainage area contributes to the peak
flow. In big drainage areas, longer duration rainfall creates this condition even in
smaller drainage areas when short duration is accompanied by intense rainfall. As
the event becomes rarer (i.e., higher return period of say 25, 50 or more years),
the volume of rain increases and flood volume increases and reaches wider areas.
Hence, smaller rainfall return periods (below 10 yrs) are initially assigned with
smaller drainage areas (e.g. urban drainage areas, 100 hectares or so) as HSA
in hazard maps where higher flood flows can be expected, and higher return
periods (above 10 years) to cover wider areas defined by all susceptible areas, i.e.,
HSA, MSA and LSA. This size may vary from 100 hectares to flood plain sizes of
10,000 hectares and beyond. (Source: Ponce, V.)

b. For rain-induced landslides, the return period depends on the return period of
rainfall and site conditions. Steep slopes are more susceptible than those areas
with moderately steep slopes or flat terrain. Nonetheless, 150 to 200 millimeters
of rainfall per day, in general, may be enough to trigger landslides, based on an
investigation by PHIVOLCS and Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and
Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).

c. An intense, short duration rainfall is likely to create landslides in HSAs; and
longer duration rainfalls are likely to increase landslide occurrences in wider
areas (i.e., MSA and LSA).

1/ the figures for geologic hazards except volcanic eruptions are for surigao del norte. Each province should compute for their return periods based on their g
value and zone, as described in these guidelines.

2/ these are only applicable to areas prone to flooding as reflected in flood susceptibility maps or flood hazard maps. it will be up to the planner to assess
flooding in the area based on past occurrences to determine whether they are frequent or likely events with the corresponding return period of ≤10 or >10,
respectively. in the computations for surigao del norte, where floods are likely events, a return period of 100 years was used.

annex 4
measUrinG direct and indirect imPact of
natUral disasters in tHe PHiliPPines

The negative impacts of disasters may be grouped into three: economic, humanitarian
and ecological. Economic impacts refer to damages to physical assets and losses in
economic activity. Humanitarian impacts include loss of human lives, injuries and
psychosocial trauma. Ecological impacts include damages to forests, habitat, flora and
fauna. The impacts on one group could also aggravate the situation of the others. For
example, humanitarian and ecological damages have repercussions to the economy.
Economic losses such as damaged crops due to flooding in the lowlands may push
communities into using the forests and other fragile ecosystems for food production.

Economic impacts usually fall under three categories: direct, indirect, and
macroeconomic (also called secondary) effects. Direct losses occur from physical
damage to assets including public infrastructure (e.g., school buildings, energy
distribution lines, residential and nonresidential buildings, industrial plants and
factories and agricultural assets). Indirect losses, on the other hand, include declines
in production capacity due to damaged machineries of industries, future harvests,
reduced income, increased cost in the provision of basic services due to damaged
infrastructures and lifelines.

Direct and indirect losses ultimately influence macroeconomic indicators, such
as gross domestic product (GDP), consumption, inflation and employment. These
macroeconomic indicators are affected not only by the direct impacts of the disasters
but also by the reallocation of government resources to relief and reconstruction.

These types of information are gathered from the field and officially communicated
by the National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) to the public. The data
on affected, displaced and missing persons can be used to estimate supplies and
financing for humanitarian aid. Collectively, the monetary value of houses destroyed
(private property), agriculture and infrastructure are referred to as damage to
property or the direct economic losses. The desirable data for valuing property
damage is the replacement cost but it is possible that reported costs may only be for
emergency repairs.

A. EStiMAtiNg DirECt DAMAgE

Since these Guidelines are intended to guide the land use and physical framework
plans of provinces and regions, direct damage may be computed to correspond to
the land use components, i.e., settlements, production, protection and infrastructure.
However, it is not possible at this time to value everything covered by these land use
components. In order to do this, there would be a need for inventory of all structures,
economic activities, and environmental systems in order to fully put a value for
replacing them when damaged by a hazard event. The approximate location (spatial
coordinates) would also be important under the Geographic Information System
approach, leading to the use of Global Positioning System and ortho-aerial photos.

For purposes of these Guidelines, the following indicators are used: (a) built-up areas
to represent the settlements and some structures in production areas (e.g., commercial
and industrial buildings); and (b) agricultural crops to represent the production
land use. Monetary value of damage to public infrastructures such as roads, bridges,
schoolbuildings, as well as protection areas, particularly the environment and
ecosystems are not covered. However, the qualitative impact of disasters on these
categories is evaluated in the vulnerability analysis for the priority areas (Step 4 of the
risk assessment methodology).

1. BuIlT-uP AREAS

Settlement land use areas cover those parts of the province’s territory where
residential, commercial and institutional buildings are located. The procedure for
estimating value of built-up areas, however, is not limited to these types of structures.
It also covers industrial facilities such as factories (production land use) and other
nonresidential structures.

The built-up area is approximated by the floor areas comprising residential and
nonresidential buildings. The residential area reflects a composite floor area
comprising different types of residential construction covering single detached, duplex
type/ quadruplex, apartment, accessoria, residential condominium and other buildings
with related functions. The nonresidential buildings reflect a composite floor area
comprising different types of residential construction commercial areas, industrial
areas, institutional and agricultural buildings and others.

In particular, the commercial floor area is a composite area representing the floor
areas of banks, motels, hotels, condominiums, office buildings, stores, and other
buildings with related functions. The industrial area considers floor areas of factories,
repair shops/ machine shops, refinery, printing press and others. The numbers of
the buildings from each type or category of building floor area (i.e., residential and
nonresidential) may be used to get a weighted average composite unit cost, which will
be used as replacement cost per sq m of floor area.

National Statistics Office (NSO) data on Floor Area and Value of Building
Construction, by Type of Building, By Region and Province will be the basic source of
information for computing property value (or replacement cost) for the built-up areas.
Table A4.1 is a sample table for Region XIII and its component provinces.

The built-up area is approximated by the floor areas comprising the total floor area
(TFA) of construction for all type of buildings, generally categorized as residential
floor area (RFA) and nonresidential floor area (NRFA).

Looking at the NSO data, the 2000 Census of Population and Housing (CPH) is
cumulative, that is, it gives us the snapshot of the floor area (by range) of residential
structures in the province. This represents the RFA of the province. NSO began to
collect quarterly data beginning 2002. There is no data for 2001.

Several assumptions are used in determining the value of property of
built-up areas using floor area and value of building construction of
NSO. One, the residential floor area generated by the 2000 CPH is also
assumed to be the total floor area. Two, there is no data for 2001, and it is
therefore assumed that the 2000 census data is maintained for 2001. The
resulting “underestimation” in a way compensates for the assumption
that all construction permits were translated to actual construction.

The user may wish to compute for the 2001 data and the nonresidential
floor area for 2000 using growth rate or time series methodologies.

For accurate data, the user may have to undertake an inventory of the
number or the floor area and value of all structures in the locality.

1.1 Deriving TFA from 2000 CPH
With reference to Table A4.2, columns (1) and (2) represent the data from the 2000
Census of Population and Housing (CPH). In order to derive the Total Floor Area
(TFA) from these information, obtain first the average area (column 3) in the given
range, multiply this with the corresponding number of households then sum up
this floor area by average range to get the TFA for a given municipality. The same
procedure has been applied for all municipalities of Surigao del Norte. The results are
shown in Table A4.3. Based on these assumptions, the TFA is also the RFA.

1.2 Computing for the TFA of reference year
In the absence of 2001 data, the 2000 data are assumed to be constant up to year 2001.
To compute for the 2007 data, the quarterly data from 2002 to 2007 (up to 3rd quarter
only as of publication) are added to the 2000 data.

Table A4.4 shows Surigao del Norte TFA and RFA as of 3rd quarter of 2007.

1.3 Computing for the TFA and RFA per municipality
In the absence of municipal data for 2002 onwards, the proportionate share of the
municipality to the provincial data is computed using the 2000 data in Table A4.3. This
share is assumed to be constant and shall be applied to the reference year provincial
data to get the municipal breakdown of the TFA and RFA for that reference year.

To get the municipal breakdown for Surigao del Norte as of 3rd quarter of 2007, the
municipal share was computed using the TFA data per municipality in Table A4.3. For
Alegria, the proportionate share of the municipality is the TFA of Alegria divided by
the provincial TFA or (118,698.0 / 2,750,453.1) or 0.043. This share is assumed to be
the same in computing for the RFA. This proportion is then applied to the 2007 RFA
and TFA data (columns 3 and 4 of Table A4.5).

1.5 Calculating for Property Value of Built-Up Areas in Surigao del Norte

2. PRODuCTION AREAS

The unit values, particularly TFA and RFA, are then multiplied to get the property
value for built-up areas in Surigao del Norte. The results are shown in Table A4.7.
Columns (2) and (5) came from Columns (3) and (4) of Table A4.5.

Production areas comprise intensive and multiple uses geared towards food production,
cash crops and extraction of natural resources for their economic value. These areas
include: production forests (in slopes below 50% and predominantly with second growth
dipterocarps with brush and grass), alienable and disposable forest, agricultural lands
(e.g., rice lands, sugarcane, corn and other croplands), agro industrial estates (e.g.,
piggery and poultry farms, processing industries, etc.) and aquaculture areas.

The values applied to the various land components would depend mainly on the
majority type of the land cover. While it is possible to obtain the various parcels for
each cover, the task may be tedious initially (at provincial or regional level) when
aggregated from the municipal levels. For example, in obtaining areas and values for

227

production forests, one has to determine location and coverage, as well as spacing of
trees and the existing growth stages. For agricultural areas, the type of crops, coverage,
stage of growth and type of irrigation afforded would actually determine unit costs.
Hence, simplifications can be made for the valuation. One way is to reduce coverage
and consider only main agriculture production units, take average costs over the area
assuming production values at an aggregated level ( e.g., province or region ), and
assume that the agricultural crops are at their mature stages (i.e., greater damages
expected for harvestable crops). Buildings in farms and processing industries may
have been counted in the built-up areas and hence are no longer included in the
estimates. Their segregation from the built-up areas and inclusion in these sections
may not be necessary since the factors used to proportion damage costs are applied
uniformly regardless of use or crop type. For aquaculture areas, valuation may be
based on a per hectare value depending on the type of aquaculture products. Typically,
for example, the stage of growth of the fish is important in valuation – fries, fingerlings
or matured fish. The values may be obtained from municipal agricultural offices or
from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.

In the Guidelines, valuing focuses on agricultural lands. In valuing agricultural
crops for damage assessment, replacement cost or the production cost per hectare is
used. In general, the unit costs may be obtained from municipal, city and provincial
agricultural offices. It would be ideal to use provincial or regional data but, in their
absence, the national estimates of the Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS) of the
Department of Agriculture (DA), as follows, can be used:

3. INFRASTRuCTuRE

Potential costs of damage to major infrastructure and public utilities can also be
computed. Estimating the cost of potential damage does not only reveal the magnitude
of the losses and damages from a disaster but also initially estimates in advance the
reconstruction and rehabilitation costs. Further, it should be used to assess and justify
the implementation of the necessary intervention measures to mitigate and reduce
the potential damages and losses to the region /province. Ideally, the costs attendant
to the mitigation is justified when such costs are far less than the estimated costs of
potential damages and losses. The damage cost estimation of infrastructure therefore
provides the bases for the social and political acceptability of mitigation proposals.

However, it is best to value only those infrastructures and utilities that are critical to
the region or province, such as:

a. Those needed to realize the desired urban form or spatial strategy (e.g., roads,

c.

b.

airports, ports);
Those that support production activities (e.g., irrigation, impounding systems,
etc.);
Those that serve as lifelines to communities during disasters or ensure health
and safety of settlements/population;
Those that provide protection and reduce vulnerability of areas from natural
hazards (e.g., flood control dikes, slope stabilizing retaining walls, etc.); and
e. Those that are used to provide a level of service (e.g., community water supply

d.

and distribution levels 1, 2, 3, etc.).

Unlike damages applied on built-up and agricultural areas where aggregate values
are obtained, computing for cost of damage on these elements are site-specific and
only requires determining the cost of rebuilding the road or section of a road that
may be damaged. For example, cost of damage to roads, bridges and other supporting
structures by region can be availed from regional offices of the Department of Public
Works and Highways (DPWH). This agency conducts its own damage estimation and
values the damages at reestablishment or cost of repair per kilometer, as illustrated by
the following examples from the repair cost for roads in CARAGA region, 2007:

Computing for replacement cost depends on the type of infrastructure or utilities, and that
for each type, different variables should be considered. It is therefore advisable to consult
with experts or mandated agencies on how to value infrastructures and utilities. Table
A4.12 below can be used as a guide.

4. PROTECTED AREAS

2. INDuSTRy SECTOR

Valuing forests, protected sanctuaries, or watersheds is difficult. Nonetheless, putting
a value to protected areas emphasizes the need to protect and to restore them into
their original state after a disaster.

In trade and industry, indirect effects include reduced production, temporary
employment losses, and the differential impact on women. Following are the available
methodologies for indirect damage cost estimation:

What the Guidelines could suggest at this time is on the cost of reforestation. Again,
computing for replacement cost depends on what is inside the protected areas. The
region or province is thus advised to consult with experts or mandated agencies on
existing or proposed methods on how to estimate cost of replacing what are in the
protected area, such as DENR’s cost of reforestation below (DENR MC/19, 2000):

Reforestation cost per hectare:
2m x 3m = P43,146/ hectare
5m x 2m = P33,267 / hectare
4m x 4 m = P21,907 / hectare

B. EStiMAtiNg iNDirECt DAMAgE

1. AGRICulTuRE SECTOR

In the agriculture, livestock and fisheries sectors, indirect effects include reduced
yields in future crops, no planting of future crops, reduced fishing, loss of
employment, and differential impact on women.

The DA implements a comprehensive methodology in assessing the damages to crops,
livestock and fishery incurred by farmers and fishermen during disasters. Information
such as type and variety of crop, growth stage of crop, area planted, wind speed,
amount of rainfall, among others are gathered to determine the degree in which crops
are salvageable or recoverable. The methodology also incorporates some assumptions
on average crop productivity and input costs. This set of information is then used to
compute the volume and value of production loss as a result of the disaster.

2.1 Manufacturing
When hazard events impact utilities, these may cause disruption over a period of time.
For example, toppled electrical posts in some parts of the city may cause brownouts
for a few hours to days; while major damages can cause brownouts for weeks. As
a result of a loss of utility, manufacturing firms may limit their production or even
close for a number of days until services are restored. Although these firms usually
have back-up facilities in their possession, these units cannot sustain power for a
longer period and at some point a pause in production becomes necessary. Hence for
estimating losses, determining the number of days of operation disrupted and the per
day loss in net income may be undertaken.

2.2 Mining
The data available for the mining industry can be obtained from the list of mining and
quarrying establishments. The establishments are categorized based on the number
of employees and the industry group. By number of employees, the establishment is
grouped into two, one with an average employment of less than 20 and the other with
more than 20 (Census, 2007). By industry group, the establishments are divided into the
following groups: (a) extraction and production of crude petroleum, and natural gas;
(b) coal mining; (c) gold ore mining; (d) stone quarrying, clay and sand pits; (e) other
nonmetallic mining and quarrying; (f) copper ore mining; (g) chromites ore mining;
and (h) other metallic ore mining. The potential damage to each mining group can be
estimated by the reduction in income per day due to disruption of mining operations.

3. POwER, wATER AND TRANSPORTATION AND COMMuNICATION SECTORS

3.1 Power Supply
While the Guidelines do not suggest the estimation of the wide range of indirect losses,
the discussions herein provide the definitions of some of the indirect costs obtained
from the post-disaster assessment by NDCC-OCD. In the case of power, indirect
effects include only the reduction in income due to fall in demand. The damage cost
due to power loss can be calculated by the number of potential subscribers affected, or
through income losses to the power provider due to nonprovision of power service per
day multiplied by the number of days of power disruption.

233

3.2 Water Supply
For water, indirect effects include only the reduction in income due to fall in water
demand. The indirect cost of the water is basically the loss in income of the water
provider per day and can be calculated by determining the number of potential
subscribers affected for specific days.

3.3 Transportation
In the transport sector, indirect effects include income loss due to the cancellation and
delay of numerous trips (e.g., land, sea and air). A simple estimation can be made by
summing up all different modes of transport trips: (Income lost per air trip x Number
of trips/day) + (Income lost sea trip x Number of trip/day) + (Sum of the income lost
by different modes of the road trip whether by jeepney, bus, etc + Number of trip/day).

3.4 Telecommunication
For estimating telecommunication indirect loss, the same concept as estimating cost
of water production loss can be used. The data should be collected from telephone
service providers. The concept is based on the loss of income per day and can be
calculated by knowing the number of potential subscribers affected due to the
disruption of telecommunication service for a specific number of days.

These Guidelines recognize the usefulness of estimating risks in guiding disaster
management approaches. The methodologies to estimate risks to life and to property
provide indications on where the needs for intervention are more urgent, or what
mitigation measures are appropriate. However, the analysis can be further enhanced
by strengthening the mechanism for valuing indirect losses from disasters, which
would provide a more comprehensive and accurate account of their social, economic
and environmental impacts.

The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Carribean (ECLAC) developed
a methodology for assessing the direct and indirect effects of natural disasters and
their consequences on the social wellbeing and economic performance of the affected
country or area. The ECLAC asserts that the assessment need not entail quantitative
precision but must be comprehensive enough to include the complete range of effects
and their cross-implications on the economic and social sectors, physical infrastructure

and environment. With these estimates, it is possible to determine the extent of
reconstruction requirements and for identifying and undertaking reconstruction
and mitigation programs and projects (ECLAC and IBRD, Handbook for Estimating
the Socio-Economic and Environmental Effects of Disaster, 2003). The methodology
proposed by ECLAC in assessing disaster damages is useful for decision-making
purposes in all the aspects of disaster mitigation, preparedness and prevention.

The NDCC through the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) tested the ECLAC
methodology in assessing the socioeconomic impact of Typhoon Harurot (UNESCAP-
NDCC, 2005). The test revealed that there are certain limitations to the methodology
that include, among others:

•
•

•
•

limited or unavailability of data;
rate of depreciation of the damaged infrastructure not reflected when
replacement or cost of repair is computed;
lack of criteria for valuing destroyed or damaged structures; and
impact across populations and their vulnerability are not counted.

A modified Disaster Impact Calculator was eventually developed by OCD and
UNESCAP. The Calculator is a software application (in MS Excel) where users can
input and store data and calculate damages, the output of which serves as a rapid
impact assessment tool for estimating damages incurred from a disaster event.
The Calculator was a response to the recommendations of various agencies to
retrofit ECLAC’s method to the Philippine setting. The Calculator provides, among
others, standard content and format in tabulating the damages, including a list of
preidentified type of data that will be gathered from the field; a standard conversion of
damaged areas comprising lands and crops in monetary value; and national, regional
and provincial and other local macroeconomic indicators.

The ECLAC method as developed by NDCC has six steps in calculating total damages:

a.

b.

c.

Direct damages are assessed using cost of repair or replacement cost, as the
case maybe, for the tangible assets or stocks;
Indirect damages are estimated using the principle of opportunity cost
incurred by the agents in the economy due to the disruption of economic
activities;
Indirect damages for agriculture, trade and industry, tourism and other
services are then multiplied to their corresponding gross value added (GVA)
ratios derived from the National Input-Output-Accounts;

235

d. The resulting losses, expressed in nominal GVA are then adjusted for inflation
using a price deflator. The losses are then summed up and expressed in terms
of percentage point loss in the GDP growth rate;

e. Upon determination of the percentage point/s taken away from the GDP,

the potential tax revenue loss per percentage point reduction in GDP is then
calculated through the use of a tax elasticity; and

f. The total damage and losses to the economy are then summed up.

A crucial factor in using the ECLAC calculator is availability of data, as the formula on
estimating damage can only work if certain information is available. Indeed, planning
and policy decisions may benefit regions and provinces which are able to gather, store,
maintain and update information on damages and fatalities, and then transform these
information to knowledge that will help them act on their risks.

To address problems arising from data inaccuracy, limited coverage, and
disaggregation, the NDCC has revised report formats to capture direct losses, while
measuring indirect losses through the ECLAC methodology (Provention, CRED, &
UNDA, 2006). Even though NDCC through OCD, had been compiling data for a
national disaster database since 1990 (Communiqué, 2003), the period of collection is
still short and the data collected are more on direct damages.

Nonetheless, the following challenges can be incorporated in proposed policy on data
collection to ensure effective application of the modified ECLAC method in the future:

•

•

Come up with standard data collection technique that can be applicable across
all the actors involved;
Develop analytical systems in generating data not for need analysis only but
also for the use of disaster risk reduction activities; and

• Promote the collection of indirect damage data.

The Child Rights-Based Disaster Management Study of NDCC suggested
improvements in the data collection system to improve damage risk assessments.

The study suggests that an inventory of the area at its predisaster state would
be needed in order to establish baseline of the number of population and the
potential number of affected. This will help identify members of the population
who could be affected in a disaster. This will help identify their location, condition
and characteristics that are important in determining their physical condition (see
vulnerability analysis in Chapter 4). Other factors that must be included are:

replacement costs for these elements;
importance;

•
•
• existing vulnerability functions;
•
• Contents of buildings.

ID of their type and their location; and

risk maps immediately after the occurrence of a strong and potentially damaging
earthquake. The REDAS software can be used to conduct seismic hazard and risk
assessment, sort earthquake data parameters, produce map of different sizes, perform
screen digitization, and develop risk database.

Essentially, the REDAS provides a computer simulation of the effects of an earthquake
or other natural disaster (typhoons, tsunamis) on a specific location after the disaster
happens. In the case of the July 1990, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Luzon in
1990 where the epicenter of that quake was located at 15º 42’ N and 121º 7’ E near
the town of Rizal, Nueva Ecija, northeast of Cabanatuan City. Once the magnitude
and epicenter of the quake are entered in REDAS, the software will produce a digital
map that shows the expected extent and magnitude of shaking in areas like Baguio,
Pangasinan, La Union, Manila, etc.

The software provides information on particular areas where danger of earthquake-
induced landslides and liquefaction (mixing of solid and groundwater), and other
hazardous effects. Knowing the possible location that effects of earthquake may be
strongly felt to an area will enable disaster officials to make quick, more effective
decisions about relief and rescue operations.

The REDAS includes a database of information that includes multi-hazards maps
that include the geological features of an area and the natural disasters to which such
an area is susceptible. REDAS may incorporate data on the elements at risk through
direct digitations or keyboard entry. Therefore, it can be used as an alternative to
commercial GIS software packages.

For rapid hazard damage assessment, REDAS is a handy tool for local disaster
management. REDAS can immediately plot identified active faults so that a user

annex 5
derivinG factors for fatality and factors for
ProPerty damaGe

These Guidelines use the following mathematical expression to compute for risk:

Risk = Hazard x Elements at risk x Vulnerability

- where hazard is expressed in return period (derived in Chapter 4 and Annex 3);
- elements at risk are the exposed population, expressed in lives lost; and property,

expressed in peso value of property damage (derived in Annex 4); and

- vulnerability expressed in degree of loss from 0 to 1 or 0 to 100% expressed

as factor for fatality and factor for property damage (derived in Chapter 4 and
Annex 5).

The factors developed in these Guidelines estimate the probable proportion of
fatalities to the population and probable proportion of damage to properties from a
hazard event. This is part of the second step, Consequence Analysis, of the disaster
risk assessment methodology described in Chapters 3 and 4 of the Guidelines.

Factor for fatality is a multiplier from 0 to 1 that represents the portion of the total
exposed population that has potential to be killed in a given location as a consequence
of a hazard event of a specific magnitude. The basic premise is that likelihood of
fatality is affected by concentration of population (i.e., population density) in the
hazard prone areas, such that less dense areas will have lower fatality levels as
compared with high dense areas.

On the other hand, factor for property damage is defined as a percentage of the total
exposed property that has potential for damage as a consequence of a hazard event of
a specific magnitude.

A. fACtor for fAtALitY

The factors for fatality, shown using a series of matrices, were estimated from disaster
damage and loss data at the national level and from comparisons of different hazard
events. The numbers are basically indicative.

1. EARTHquAkE-RElATED HAzARDS

Table A5.1 Past Earthquake Occurrences

Factors for fatality for earthquake-related hazards were based on the Metropolitan
Manila Earthquake Impact Reduction Study (MMEIRS) prepared by Philippine
Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA).

MMEIRS simulated a scenario (called Model 8) in case West Valley Fault (an inland
fault) triggers a 7.2 magnitude earthquake (PEIS, VIII) and affects a high density area
like Metro Manila. Using data on past earthquake magnitude, population density and
physical structures, results revealed that the possible percentage of fatality against the
population was 0.3 percent, for a population density of 1,500/km2.

The same value was used in these Guidelines to compute for potential fatality in
earthquake-related hazards under a worst case scenario, i.e., magnitude of > 7.0.
This is because the g value of Metro Manila (0.39 g) is almost at the midrange of the
g values of the country’s seismic zones (0.17-0.56 g), in medium soil. However, this
default value will overestimate potential impact to provinces with lower g values (i.e.,
Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental and Siquijor in Region 7 and Cagayan, Isabela, and
Quirino in Region 2) and underestimate for provinces with higher g values (i.e., Davao,
Compostela Valley, and Davao Oriental in Region 11).

A review of recorded earthquake events by NDCC from 1968 to 2003 gives credence
to the use of the MMEIRS estimate. Table A5.1 shows that in eight out of nine
earthquake events, fatalities as a percentage of the total affected population do not
exceed 0.3 percent.

There is uncertainty in defining rates from historical reviews because the potential
number of affected population per unit area (e.g., per sq km) is not predefined and
that the reporting system typically presents aggregates and not rates over a fixed
geographic area. This is also a similar problem in coming up with other fatality and
damage rates from other hazards. Hence, the value taken from the MMEIRS studies
is used here since the rate is based on a fixed boundary. The factor for fatality of 0.3
percent can be used as benchmark in these Guidelines for hazard events of worst case
scenario, i.e., with magnitude > 7.0.

For purposes of estimating the factors for moderate events of magnitude 6.2-6.9
and low events of magnitude 4.9-6.1, it is assumed that potentials for fatality across
these ranges are linear. Since there are three levels of event (HSA, MSA, LSA or
Frequent, Likely and Rare), the factors for fatality and property damage are distributed
proportionally across these levels of event as well as across population density levels.
Thus, the highest magnitude level of >7.0 is twice more destructive in terms of risk
of fatality than the next magnitude level (6.2-6.9) and thrice more destructive than
the lowest magnitude level of 4.9-6.1. The same analogy holds true for the various
population density levels. The factor for fatality in areas with high population density
(500 persons/sq km) is two times higher than the medium population density (250-
500) and three times higher than the low population density (<250 persons/sq km).

The factor for fatality for each level of susceptibility is derived as follows:

a. Divide the estimated factor for fatality of 0.3 percent for magnitude > 7 by 3 to
get 0.1 percent. Thus, the factor for fatality of 0.1 percent shall be assigned to
low population density level (<200persons/sq km), 0.2 percent factor for fatality
for medium population density level (250-500 persons/sq km), and 0.3 percent
for high population density level (> 500 persons/sq km). See last row of Table
A5.2.

b. Repeat the same procedure in step a) but this time, use the 0.2 percent value

and divide it by 3 to get 0.066 percent. This will be the difference in the factor
for fatality for each population density levels under the magnitude range of 6.2
– 6.9. Thus, the factor for fatality of 0.066 percent shall be assigned to the low
population density level; double this value for the medium population density
level; and triple the value for the high population density level. See second to the
last row of Table A5.2.

c. Repeat the same procedure in step a) but this time using the value of 0.1 percent
and divide it by 3 to get the difference of 0.33 percent for magnitude range 4.9 –
6.1.

It has to be emphasized that these values are estimates which warrant refinement

estimates require local scenarios to adjust the values to local conditions.

2. HAzARDS FROM vOlCANIC ERuPTIONS

The factors for fatality for volcanic eruptions were computed based on the 100-year
data of the Center for Research and Epidemiology of Disasters-Emergency Database
(CRED-EM/DAT) presented in Table A5.4. The table presents the aggregated number
of fatalities against the number of affected populations from 19 volcanic eruptions
recorded in 1905-2005.

There were a total of 2,996 fatalities from volcanic eruptions, out of the 1,541,518 total
affected population. Following the formula for factor for fatality, FF = no. of dead/ no.
of affected persons, this results in a factor for fatality of 0.002, for a 100-year period.
Since volcanic hazards have return periods of 300 years as worst case scenario, the
0.002 factor was assigned to frequent events (>500 person/km2 density), as shown in
Table A5.3.

Then, similar to the computation done on earthquake related hazards, the factors
for fatality and property damage are distributed proportionally across these levels of
events (HSA, MSA, LSA, or Frequent, Likely, and Rare). This results in a factor of 6.00
x 10-3 for worst case scenario. It follows the assumption that with stronger eruptions,
fatality rates increase, since coverage may be wider and the intensity greater. The
factors for fatality are shown in Table A5.3.

Event rates should normally consider specific volcanoes as reference; hence the
average taken here does not consider these assumptions. Local studies to establish
rates of occurrence and consequence on active volcanoes need to be pursued.

3. HyDROMETEOROlOGIC HAzARDS

3.1. Floods
The 100-year data of CRED-EM/DAT in Table A5.4 registered 63 events, 2,661
fatalities with 10,432,410 population affected and loss of US$431.231million. Taken
on an event basis, this translates to about 42 killed, 165,594 persons affected and
US$6.845 million in property damage.

An estimate for the factor for fatality based on this record shown is computed as:

Factor for fatality

= no. of dead /no. of affected persons
= 42/ 165,594
= 2.54 x 10-4 fatality/person (2.54 in 10,000)

Events included in the aggregation are assumed to be independent events that have
varied return periods and varying geographic coverage. It is assumed that stronger
events (higher return periods, frequent events) contribute to the averages.

A comparison is made from shorter period reports. Table A5.5 shows yearly summary
aggregates of affected population, not specific to provinces or smaller areas, and are
contributions from different flood events. Based on the period 2001-2006 on flood
occurrences in Table A5.5, lower averages of fatality rates have been recorded (5.15 in
100,000 to 1.09 in 10,000).

Several factors affect the accuracy of the number such as the actual boundaries of
affected population and geographic factors, among others. In view of these limitations,
an initial estimate is taken for frequent events using the factor 1x10-4 (1 in 10,000).

Stronger events (likely events) are further assumed to create twice the risk for affected
areas. Recall in Chapter 4 that hazard flooding maps only classify areas as prone or not
prone to flooding.

Having set the upper thresholds for the different events, the corresponding values
for population densities (persons/ sq km) less than 250, and the range of 250-500 are
assigned values one third and two thirds of the threshold set at 500 persons/sq km,
respectively.

The values used are initial estimates subject to validation for each area.

Box A5.1 Return Period and Factors for Fatality and Damage: Floods

in Chapter 4, it has been clarified that these factors are applicable only to areas that are
prone to flooding as reflected in the flood susceptibility maps or flood hazard maps. it will
be up to the planner to assess flooding in the area based on past occurrences to determine
whether to use frequent or likely factors for fatality. definitions of frequent and likely events
presented in Chapter 3 are as follows:

(a) Frequent – many events are frequent over a lifetime; and
(b) likely – a single event is likely over a lifetime.

a return period of ≤10 years is assigned to frequent events and > 10 years for likely events.
the surigao del norte disaster risk assessment identifies the flood-prone areas as likely
events with a return period of 100.

3.2. Rain-induced Landslides
Records on rain-induced landslides (Table A5.7) report the number of persons
affected in specific areas. The factors for fatality range from 10-2 to 10-3, higher than
the values for flood and earthquake events. The danger of using high values, however,
may create an impression that landslides cause more deaths per year compared to
earthquakes and floods, which may not be accurate for the Philippines.

Thus, it is suggested that the factor for fatality for frequent events (5 years and below)
be set to 1x10-4, comparable with that for floods. Likely events (6 to 25 years) are
further assumed to create risk to an individual twice this number; and rare events at
thrice the risk. These numbers are assigned to population densities higher than 500
persons/sq km.

km are assigned values one third and two thirds of the threshold set at 500 persons/sq
km, respectively (Table A5.8).

In the absence of more information regarding fatality factors, it is suggested that
local values be determined from predefined potentially affected areas using overlays
of hazard maps and barangay maps. The affected area may be gridded in squares
and future actual affected population and actual fatalities will be counted in these
grids. Spatial factors may be obtained differentiating fatality rates for each potentially
affected area. Comparisons may then be made across affected areas.

3.2. Storm Surges
Based on the 100-year data by CRED-EM/DAT in Table A5.4, six events of storm
surges have been registered, with 61 fatalities among 6,262 people affected and a
loss of US$2.3 million. Taken on an event basis, this results in about 12 killed, 1,044
persons affected and US$0.38 million worth of losses. The events are taken to be likely
events (6 events in 100 years).

Based on Table A5.4, an estimate for the factor for fatality is computed as:

Factor of fatality = no. of dead / no. of affected persons

= 12/ 1044
= 1.19x10-2 fatality/person (for likely events)

The average factor for fatality is in the order of 10-2 and is quite high. The potential
impact areas of coastal surges are limited unlike floods and earthquakes. In a similar
argument as with rain-induced landslides, aggregating the values without the proper
spatial referencing may cause values to be higher, since it is possible that the affected
persons are concentrated in one area and does not represent a proper distribution
of fatalities in different coastlines of the country. For example, in August 2006, a
storm surge hit Zamboanga del Sur, affecting one city, eight municipalities and seven
barangays, with one killed among 4,075 people affected (factor for fatality would
be 2.45x 10-4). In 2003, six incidents of storm surges were recorded (OCD-NDCC)
resulting in one death and 1,205 affected persons (factor for fatality is 8.3x10-4).

While these may provide evidence to the argument, the actual fatality factors vary
across the country and hence field validation is needed to determine representative
values for the various segments of the coastlines. For these guidelines, it is suggested
that the values be initially set to 1x10-3 under likely events.

1. EARTHquAkE-RElATED HAzARDS

The same assumptions as those for factors for fatality are followed in determining the
factors for property damage across magnitude ranges and property values.

MMEIRS indicates a factor for property damage of 12.7 percent under a 7.2 magnitude
(PEIS, VIII) earthquake in a high population density area. The same factor is used for
events with magnitude of > 7.0 (worst case scenario).

It is assumed that factors for property damage can be applied to provinces with similar
g value as Metro Manila. However, using this default value will overestimate risks for
provinces of Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental and Siquijor in Region 7 and provinces of
Cagayan, Isabela, and Quirino in Region 2, and underestimate risk for parts of Davao
(0.56 g value).

The assumption here is that these factors are only applicable to damage in built-up areas
and not for damage to agricultural crops. Generally, earthquake-related hazards have
very significant impact on built-up areas.

This number means that the scale of potential damage for hazards from volcanic

for the factor for damage for earthquakes, the factor for damage for hazards from
volcanic eruptions is assumed to be scale (0.3) x (12.7) or 3.8 percent

The value is set for frequent events. The factors for the likely and rare events under
the >100 million value are assumed twice and thrice this value following a linear
proportion.

Again, it has to be emphasized that these values are estimates which warrant
refinement and subject to historical reviews and possibly earthquake simulations.

2. HAzARDS FROM vOlCANIC ERuPTIONS

Based on CRED EM-DAT data, average event damage for volcanic eruptions (assumed
in these Guidelines as frequent) is US$11,998. Comparing this with the average
earthquake event damage:

3.1. Floods
A review of related literature indicates that a general approximation of damage would
be possibly on result of a study done by the National Disaster Coordinating Council
(NDCC) and World Bank entitled “National Disaster Risk Management in Philippines:
Enhancing Poverty Alleviation through Disaster Reduction.” Similarly, it makes use of
the total number of deaths and the total number of affected population presented in
Table A5.4 also sourced and summarized from the CRED-EM/DAT database.

253

The factor for property damage cannot be computed directly since only costs of
damage are recorded. The amount of property value from which a percentage is
computed should also be available. A scaling of damages is then used to obtain
estimates of these percentages (or the factors for property damage).

Based on Table A5.4, the average damage for flood events (assumed in these
Guidelines as frequently occurring) is about US$6.845 million. Comparing this with
the average earthquake event damage:

Scale = Floods Damage/Earthquake Damage

= 6.845/40.147
= 0.17

This number means that the scale of potential damage for hazards from floods is
0.17 or 17 percent of earthquake damage. Rounding this figure to 15 percent and
benchmarking this with MMEIRS value of factor of damage for earthquakes of 12.7
percent, the value for the factor for property damage for earthquakes is (0.15) x (12.7)
= 1.9 percent or 2.0 percent.

It is then assumed that for frequent flood events a threshold may be set initially to 2.0
percent. Likely events are further assumed to create risk to an area twice this number.
These numbers are assigned property values higher than PhP100 million.

Having set the upper thresholds for the different events, the corresponding factors
for property values in the range of below PhP10 million, and between PhP10 million
– PhP100 million are assigned values one third and two thirds of the threshold set at
PhP100 million, respectively.

Taking the factor of 2 percent at face value for agricultural areas (especially for those
planted with crops) is quite low but may be true for built up areas. In most cases,
damages are generally higher for agricultural areas arising from a wider coverage of
floods and damage to crops. In likely events, it may be assumed, as a first estimate,
that the crop areas suffer 100 percent loss or a factor of 1. Table A5.13 presents
factors used for crop damage.

Refer to Box A5.1 for explanation on return period and factors for fatality and
property damage for floods.

3.2 Rain-induced Landslides
The factor for damage cannot be obtained directly from the records of rain-induced
landslides (RIL) since very few data are existing to establish percentages. Based on
CRED-EM/DAT data, damage for landslide events (assumed in these Guidelines as
frequent events) is US$1.409 million. Comparing this with the average earthquake
event damage:

Scale = Flooding Damage/Earthquake Damage

= 1.409/40.147
= 0.035

This means that the scale of potential damage for rain-induced landslides is 0.035 or
3.5 percent of earthquake damage. Benchmarking this with MMEIRS value of factor of
damage for earthquakes of 12.7 percent, the value for the factor for property damage
for rain-induced landslides is (0.035) x (12.7) = 0.44 percent. For purposes of these
Guidelines, this number has been rounded off to one percent.

For frequent rain-induced landslide events (return period of 5 years), a threshold may
be set initially to 1.0 percent. Likely events (return period of 25 years) are further
assumed to create risk to an area twice this number. These numbers are assigned to
property values higher than PhP100 million.

Having set the upper thresholds for the different events, the factors for property values
in the range of below PhP10 million, and between PhP10 million - PhP100 million
are assigned values one third and two thirds of the threshold set at PhP100 million,
respectively.

In general, it may be assumed that like floods, the damage from rain-induced
landslides is similarly higher for agricultural areas. The factor of property damage
used for the built-up areas (Table A5.14) of 1 percent to 3 percent is quite low for
agricultural areas. As a first estimate, assume that loss is taken as 75 percent of the
areas affected under rare occurrences. Unlike floods which may cover plain areas,
landslides may damage crop areas in slopes and in debris accumulation zones.
Flooding may similarly result from obstructions of river ways or create temporary
dams of flood waters created by debris and large volumes of sediments.

3.3 Storm Surges
Based on CRED EM-DAT data, damage for surges (assumed in these Guidelines as
likely) averages US$ 0.38 million. Comparing this with the average earthquake event
damage:

Scale = Flooding Damage/Earthquake Damage

= 0.38/40.147

= 0.0094

This means that the scale of potential damage for hazards from flooding is 0.0094 or
0.94 percent or approximately one percent of earthquake damage. Benchmarking this
with MMEIRS value of factor of damage for earthquakes of 12.7 percent, the value
for the factor for property damage for earthquakes is (0.01) x (12.7) = 0.127 percent.
However the value may be too low especially for coastal areas. Thus, we assume one
percent as the factor to be used for likely events.

annex 6
Gis-based disaster risk assessment

This annex is divided into three parts. The first introduces the basic concepts of
the Geographic Information System (GIS). The second explains the framework and
assumptions in conducting disaster risk assessment (DRA) under a GIS environment.
The third demonstrates the step-by-step procedure in performing DRA, from hazard
analysis to risk prioritization, as outlined in Chapter 4 using a sample GIS dataset. The
procedures in encoding and digitizing the maps and table were not included anymore as
these can be obtained elsewhere (from GIS texts and software manuals) and varies from
one software package to another.

A. fuNDAMENtAL CoNCEptS

GIS is a set of tools for collecting, storing, manipulating and managing spatially-referenced
information. Strictly, it applies to computer-based systems. A typical GIS consists of
hardware, software, data, people and processes. Spatial features are stored in a coordinate
system (latitude/longitude, state plane, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), etc.)
which references a particular place on the earth. Descriptive attributes in tabular form
are associated with spatial features. Spatial data and associated attributes in the same
coordinate system can then be layered together for mapping and analysis. GIS is widely
used for scientific investigations, resource management, and development planning.

The DRA process discussed in Chapter 4 is iterative and data intensive. Although the
calculations can be done manually or through spreadsheets, the computerized platform
of a GIS has the following advantages:

a.

b.

c.

GIS puts structure and organization to the complex and numerous input planning
variables as it allows integration of the various data sets coming from different
sources;
GIS makes use of reusable sets of information that can be utilized for other
planning-related purposes; and
GIS is a powerful visualization and evaluation tool able to provide rapid and
concise means of presenting DRA results and hence facilitate decision making
and policy formulation.

Figure A6.1 Hypothetical Provincial Boundary Map (Dataset)

However, GIS is still but a tool
that enhances or facilitates
analysis. It cannot replace basic
planning logic or analytical skills.

To perform DRA in a GIS
platform, the following are
needed: data set, software, and a
method of analysis.

1. GIS DATASET

A GIS dataset is composed of a
digitized map and an attribute
table linked internally with
each other. Unlike its paper
counterpart, a GIS map contains
a single theme or layer like
administrative boundary or
hazard. Map features can be a
point, line or polygon type. Also,
each theme contains only one
type of feature although there can
be many features in a theme.

Consider the hypothetical
provincial boundary map
shown in Figure A6.1, which
is an example of a GIS dataset
consisting of five municipalities
(features) represented by five
polygons. This map has an accompanying attribute table (Table A6.1), which consists
of fields or columns that describe the features in the dataset. These feature descriptions
are called attributes.

Each feature is given a unique identifier that is usually located in the first column.
In the example above the unique identifier is MUNI_ID, with attributes like the
municipality name (NAME), the area in kilometers (AREA), and population
(POPULATION).

Fields may be added to the attribute table in which additional description about each
feature may be entered by either assigning a value or computing it from existing fields.
For example, if the population density is desired for each municipality, a POPU_DEN
field can be inserted after the POPULATION field. The value can then be computed
for each feature using a formula, e.g., POPU_DEN = [POPULATION]/[AREA]. The
values can also be entered directly by keyboard entry or from a look-up table based on
criteria from the other fields.

2. SOFTwARE1

GIS software forms an important component of a GIS-based DRA. The worked-out
example of the DRA methodology presented in the next section was implemented
using ArcView® GIS v3.22 software platform and has also been tested in ArcGIS v9.2.
However, the methodology can also be applied in other GIS software packages as
long as the essential routines like sieve mapping (overlays), attribute query and field
calculation functions are present.

Implementing a GIS-based DRA may require considerable initial investment because
of the costs involved in getting the necessary hardware and software, and the human
resource training required to operate the system. The range of prices of GIS software
may vary from free3 to low cost to high end. The price ranges usually correspond to
the functional capabilities, ease of use, and the availability of technical support. While
computing requirements largely depend on the software procured and the volume
of data, an ordinary desktop PC with Pentium® III grade processor with minimum
of 512Mb memory and disk space of about 20Gb may be sufficient to carry out the
methodology at the scale expected of regional and provincial planning.

However, what should be emphasized is that a successful GIS need not be too
expensive. There are open source softwares which can substitute for commercial
softwares. If a GIS is procured only for the purpose of doing the DRA, then it may not
be worth the effort and investment. The GIS data generated from the DRA process
could be (re)used for other physical framework and development planning activities.
On the other hand, the hardware could be also used for ordinary, daily and routine
tasks like spreadsheet and word-processing applications.

users and degree of familiarity.

3. METHODS OF SPATIAl ANAlySIS

Spatial analysis allows for the combination of two or more input GIS datasets to meet
a certain criteria based on spatial relationship of the features present in the input
datasets.

The most common spatial analysis is the overlay method using a UNION relationship
mode. To illustrate this method, consider the hypothetical provincial boundary map
shown earlier.

Figure A6.2 Illustration of Overlays of Different Thematic Maps

(a) provincial Boundary

(b) Hazard map

(c) Combined map using
overlay method (union)

Suppose you want to know which of the municipalities in Figure A6.1 are affected
by a hazard. You need to combine the provincial boundary map and the hazard map.
Suppose, further, the hazard map has the following attributes:

HAzARD_ID

lEvEl

3

2

1

The resulting map is illustrated in map (c) of Figure A6.2. It can be seen that the
original number of features (five for the provincial boundary and three for hazard)
resulted in 20 new features.

The combined table of the boundary and hazard map appears similar to Table A6.3.
Each feature would retain a characteristic from the input features depending on the
location. For example, the municipality Palayan would still be represented by a single
feature since the whole municipality is located within a single hazard zone (LEVEL=3).
Municipalities or portions of municipalities not located in the hazard are given a
hazard LEVEL of zero. On the other hand, portions of the hazard zones not falling
into any municipality feature will not have any entry in the NAME field, as well.

Notice however, that the spatially dependent fields like AREA change in proportion to
the size of the resulting features.

One other mode of overlay is INTERSECT. Through this method, only the portion
common to both datasets are retained in the output. Each combination of attributes
in the input features results in a separate feature. Figure A6.2 shows an example of the
hazard and administrative boundary overlain with each other. It shows that only the
portion common to both hazard zone and administrative boundary are retained.

provides a way to store, process and organize the collected datasets in a spatially-
implicit and consistent manner. This component involves conversion of tabular
and mapped data to relational databases, adding attribute information to digitized

maps and setting boundaries or locations of the element at risk. In this phase, data
integration becomes a challenge especially if data come from various sources.
The main risk assessment component involves identifying, quantifying and evaluating
the risk, given a certain hazard. The whole process of risk assessment as undertaken
in a GIS is discussed in detail in the rest of this Annex. Identifying potential risks
require appreciation of current development and existing land use planning policy.
The quantification and evaluation of risk also depends on the current and desired
physical framework and the prospective development paths. At this stage, defining
different land use categories or development options are essential in order to
determine risk level relative to the value of the elements at risk. The results of a risk
assessment exercise are measures of risk. In a GIS-based environment, risk maps can
also be generated to show areas of relatively high risk, safe or unsafe zones and some
indications or patterns of commonality or contiguity between or among affected areas.

The results of risk assessment are then used to aid the planning process by evaluating
different planning alternatives for a given area against the risk generated by GIS
analysis in a highly visual manner. The suitability of a present or future land use or
development plan can be checked against the level of risk it is situated in. In this
phase, for example, suitability maps can be drawn where planned development is
overlain on the risk map. Decisions can then be made calling for either the adoption
or rejection of one or many planning alternatives based on the presence and value of
associated risks.

2. DATA REquIREMENTS FOR DISASTER RISk ASSESSMENT

2.1. Hazard Maps
The location of hazards can be found from hazard maps which are being produced
by the mandated agencies —Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(PHIVOLCS), Mines and GeoSciences Bureau (MGB), and Philippine Atmospheric,
Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA). On the other
hand, the frequency of hazard occurrences is ascertained from analysis of historical
data. Multihazard maps have been prepared through the READY Project. The
technical reports describe the nature of the hazard level designations.

Table A6.4 shows the minimum contents of the attribute table of each type of map.
The same contents are used in demonstrating the DRA methodology in subsequent
sections.

2.2. Administrative Boundary with Population Data
One of the fundamental data for planning is the administrative boundary. In the
Philippines, there are three main possible sources of administrative boundary. The
first source is the Land Management Service of the Department of Environment and
Natural Resources (LMS-DENR) found in each region, particularly the Field Network

Survey Party (FNSP). The barangay boundary, plotted in their Cadastral Index
Maps (CIMs), is derived during the cadastral surveys and considered more accurate
because of the availability of technical description of their metes and bounds. The
national mapping agency, NAMRIA, depicts municipal boundaries in their base maps.
However, NAMRIA itself claims that these boundaries are approximate. There are five
national maps, 13 regional maps and 77 provincial maps available in NAMRIA as of
2007.

The second possible source is the local government units (LGUs) themselves or
the municipality or component cities. Usually, these LGUs settled on their own
definition of their administrative boundaries that are preferably used in their planning
documents like the Comprehensive Land Use Plans (CLUP). The municipal or city
boundary is then formed by combining the inclusive barangay boundaries.

The third source is the National Statistics Office (NSO) which also has its data on
administrative boundaries up to the level of the barangay. The boundary maps are used
as a basis to define the population for each barangay. Subsequently, the population
density in succeeding levels of administrative unit (barangays to municipalities to
provinces) is computed based on these boundaries.

Because of inconsistencies in boundaries from among the sources, questions arise
as to which boundary data should be adopted when performing risk assessment.
It should be borne in mind that the planning scale is much smaller than these
inconsistencies so that boundary conflicts will not significantly affect the outcome of
the risk estimates. Therefore, one should not be deterred from proceeding with the
DRA on the notion that no accurate boundary data is available.

There are many sources of land use maps. The Bureau of Soils and Water Management
(BSWM) of the Department of Agriculture (DA) produced land use maps for
agricultural planning. Most of the Regional Physical Framework Plans (RPFP) make
use of these maps. The land use maps from cities and municipalities were generated as
a requirement in the formulation of their CLUPs. The land use maps of municipalities
and cities within a province can be combined to form a generalized land use map for
the province or region.

2.3. Property values
The Guidelines estimate damage to property using data on damage to built-up and
agricultural areas. Representative property values for built-up areas may be obtained
from the data on residential and nonresidential structures under the Census of
Population and Housing of the NSO. Every quarter the NSO releases, in its website,
the data on the total floor area constructed and cost of construction summarized by
province. The method to compute for the latest total floor area per municipality is
presented in Annex 4.

For agricultural areas, the value considered is the cost of production. The agricultural
office of every province or municipality may have this data. A national average for rice,
corn and other common crops is found in the website of DA.

3. GIS DATA STANDARDS AND MAPPING CONvENTIONS

For the thematic maps to be consistent, certain conventions are used for preparing
geographic datasets from their original form (i.e., the paper maps). In a GIS,
consistency in coordinate systems used is necessary when performing spatial
modelling. Spatial modelling attempts to describe the interaction or processes of real
world objects by using map calculation.

The Philippines Reference System of 1992 (PRS92) is the unified reference system
for surveys and mapping as provided for by Executive Order (EO) No. 45, series of
1993. For purposes of analysis and preparation of the Guidelines, the PRS92 mapping
conventions shall be used with the following parameters:

a. Reference Ellipsoid
The Philippines uses a Clarke 1866 spheroid model with characteristics found
in Table A6.8.

Marinduque Island in the Southern Tagalog Region. That point is at station
Balanacan (a port name) which contains the characteristics found in Table A6.9.

c. Map Projection
Map projection is a system of converting geographic coordinates (latitude,
longitude, height) to flat grid (Northing, Easting, height) plane coordinates.
The standard map projection used for base maps in the Philippines is the
Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM). The Philippines belong to Zone 51
of the UTM with the exception of Palawan (Zone 50) and small parts of
northeastern provinces (Zone 52). The scale factor at the central meridian is
0.9996. The 1:50,000 scale base maps of the NAMRIA are plotted using the
UTM projection.

Major GIS software packages include the PRS92 parameters in their list of reference
systems or possess the flexibility to be customized to include PRS92.

Most casual mapmakers use the Global Positioning Systems (GPS) receivers to
determine the position of features on the ground. The GPS, however, is based on
a set of ellipsoid and datum parameters called the World Geodetic System of 1984
(WGS84). Usually, the WGS84 position measurements are expressed in geographic
coordinates (latitude, to longitude. height). Relative to the scales at which regional
or provincial plans are prepared, the differences in coordinates between PRS92
and WGS84 should not be very large such that it may be negligible. Those with
collected data using a GPS and need to transform the WGS84 coordinates to PRS92
is directed to the Revised Manual of Surveys of the Philippines (DENR Department
Administrative Order 98-12, Section 50) for the detailed instructions.

4. DATA SOuRCES

Paper maps and tabular data are the common sources of geographic data to be entered
in the GIS. These maps or tables are published by mandated agencies. For example,

NAMRIA is responsible for producing topographic data (see Table A6.11 for available
Topographic Maps in NAMRIA) while the NSO is expected to collect demographic
data. Usually, maps are digitized, edited and verified before they could be processed
for GIS-based analysis. On the other hand, nonspatial data such as tables and lists
can be entered in the GIS if it contains at least some form of implicit referencing;
for example, the location of an area with a certain population count and is known by
its place name. If a digitized map contains features with the place name as one of its
attributes, then the tabular data could be linked to the digitized map.

C. riSK EStiMAtioN: WorKED-out EXAMpLE iN ArCViEW™

This section presents the step-by-step procedure in disaster risk assessment discussed
in Chapter 4 using GIS. The example used is Surigao del Norte, and the hazard is Rain-
induced Landslide (RIL).

Based on the procedures as detailed, GIS operations can start only after the Hazard
Characterization and Frequency Analysis are completed. Thus, the following should be
readied before proceeding with the estimations in GIS:

Hazard Inventory Matrix based on information, maps and data sets collected from
mandated agencies

To be able run the risk estimations, shape files of the following maps (including the
attribute table) should be readied:

a. Hazard map
b. Population density per barangay map
c. Municipal boundary map
d. Land use map

The minimum attributes needed for each shape file is indicated in Table A6.4. For
purposes of demonstration, it is assumed that all attributes in Table A6.4 are available.

The worked-out example will use the default return periods contained in Chapter 4,
Table 4.10, Summary Frequency Table which contains the estimated return periods
of all geologic and hydrometeorologic hazards affecting the region or province.

Four major steps in the disaster risk assessment can be performed in GIS,
as follows:

1. Assigning Return Periods
2. Estimating Risk of Fatality

a. Determining Potentially Affected Population for Every Hazard
b. Computing Consequence of Fatality per Hazard Event
c. Estimating Risk of Fatality
3. Estimating Risk of Property Damage

a. Determining Potentially Affected Property for Every Hazard
b. Computing Consequence of Property Damage per Hazard Event
c. Estimating Risk of Property Damage

4. Determining the Composite Priority Score for Each Municipality

1. ASSIGNING RETuRN PERIODS

After gathering all maps and preparing the hazard inventory matrix, the next step is
to assign the return period for each hazard event. Default values were provided in
Chapter 4, in case the hazard map obtained does not provide this information. For
hydrometeorologic hazards such as rain-induced landslides, the indicative return
periods are as follows:

moderate susceptibility

High susceptibility

The “Low susceptibility” in table above is equivalent to the LSA indicated in Table
4.9 in Chapter 4; “Moderate susceptibility” is the MSA; and High Susceptibility,
Accumulation Zone, and Flooded Area are the HSAs. Table 4.9 though already
lumped the accumulation zone and flooded area under HSAs.

The return period should be inputted in the attribute table of the hazard map. In
ArcView™, the assignment of probability of occurrences for hazards can be done in the
following manner:

a. Open the shape file for the hazard, hazard.shp, and make the file editable

(ThemeÒ Start Editing).

b. Open the attribute table (ThemeÒ Table or click on the Table icon). In the

Edit menu, select Add Field.

c. Set field name as RETURN, set the data type as Number with Width set to 8

and 0 Decimal place. Click OK.

d. To select rain-induced hazard areas with no susceptibility (Table A6.12, first
row), go to ArcView main menuÒTable ÒQuery. There should be a field
called “RIL_NO” which refers to the index of the different susceptibility levels.
In the Query dialog box, type:

([Ril_no]) = 1.

Click New Set. Those that match the criteria should be highlighted (e.g., with a
yellow color).

277

e. To assign the corresponding return period to each level of susceptibility, set the
Right-click on the RETURN field. From the ArcView main menu Ò FieldÒ
Calculate. In the dialog box below the (RETURN) =, type 0. The values for
RETURN should change to 0.

f. Follow steps d to e. This time, change the values according to Table A6.12.
For example, to select areas with high susceptibility, flooded areas and
accumulation zones, type in the query box:

[Ril_type]="High susceptibility") OR ([Ril_type]="Flooded area")
OR ([Ril_type]="Accumulation zone")

g. From the ArcView main menu ÒField Ò Calculate. In the dialog box

below the (RETURN) =, type the corresponding return period (e.g., for High
Susceptibility, type 5).

h. Save your modified data (ArcView main menu Ò Table ÒSave Edits)

At this stage, the attribute table of the hazard map should look like this:

2. ESTIMATING RISk OF FATAlITy

2.1. Determining Potentially Affected Population (PAP) for Every Hazard
As indicated in Chapter 4 (under Consequence Analysis), the potentially affected
population is calculated based on the intersection of the overlays of the hazard map
and the population density map.

a. Open the shape file of population density data per barangay and make it ready

for editing (TableÒStart Editing). The barangay population density map should
include, at the minimum, the following attributes:

Save your modified data (ArcView main menu ÒTable Ò Save Edits).

g. Now that the population density map has been updated, combine the density map

and hazard map. In ArcView, this can be done by following these steps:

Open the shape files popden_brgy.shp and hazard.shp and start editing.
Open the Geoprocessing Extension, go to File ÒExtensionsÒ Geoprocessing.
Click on the checkbox and Click OK.

Go to ViewÒGeoprocessing wizardÒUnion two themesÒClick Next >>. Enter
the following:

- Select input theme to union: popden_brgy.shp. Make sure that the “Use selected

features only” is unchecked; and

- Select polygon overlay to union: hazard.shp. Make sure that the “Use selected

features only” is unchecked.

Specify the output file to be popu_risk_hazard.shp. Keep all the default settings as
is. Click OK.

By combining the population density map and the hazard map, barangays – or parts
of barangays – and size of the area that falls under HSA, MSA, or LSA is shown.
The combined map should show that one barangay may fall under one or all of
these three categories. The combined attribute table also shows how many people
are potentially affected in each HSA, MSA, or LSA.

2.2. Computing Consequence of Fatality

a. This step refers to Chapter 4 Section B2.2.1

b. Open the popu_risk_hazard.shp GIS file (if not yet opened). Open the attribute

table and start editing.

d. A field is then added for the consequence per event. Start estimating the

consequence for the High Susceptibility Areas (HSAs) and name this field
CONSEQH. To add a new field, open the attribute table, click on the last column
and select Add Field.

Set field name as CONSEQH, (width:18, Decimal places: 8). Click OK.

Recall that HSAs are those delineated by hazard agencies as highly susceptible to
the given hazard, or frequent events with return period of five years or less.

the divisor “1000000” is used to get area in square kilometers because arcview’s default
unit is square meters. also, it is likely that the attribute table resulting from the union of
population density and hazard maps will have more than one columns of “area.” this is
normal since all fields are being combined in the union command.

as a rule, though, you only need one “area” attribute for the entire process. it is suggested
that you retain only the first “area” attribute (or column) from the left, and update this same
column every time you complete a phase/process. However, this does not preclude you
from adding additional fields to indicate area.

For example, one arEa field may contain the original area of each municipality in the
province. another field (say, area1) may contain the actual area of features (polygon)
within the municipality. retaining the original area of each municipality in arEa is useful
in estimating the proportion of a quantity with respect to a municipality when the data is
available only for a municipality, e.g., quantity for small area = quantity for entire municipality
x arEa of small area / arEa of entire municipality.

to illustrate, rice area is reported per municipality and contained in the field riCEarEa.
therefore, the estimate of rice area for smaller features with arEa1 will be riCarEasmall =
riCEarEa*arEa1/arEa

The reference tables for this operation are Tables 4.21 to 4.25 of Chapter 4. For rain-
induced landslide, Table 4.23 is presented anew for the factors for fatality.

e. Determine the probability of fatality for barangays with population density of less

than 250 people per square kilometer and with return periods less than or equal to
five years (third column, first row of Table 4.23 above). The probability of fatality for
this combination is 0.000033.

2.3. Estimating Risk of Fatality

This step refers to Chapter 4 Section C3.3.1

h. Finally, select those areas where there is consequence from a low frequency

event but none from high and moderate frequency events. Go to ArcView main
menuÒTableÒQuery. In the Query dialog box, type:

The calculation of risk of fatality can be operationalized in ArcView as follows:

[CONSEQH] = 0 OR ([CONSEQM] = 0 AND [CONSEQL] > 0)

a. Open the popu_risk_hazard.shp file and start editing.

i. In the Field Calculator fields list, select the POPU_RISK and enter the following

b. Update the AREA field, click on the AREA field and Calculate

(([Shape].ReturnArea)/1000000)

c. Add another field called POPU_RISK (Number, Width=18, Decimal places=8)

d. Click on the POPU_RISK field heading, right-click and select Field Calculator.

e. Select those areas where there is consequence from a high frequency. Go to
ArcView main menuÒTableÒ Query. In the Query dialog box, type:

expression:

[CONSEQL]*(1/100)

3. ESTIMATING RISk OF PROPERTy DAMAGE

3.1 Determining Potentially Affected Property for Each Type of Hazard
As indicated in Chapter 4 Section B2.2.2, the potentially affected property is estimated
by assigning an indicative value to each land use category that represents the cost of
replacing the lost asset or property within that land. This is done in ArcView through
the following steps:

[CONSEQH]>0

a. Open the land use shape file. Open the attribute table and start editing.

f. In the Field Calculator fields list, select the POPU_RISK and enter the following

expression:

b. Add Field for the unit costing. Go to EditÒAdd Field. Name this field “UNIT_

COST” (Number, Width=18, Decimal places=2).

[CONSEQM]*((1/5)-(1/25))+ [CONSEQL]*((1/25)-(1/100))

Click OK.

g. Select those areas where there is consequence from a moderate frequency event but
none from high frequency event. Go to ArcView main menuÒ TableÒQuery. In
the Query dialog box, type:

[CONSEQH]=0 AND [CONSEQM]>0.

In the Field Calculator fields list, select the POPU_RISK and enter the following
expression:

[CONSEQM]*((1/25)-(1/100))+[CONSEQL]*((1/25)-(1/100))

c. Select the built-up areas and assign unit costing based on Table 4.13 of Chapter 4.
Select the land use feature by ArcView main menuÒTable ÒQuery. In the query
dialog box, type: ([Lu_name])="Built Up Areas"

d. Using the property value for built-up area (residential and nonresidential urban
area) in Table 4.13 of Chapter 4 ( PhP7,509.00/sq m), change the value of the
UNIT_COST for built-up areas by going to Assign FieldsÒCalculate. In the Value
dialog box, type 7509*10000 (without any comma).

The value was multiplied by ten thousand (10000) to convert the value in hectares
(10,000 sq m = 1 hectare).

e. Using the property value for agricultural areas (based on value of crops planted)

in Table 4.14 of Chapter 4 (PhP31,597.27/hectare), change the value of the

285

UNIT_COST for agricultural areas by going to Assign FieldsÒCalculate. In the
Value dialog box, type 31597.27 (no comma). No need to multiply the value by ten
thousand as the value is already per hectare.

f. Repeat the two previous steps for the other land use types. (Note that Chapter 4

only showed examples for Built-Up and Agricultural Land Use. Unit Cost for other
types of land use should be generated by the region/province).

3.2. Computing Consequence of Property Damage Per Hazard Event

a. Estimate the consequence of damage to property

a.1. Computing for the total floor area (TFA) and the total residential area (RFA)

for each municipality in the GIS.

a.3. Combining the land use and municipal boundary data and updating the area

value

a.3.1. Open the land use data and the municipal boundary data.

a.3.2. Combine the land use and municipal boundary data using the UNION
command. This step is necessary so that the land use values are
disaggregated according to municipality. It is suggested that the output
filename be expo_property.shp.

a.3.3. Open the expo_property.shp. attribute table and create a field called

AREA_1. This is where the area of each municipality is transferred. The
field AREA_1 shall be used later. Click on the AREA_1 field heading and
equate it to the current AREA values. Using Field Calculator, type:

a.1.1. Prepare a list of the latest TFA and RFA for each municipality as in Table

AREA

4.15 of Chapter 4.

a.1.2. Open the municipal boundary data, muni_boundry.shp and make it
available for editing (ArcView main menu ÒTable ÒStart Editing).

a.1.3. Add a field called TFA and enter the total floor area values that were

computed for each municipality.

a.1.4. Add a field called RFA, and enter the residential floor areas that were

computed for each municipality.

a.2. Entering the crop area per municipality in the GIS

a.2.1. Prepare a list of total agricultural area per crop for each municipality as

in Table 4.14 of Chapter 4.

a.3.4 Update the AREA field by using the Field Calculator. Use sq km as unit.

The syntax is:

([Shape].ReturnArea)/1000000

b. Determine the urban area per municipality

b.1. Open the expo_property.shp. attribute table and create a field called

URBANAREA. This is where the urban area of each municipality is stored.
Here it is assumed that your built-up area is equivalent to your urban area.

b.2. Select all the built-up areas for a particular municipality. For example to

find the built-up area for municipality named Bayan1, go to ArcView main
menu ÒTable ÒQuery and in the Query dialog box, type:

a.2.2. Open the municipal boundary data, muni_boundry.shp and start editing

([Lu_name])= “Built-up area” and ([Muni_name]) = “Bayan1”

it.

Add a field called

AREA, select the particular municipality

and enter the total agricultural area values that were computed for each
municipality. For example if the crop area is for palay, the field should be
called PALAYAREA; for corn, CORNAREA; and so on.

In some cases, none is selected when you do this operation. This only

means that the particular municipality has no built-up area.

287

b.3. Click on the field heading AREA, and go to ArcView main menuÒFieldÒ
Statistics. Copy the values for the Sum. This is the total built-up area for
Bayan1.

b.4. Update the field URBANAREA with the number copied from the previous
step. You can do this by going to ArcView main menuÒFieldÒCalculate
and in the Calculate box, paste the number copied.

b.5. Do the three previous steps for all other municipalities and cities.

c. Combine the property map and the hazard map.

c.1. Combine the exposure map expo_property.shp and the rain-induced

landslide hazard map, hazard.shp using UNION command. Name the output
risk map file as risk_property_hazard.shp.

c.2. In the risk_property_hazard.shp, add a field called VALUE (Number,

Width=20, Decimal Numbers=2). This is where the values of the land use
“parcels” are entered.

c.3. Update the AREA field, click on the AREA field and Calculate

(([Shape].ReturnArea)/1000000)

From hereon all GIS operations will be done on the risk to property map,
risk_property_hazard.shp.

d. Estimate the values of the affected property and agricultural areas

d.1. Open the table for risk_property_hazard.shp and using Query, select the

agricultural areas which lie in the hazard zone. A series of queries should be
done to select the right areas. The syntax to the select agricultural areas is:

"LU_NAME"= 'Agricultural lands'

From the above selection, select those that are within the hazard zones. This
time, NOTE: instead of Query New Set, use Select from Set.

"RIL_TYPE" = 'Accumulation zone' OR "RIL_TYPE" = 'Flooded
area' OR "RIL_TYPE" = 'High susceptibility' OR "RIL_TYPE" =
'Moderate susceptibility' OR "RIL_TYPE" = 'Low susceptibility'

From the above selection, those that are either palay or corn

("PALAYAREA">0 OR "CORNAREA">0 OR "AREA_1">0)

d.2. Select the VALUE field heading and using the Field Calculator, calculate

the value of the agricultural area using the unit costs for each municipality
found in Tables 4.13 and 4.14 of Chapter 4. Note that the unit costs per
municipality are only available for palay and corn. The expression is:

[AREA] * 100 * (30486 * [PALAYAREA] + 17112 * [CORNAREA]
+ (61670 * 558 + 25228 * 108 + 98367 * 521) * ([AREA_1] /
2017)) / ([PALAYAREA] + [CORNAREA] + (558 + 108 + 521) *
([AREA_1] / 2017))

This step estimates the value of agricultural area for a portion of the
municipality. Usually from agricultural census, the data on crop area are
available per municipality only. Therefore, in order to estimate agricultural
area for a portion of a municipality, a ratio-and-proportion method is
employed. The method assumes that the proportion of each type of crop
in one portion of the municipality is the same with that of the entire
municipality.

For example, if area per municipality is available for palay and corn, a simple
expression to get the unit cost would be:

Area x (Palay unit cost x Palay area per municipality + Corn unit
cost x Corn area per municipality) / (Palay area per municipality +
Corn area per municipality)

If area for other crops is available at the province level only, a ratio and
proportion approach where each municipality is assumed to have agricultural
areas proportional to the size of the province. For two types of crops, the
expression to estimate value of agricultural land is:

289

(Area x Area per municipality / Area of entire province) x (Crop1
unit cost x Crop1 area per province + Crop2 unit cost x Crop2
area per province)

(Crop1 area per province + Crop2 area per province)

Therefore, the two previous expressions can be combined for cases where
municipal and provincial level agricultural data are used:

Area x (Palay unit cost x (Palay area per municipality + Corn unit
cost x Corn area per municipality) + (Crop1 unit cost x Crop1
area per province + Crop2 unit cost x Crop2 area per province)
x Area per municipality / Area of entire province)) / ((Palay area
per municipality + Corn Area per municipality) + (Crop1 area per
province + Crop2 area per province) x (Area per municipality /
Area of entire province))

”AREA*100” converts square kilometers into hectares (1km2=100 hectares).
The area field is given in hectares. 2017 is the total area of the province in
square kilometers.

d.6. Add three fields CONSEQH, CONSEQM, CONSEQL (All Number,
Width=18, Decimal places = 8) to contain the consequence for high,
moderate and low intensity events respectively.

d.7. Compute for the Consequence to Property for Frequent Events. To do

this, first, select highly susceptible areas (HSAs) and areas with potentially
damage to property that is less than ten million pesos (PhP <10 Million). Go
to ArcView main menu Ò Table Ò Query. In the Query dialog box, type:

("RIL_TYPE" = 'Accumulation zone' OR "RIL_TYPE" =
'Flooded area' OR "RIL_TYPE" = 'High susceptibility') AND
("VALUE"<10000000)

d.8. When the areas meeting the criteria are selected, compute for consequence
to property by multiplying the corresponding factor for damage and the
computed value of property. In the case of rain-induced landslides, the factor
for damage for this combination is 3.3 x 10-3, or 0.0033

To do this, right-click on the CONSEQH field, and go to ArcView main
menu Ò Field ÒCalculate. Select the CONSEQH field. In the dialog box,
type the following formula:

d.3. Select the built-up areas lying on the hazard zone. The syntax for the

selection is:

0.003333*([VALUE])

("RIL_TYPE" = 'Accumulation zone' OR "RIL_TYPE" = 'Flooded
area' OR "RIL_TYPE" = 'High susceptibility' OR "RIL_TYPE" =
'Moderate susceptibility' OR "RIL_TYPE" = 'Low susceptibility')
AND "LU_NAME" = 'Built-up areas' AND "URBANAREA">0

d.4. Select the VALUE field heading and using the Field Calculator, calculate the

value of the built-up area using the unit cost. The expression is:

[UNIT_COST]* [AREA]* [TFA2007] /( [URBANAREA]*1000000)

d.5. Compute the consequence of property damage for each intensity level

following the equation in Chapter 4 Section B2.2.2

d.9 Repeat the last 3 steps above, this time, using the other combinations of HSA
and value of 10-100 million, and HSA and value of over 100 million. Refer to
Tables 4.27 to 4.33 in Chapter 4 (factor tables).

Repeat the process for Likely and Rare Events (CONSEQM, CONSEQL).
Since there are three hazard intensity levels, there will be nine combinations,
three for each frequency level.

Similar to the procedure for consequence of fatality, the consequence of
property damage for a 25-year return period includes the Moderate and High
Susceptibility Areas (MSA and HSA) while the consequence of property
damage for a 100-year return period includes the Low, Moderate and High
Susceptibility Areas (LSA, MSA and HSA).

3.3 Estimating Risk of Property and Agricultural Damage

a. In the attribute table of risk_property_hazard.shp, add another field called RISK_
PROP. This field will contain the incremental risk of property damage from the
individual events.

b. Select the affected areas where consequence is present for high, moderate and low

frequency events. The expression for selection is:

"CONSEQH">0 AND "CONSEQM">0 AND "CONSEQL">0 AND "LU_
NAME" = 'Built-up areas'

c. Calculate the value of risk for the particular selection. Click on the RISK_PROP
field which will represent the total incremental risk value for two return periods
(50-year and 100-year). The formula as implemented in ArcView is:

[CONSEQM]*((1/5)-(1/25))+[CONSEQL]*((1/25)-(1/100))

Similar to the above step, select affected built-up areas and calculate the
corresponding risk. The table below provides a summary of the expression used to
select the appropriate features and the computation of the risk:

d. These equations also apply for Agricultural Areas. Step b need to be modified to

select affected Agricultural Areas

"CONSEQH">0 AND "CONSEQM">0 AND "CONSEQL">0 AND "LU_

e. Repeat Step c above.

At this stage, the risk to property and agricultural damage are already computed.
They should be found in RISKPROP field. The spatial distribution of risk is also
determined.

3.4. Generalizing the risk estimates for life, property and agricultural damage

Sometimes it is useful to generalize the risk maps to the level of the administrative
unit. The dissolve feature of ArcView enables the generalization of features to
according to a spatial range.

a. For the risk to life map popu_risk_hazard.shp, it is necessary to weigh the values
according to area covered. To calculate the weighted risk, a field is first added to
accommodate this value. Let us call this field WRISK (Width:18, Decimal places:
10)

b. Select the WRISK field and do the weighted risk calculation. The expression is

[WRISK] = [RISK_PROP]*[AREA]

c. For properties, it is necessary to distinguish the risk according to the affected sector
(e.g., property or agriculture) and later on sum up the risk value per municipality
or city. In preparation, in the risk_prop_hazard.shp file, add fields according to the
table below:

agri valuE

agririsK

valuEurBn

risKurBan

the total value of agricultural areas affected by hazard

the total risk value for agriculture in a particular area

the total value of the property in the area

the total property risk value for in a particular area

d. Select all affected agricultural areas. The syntax for the query is:

"LU_NAME" = 'Agricultural lands'

Note that it was not necessary to qualify the selection to include only those affected
by the hazard since by this time, only those affected have been valuated and
computed for risk.

Fill the values for the AGRIVALUE field for the selected agriculture areas. Select
the AGRIVALUE field heading, go to FieldÒCalculate and in the dialog box, type
[VALUE]

e. Fill in the values for the AGRIRISK field for the selected agriculture areas.
Select the AGRIVALUE field heading, go to FieldÒCalculate and type
[AGRIRISK]=[RISK_PROP].

f. Select all affected urban areas. The syntax for the query is:

"LU_NAME" = 'Built-up areas'

Fill up the values for the VALUEURBN field for the selected built-up areas. Select
the VALUEURBN field heading, go to FieldÒCalculate and in the dialog box, type
[VALUE]

g. Fill in the values for the RISKURBAN field for the selected urban areas. Select the
RISKURBAN field heading, go to FieldÒCalculate and in the dialog box, type
[RISK_PROP].

Output file: Risk_popu_hazard_muni.shp

Click Next.

Include the following in the range of fields and corresponding operations in the
output file (Press SHIFT while selecting).

AREA by Sum – this is the sum of the area by municipality
WRISK by Sum – this is the weighted risk value computed earlier

In the output file Risk_popu_hazard_muni.shp, add another field called (again)
POPURISK. In this field, the risk to life value for each municipality is computed by
(use Calculate function to do this):

[POPURISK]=[WRISK]/AREA

d. Do Steps a to c for the property damage risk maps.

e. Theme to dissolve: Risk_prop_hazard.shp

Attribute to dissolve: MUNI_NAME (The name of the municipality).
Output file: Risk_prop_hazard_muni.shp

Include the following in the range of fields and corresponding operations in the
output file (Press SHIFT while selecting).

1. AREA by Sum – this is area for each feature to be aggregated
2. RISK_PROP by Sum – this is where the total risk value for each municipality will

be stored

3. VALUEAGRI by Sum - this is where the total value of agriculture for each

municipality will be stored

4. AGRIRISK by Sum - this is where the total agricultural risk value for each

municipality will be stored

5. RISKURBAN by Sum - this is where the total property risk value for each

Preparing the Prioritization Maps from Risk Estimates

This step refers to the Chapter 4 Sections D1.1.1 and D1.1.2

To come up with a map showing the priority of the risk estimates for each
municipality, the following can be done.

a. Open the risk to life estimate map risk_popu_hazard_muni.shp.

b. Add attribute fields called PRIORITY and ACTION. The PRIORITY field can be of
type short integer with length 3. ACTION should be of type text with 20 characters
length.

c. Select the categories of priority according to Table 4.41 of Chapter 4. For example,
to find all municipalities with estimated risks greater than >10-2 , a query can be
made on the attribute table where:

“RISKPOPU” > 0.01
“RISKPOPU” > 0.00001 AND “RISKPOPU” <= 0.01
“RISKPOPU” 0 or “RISKPOPU” <= 0.00001

After selecting the municipalities falling with the risk criteria, a risk priority
score may be assigned. In the case of the municipalities with estimated risks
greater than 1x10-2 per person per year, the field PRIORITY is selected and using
FieldÒCalculate,

[PRIORITY]=3

d. To put a description to the priority level, the ACTION field is assigned accordingly.
For municipalities with estimated risks greater than 1x10-2 per person per year, the
expression used in the calculation is

[ACTION]=”Urgent”

Expression used for selection

value assigned to [PRIORITy]
field

value assigned to [ACTION]
field

“risKpopu” < 1*10E-2 and “risKpopu” > 1*10E-5

[prioritY]=2

“risKpopu” <= 1*10E-5

[prioritY]=1

”High”

”low”

f. In the case of the risk to property and agriculture, certain thresholds need to be
computed. For property damage, the threshold is that the risk cost should not
exceed 20 percent of the cost of the total residential area. To operationalize this
threshold, a field URBANTHRS is added to the generalized map risk_prop_hazard_
muni.shp to represent the ratio between the risk and the threshold value for urban
areas.

g. Likewise, another field called AGRITHRS should be added where the threshold

ratio for agriculture may be added. The threshold for agriculture is that the risk cost
should not exceed 40 percent of the cost of the affected agricultural area.

h. First the values for URBANTHRS and AGRITHRS are computed.

[URBANTHRS]= [SUM_RISKU]/(0.20*[LAST_TRA20]*5534)

The value 5534 represents the cost of construction per square meter of residential
area (Table 4.13).

For agricultural areas:

[AGRITHRS]= [SUM_AGRIRI]/(0.40*[SUM_VALUEA])

i. Add fields where separate priority scores can be assigned for property and

agriculture. These can be called URBNRISK and AGRIRISK respectively. Both are
short integers with 3 lengths.

j. Apply the criteria set in Chapter 4, Section D-b to assign the risk priority scores for
agriculture. For example, a query may be made to determine all municipalities that
have values of URBANTHRS greater than 1.0.

e. Do Steps c to e, but this time, select the two remaining criteria. The table below

shows the summary of the selection expression and the corresponding [PRIORITY]
and [ACTION] assignments.

k. Those municipalities fulfilling the above selection should be assigned priority scores

d. The RISKPRIOTY should be the sum of all the risk priority scores evaluated earlier,

of 3 for URBNRISK

[URBNRISK]=3

that is:

[RISKPRIOTY]=[PRIORITY]+[URBNRISK]+[AGRIRISK]

l. The scoring can be done through a series of queries and value assignment as follows:

4.3. Preparing Composite Maps for Risk Estimates

The risk scores obtained from the risk to population, property and agriculture can
be combined to create a composite risk map. The steps are as follows:

a. Open the generalized risk maps risk_popu_hazard_muni.shp and risk_prop_

hazard_muni.shp containing the risk scores evaluated earlier.

b. Add a new field called RISKPRIOTY, with type integer, length 4 to the attribute

table of any of the two themes.

c. Display the two risk tables. These two tables should be “joined”. Overlay techniques
like UNION is not necessary in this case. To be able to join, select the field content
that is common to both themes and click on their field names. In this case, it is
the MUNI_NAME, the field which contains the names of the municipalities are
common to both. Make one attribute table active by making it editable, and add a
field called RISKPRIOTY. In the main menu, go to TableÒJoin. The inactive table
window should disappear. In the active theme table, the fields of the active and
inactive should now be seen in one table.

accordingly (string, 12 char length)

Query the Theme Table where the RISKPRIORITY field is entered and assign the
value for ACTNCMPST. Since the maximum value for RISKPRIOTY is 9, the
prioritization can be done in 3 levels.

1. Community decisions and
planning regarding built
environment take potential
natural hazard risks into account
(including potential for increasing
risks thru interference with
ecological, hydrological, geological
systems) and vulnerabilities of
different groups

2. Security of land ownership/

tenancy rights. Low/minimal level
of homelessness and landlessness

3. Safe locations: community

members and facilities (homes,
workplaces, public and social
facilities) not exposed to hazards
in high-risk areas within locality
and/or relocated away from unsafe
sites

4. Structural mitigation measures
(embankments, flood diversion
channels, water harvesting tanks)
in place to protect against major
hazard threats, built using local
labor, skills, materials, appropriate
technologies as far as possible

5. Knowledge and take-up of

building codes/regulations in
community

1. Compliance with international

standards of building, design,
planning, etc. Building
codes and land use planning
regulations take hazard and
disaster risk into account

2. Compliance of all public

buildings and infrastructure
with codes and standards

3. Requirement for all public and
private infrastructure system
owners to carry out hazard and
vulnerability assessments

4. Protection of critical public
facilities and infrastructure
through retrofitting and
rebuilding, especially in areas of
high risk

5. Security of access to public
health and other emergency
facilities (local and more
distant) integrated into counter-
disaster planning

6. Legal and regulatory systems

protect land ownership and
tenancy rights, and rights of
public access

7. Regular maintenance of hazard

6. Adoption of hazard-resilient

control structures

construction and maintenance
practices for homes and
community facilities using
local labor, skills, materials and
appropriate technologies as far as
possible

8.

‘Hardware’ approach to disaster
mitigation is accompanied
by ‘software’ dimension of
education, skills training, etc.

9. Legal, regulatory systems and

economic policies recognise and
respond to risks arising from
patterns of population density
and movement

7. Community capacities and skills to
build, retrofit, maintain structures
(technical and organizational)

8. Adoption of physical measures to

protect items of domestic property
(e.g., raised internal platforms
and storage as flood mitigation
measure, portable stoves) and
productive assets (e.g., livestock
shelters)

9. Adoption of short-term protective
measures against impending
events (e.g., emergency protection
of doors, windows from cyclone
winds)

10. Infrastructure and public

facilities to support emergency
management needs (e.g., shelter,
secure evacuation, emergency
supply routes)

11. Resilient and accessible critical
facilities (e.g., health centers,
hospitals, police, fire stations –
in terms of structural resilience,
back-up systems, etc.)

12. Resilient transport/service

infrastructure and connections
(roads, paths, bridges, water
supplies, sanitation, power lines,
communications, etc.)

13. Locally owned/available transport
sufficient for emergency needs
(e.g., evacuation, supplies), at least
in the event of seasonal hazards;
transport repair capacity within
community

(includes microzonation applied to
permit/restrict land uses)

1. Compliance with international

planning standards

2. Land use planning regulations
take hazard and disaster risk
into account

2. Local (community) disaster plans
feed into LGU development and
land use planning

3. Effective inspection and
enforcement régimes
