## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Kristina Nikolic

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

8/9/2023

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Depopulation portfolio within UNDP country office in Serbia

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

·       Depopulation of Serbia (including topics such as Circular migration; migration away from Serbia and (Re-)connecting with Serbia’s large diaspora through an agile platform.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How might a new platform for engagement with highly skilled diaspora function? What are the key services needed? What type of communication would be engaging? In addition, what if we start to openly share honest stories of return – highlighting both pros and cons – via a new, popular medium, and create a sense of community around the narrative of circular migration, migration by choice?

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

·       We set up a new learning format to test our main hypotheses

What will happen if we open new pathways of communication with the diaspora, potential returnees and all the successful individuals who have already returned to Serbia to work and live here?

What does a different kind of communication with a formal or informal tone mean for our diaspora?

What if we start to openly share real stories of return and create a sense of community around the narrative of circular migration, migration by choice?

·       Testing how it is possible to remove the stigma of returning to Serbia for the Serbian diaspora and returnees and change the narrative to a more positive view

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

·       If there is a new communication platform for promoting real - positive and negative - experiences of returnees to Serbia, then returnees and diaspora in general would be more at ease reconnecting with Serbia and the stigma of returning would be lessened.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

·       Starting the podcast small with the intention of growing and learning on the go

o   During the COVID19 pandemic, the podcast started an online-only format (interviews over Zoom)

o   After good feedback, we invested in hiring a studio where Returning Point will record the podcast, working on design and branding, as well as upskilling the hosts through trainings (public speaking)

o   Open to suggestions from the audience regarding potential guests ad themes to be covered in the podcast episodes

·       Consistent focus on challenging the popular narrative that returning to Serbia is something shameful though nuanced personal stories of success

·       Mindful of the gender balance and representation among guests  (especially as male potential guests tend to be more willing to participate and share their stories)

·       Discussion of services offered, and activities organized by Returning Point  and position of the org as a “virtual friend”

·       Relatable audio/video content in Serbian language for second and third generation Serbian diaspora

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Single episode

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

·       User feedback 

·       Social media feedback (comments and shares)

·       Stakeholder feedback

·       Analysis of media coverage

·       Listening/viewing stats

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

37 months (since August 2020), continuing cooperation

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time from the UNDP Accelerator Labs team to research and suggest speakers

The production team’s efforts in recording and producing the podcast

Public speaking training for hosts

Designer’s effort to create the visual identity and social media collateral (covers, reels etc.)

The social media team’s effort to promote the show
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

·       Proven

o   Good feedback and many word-of-mouth references

o   Sense of community among guests

o   The audience is interested in and reaches out to Returning Point’s other services

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

·       Straightforward model of building an interview podcast with guests in the studio - Starting small, iteratively building up when there is positive feedback

·       Changes in the way of working and the work methodology in general would include earlier training in public speaking for hosts, work on standardization of the format and process, and detailed information for guests before filming so that the episodes with be “tighter”

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

37 months (since August 2020)

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

·       Podcast studio rent

·       Production team salaries

·       Graphic and visual material

·       Advertising and social media promotion

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

·       Due to the change in the leadership of Returning Point new host is taking over the podcast

·       As podcast grows, introduction of new topic and visual identity to attract new audiences (e.g.  include focus on older returnees planning to retire/spend final years of their career in Serbia)

 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

·       Growth to come from more and more high-profile guests who will expand the target audience

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

·       Changing narratives is a very long process and takes time

o   Requires logic of systems thinking, not a single solution

o   In practice, a series of activities with the same intent that work in synergy

·       People like hearing people’s life stories because and realize they are not alone

·       People like offering, hearing and sharing actionable advice

·       Many guests found that being on Returning Point podcast offered closure to their current stage in circular migration, besides being a good way to advertise their successes and status

·       Many guests used it to thank Returning Point for how it helped them with their return (e.g. through flights organized during the COVID-19 pandemic)

·       Diaspora and returnees are a diverse set of individuals with varied interests and the most effective communication is one that directly addresses common needs (e.g. practical law changes, financial benefits)

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

·       COVID-19 and pandemic restrictions initially made production problematic

·       The team had no experience in podcasting/media, but they worked with professionals and then picked up skills along the way

·       Criticism that it is a propaganda tool for Serbia and that it paints Serbia in an unrealistically positive light

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

·       Colleagues working on topics related to Migration, Depopulation and connection with Diaspora

·       Colleagues trying to change the narratives surrounding some issues similar to migration  

 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

·       Serbian Diaspora, returnees and other potential users of Returning Point’s services

·       Serbian society

·       Serbian media 

·       All other relevant stakeholders

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

·       The initial phase as a small podcast recorded fully remotely (due to COVID restrictions)

·       The second phase of upskilling the hosts, hiring the studio and production team

·       A new phase with new leadership and expanded topics

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

·       Start small in terms of production and see initial feedback

·       Line up multiple guests in the beginning and streamline the recording process

·       Hire professionals for media training and standardize the format earlier

·       Keep an eye on gender ratio and representation

·       Focus on guests with greater social media presence to initially promote work

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

-        Yes, the experiment can be replicated in different areas, especially where stigma needs to be lifted and where sharing individual experiences is valuable.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense and explore phases had significant influence:

·       Following the listenership stats

·       Researching and contacting good guests

·       Informing the hosts on the general issues around migration in Serbia

> What surprised you?

·       Openness of guests to share very private experiences and impressions (as migration is often a very personal and emotional decision) in order to help others and paint a realistic picture of their lives and situation in their country.
