Data Powered positive Deviance: what can we learn about the citizen centered financial municipalities in North Macedonia?
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. \n\nPlease note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.\n

> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that municipalities have different financial performances. Some being very good in certain areas, the other on other areas. There is not a single practice that stands out. In addition there are many data available including datasets that can be very beneficial in understanding the problem and the performances of municipalities. The decentralization lead to gap in the fiscal discipline, as well as fiscal management among the municipalities. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Since territorial reform in North Macedonia almost 20 years ago, the municipalities have numerous competences and are responsible for high number of services towards the citizens such as social care, education, communal affairs, culture sport etc. The level of fiscal decentralization is relatively low, and the municipalities are still highly dependent from the central government funding. Despite the efforts for improving collection of taxes, some municipalities have difficulties ensuring own financial resources. This, paired with high expenses the municipalities engage for some services, had led that certain number of municipalities have “blocked accounts” as result of poor financial performance. These developments also influence the equal access to services for the citizens living in certain municipalities. However, there are cases of good financial performance among the municipalities.

Municipalities in North Macedonia have different fiscal performances. There are multiple data sets available that we can look at: Treasury datasets final accounts from municipalities Open data platform: https://data.gov.mk/ Municipal development index – data collected through this process http://indikatori.opstinskisoveti.mk/ https://open.finance.gov.mk/mk/home - datasets on financial transactions Datasets from the MISA about the employees at the municipal administration

Problems in municipal financing can easily obstruct municipal development and provision of high-quality local public services. A municipality struggling with financial problems – even with the best leadership – may not “bring the government closer to people” UNDP has been - and still is - at the forefront of fiscal decentralization and local governance reforms, aimed at building local government capacity, as well as creating better public finance management system, in general There are so many challenges in municipal financing! On this occasion, we mainly focus on the problem of budget arrears, the government bailout in 2018, and its implications. Local self-government is becoming increasingly important. The lower tier of government (local self-government units, LGUs) employs 35,208 employees. If the employees from locally managed institutions in education, culture, child and social protection, are excluded, then the employees in the local self-government units reduces to 5,751 (source: MIOA, 2020). Key challenges Low level of fiscal decentralization, when compared to the EU member states. Vertical fiscal imbalances – misalignment and underfunding of local governments (vertical fiscal imbalance). Municipalities do not have sufficient funds to fulfill their competencies and provide local services. Expenditure assignment does not consider differences in fiscal and administrative capacity, economic and demographic conditions. Lack of clarity of the functional and expenditure assignments and the responsibilities of delegated or shared functions. Finance follows institutions, not functions! We have an institutional, not a functional decentralization. Ineffective mechanisms to reduce horizontal fiscal imbalances. The intergovernmental transfer system does not equalize sufficiently.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Data Powered Positive Methodology was introduced to the UNDP CO office in North Macedonia by the AccLab. Teamed up with the Democratic Governance Unit we explored where we can test the methodology, and apply the learning of the boot camp in the work. Big data became available in North Macedonia through openfinance.gov.mk platform, and these data was occasionally use by the reports and revealed stories on financial transactions that were part of some corruption. The big data available on the transactions of the treasury were not used in understanding the performances of the institutions. Thus, utilizing this data is an important step in promoting data-informed programming in UNDP CO North Macedonia. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Data Powered Positive Deviance revealed the positive outliers on citizen centered financial management among the municipalities in North Macedonia. What can we learn from those? what can we replicate? what can we upscale?

These is a professional non-profit organization that unites the Financial officers that work at municipalities. This organization has a wide network among the municipalities, and would enable us to have a gate opener, as well as contacts for scheduling interviews and discuss the research on these communities.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What can we learn from the positive deviants among the municipalities in North Macedonia on citizen centered budgeting and expenditure. Are there any common practices among the small, medium, and large municipalities that lead to success and can these be replicated?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

using the open data, especially financial datasets would come very useful in the validation of the self-reporting done by the municipalities. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Following the couple of rounds of the discussions, but also some ideation about how to use the knowledge that is about to be generated by DPPD will propose some initial thoughts that we can look at: 1. Communication component – look beyond municipalities, and explore the role and the contribution of the other actors in the ecosystem, harness the positive experiences, and support the grow of similar ecosystems in other places 2. Look and identify cases that can serve as solid ground to build peer-to-peer learning mechanisms, and systems – this can be done in various forms ( onetime meeting, or systematic via looking and exploring options through partnerships and professional bodies/unions) 3. Looking at the Synthetics Models for the homogenization we note similar patterns among the performances of the municipalities. This could serve as a great opportunity to design multiple activities ( on top of my head are: conferences, new projects and proposals, explore additional avenues for new partnerships) 4. Blogposts – share learnings on processes and results -this can come very handy on the process with identified continuous positive outliers on specific categories only and are not part of the municipalities that are explored with qualitative methods 5. Final DPPD report with the methodology, data, findings ( upon the result of the census in announced)
