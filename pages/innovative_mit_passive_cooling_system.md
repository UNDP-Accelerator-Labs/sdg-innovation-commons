> Description of the solution

The system combines radiative cooling, evaporative cooling and thermal insulation in a slim package that could resemble existing solar panels. It can provide up to about 19 degrees celcius of cooling from the ambient temperature. Three layers of material make up the system, which collectively provide cooling as water and heat pass through the device.This material consists mostly of air enclosed in the cavities of a sponge-like-structure made of polyethylene
