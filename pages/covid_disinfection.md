> Brief description of the innovation

Indoor covid Disinfecting services at affordable prices using a fogging machine.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income is generated when people call for the service, as each room that gets to be disinfected attracts a reasonable fee.
It improves operations of existing companies by ensuring that their environment is safe and free from from the deadly virus

> Technical Feasibility

We use the the fogging machine to creat a thick fog in the closed room. The time varies from the sizes of rooms. For an average room it would take about 5 to 10 minutes.  Once the fog has been spread efficiently, the room is left vacant for 30 to 45 minutes to allow the fog containing the disinfectant to settle down and engulf the virus if it is present in the room.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It disinfects places that might contain the virus and thus helps the society by preventing them from getting affected by the deadly virus
