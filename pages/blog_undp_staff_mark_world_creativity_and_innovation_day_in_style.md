Oh what an impact, the Novel Coronavirus had globally!

It disrupted the world order and stimulated global
cooperation and new innovations

It limited human physical mobility and increased human
virtual engagements

It stopped many social activities and created stronger
family bonds

It halted certain work and created new ways of work

It raised public health costs and made the rich donate to
meet public food and health needs

It closed places of worship and opened more people to worshipers of
God at their homes

It killed many human lives and led to healing of parts of
planet earth

Oh what an impact, the Novel Coronavirus has
created globally !

When Covid is done,
We shall bask in the Sun;

Wipe away the tear's,
Brought by all the fear's;

Covid taught us by any measure,
Life is our most important Treasure;

Its not what we have in our lives,
But the lives that we have;

Family & Friends we cherish the most,
Money & possessions their value is lost;

I AM my brother & sister's keeper,
Knowing that my life's meaning is deeper;

Covid will NOT define Me,
Covid WILL REFINE ME;

And when it is done,
WE SHALL BASK IN THE SUN...

One day, the world is awash with news
Covid-19 Virus is around
It is deadly; how deadly?
Nobody knows!
But I'm thinking it maybe manageable
I am wrong!

The world is shaking,
Media reporting only Covid-19
I am thinking somehow
There might be a solution
Am I wrong again?

Death is looming, death is happening
What do we do?
Wash hands, social distancing, stay home...
Oh! These are manageable
I hope I'm not wrong

Unbelievable! Covid-19!
New term, new virus, deadly too
Loved ones lost, new ways of living
Oh Covid-19!
The world will never be the same
Wash hands, social distancing, stay home
Save life!

Together we stand; our fore father's once preached
But now, it's said we must stand apart
in order to survive

Suddenly,
Corona like a sad song across the land breaking the
fibers of society we know and writing the new story
that no one wishes to read

Corona virus, your family member HIV/AIDS has been here for awhile
but heard our cry and now responding to ART and your cousin Ebola
stirred rapidly but packed and went

And now you, you Corona, leave us and our generation alone
so that we start writing a new story
about our future after you

Corona leave and go, go away, go for Good.
Happy to see you go

Wednesday blah blah 2020
Time seems too fast and
The schedule seems full
The meetings are running with no reprieve and then
The broadcasters announce a disruption
The tight schedule won’t matter in a few minutes

In one moment,
In an instant
Life changes
So many little ways that the new normal has taken afoot

You could be stuck – on mission
You could have a narrow window in which to get “home”
You realize that time and not resources is the limitation
You are advised to sit out and wait on a miracle; and
You are lucky the institutions in which
You operate can offer reassurances and full support
You are not worry; but,
You worry about so many that cannot count on the same

As days go by
The new normal becomes humanity trying to survive
The anonymous neighbor becomes family
The job you agonize over is a lifeline
The home – wherever that you are “stuck”- glares back, giving you
The exact investment you made into it; however,
The gratitude you feel - for being alive- is reinforced with promise

To a better world, starting with you
To more compassion and respect for humanity
To slow down, breathe, and appreciate
To understand earth, and only act in haste
To save or secure a life; you commit
To do better, with the little you have and
To ultimately, be better, do better and live better
To make the world home - everywhere.

When the lock down was announced abruptly, I got scared

I thought about my loved one whose medication was not delivered

When I see them cry, I am scared

When they are not feeling strong physically and mentally, I am scared

When there is help, there is hope

Find your strength in art and loved ones around you, do not be scared.

Mr. Corona"COVID-19"
I heard of you last year while in China & now
you are every where.

You have killed many people & caused new
ways of working but you seem not to care.

Corona! You are a bad disease to extent that
you cause places of worship to be closed!

Oh my God, i need a future & the future of
the next generation.

Am not meant to only stay at home under
this crisis and or lockdown.
Am not a slave Mr. Corona! Neither a person
meant to watch others die.

Don't take me for granted please!
I need a life & that of others.
Don't break me off.
"God' is keenly watching you & can't allow
you continue killing His people.

The world is watching you & the talk now is"
re-programming, re-focusing and or
re-thinking new approaches to development!

Thanks to UNDP for the 3*3 aproach of
Preparedness, Response and Recovery
currently being adopted in Uganda

Hello Mr. Corona, we have prepared the UN
appeal with the Government of Uganda. This
will help reduce your burden on people!

Reconsider your thoughts or you get
defeated for ever. Please ask
your friends such as Ebola and HIV/Aids of
what happended to them.

You can't defeat us Mr Corona.
Take us back to our normal life. Trust us with
a chance! Leave us alone.

Sosan Muwanika

You have made not to be clear when the
current lockdown in Uganda will end! This is
not easy for the ordinary Ugandan people
especially Women& Children or people of
concern/refugees.

We are under test! You have
made us to demonstrate our resilient
mandate! Mr Corona,
you decided to add more food on the plate of
Madam Elsie & others making
them more extraordinary busy and or ever
engaged in meetings both at HQ, RBA,
UNCT& CO staff! Thanks to senior
management& staff.

You thought
that you would disorganise UNDP but it has
managed to offer 10,000 zoom
lisences to government and extended to staff
internet data bundles allowing
them work from home globely!

With this, I have seen the UNDP Administer
share his experience working from his home:
this was inspirational! Thanks our boss!

Additionally, UNDP Uganda SMT/staff show
case their talent in the first week of lockdown
in Uganda. This was interesting!

Amazing! You can't destroy me, UNDP and
UN system. You are just joking Mr Corona.
Instead you have made us more resilient. We
shall not forget you.

We shall not run short of new ideas!
Take me back to place of work to help the
most vulnerable people.

The future needs me....
The future needs UNDP and it needs the UN
system.

But the future does not need you Mr Corona.

The world has come to a halt.
It's not World War 3, it's not
Judgement day, it's a FLU that has put
Brakes on the World!

It's telling us to stop & breathe.
While it has separated families, it has
also bonded them together.

While it has stopped us from spending,
it has taught us the importance of saving.

It does not discriminate, be it race, wealth,
young or old. Instead it has taught us that
we are all equal.

It's telling us to Stop! Breathe.
So let's stop and breathe, Mother
Nature is realigning the world and we are
going to come out happier.

A Blog By Elsie Gyekyewaa Attafuah

I am not sure if I should call it the ‘Covid-19 Insomnia’ but I wake up to the
sound of croaking frogs and chirping birds in my neighbourhood. A sign of
rich biodiversity in the beautiful Pearl of Africa;

I get up to draw my curtains to see the beautiful dawn break but it is still dark;
I go back to lay in my bed. I am reminiscing as I lay in bed;

In my mind’s eye, I see my beautiful garden, I see the flowers blossom. It is a
sign of hope, it is a beauty to gaze at;

Morning will come soon. I am eager to go and walk in the garden. I will also
pick slugs from my garden with my son and chase butterflies, something I
have never done before. Kwabena, loves them and looks forward to such
hunting times;

My Journey to the Unknown

Today, 20th April 2020 is special, it has been three weeks of staying at home.
Today is exactly three weeks that I left my office physically with my
colleagues. My last day in the office before the “lockdown”;

With a potential lockdown of the country in sight, call it premonition, I had to
rent a car home, and leave the office that day with the car;

It is my first time of driving out of the office car park; it is also my first time of
driving in Kampala;

As I drive off, Sheila, Ramlah, Anthony, Stewart, and Victor say good-bye, they
giggle but they are more curious. They are nervous but hopeful that I will
reach home safely. They have never seen me drive, in fact, they even take a
video of me driving out. I laugh and wave at them as I say good-bye;

As I drive out, the usual hectic Yusuf Lule road is quite, in fact, dead quite, one
could feel a pin drop. So unusual, so uncommon, so uncharacteristic and
even unimaginable despite knowing the reason;

16

As I drive out, I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder, a shoulder to
carry the office with me; to carry friends with me; to carry colleagues with me;

A weight to be able to inspire a team to a call unprecedented, a response
unprecedented; and a devotion unprecedented in my sphere of influence. It
was a reality that has dawned on me but not out of a stage managed high
octane sci-fi movie;

As sense of urgency dawns on me like never before; a sense of urgency for
my people, my beloved Pearl of Africa, my beloved Africa, and to the cause of
the United Nations, an organization I have given my heart to;

As I drive home, I could only think about the journey to the unknown;

I reach home safely, I park my car and enter my home, and as always, I
receive a warm welcome from my mother, Afua. Yaa (the name of a female
born on Thursday in Ghana), Akwaaba (welcome), she says;

I look into my mother’s eyes as she calls me Yaa. In our tradition, Thursday
borns’ are believed to be brave and strong. It reminds me of Yaa Asantewaa,
the bold and courageous Ashanti Queen who saved her people;

Yaa, I told myself, you must be brave and courageous, you are Yaa as you lead
your team in the days, weeks, months and years ahead. I am usually known to
be bold and courageous but now even more than ever. The expectations are
high;

In all these, there was a subtlety in my mum’s message of the resilience of the
African woman, and trust and unwavering support that we are in this
together as a family, which extends beyond the four corners of my home;

Talents Unraveled

Three weeks of home stay has been intense and interesting, encouraging and
exhilarating, discovering and re-discovering uncharted paths;

As I look back into, I can only say it has been gratifying, humbling and I am
grateful;

I have seen spark in the eyes of many people like never before. I have seen
the energies of people ignite like never before;

As for the wonderful UNDP colleagues and staff of Uganda;

I have seen innovations like never before;

17

i have seen bonds grow like never before;

I have seen talents explode like never before;

I never knew Rose and Sylvia are artists, Sheila, Daniel, Hope, Sosan, Prossy,
Jastine and Florence are poets;

I never knew Eyllaf could paint so beautifully, and depict the incredible space
that we are all in, cocoons, and that we will fly out one day like the butterfly;

I never knew that Annette had a green thumb;

Mzee Kijana Gerald’s tasty pizza is to ‘die’ for. Uganda Country office got great
chefs;

And oh, we have sang together like never before during our Karaoke times;

We have virtually hugged together like never before;

We have looked after each other like never before;

I have also tried to unearth some talents out of my usual comfort zone, my
blogging skill is back;

Unity of Purpose to defeat the Invisible hand

I have seen dedication to a cause, a cause for our people, a cause for unity of
purpose like never before;

We have sought solutions to development and humanitarian challenges like
never before;

We have burnt the midnight oil together like never before;

We have conquered the invisible hand of the stranger, and yes, I call it a
stranger, that has caused panic or insomnia in our world today, the pandemic
that is here with us but which will be defeated;

Yes, no crisis lasts forever but this has fortified us as one global village more
than ever prepared to face any similar challenge in the future;

18

And to borrow the good words of my friend Dominic Sam, my fellow
Representative in DRC, we should work hard to stay ahead of the pandemic
and not to chase the pandemic. This too shall pass as my ‘Oga’ Madam,
Ahunna, UNDP RBA Director says;

And when my son Kwabena says to me, mummy, mummy, mummy! when will
the lock down finish; I could only whisper to myself, I do not want it to finish;

Yes, I want to be able to walk down the streets and walk into the offices of
colleagues;

But we must not lockdown or allow it to lockdown our talents, our energies,
our hope and desire for a change;

We must not lockdown what has brought us together to work together like
never before;

We must not lockdown the momentum we have created as we pave the way
for the future of development;

As we wait for the stranger to pass over us, I chose to reminiscence about
positive things;

Suddenly, I wake up with a jolt, it is morning, I have spark in my eyes;

I dash to my window to gaze at my beautiful garden. This time I see so many
slugs on the grass; a sign of hope and life;

So yes, we must never lockdown the potential in us.

Lockdown is never a lockdown.
