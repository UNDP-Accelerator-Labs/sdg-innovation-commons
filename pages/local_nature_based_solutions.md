## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Due to the situation in Gaza that effected tourism in the region the experiment was postponed to 2024. 

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

During the mapping of nature based solutions we mapped a local solution in a small desert village called Al Disi. The Al Disi Women's Cooperative emerged as a remarkable women-led Community-Based Organization. Fueled by a shared vision, a group of determined women united to revive their environmental heritage symbolised by a native plant called "Al Ghada" (Haloxylon persicum) that once thrived in the region. The Accelerator Lab seeks to unravel the secrets of the famous Al Ghada, recognizing its potential as a catalyst for ecological restoration, economic empowerment, and cultural preservation. To achieve this, the Lab conducted a mission to map out possible solutions that sustainably utilize local plants, primarily focusing on the “Al Ghada” while empowering the women of Wadi Rum. We created an experiment to test with the Al Ghada plant in tourism, but due to the situation in Gaza that affected tourism in the region, we decided to postpone this experiment to 2024.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There is a gap in studies related to local knowledge in Jordan specifically related to genetic resources. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We wanted to test the potential of creating a tourism experience related to nature based solutions, where the tourist can help in the restoration of the Al Ghada plant in its natural habitat. Piloting this would benefit in creating a model of merging local knowledge with unconventional land restoration activities.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We were excited to proceed with the experiment, but due to the situation in Gaza, tourism was greatly affected and we decided to postpone the experiment to 2024.
