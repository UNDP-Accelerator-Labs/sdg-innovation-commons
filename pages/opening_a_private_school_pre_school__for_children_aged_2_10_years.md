> Title of the innovation

Opening a private school(pre-school) for children aged 2-10 years

> Brief description of the innovation

In our area, we do not have a community, or private schools that offer quality education to children under the of 10. Children are kept home until the recommended age to enter grade 1 in government schools. The initiative is there to help young children to acquire education as young as they are so as to produce who are able to present themselves well in our society.

To begin with, the innovation will generate income for me in the sense that parents of the children who will be admitted at school will have to pay small amount of money that will help me survive as I deliver the service as a teacher, it will also help me develop my career as a teacher for I will practice what I have learnt. The innovation will also provide employment to other youths as they will be employed as teachers. Parents and the entire community will benefit for quality education needed for their children will be brought closer to their door steps. It will also support the fulfillment of the government agenda of job creation.

> Technical Feasibility

The land for the said school is available for development and a small structure is there that can be used for the start. I would therefore, request for materials needed for the smooth running of the innovation.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Every parent is happy to see a child grow well accidentally it is for that reason that the innovation will bring joy and development to the local community and national wise as education is the key to success. Zambia 🇿🇲 will have children and citizens who know the value of education and become productive in society.
