## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

The activity was conducted to assess how mature the critical technology components of the Local Revenue Management Information System (LoRMIS).

The experiment was important to determine if prior gaps identified in the system were adequately addressed to confirm readiness of the system for implementation

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF gaps identified in the system are adequately addressed, THEN the system will have matured enough to be deployed.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

UNDP Accelerator Lab Malawi supported Mwanza District Council to refine their system for managing revenue from 2022.

In 2022 and 2023, the National Commision for Science and Technology (NCST) adapted and simplified NASA's technology readiness assessment framework.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

Technology Readiness Results from iterations of assessment revealed that the system had progressed from Technology Readiness Level 3 to Technology Readiness Level 8. As such, the Testing Team recommended the implementation of the system.

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

The technology readiness assessment questionnaire should be simplified and adapted in order to effectively measure the maturity of a technology.

Refinement of early innovative technologies should identify and focus on critical technology elements to address key assumptions.

> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- Solutions tested in this experiment were scaled in numbers
- This experiment led to resource mobilization
- This experiment led to adoption of new ways of working by our partners
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Digitizing assessment scores from paper notes was too labour intensive and error prone. Use digital data collection tools integrated error with the Technology Readiness Calculator should be explored.
