Don't-break-the-eggs box with a handle 

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

When buying eggs in bulk (36 pieces), there is no separate box to keep the eggs from breaking. They only come in one tray which is difficult and dangerous to carry. The solution that sales people created is the DIY box made of two pieces of tray with the tape around them to be used as a handle.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

The solution answers the need to have a box for 36 eggs in one go that is safe to transport 

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

This solution shows how individual entrepreneurs and especially vendors come up with ideas that make it easier to sell their products. For examples, unless the vendor had this DIY box, I would not have bought as many eggs - I would have gotten only 10 eggs that come in the box and are more expensive. 


Because the vendor has done this process of making the box many times, she was quick and efficient in putting it together with the handle - fascinating process that would have taken me longer to implement :)
