- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Agriculture is the major development sector in Zambia.About 97.4% of rural households are engaged in agriculture and this equates to 45% of the total population.Approximmately 4.6 million poor people in Zambia depend on agriculture.Economic growth therefore axes on an improvement in agriculture productivity.

> Technical Feasibility

Investigate the relationship between agriculture output and economic growth in Zambia as well as both the short and long run impact.Then the model used is the following :
GDP=AGOUTPUT+ GCF+ HK+EMP
The variables are;economic growth (GDP),agriculture output (AGOUTPUT),gross capital formation (GCF)’human capital (HK) and Employment (EMP).

> Anticipated Social Impact

Using the model above,the results show that agriculture output has a positive significant impact on economic growth which is inline with what was expected in the prior expectations.Employment which was a proxy for labor force was found to have a positive significant impact on economic growth as well.And inline with these results,the government will continue creating more jobs for the individuals in the agriculture sector especially experts.
