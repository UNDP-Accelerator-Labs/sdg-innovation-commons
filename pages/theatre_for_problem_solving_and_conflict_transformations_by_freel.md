fReeL transform people’s lives positively through theater problem solving and conflict transformation tools.
We do this by creating an interactive approach that involves the audience in developing real time strategies for enacting social and personal change. Here, actors create, rehearse and present scenes that show moments of conflict or any social problem such as work issues, family problems, racism, bullying etc. and then invite the audience to intervene and enact solution to the problems presented.
