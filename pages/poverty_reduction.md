> Title of the innovation

Poverty reduction

> Brief description of the innovation

maize has been know as the most grown food in Zambia instead of every one depending on it because maize is cultivated only in rain season it's to my best interest knowing that millet can be cultivated within June and November so for us to reduce poverty I believe millet can help and other crops that can be cultivated away from the the rain season such as sweet potatoes, sunflower and many more lets invest in agribusiness and make Zambia not only food basket but also the country that eradicate poverty and help others interms of poverty reduction and economic development

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Millet and sunflower being one of the foods used in Zambia and most parts of the world and trying to introduce and encourage every citizen who knows how important and what value it can hold to the currenty economic growth. bring up other cereals that can bring up competition in the world market I believe everyone of us who give in try to add value not only to us but to the world at large because what an individual is improving on is also improving to a great number which used to sleep without eating anything or maybe eat once a day 
It will also improve the rate of poverty crisis
It will revamp the economic standard

> Technical Feasibility

Firstly sensitize the importance of cultivating other crops not only maize when it's rain season 
As we want to improve one the economy development and the lives of the people encourage commercial and substance farmers both 
Just like the FRA in Zambia introduce an organization or a company that not only distribute maize seed but also sunflower and Millet to strengthen and widen the economy and the lives of the people
Help each other by empowering them with the machines and tools to use 
help them on how to sell not only locally but international

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will improve the standard of living for the people and it make people understand that it's not only maize that can be cultivated but also other cereals
Get to experience on international market because many people will hv started to export there product due to exess production it will impower and employ youths of which will be more energy and job opportunity
