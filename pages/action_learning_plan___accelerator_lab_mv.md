Addressing exclusions in the Maldivian labour market
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that various groups of the population are excluded from the labour market. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Given the significant percentage of young people in the country’s population, it is undeniable that they represent the hopes and aspirations for the future. without support and facilitation from a distant and unresponsive state. Although Maldivian youth live in the wealthiest country in South Asia, with a similar per capita GDP (measured in PPP terms) to Mexico or Argentina, Maldivians in the working age group are faced with many of the pressures of post-industrialist society. It seems to be the case that efforts to improve the well-being and empowerment of young people have lagged behind economic growth. Such absence of meaningful socio-economic participation and engagement is evident from the fact that twenty nine percent of the youth (between 18-35 years) remains without been engaged in any employment, education, or training (NEET) out of which 41% are women, and 15% are men, alluding to the increasing unpaid care burden of women after marriage or starting a family (Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2019and the number of NEET below 22 are similar for men and women. A higher NEET rate for women after 22 years alludes. Job opportunities are less in rural islands compared to the volume of jobs created and available in the Greater Male’ Region and in other urban centres of the country. This is reflected by the fact that one third of the youth population, aged 18-24 years live in Male’, the capital city. Higher education enrolment is low in the Maldives compared to other Middle-Income Countries (International Organization for Migration, 2018). According to the latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), overall unemployment is at 5.3% (4.8% among women and 5.6% among men). Also, 29 percentage of youth (between 18-35 years) belongs to Not in Education, Employment, or Training (NEETs) population, out of which 41% are women, and 15% are men (Household Income and Expenditure Survey, 2019).         Additionally, poor inclusivity in the employment landscape, gender stereotypes, issues related to harassment, unpaid care burden and the gender pay gap remains as hurdles to vulnerable groups like women’s and PWD’s participation in the labour force. Systemic efforts to facilitate access to services for PWD's continues to be lacking.  Even though existing laws mandate equal  opportunities in education and employment for PWD's, challenges remain for their access and meaningful participation in these opportunities. For instance, Maldives Civil service does not have a policy in effect for making reasonable adjustments for PWD's in the civil service. Moreover, most government offices, buildings and workspaces lack the enabling environment for PWD's to work.    In the absence of appropriate labour governance mechanisms, such as a minimum wage and a strong labour regulatory institution creates a race to the bottom in terms of wages and working conditions, which further exacerbate the unemployment trends for Maldivian young people.     Deficits in soft skills development and critical thinking in the education system and poor investment in professional skilling programs, including a negative attitude towards technical and vocational training programs, leaves the country with a labour force ill equipped to meet its development needs.     Educational attainment of youth in agriculture, engineering, manufacturing, and construction are low compared to the fields of social science, business and law, and education.   The disjuncture between the needs of the industries and educational programmes feeds into the gaps in the labour market with young local graduates being continuously marginalised due to lack of relevant qualification and experience.  Such labour trends put the Maldives in a fiscally compromised situation (high outflow of foreign currency in the form of remittances) and has significant implications for the long-term development of the country as it has just completed its first demographic transition almost five years ago. The issue of addressing the various exclusions in the Maldivian labor market is a complex issue with linkages to education policy, migration policy, labor governance as well as the many sectoral policies that has driven the expansion of various sectors including tourism and construction.

Maldives graduated from the Least Developed Country (LDC) category on 1 January 2011, owing to its high GNI per capita and human asset index (United Nations Committee for Development Policy, 2015). However, young people and women in the Maldives experience high levels of unemployment. While the country’s labour force participation rate is at 60%, the rate for men is much higher at 77% compared to 46% for women (National Bureau of Statistics, 2019). Tourism sector, which is the highest contributor to the country’s GDP, tend to employ large number of expatriates (National Bureau of Statistics, 2019).  Even amongst the 47% local workers in the tourism industry, only 3% are local female workers. Labour force participation rate for 15-24 years is low with 45% for female and 56% for male. Although, labour participation rate is highest for the age groups 25-34 and 35-44, gender parity is lowest for both age groups. Accordingly, men’s labour participation rate for the age group 25-34 is 91%, while for women the figure is 55%. These disparities further augment the vulnerabilities of youth and women. The labour market consists of a total of 177,585 registered expatriate workers and out of which more than 40% of expatriates work in construction industry (National Bureau of Statistics, 2020). Given the huge number of undocumented migrant workers, this number is estimated much higher.    Moreover, for persons with disabilities, stigmatization and volitation of their rights continue. Human Rights Commission of Maldives (HRCM), in December 2020 revealed that 72 cases of violations related to persons with disabilities were lodged.  While there are 8476  (2568 capital, 5908 atolls) registered persons with disabilities, the number of employed PWD's are few and far between. Especially for adult PWD's, because they were not able to complete their formal education, finding formal employment remains a challenge.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Weak Signal: Increasing drug abuse and crime among youth. Previous statistics show the majority of drug users in Maldives are between 15-24 years old. In the past years drug related offences have been on the rise, including among women and adolescents. The news media is filled with reports on this theme every week.   Recently, more qualitative and investigative articles have come up about many young people trapped I the world of drugs, homeless and unable to access rehabilitation services.  We have read stories of individuals as young as 19 years old, involved in drug abuse and trade. Often a common thread in these cases is their disengagement both socially and economically. We identified this as a weak signal of the current and future impacts of youth being excluded in the labour market.  Photo story gives a glimpse of a generation falling through the cracks.  https://mihaaru.com/gallery/1902    Weak Signal: More PWD's celebrated in the public sphere. We are seeing more and more persons with disabilities active and successful in the public life from achieving top scores at national O'levels, being employed in different occupations to representing Maldives at the Paralympics. This represents the aspirations of persons with disabilities to engage in all spheres of life. This reinforcing loop has led to the society's acceptance of PWD's as productive members of the society.  Also this has given visibility to the challenges faced by PWD's. This is the opportune time government agencies step up and put in place the policies and procedures for mainstreaming inclusion.    Story Physically disabled surfer from Meemu atoll https://dho.mv/lifestyle/84225    Story of first blind PADI certified diver in Maldives   https://dho.mv/people/83762    Stories of 3 young PWD's working, 2 at a national utility corporation,  1 at  the industrial village.   https://mihaaru.com/report/60831

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Maldives Accelerator acknowledges the urgency to build labour market resilience amid socio-economic, environmental, and technological challenges for the present and future generations of Maldivians. Demographic window of opportunity is closing for Maldives to capture its first demographic dividend. However, the potential to accelerate growth for the country cannot be unlocked as a substantial portion of this population including young people, women and PWDs are not productively employed. Investments are required in women, PWDs and young people's skills development, policies and programs to enable them to participate in productive and meaningful livelihood activities. A potential opportunity to benefit from a second demographic dividend can only be realised if the country is successful in employing the previously unemployed workforce.     The UNDP Maldives Accelerator Lab’s value proposition is not so much in the actual intervention as much as the process of coming up with the intervention which leads to a greater shared understanding of the problem, what is already being tried and the opportunity that it provides to test certain assumptions.        Accelerator Lab’s methodologies and approaches entails generating a shared and thorough exploration of the problem space, questioning and testing our assumptions and knowledge while also leveraging on existing solutions. One of our key purposes in the pursuit to solve this challenge is to support decision makers to sense and explore together and co-create a portfolio of experiments on this issue. The Learning Cycle Advisory Committee (LCAC) conceived as a forum for bringing together representatives from a broad spectrum of sectors. Convening of these diverse group of stakeholders in the process allows them to provide input to the design of experiments together with the space to test several assumptions that are implicit in their own interventions and to share varied experiences and lessons learnt from what they are all doing respectively. Additionally, the key stakeholders, especially public institutions would benefit from an opportunity to break away from conventional approaches and bureaucratic limitations to co-create the processes that are inclusive, participatory and bottom up. Accelerator Lab, through our methodology (sensing, exploring, testing and scaling) can be a catalyser that facilitates and inculcates this way of working within public institutions.
