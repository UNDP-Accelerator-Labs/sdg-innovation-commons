> Description of the solution

The program aims to prevent, minimize, and control the emission of pollutants from vehicles that circulate in the State of Mexico.  It implements partial driving restrictions determined by a vehicle's emission level classification. These classifications dictate the days when a vehicle is permitted to circulate. In times of heightened pollution, additional limitations are imposed in accordance with the severity of the environmental conditions.
