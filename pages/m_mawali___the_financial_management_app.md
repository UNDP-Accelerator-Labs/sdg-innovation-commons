> Explain what is it about

M'mawali is our solution designed and developped from the collaboration of UNDP and the Ministry of Telecommunication through it's agency ANIEN.  
M'mawaly is a financial management app available for the women as contribution to their resilience against COVID-19 pendemic situation. 
 For the initial part of our project, like a normal app developpment, from the idea, we passed through a dianogstic of what women are really living in their respective activities as challenges. So, after some analyses we ended by designing and developping M'mawali. Essencially, the app is about finacial expenditures and incomes management for the women to better understand their finance movement.

The App is the result of the common work between UNDP and the ministry of the telecommunication. From this collaboration, the Lab was sollicited by the C.O to accelerate the process. So now we are pleased to announce you that we just ended the sharing of the smartphones and the training so that they be able to use by themselves.
