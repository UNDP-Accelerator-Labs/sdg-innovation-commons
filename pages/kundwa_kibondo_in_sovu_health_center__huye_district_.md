64 cases of malnourished children with 17 severe cases (in Red) were registered at Sovu Health Center in 2017, the Head of Sovu Health Center, the Sector Executive Secretary and Community Health Workers came up with an initiative to overcome malnutrition cases. Kundwa Kibondo program was thus established through which each family with malnutrition cases is supported to have a kitchen garden and is required to contribute Frw 100 per month used to support in the preparation of a balanced diet for malnourished children at the Health Center. The Health center and Huye sector staff committed to contribute Frw 200 per month in order to support malnourished children with eggs and fruits. 113 malnourished children were rehabilitated and their parents formed groups that help in monitoring of malnourished children on a daily basis. The sector lent to the families with malnutrition cases government plots to grow some vegetables. The Head of Sovu Health Center carries out numerous trainings with the parents whose children have been affected by malnutrition to teach them how to tackle this issue completely.
