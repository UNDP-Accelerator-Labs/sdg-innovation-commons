## STEM Garage targets all children but particularly girls from disadvantaged backgrounds in Sierra Leone. Isata Jalloh successfully guided her team to pilot STEM learning in Bo City in June 2022. This pilot demonstrated children's ability to acquire digital skills more quickly when the learning approach is fun and hands-on.
