## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Inclusive development in Ukraine: employment, urban transformation and long-term policies
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that current public policies in Ukraine that concern achieving decent livelihoods are based on limited and short-term evidence, which leads to low level of results for vulnerable people (i.e. senior people, people with disabilities), who are significantly excluded from social life and experience additional barriers for economic (labor, livelihoods) opportunities, and put lack of systemic approaches exacerbates inequalities in communities. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In 2019-2020, Accelerator Lab has been involved in supporting the national digital literacy agenda in Ukraine, we have facilitated the provision of human-centered evidence on digital literacy in Ukraine.    When COVID-19 hit, we have partnered with colleagues in the Country Office to map weak signals and spotted the opportunity to advocate for better inclusion of people with disabilities as remote work has put them in essentially equal position with all labor force ( not having to commute to the office and have specially designed offices for wheelchairs).   Problems with employment of people with disabilities are quite serious challenges and are characterized by a variety of their manifestations. They cover both the difficulties of social, professional and psychological adaptation of people with disabilities to the demands and proposals of the labor market, and external employment conditions for this vulnerable group.   Among the former, a certain isolation or even self-isolation of people with disabilities from the outside world, generated by the history of their disability and the general, mostly negative stereotypical attitude of society to their problems and demands, occupies a significant place. Their long stay in specific conditions, too slow implementation of the policy of inclusion and accessibility to public and public services, lack of proper motivation and necessary assistance in forming an active focus on going beyond physical and social alienation are noticeable.    This requires the state and society to study the situation of people with disabilities, on this basis to develop and implement well-thought-out and consistent measures to form a positive motivation to take an active attitude to solving their own problems, going beyond the usual environment, establishing new social and professional contacts. Of course, as much as possible physically and psychologically for each individual case. Finding a job and getting it can be a powerful way to solve this set of personal and social problems of people with disabilities.   These engagements revealed the systemic challenge of inclusion of elderly people and people with disabilities in Ukraine, highlighted the lack of policies and long-term thinking on the governmental side.  While a lot is done with regard to addressing barriers for wide inclusion in Ukraine, we found that the policies and programs are focused on short term goals and do not take into account the future trends, weak signals and complexity of the issue. Thus, we approach this challenge both from injecting future-thinking methods into national policies and exploring barriers.

Today, there are around 600 million people aged 60 years and over worldwide. This number will double by 2025 and will reach two billion by 2050, with the vast majority of older people in the developing world   Ukraine has one of the ‘oldest’ humanitarian crisis: 30% of all people in need of humanitarian assistance are over 60. They constitute over 50% of registered IDPs.  https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/sites/www.humanitarianresponse.info/files/documents/files/06_2020_advocacy_note_protection_of_older_people_eng.pdf    In Ukraine, there is more than 21% of people age over 60 (9 million people)      •32% elderly respondents say that more opportunities for work and income are needed •27% would like authorities to listen to their needs better •33% do not engage in any social activity   Future trend:   Extending working lives and promoting senior entrepreneurship are increasingly perceived as economic drivers, and both can enable older people to better leverage their institutional knowledge, wisdom, and insights about their peers. In sectors including healthcare, financial services, retail, travel, and entertainment, jobs done by older people that cater to other older people can help capture massive, untapped spending  power.  https://intelligence.weforum.org/topics/a1Gb0000000LHRxEAO?tab=publications   - private sector will need to create age-neutral workplaces, and life-long learning opportunities, - success is contingent upon combating prejudices about ageing and life expectancy Signal from Ukraine: Ukrainian Media Giant nominated for best HR practice for countering age discrimination What: The 1+1 Group is summarizing the project that started in May 2019, they received 1854 CVs from senior people from all around Ukraine and employed 14 interns.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

AccLab will bring unique futures and systems thinking methods into exploring the challenge: horizon scanning, strategic foresight, simulation games, deep listening etc. Currently inclusion work in UNDP Ukraine is placed in different projects and programmes and does not take into account the changing nature of work. We will work on development of strategic innovation capacities within national partners on central and local level, our work will focus on testing ways new methods can improve public policies and outcomes for people of Ukraine. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Exploring inclusive development in Ukraine. Deep listening to coalmine dependent cities and facilitating better understanding of barriers for economic inclusion of people with disabilities in Ukraine. Experimenting with futures thinking in the Ukrainian public sector.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the real barriers and opportunities for people with disabilities employment and inclusion?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Systems thinking and sensemaking allow to understand the issue of economic barrier of people with disabilities from multiple perspectives, beyond labor policies and will help us identify new areas for intervention;   Gamification will be used to simulate the experience of people with disabilities for the representatives of ecosystem, in order to immerse them into different reality;   Co-Creation will put partners (businesses, people, etc) into equal positions when designing specific interventions

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

By observing experience of people, focus groups etc will give us better perspectives on the issues under exploration
