# Changing the Narrative Around Digital Education in Malawi

### [[0:00]] Good morning\. Please can you tell me your name and position, please?

My name is Hazel Namadingo\-Shaba\. I'm the head of Solutions mapping for UNDP Accelerator Lab in Malawi\.

### [[0:11]] OK\. And I'm your interviewer today\. I'm Aki from Sierra Leone\.

OK\.

### [[0:16]] So basically the interview is just to ask you a few questions about your R&D story, an R&D story you have from your lab and how it speaks to the practice of R&D in development\. OK, so what would you give the name of your story?

OK, so the story I want to share, if I were to give you the title, I would call it, I would call it changing the narrative around the use of digital for education in low income countries like Malawi\.

### [[1:01]] OK, so tell me, so tell me about the story\.

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
OK, so this story started in 2020 around the time of COVID and it came about because as a lab we're looking at understanding COVID as an imaging issue\. So from 2019 when we started out as a lab to 2020, we had established partnerships with universities and in Malawi we have six public universities\. So these were our places, our go to places apart from the communities to also highlight or identify innovative solutions\. So when we reached out to the universities to say who is already working on this issue, who already has solutions to respond to COVID, we came up with an array of solutions that the students were either putting together\. They already had a prototype, they were looking to scale or they were looking for funding\. They had an idea, but they were looking for funding to develop the prototype\. So one of the solutions that came up\.

### [[2:18]] So tell me a bit about the solution you discovered\.

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[tools:Desk review analysis]]
[[tools:Literature review and desk research]]
[[skills:Digital skills]]
Yes\. So the solution we discovered from one of the universities was a solution that had to do with a virtual lab for teaching and learning sciences\. So science courses in secondary schools\. So these included chemistry, biology, physics for students in in secondary form, form 1, which is like equivalent to grade 7 of high school to form 4, which is equivalent to grade 12 of high school\. So this is a time where students are preparing for their university and it's a requirement that as students they need to have credits in sciences for them to be able to enroll to universities\. So we had noted that there was a big disparity between the urban and the rural areas in terms of the infrastructure to do with teaching and learning sciences or STEM education in general\. Because you find more schools in the urban setting where they have physical laboratories where they could learn these sciences, they could do unlimited experiments and they were already set to excel in their exams\. So you have more representation of urban kids in the universities than the rural folk\. While in the rural areas we have what we call community de secondary schools where the infrastructure is limited, the resources are limited, and they basically do not have physical laboratories where they can do their science experiments\. So admittedly you find that in universities you have more privileged kids attending a university education and less privileged kids just finishing at Form 4 or secondary school education\. So we thought that this is a solution that could improve things a little bit in terms of access to quality education, number one, as well as in terms of access to education in general\. Because once the community, the kids in the Community Day, secondary schools could access this virtual lab, they could learn anywhere at any time\. They could do their experiments anyway\.

### [[4:44]] OK, so like who did you work with on this solution? I know the universities obviously were on board\. Did you have any other partners you worked with on this particular solution?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
Yes\. So it was important for us because at the beginning we wanted for this solution to scale\. So we engaged the Minister of Education from the beginning when we identified the solution and when we had the intention to support the university to refine the solution\. Obviously, the solution would be used in schools\. So the key stakeholder there was the Ministry of Education\. There are different departments in the Ministry of Education and we made sure that we worked with all the departments that were concerned with checking or validating the solution as well as also making sure that the solution was used in in the schools\. So we worked with the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation in the Ministry of Education, we worked with the department that overseas the curricular development in the ministry and we also worked with the ministry that was responsible for secondary school education and open and distance learning department in the ministry\.

### [[6:03]] So since the development of the solution, how is it currently being, is it currently in use, how is it grown? Is it what has been like the outcomes of this particular solution in the education system?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
Yeah\. So since the stakeholders were part of the R&D journey from the beginning, they were there when the students were refining the innovation, when they tested the innovation with the users, with the students in the secondary schools as well as the teachers to do to see if the teachers could use this solution in the school\. The solution evolved to a point where now the ministry was comfortable to have it used in schools\. So they started with two pilot schools in the first year\. But now since 2021, the ministry has brought out the solution to 56 schools across the country\.

### [[7:10]] OK, so what do you think were like the, the critical moments in terms of their, their willingness to adopt that solution? What, what was the driving force for like the ministerial education to adopt this particular, this solution?

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
So I think the biggest driving force has been that the solution as a virtual lab is one of the targeted solutions or interventions in the national development agenda\. So we have a national development group booklet for the 1st 10 years to 2063\. We have a 2063 development agenda and then we have the 1st 10 year implementation plan to 2030\. So in the in the 10 year implementation plan, the virtual labs or science virtual labs are one of the critical interventions that are targeted by the government that have been targeted by the government\. So it was easy for the Ministry of Education to adopt this solution because it was already outlined or highlighted as a critical government area of intervention\.

### [[8:32]] So you, you discovered the solution to like an innovation challenge?

No, it was through the usual solutions mapping that we that we do\. It wasn't the challenge\.

### [[8:43]] Oh, OK, OK, sorry\.

It wasn't a challenge\.

### [[8:47]] OK\. So what opportunities do you see in terms of this particular solution in terms of growth within Malawi or maybe even being adopted in other countries? Because I know digital hubs for education is something that's it's picking up pace, especially in Africa now there's a big push for online learning\. So I don't know what opportunities do you see in terms of this solution in for greater?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Yeah\. So there's a lot of opportunity for this, for this solution because when we started, we were targeting education for secondary school students\. But when the government came in, they said it can work beyond secondary education\. So we can even start from primary or basic education going across to tertiary education because of that demand for online learning, but also as the world is going digital, these are some of the solutions that we are more inclined to support and to grow\. I should also mention that apart from UNDP, initially it was just the UNDP and government, but now UNICEF is, is interested\. You know, education is an area for or a mandate for UNICEF\. So UNDP looking at the potential of the solution, we looked in other stakeholders and other potential donors and we are speaking to UNICEF and there's interest there that UNICEF can also come in to grow this solution because as you can see, it's not just a learning app, but also there are a lot of things that needs to be put into consideration\. We're talking of infrastructure, we're talking of devices, we are talking of Internet access, connectivity availability in the in the schools\. So we are pulling together other stakeholders who can come in and expand the solution\. But there's a lot of a lot of interest, a lot of push in fact, from the government that this this solution be scaled up across all the schools in the mission\.

### [[11:13]] One ad hoc, one thing I just want to ask, do you have an online university at Malawi?

Not an online university, but the universities that are there provide online learning\.

### [[11:27]] OK\. Yeah\.

So we have an open and distant learning department that oversees online and distance learning in every institution, in every education institution in the country\. This is something that can be integrated\. Maybe\.

### [[11:44]] Yes, I know in in Salem, there's a big push for an online university, but it's not happening yet\. Thank you very much, Hazel, for your time\.

Thank you, Aki\.
