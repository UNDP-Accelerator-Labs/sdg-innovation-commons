The trash bin is made out of waste materials (tyres and used bolts and nuts to assemble the tyres into a bin). The bin is cost effective that gives it a competitive advantage.

The bin is sold as a set (one yellow for plastic waste and one sky blue for non plastic waste) – recycling is promoted and can be a fun thing to do by users.
