> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Solar Fiji successfully installed a solar energy ice plant on the remote island of Rabi Fiji. This allows for coastal villages that are dependent on fishing for sustenance and income generation to be able to store their produce for longer. It is also a more cost-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to ice plants that are powered by diesel generators.
