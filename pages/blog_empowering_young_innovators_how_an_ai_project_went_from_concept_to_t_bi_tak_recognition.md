How can young people acquire digital skills and use them to solve social problems? The Innovation Campus project, launched by Samsung Electronics Türkiye and UNDP Türkiye, provides an answer to this very question. Since 2020, the program has been equipping young individuals with essential skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), Coding, and Programming, preparing them for digital transformation. Inspired by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it promotes quality education, decent work, and inclusion.This year, one of the young participants of Innovation Campus made a significant impact in Türkiye’s science and technology ecosystem. Ahmet Furkan Bayram developed an AI-powered health technology project called Mammo-Des as part of the program. His innovation received support from TÜBİTAK and was honored with the TÜBİTAK Seal of Excellence. But for him, this was just the beginning—he went on to establish his own company to bring Mammo-Des to life. From Idea to Enterprise: The Birth of Mammo-DesAhmet Furkan Bayram, a Computer Engineering graduate from Karadeniz Technical University, is an AI specialist. When he joined the Innovation Campus, he set out with the idea of developing an AI-based solution in the healthcare sector. He recognized the life-saving importance of early detection in breast cancer—a disease that affects one in every eight women worldwide and often requires lengthy diagnostic processes.To address this challenge, Bayram designed Mammo-Des—an AI-powered decision support system that assists doctors in diagnosing breast cancer more accurately and efficiently. Unlike traditional diagnostic methods that rely on extensive analysis and human interpretation, Mammo-Des provides fast, data-driven recommendations, offering a powerful tool for healthcare professionals.With the support of the TÜBİTAK 1812 Entrepreneurship Program, Bayram transformed Mammo-Des into a startup and founded RATIONE DIVIDE, a company specializing in AI solutions for the healthcare sector. While continuing to develop Mammo-Des, his company is also working on other AI-driven innovations in the medical field.Through Innovation Campus, Samsung and UNDP continue to support young individuals who aim to convert digital skills into social impact. Ahmet Furkan Bayram’s journey is a testament to the opportunities that this program provides. For anyone looking to contribute to Türkiye’s digital transformation and become a leader of the future, Innovation Campus offers the perfect starting point.
