## What is the challenge?

One of the major challenges for Bangladesh is the growing electronic waste, a growing threat to the environment and ecology. The other challenges are growing energy related costs and electricity challenges in many rural and semi urban areas such as Khulna. While many people have solar panels in these areas, they can’t use the energy because of affordable products and technical solutions.
## What is the solution? How does the solution work

To address this challenge, Nature Plug, an initiative by two young students from Khulna, Bangladesh has been working on a small project to make new electronic products from electronic waste with the stated goal of recycling electronic waste as much as possible. It currently has three products:

1. A low-cost mini UPS made from old laptop batteries, which can be used to keep Wi-Fi and small electronic devices running during load-shedding.

2. A solar inverter, a highly in-demand device for people in the Sundarban region where electricity is a challenge. Many people have solar panels installed in their homes but often can't use the energy because they don't have an inverter. Load-shedding remains a challenge in this region, but people also don't properly use solar energy. To address this challenge, the Nature Plug team has introduced a low-cost inverter made from electronic waste. The currently available Chinese inverters in the market don't come with a warranty or guarantee. Nature Plug says its product is of high quality and comes with warranty. It uses 30-50% electronic waste in its inverter. It collects the main components such as SMPS, transformers, etc., from electronic waste, recycles them, and uses them in its inverter.

3. LED lights. LED lights are a common product throughout Bangladesh. What we usually do when an LED light doesn't work is throw it away, but you can fix it and reuse it. Nature Plug recycles used LED lights, improves them, and sells them.
