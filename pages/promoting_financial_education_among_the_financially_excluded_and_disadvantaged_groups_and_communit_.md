The innovation is designed around the National Strategy on Financial Education ( NSFE II) for Zambia. The Republic of Zambia have among other goals to achieve a financially educated population by 2030. The National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) indicates that there is a need to improve financial literacy levels in Zambia. This status is also reported by World Bank Report of 2017 dubbed 'Enhancing Financial Capability'. The financial education innovation and programs are centered around the four themes as follows:

    e) Investments and stocks
    f) Retirement and Pension
    g) Financial products &amp; services
    h) Consumer protection

> Anticipated Social Impact

Financial literacy is a major determinant of demand for financial services. Financial illiteracy is widespread among the youths, elderly ,women, the poor, less educated and the underprivileged. Since financial literacy is a combination of awareness, knowledge, skill, attitude and behavior necessary to make sound financial decision and ultimately achieve individual financial wellbeing. The world as a whole and Zambia in particular has been affected by causes of over-indebtedness, financial scam, financial crises ,globalization and changing demographics. Therefore anticipated social impact derived from consumer insight is immeasurable. Households, MSMEs,  SMEs, Communities, governments and the economy would benefit greatly if such innovation is implemented and supported. The proposed innovation is relevant to the current market because nations, corporate governance institutions, individuals, targeted groups, free streets and environment gain more from financially educated population, is likely to save and invest more, to be better equipped to run successful businesses and use financial products that are appropriate to their circumstances. This would help reduce levels of financial exclusion and poverty.
