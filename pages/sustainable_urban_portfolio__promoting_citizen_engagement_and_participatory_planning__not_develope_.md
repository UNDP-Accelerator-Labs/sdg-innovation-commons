## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

This learning cycle was identified based on observations of the number of mega projects and urban changes taking place and the possible gaps in engaging the community. We have still not developed it further.&nbsp;

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We mapped activities that the Accelerator Labs are working on globally around this theme. This promoted inspiration and allowed better visualization of the potential activities that could be explored in the local context (for both internal UNDP colleagues and external potential partners).&nbsp;
