Future Tourism Regional Policy Dialogues - Summary Report
SEPTEMBER 27, 2021
The rapid growth in the number of international visitors to the region over the past several years has led to limited social and economic benefits for Caribbean people. The income per capita in several Caribbean countries in December 2019 was still below 2007 levels. Social and community development also lagged behind the growth in visitor numbers. The pause created by the COVID-19 pandemic presents the opportunity to rebuild the industry more equitably.
The purpose of this briefing paper is to present the recommendations of diverse stakeholders based on the key issues and opportunities affecting Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) involved in the tourism value chain in the Eastern Caribbean region.
