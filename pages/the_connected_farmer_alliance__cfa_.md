> Description of the solution

The Connected Farmer Alliance (CFA) is a partnership between USAID, Vodafone, and TechnoServe to improve the lives of smallholder farmers in Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. By using mobile technology, the CFA aims to connect farmers to markets, financial services, and agricultural information. This will help farmers increase their productivity, incomes, and resilience to challenges like climate change. The CFA is currently working with 30,000 farmers and multiple agribusinesses to achieve these goals.
