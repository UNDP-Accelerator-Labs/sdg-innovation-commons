> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The SchoolMaster Management System will be able to generate income through the its payment plan which we have is sectioned into two parts namely the premium pack costing k7500 per school term and the Standard package costing k2500 per term, the subscription fees that are paid to us are what we use to improve on the system as well as be able to operating as a business in term of transportation costs etc. The SchoolMaster system help in improving the accountability of the school in all areas and improves the teaching quality and teacher pupil relationship, it also improves the trust of the parents to the school as the system provides for them all access of their child's accounts, school materials and timetables and Teacher interactions. the targeted market for the SchoolMaster system are government schools and private schools in Zambia as the system is web based and accessible anywhere. We have already potential offtakers are Kings highway school who are already using the system. The system has a very positive impact on our environment as the will improve the educational standard of learning and teaching in our country.

> Technical Feasibility

The SchoolMaster System is a Web based Application which is designed to work on laptops, desktop and all android Phones provided its has internet connectivity The system also comes with an app which is designed for easy access by both school management and parents, Currently  we have not seen any prototype in Zambia with a system that works like Schoolmaster. We have already starting implementing to our Potential Clients once the agreement are made with the school we put up a plan to collect any data need for the system to be designed according to the school's specifications e.g colors and website designing, we then moving in to training all the staff members and all users on how to login in and use the system according to their roles and this is normally done with a month depending on the number of users.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The SchoolMaster System is designed to improve the lives of all user namely the school management, students,  parents and the teacher as it makes it easy for them to perform their duties anytime and anywhere without the limitation of weather the schools are closed due to unforeseen consequences such as covid 19 or any other.it allows schools to function without interruption to the learning of the students and all running of the school. it also improves the life of our children as they become part of the new existing technology movement of doing things online.
