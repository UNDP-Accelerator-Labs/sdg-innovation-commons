## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Development Partners Learning &amp; Coordination Platform_Employment and FoW
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that Development Partners are working in silos and not in an integrated way which does not lead to systemic transformation. There is no mechanism in place for development partners to regularly reflect and exchange learnings and coordinate actions related to employment and future of work that can lead to better optimization of resources, stronger partnerships, and to inform strategic planning and policy making.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?






The Government of Angola approved its National
Development Plan 2023-2027. The government defined
Human Capital as a critical pillar for development. Youth
employment and entrepreneurship are engines for
economic diversification.

Widening our images and narratives of what matters about
work is key to leveraging the opportunities that lie in a
comprehensive approach to employment creation.

Considering the systemic nature of this challenge, some of
these opportunities must be leveraged through coordinated
actions. Donors and Development partners play an active
role in supporting Government and providing financial and
technical assistance in the development and
implementation of policies, strategies, and projects.

System transformation requires strong partnerships and
coordinated action which can be fostered through
collective thinking and learning.

There is a need for a clear vision of the system that can
enable partners to better plan on how to integrate their
actions in a complementary way.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Analysis of programmatic documents from different development organizations show duplication in efforts and projects, non coordinated activities with the same government partners and low levels of program delivery. Similarly, learnings and results are not shared and available to all. Data on unemployment shows the urgency of an alignment to achieve bigger impact.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab has the capacity to apply collective intelligence, sensemaking and systems thinking to make sense of the complexity of the system and actors. The Accelerator Lab also has a clear perspective of the system having developed a Porfolio on future of Work and employment and is seen as a Knowledge broker. UNDP Angola is respected in their convener role and has experience in hosting platforms with key development partners and stakeholders. 




UNDP and EU joined forces to establish an informal Development partners learning and coordination working group. Quarterly collective intelligence sessions are an opportunity to collect insights about the overall initiatives around employment, future of work and entrepreneurship.











 


> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?






WHAT NEW EMPLOYMENT-RELEVANT TANGIBLE
PRODUCTS AND ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNMENT
AND PARTNERS PRODUCING? WHAT
DIFFERENCES ARE THESE MAKING?

WHAT TYPES OF CAPABILITY, ORGANISATIONAL
AND BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES ARE WE
OBSERVING AMONG KEY EMPLOYMENT
STAKEHOLDERS?

WHAT NON-OBVIOUS OR UNEXPECTED
DYNAMICS RELEVANT TO EMPLOYMENT ARE
OCCURRING IN COMMUNITIES?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We will use the above methods regularly to effectively map and show what is being done by each organization, identify synergies and what works and what does not work.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



At this stage there is no data on what is being done, how it interconnects and how is it working. These sources of data are complementary to have both quantitative document based information and qualitative data that is generated iteratively and collectively.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



All 8 participants in the platform are already benefiting from the work. UNDP CO is benefitting from it by designing new pipeline and building synergies. Additionally when the intelligence generated is provided to Government it will help inform strategies and policies, ultimately benefiting the employment system and the society. The EU is the biggest champion who we have brought to bring more legitimacy into the process.
