An initiative aimed at reducing the use of pesticides and developing environmentally-friendly farming methods. It aims to gather NGOs and civil initiatives with common purposes in order to act hand in hand to popularize alternative farming and pesticide control methods.




*This initiative is not exactly created by grassroots innovators however, it deserves being recognized and heard in this platform.
