## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The insights we sought to note on the frontier challenge were not fully captured as we experienced by delays during the course of the year. The country encountered 2 waves of political unrest which had a knock-on effect in the implementation of this learning cycle. The insights noted below are insights that relate to learnings noted during the  sensemaking and exploration phases of the cycle. These include: 
1. Stakeholder coordination and partnership formalization at an early stage is key in such actions plans, where each stakeholder is assigned roles and responsibilities. We lost one key partner towards the end of the action which affected progress of the plans greatly as they pulled out due to lack of funds, to carry out the pro-bono agreed responsibilities and roles.  
2. Another key insight generated through this learning cycle is that the country lacks a domesticated process or system for ensuring that local products meet the basic food health and safety standards that will allow them entry into mainstream market channels such as retail outlets. Government agencies and development partners for the longest time were under the impression that food processors need to meet international standards like ISO and Hasip, and this is usually a bridge too far for SME’s. Engaging retailors, in particular those with an Enterprise Supplier Development (ESD) unit, has revealed that from the point of view of retailors, it suffices to for the country to formulate a nationally determined regime of food health and safety standards using already existing government institutions that are doing food health and safety certification in one form or the other as part of the domestication food health and safety standards that can be used by SME’s as a proxy for the international standards.  This finding has presented a more achievable hurdle for local food processors and the AccLab is in the process of testing that approach. This learning cycle sought to bring together local partners that will help facilitate the development of a local blueprint of domesticated standards to facilitate for local agro-processed products access to food health and safety accreditation from a local perspective. 3. Another key insight identified during the learning cycle is that of ensuring mutual beneficial partnerships with the private sector. This intervention required extensive consultation with the private sector together with government agencies that are working on SME development support. A handful of retailors  that we engaged expressed willingness to support this initiative and primarily this was because these retailers had an enterprise development programme within their organisation that is focused on supporting and promoting local products. Those that did not have a similar structure were not receptive to the “Buy Proudly Swazi Campaign”. As such, when development priorities are aligned with strategic corporate priorities, partnerships between development agents such as UNDP and the private sector become possible. The same can be said as it relates to other development agents who have already partnered with the AccLab in this initiative and approximately $ 95 000 in cash and in kind has been raised to support the targeted beneficiaries over and above the resources availed by the AccLab.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

One of the main bottlenecks encountered in impacting the system is the lack of a domesticated quality and safety approach/ system/ policy that allows local agro-processed products to reach formal markets.  another bottleneck is that most agro-processing equipment tends to be imported which leads to supply chain issues that make it difficult for local producers to move higher up the value chain.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Direct Interviews and Ecosystem mapping - this was chosen in the exploration and sensemaking phase to understand the cottage industry and small agro-supply chain challenges and market barriers. The interviews were conducted with the participants, other development partners, private sector companies in grocery retail and government partners. This was useful in understanding the market barriers, development challenges and requirements for designing an experiment.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

This method is necessary for all components of the concept note in that it allows for small scale - studying and testing of agro-processing and formal market access in small scale. This will allow UNDP and partners to gather learnings of emerging challenges, and areas that need to be refined in the pilot design in order to come up with a blue print for similar interventions in UNDP programmes. This will also help the government and private sector partners how to refine similar projects in order to address the frontier of challenge of small businesses, remaining in cottage and informal industry phase.  
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We have been working with Private sector (Pick n Pay retail company), who is one of the large grocery retailers in the country. They are helping us test an Enterprise Supplier Development experiment for small scale producers We also worked with the Small Enterprise Development Company (SEDCO) who are a state owned enterprise and a lead partner for this learning cycle.  We also worked with the Eswatini water and Agricultural Development Enterprise (ESWADE) who provide technical support for the pilot on agro-processing of honey aimed at understanding the technical barriers to trade that affect local small scale produceres. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with Ministry of Commerce, SME unit, Ministry of Agriculture (Home economics department) to develop a pilot for agro processing of Cayenne Pepper to test the viability of moving local farmers higher up the value chain and developing local standards for this.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Private sector (Pick n Pay retail company).

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

For the activities we managed to carry out in the year, the interplay of innovation methods used, unusual partners and new forms of data was very difficult to coordinate.  1.We learnt 2 months into the action plan that the state owned enterprise which we had previously considered as a government entity is a private sector organization and needs a due diligence exercise. This was a big setback in terms of getting some activities done as all engagements had to be suspended pending the due diligence approvals. The UNDP partnership governance requirements were unclear at the beginning even within our CO.   2.The other unusual partner Pick n Pay was energetic during the first few planning meetings and committal. However in the last quarter of the year we noticed withdrawal signs in implementing some of the agreed roles such as paying marketing consultant's costs. This taught us that formal partnerships are key vs pro-bono for such key partners. 3. We also learnt that there are other enabling partners that we ought to engage as we proceed with the interventions in each component, whom we might need in the later stages of the experiment to provide guidance and support to the small agro-processors who would be participating in the experiment. These include, food safety and quality assurance agencies, municipalities, development financing organizations such as banks to support funding needs for product development, marketing of products. 4. We learnt that the community participants need constant support and encouragement to get to a level of owning and hands on involvement  in the pilots. This is key as in order to sustain the solutions to the development challenge, they need to run with the pilot activities from the early stages.
