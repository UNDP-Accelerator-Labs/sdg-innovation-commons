"...I initially got involved in environmental issues to understand their connection with social topics. The biggest impact will be on disadvantaged people; inequalities will increase, we will have fewer resources, and therefore, fewer opportunities for development, etc. Over time, I became more immersed in the topic and realized that talking about the environment is not just about protecting penguins; it means changing the country's development model and opens the possibility to discuss other issues."Interview #3, male, 23 years old, Buenos Aires city.In recent years, interest in the environment and social equity has been growing among young people, who acknowledge and highlight the intrinsic connection between the environment and social conditions. In Argentina, this youth movement has manifested itself showing an increasing awareness of the need for development models that are both inclusive and environmentally friendly. Therefore, the Accelerator Lab of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Argentina, the Co_Lab, began a qualitative research study to understand why young people are becoming publicly engaged in the socioenvironmental cause, what kinds of strategies and practices they value or employ, and what being an activist means to them.Our initial findings reveal that these young individuals connect their interest in environmental causes to different life experiences, ranging from moments in nature to witnessing socioeconomic crises. Despite their diversity, these experiences often share a common denominator: they allow young people to recognize that they are part of an interconnected whole, encompassing both nature and human actions. Furthermore, as the national movement is part of a global phenomenon, these youths emphasize the need to develop an agenda and actions that are relevant to local priorities and needs.Interviewees also acknowledge that environmental issues are often overshadowed by other more urgent or prioritized problems. Indeed, environmental topics frequently gain public attention reactively, following the negative impacts of events like wildfires, floods, or droughts. However, there is little proactive discussion about long-term solutions. How can we promote nature-based solutions that help reduce the spread of wildfires? What kind of cities do we want to live in? How should they be planned accordingly? How can we improve water resource management to ensure sustainable supply during droughts?To advance the socioenvironmental cause, this group highlights the importance of developing narratives and communication strategies that avoid an apocalyptic view of the environmental crisis, aiming to prevent feelings of despair and inaction. The reasoning is simple: if everything is lost and change is impossible, the struggle to drive transformations or transitions becomes meaningless. In response, there is widespread agreement that messages should be framed in a positive light, and that the movement must develop proposals through dialogue and collaboration with other stakeholders. The question then arises: What future are we willing to build together? In this context, young people emphasize the need to include social movements and those most exposed to environmental risks in the conversation and to define common strategies and action plans for development.
