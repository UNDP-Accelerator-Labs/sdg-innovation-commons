## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

It's time to prototype with communities on waste classification!
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

How to strengthen collaboration between institutions and civil society to improve waste management towards resilience to climate change 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

We’ve been working on understanding waste management from the different ecosystems that integrates the emerging systems in the metropolis as well as other villages in the Motagua River Basin, the largest watershed in the country and the most polluted one due to residual waters and solid waste.  Working with many actors from the Ministry of Environment to municipal authorities as well as citizens and even informal workers around the waste management emergent system, mainly in co-designing the “Transition Plans” which is a methodology we’ve created as Labs in response to the need to comply with national regulation in a very short timeline.   With the publication of Government Agreement 164-2021, which establishes that by August 2023 all waste, including those generated in homes, must be primary classified, and delivered into two main sorts of organic and inorganic, the urgency to address waste classification has become the priority.   In response to this, the Municipality of Guatemala, together with the technical team, the Auxiliary Mayor's Office of zone 5 and neighbors, the Waste Management Transition Plan was developed with the support of the Acc Lab, identifying priority actions for better waste management, including how to promote the classification of garbage from the source and without impacting the household economy.   So, part of our approach to waste management improvement challenge, became on what solutions were suitable enough to promote waste classification from households, complying with national regulation, towards scaling into city and metropolitan level.

According to the 2018 census 43% of population open burn their waste, which is presented in the countryside, however, only 42% of the population is using the waste collection service, 17% from municipal services and 25% of private (within informality) services. The concern is that waste collection only means transportation, not waste management which presents a critic scenario.   From this graph only 7% is using organic waste to compost, acknowledging the opportunities loss towards recycling.   According to the Ministry of Environment and the latest waste characterization average, the number of recyclables is up to 24% from inorganic, nontoxic and not composed materials. Meanwhile 53% is organic, which most of it has potential to bio-fertilizers or used to energy purposes. The graph is missing another 3% that related to clothing material.

Reading the signs that have emerged along the participatory processes, we have seen these key risk signals that must be addressed: 1)      The lack of understanding of municipal operations and administration by ministerial officials who, with the outline of the new regulation, leave gaps or contradictions for its compliance 2)      As result of top-down regulations imposed to municipalities, there’s a sense of discontent and discomfort is perceived; according to past experiences, this could lead municipalities to organize to legally revoke the regulation. 3)      The lack of certainty and regulations application has also generated a culture of indifference from citizens to comply with regulation, perceiving somehow the Waste Management Ministerial Agreement will be cancelled. 4)      We’ve been working on the field noticing that the pollution comes mainly from plastic containers on general and mass consumption products. Although there’s a growing sense on consuming more environmentally friendly products, the majority seems to keep consuming cheap which comes with a variety of plastic containers, and many of them without recycling technology in the country.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Taking the Ideathon experience, where we addressed the learning question on: “If waste collectors already segregate waste during collections routes, why people aren’t classifying waste from the source? We had come with successful results on prototyping with a real – operating truck, along with citizens, municipal authorities, students, automobile, and mechanic experts as well as waste collection workers. So now that plans were developed with local authorities, we as Lab, have the agility and flexibility enough to co-create prototypes along with unusual partners such as community leaders, neighbors, and particularly the waste collection guild and its workers including those under informality.

 

We’re aiming to find the most suitable solutions, validate them with counterparts and most important, thing is to try-out the prototypes with citizens in real day life scenarios to evaluate their performance and consider scaling opportunities.

 

Through participatory and co-creative processes, we bet these prototypes will generate a sense of belonging from different stakeholders that could promote its scalation eventually, and demonstrate through low-cost models, how they work in daily operations for waste management. 




> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

After agile planning and prioritized actions towards waste management in Guatemala City, now we´re launching 3 solutions on waste classification with local communities! Are you ready to join?
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

Citizens / household users from at least 3 neighborhoods (pre-selected) with possibility of a human settlement.

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

Our focus is on regular citizens, because the common waste comes from all households, who need to separate waste. Theory is drawn in the national regulation, however never tried out with end-users. Therefore, our main source of knowledge is based on citizen’s and worker’s acquaintance with solutions pre-identified, its' performance and opportunities for improvement and scaling. For this purpose, 3 communities have been pre-selected by local authorities: a) Neighoborhood Jardines de la Asunción Arco 5-6 – gated quarter; Neighborhood Vivibien – gated quarter; and c) Neighborhood 20 de Octubre, open quarter.

We have planned with local authorities, and even though citizens and waste collection services were included, it’s not the same to have drawn up a plan than to execute the plan and learn how does it go and what could be improved. We are looking to generate enough confidence in solutions to be owned and implemented officially in a larger scale.

Waste collection depends completely on this hybrid system of SMEs, however very powerful because without them, the Metropolitan Area wouldn't be able to provide waste collection service unless runs open bidding processes, politically complicated though. It's necessary to acknowlede these unusual partners and make them part of these pilot projects as well as future infrastructure projects.

We need to find stakeholders that can produce solutions pre-identified, as well as have the enough capacity to replicate them within a city-scale.  These partners are important to evaluate possible scenarios of scaling, growing or expanding to all counterparts including costs, distribution, efficacy and other conditions necessary to plan ahead accurately.

Examples speaks for itself, so we need to set an example from UNDP Guatemala. Prototyping could be less risky when doing try-outs in-house, so why not do it with our own staff before launching prototypes publicly? Plus, it's fun!

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

1) What other solutions could promote waste classification from citizens towards recycling?  1.a) What other solution uses less plastic from the bag recommended by central government?  1.b) Are these other solutions feasible to implement city-wide, nation-wide?  1.c) Are these solutions easy to use by households and waste collector workers?  1.d) Do they have the potential to be employed as financial recovery mechanism for local authorities pursing to cover the costs of waste final treatment and disposal?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

First the portfolio on solutions mapped will help to identify the most suitable solutions to be validated or adapted to local needs through co-creation through Human Centered Design methods. Therefore, the prototyping phase is focused to try-out with end-users and end-operators.  Field validation during testing is necessary particularly to evaluate performance within daily behaviors from communities involved but also from operations from waste collection services. Finally, we intend to collect individual and community user experiences to either enhance the solutions, iterate, or scale. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Validate the percentage of recyclables versus organic material, having the perception (weak sign) that the amount of recyclable material is actually bigger.  Real user – experience results, overcoming theorical and top-down solutions, never tried with local communities and in local conditions. What are the costs of implementing these solutions in a city-wide scale? 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Prototyping and trying solutions are intended to generate evidence on what works particularly to local authorities (Municpality of Guatemala the largest in the country) and aiming to generate more accurate knowledge to the Ministry of Environment. With the pilot plan, we can actually demonstrate the costs of implementation, citizens response to solutions and waste collection adaptation to solutions, in a small amount of time but also at very low cost. All of the solutions are not only intended to be escalated but also to work as a financial official mean to recover the costs of final treatment and disposal, which today is not being charged to anyone.
