## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

The intent of the FABLAB project is to explore how technology and innovation can drive sustainable development. It focuses on teaching participants how to use tools like 3D printing and laser cutting to create solutions that address environmental challenges such as waste recycling and renewable energy generation.

Why Is It Important?

This experiment is crucial because it empowers the community and students to engage in hands-on learning, fosters innovation, and promotes environmental sustainability through practical, scalable solutions that benefit society.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF participants in the FABLAB use innovative technologies to address environmental challenges, THEN they will create sustainable solutions that promote recycling, renewable energy, and responsible consumption, leading to greater environmental and social impact.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions to Test the Hypothesis:

Workshops and Hands-On Training:

Conduct workshops at the FABLAB UNIFRANZ to teach participants how to use 3D printing and laser cutting to create sustainable solutions.

Collaboration:

Partner with students, engineers, and community leaders to address environmental challenges like recycling and renewable energy.

Location and Timeline:

The project is ongoing at FABLAB UNIFRANZ, with activities and training sessions conducted throughout the year.

Prototypes and Solutions:

Participants will create prototypes (e.g., recycling tools, energy devices) to test their sustainability impact
