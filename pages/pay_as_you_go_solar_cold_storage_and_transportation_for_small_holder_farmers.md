> Brief description of the innovation

We offer small holder farmers pay as you go solar powered cold storage and transportation which is linked to ready market through the Zambia Development Agency ensuring we are a one stop location for small holder farmers and create a complete value chain.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Lack of storage in the fisheries, fruit and veg and livestock value chains results in 45% revenue loss for small holder farmers. Our innovation increases their revenue by 35%. We charge farmers 20 cents per 20kg crate storage per day. We also charge them $2 dollars per kilometer for transportation of their produce. Through our partnership we ensure they have a ready market to sell their produce to such as the large chain stores and exporting to markets outside Zambia. The challenge prize will assist us towards building an additional cold room in order to meet the demand for cold rooms. Our current market size is 1,5 million small scale farmers around Zambia with 1,2 millions small scale farmers is our addressable market, currently our market share is 5020 small scale farmers. These are farmers who live between 30 to 90km of the provincial capital and lack affordable transport, storage and have 2 Hectares or less of farming land. Our innovation uses solar energy and is off the grid ensuring it's climate resilient

> Technical Feasibility

Our solar cold rooms are made from refurbished containers and compressors. 80 % of the material used to build the cold room is sourced locally while the remaining 20% which is the battery and solar panels are imported. Depending on the size of the moveable cold rooms, implementation could take 2 to 3 weeks which includes the testing phase as well.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation increases the revenue of small holder farmers by 35% as opposed to the 45% revenue loss small holder farmers experience today. Our innovation ensure they can continue subsequent farming cycles, expand production, create employment in their communities to meet the production demand and ultimately provide food security in their communities. Our innovation ensures 90% quality retention of the produce which ensures nutritious produce is available to our communities.
