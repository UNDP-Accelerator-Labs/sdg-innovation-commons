Plastic Circularity and Waste Management: An Ethnographic Study August 2, 2022 The plastics crisis is one of the most complex global challenges of our time. With its negative impacts on both human and environmental heath, there is an urgent need to shift to a more circular economy for plastics. Our current take-make-waste model where single-use plastics has become ubiquitous in our daily lives is proving detrimental to our people and planet.

If we continue with business as usual, it is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. With the ocean holding special cultural, social, and economical value to Pacific Islanders, it is crucial that a whole systems approach is taken to address this plastics crisis. This publication is the product of 8 months of ethnography research on the stakeholders that make up the plastics value chain. Through research methods of participant observation, semi-structured, formal interviews, Fijian talanoa sessions (informal conversations), attendance at formal gatherings, and virtual ethnography—insights were generated from a range of stakeholders across the entire plastics value chain.
