> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

2500$

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Advance order has to be given

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Complete system tested and operated in real environment by several users TRL 8

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

The solution went through several iterations and modifications to reach its current final form. It has been thoroughly tested in lab-like conditions and real environmental conditions for extended periods. It has been operated by regular farmers for long duration in various environmental conditions.

> Please upload a link of end-user feedback


> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

The original benchmark has been regular surface diesel pumps (5 to 8 HP) which can pump between 50 to 100 cubic meters per hour depending water depth and elevation. The pump has met expected performance

metrics and proved reliable even in cloudy days. The pump is modular and can be tailored to different operational conditions that vary largely from region to  region

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

Key bottleneck is farmers' finance as they don't have the means to buy
