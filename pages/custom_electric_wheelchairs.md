The custom electric wheelchairs are made from scarp materials collected from junkyards and can withstand potholes and untarmacked roads. The innovator, Lincoln Wamae, was inspired to develop these wheelchairs after witnessing heartbreaking scenes of persons with disabilities struggling to board public service vehicles during a downpour in the Central Business District. His dislike for petrol led him to consider green energy. Most of his wheelchairs are made of 90% recycled materials, the only imported part is the battery management system.
