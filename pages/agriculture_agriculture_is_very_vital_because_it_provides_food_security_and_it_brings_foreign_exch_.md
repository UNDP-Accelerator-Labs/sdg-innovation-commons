> Title of the innovation

Agriculture:agriculture is very vital because it provides food security and it brings foreign exchange it brings development in the country,agriculture make people rich because no one buys rain its a offer from God so I have a good plan that can make more people to prosper through agriculture.

> Brief description of the innovation

Soya Bean is a very good product which is rich in protein and soya beans is very marketable in our country and outside our country.
Uses of soya beans are:
▪use to make cooking oil
▪use to make African tobwa (African porridge)
▪use to make soya chunks
▪use to make milk
▪use to make coffee soya
▪used to make medicines
▪it's good to lower high blood pressure 
▪it's good for people who suffer from from heart disease 
▪It's used to make sausages 
▪it's good for body building 
▪it provides more proteins in the body
I can mention a lot of things and the same soya beans is very expensive when it comes buy and sell,so if we can start producing enough tonnes of soya beans the country  can move to the next level and it can benefit both farmers and consumers,soya beans is marketable but lack of capital and other needful substances draw us down but will still do it without fail because we have you partners your help will definitely take this country to the next level.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Soya beans can generate income in various ways,if  I produce enough tonnes of soya bean I can just sell from my farm because this product is marketable 
-by selling to local companies 
-by selling to government 
-by selling to our locally butchering
-by selling to our neighbouring countries 
Because this product is on demand the market is there and this product is wanted as am talking  and we can cultivate we sell to the government and government sell internationally it can benefit more people and we as a country can prosper.

> Technical Feasibility

Agriculture is the main industry that can help to reduce poverty if the country have enough crops and product we can't see poverty  

My plan is to start producing enough soya beans local and international level we can't just depend on mines alone but also agriculture which is food eating  thank you

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation can improve lives of others by selling enough soybeans to companies that manufacture soya chunks because of high prices of beef sausages and other products we can reduce prices of soya because it's produced within the country and it can also benefit transporters and many more
