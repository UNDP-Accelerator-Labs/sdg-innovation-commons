> Type of the Solution

Active Cooling System

> Description of the solution

The Thermally Activated Building System (TABS) is a combined heating and cooling system with pipes embedded in the structural concrete slabs or walls of multi storey buildings. TABS operates at temperature close to ambient enabling more efficient utilization of renewable and free cooling sources. Moreover, it provides optimized thermal indoor environment.
