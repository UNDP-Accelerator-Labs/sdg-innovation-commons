> Title of the innovation

Sustainable ways of producing insect proteins for both Man and animals

> Brief description of the innovation

Protein production using black soldier fly, biomass is turned into lavea and residue, lavea become the source of protein equivalent to fish meal in protein percentage. Also  crickets keeping with protein percent equivalent to that of beef meat.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We are going to cut dependance on soy bean and fish meal proteins, this industry is can be done on the small and large scale,, the process is environment friendly.

> Technical Feasibility

I have designed a house scale operation, which in due time people will be amazed because the process is cheaper and sustainable.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Feed for animals and birds will drop drastically in the country.

> Name of the Innovator

Fredrick Chinyama

> Age

- 36-49
