This is a charcoal oven that is moulded in pure steel. It can be used to bake local food, bread, and cake and can be used as a barbecue stove as well. It has a steel lid for baking purposes and a steel mesh wire layer separating the charcoal briquettes from the food. It can hold up to 5 baked tins per baking session. It is cheap, portable and is of a quality product.
