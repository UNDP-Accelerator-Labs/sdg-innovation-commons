## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Shamar Ward

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

April 12th 2023

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Low Cost and Innovative, Emerging technology to solve developmental challenges.

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

In Barbados the Child Care Board operates a total of fifteen (15) day cares across Barbados. These day cares cater to over 600 early childhood learners from 9:00AM to 5:00PM daily. There is currently a need for greater numbers of affordable manipulatives such as blocks, peg puzzles and learning aids considering the frequently high cost of these items. Additionally, most of these items must be sourced internationally as these learning tools are generally not made locally, which also increases the cost and complexity of acquisition. Lastly, there is the issue of product wear and tear which will occur naturally over time with children, requiring recurrent replacement of goods.  

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

The 3D Building Block Pilot is an experiment which seeks to determine if 3D printed manipulatives can be used as more affordable, accessible and innovative early childhood learning aids and manipulatives in the Government Day Care system.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Determine if 3D printed manipulatives are as effective as traditional manipulatives.

Determine if the use of 3D printing for the creation of manipulatives can aid manipulative research since it supports the customization of the manipulatives.

Determine if 3D printing of manipulatives can reduce the cost of manipulatives available on island especially to government ran day cares with high enrolment numbers.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

3D printed manipulatives reduces the cost of acquiring manipulatives and therefore would increase the access to manipulatives on island particularly in the government ran day care system.

The 3D printing of manipulatives locally, would enable early childhood practitioners to experiment and trial various variations of manipulatives enabling them to determine which ones work best.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

- 3D Design & Printing of blocks and peg puzzles in collaboration with the Barbados Child Care Board. 

- Printing of open source 3d block models and peg puzzles. 

- Design of 3D models and peg puzzles. 

- Integration of the 3D printed blocks and peg puzzles into a selected day care. 

- Care givers will monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the tools created. 

- Amendments to the manipulatives will be made. 

- Reporting on the performance of the 3D manipulatives. 

- Creation of a 3D design course to enable the creation of new manipulatives by secondary and tertiary students. 

- Validation of the 3D Design and Printing of manipulatives E-learning training toolkit. 

- Creation of a submit to print model. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Individual

Focus groups 



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

- An evaluation sheet will be created by the Barbados Child Care Board (CCB) which will be completed by the care givers in the day care setting.

- A cost analysis will be done to evaluate and compare the cost of sourcing blocks locally vs 3D printing them.

- A focus group will be used to determine the ease of fostering research into making various variations of the 3D manipulatives which would support research into optimal learning tools for early childhood learners.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 Months to implement all the stages.

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
