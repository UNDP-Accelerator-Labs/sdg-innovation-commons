## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Holistic and sustainable approach: By structuring conversations with citizens (both digital and on the spot) over the future vision of public spaces, we could influence the transformation of public spaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also environmentally sustainable and economically viable. 


Inclusivity and diversity: Community-led processes are inclusive and consider the diverse needs and perspectives of different groups in the community. Structured conversation on a different aspect of the future design of public spaces reveals those needs and helps prioritize actions so that needs and perspectives are accounted for optimally. 


Empowerment and ownership: By involving the community in transforming public spaces, individuals were not just given the power to (re)shape their environment but also developed a sense of ownership over the space, hopefully contributing to its further sustainability and care. 


Communication, collaboration, and partnerships: Community-led transformation of urban public spaces amplified the importance of building partnerships between the local government and community. For that to happen, outreach and communication is a key. Over time, it helped in the trust-building process and in "reducing the distance" between citizens and elected officials in this pilot local government - in the end, the mayor itself was facilitating the urban transformation workshops with citizens - all working hand-in-hand.  


Political will is key: If the urban public places transformation initiative has not received adequate political support, it would be almost impossible to implement it in practice. The willing and devoted mayor and his team were preconditions for the success of pilot interventions.

Still not availible.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

We have identified the following impediments and bottlenecks to community-led urban transformation of public spaces: 
- Resistance to change in the existing system: Political leadership and civil servants are two parts of the coin. In our case, the municipality's urban planning and urban design department is still not much involved in the process. While we have strong support from the mayor, we still have to work on changing traditional mindsets and embedding new approaches to public space (re)design at the operational level. 
- Limited resources: The approach we designed requires new resources (for designing surveys, visual designs, organizing open space workshops, outreach & communication, etc.), which, although not so significant, counts in terms of new investments in time and money. 
- Lack of community engagement: It is challenging to engage and mobilize community members to participate in the design process if, as in our context, "participatory democracy" is a relatively new practice. 
- Limited expertise among the civil servants: Lack of practice and knowledge on values and principles of community-led local development may impede local government from adopting this approach. 
- Lack of follow-up: This type of initiative requires a strong commitment from the local government to follow up on the citizens' ideas and recommendations generated through the design process. We are experiencing delays in implementing the designs, which already backfires in a way - the level of citizens' engagement is decreasing over time. 
- Balancing diverse interests: We experienced heated debates and the expression of conflicting interests and opinions among different community members at the on-site events and through the digital survey. Arriving at a consensus was impossible, and not everybody will be happy with the outcome of the participatory process.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The initiative was inspired by the research and publication on the topic, titled "Urban rooms of Sarajevo", written by professors at the Faculty of Architecture, University of Sarajevo, which proposed changes to the urban public design process to be more citizens-led and inclusive and aim for sustainability, inclusiveness and aesthetic in parallel. We took it from there and experimented with ways of working with people to obtain the overall and authentic opinion of citizens, especially those living and working in the neighborhood.   

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The essence of experiment was to nudge the existing system of urban planning and design and embed community perspectives. We used collective intelligence crowdsourcing as an umbrella method. Visual prototypes of a design solutions were used to validate that overall will of citizens were accounted for.
## Partners

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Our goal was to bring in diverse perspectives and ideas of citizens living and working near the urban public spaces in its (re)design process. Obviously, desk research or passive public consultations does not help.
