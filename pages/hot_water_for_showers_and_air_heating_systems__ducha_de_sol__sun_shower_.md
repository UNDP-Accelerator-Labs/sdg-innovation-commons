> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

This is a socio-environmental project which objective is to provide hot water for showers and air heating systems for all types of homes, harnessing the clean and sustainable energy of the sun.  To do this, a solar water heater and a solar heater were created, made with recyclable and low-cost materials, which reduce the consumption of traditional fuels and contribute to caring for the environment. In addition, in vulnerable populations, they allow people to obtain hygiene and comfort by providing the possibility of a hot shower and a warm home in winter, which improves self-esteem and social inclusion.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

With this solar water heater, 70% of the fuel used in conventional water heaters per year can be saved. This implies triple impact actions that avoid more than 70% of greenhouse gas emissions of family origin, which pollute the atmosphere and lead to global warming.
