> Title of the innovation

Hydroponics Vegetable growing System

> Brief description of the innovation

Put simply, it is a way to skip the soil, substitute in a different material to support the roots of the plant, and grow crops directly in nutrient-rich water. There are multiple approaches to designing hydroponic systems, but the core elements are essentially the same. I would not necessarily call this an innovation but it is something I would like to be the first (to the best of my knowledge there currently isn't anyone operating this type of system) to start operating one.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It has a very large potential to boost the Export market as well as the GDP of the country by exporting fresh produce to most of Zambia's neighboring countries that do not have high levels of farming activity, and at an attractive price too. It can as well further open up trade levels between Zambia and it's neighbors taking advantage of how well positioned the country is geographically.

> Technical Feasibility

Hydroponics is the cultivation of plants without using soil. Hydroponic flowers, herbs, and vegetables are planted in inert growing media and supplied with nutrient-rich solutions, oxygen, and water. They use the light's energy to split water molecules they've absorbed via their root system. On a medium to large scale, the process can run fully on renewable supplies of energy and nutrients (e.g a solar energy power system to run the artificial light to allow the plants to grow at the same speed at night as during the day. Said solar power system also running pumps which in turn get their water from a borehole, water which also gets its nutrients from a fish pond [the fish pond getting it's clean water from the borehole]).

> Anticipated Social Impact

There exists a number of social impacts chief among which include a cheaper supply of vegetables to Marketeers which leads them having higher profits. Another being the overall impact on the Enviroment down to ground level. The lack of soil use translates into less water used during the growing process, a faster and more efficient growing process requiring less time and resource to yield the same amount compared to traditional growing. Continuing on still on the lack of soil use, less water is also needed to wash the vegetables. When grown in ideal sanitary conditions, the produce can go from the farm straight into the consumer's plate without needing any cleaning (this has significant long term Enviromental benefits). Growing vegetables this way also helps get healthy foods into people's homes, they will be more inclined to buy local commercial produce seeing as most produce is imported (buyer confidence is not at it's highest in such a case), it also has more stable marginal production costs. The list of benefits is long but these are just a few of the benefits from using hydroponics for farming. This aligns with the SDGs that the Government has to diversify the Zambian economic activity set up and move it way from mining into Farming. It can be easily implemented in urban areas bring the produce closer to the marketeers resulting in less transport costs as well as less emissions from cars and trucks (during transportation of the produce) since they cover a shorter distance (potentially half or less than half) better improving not only the Nation's but the World's efforts to reduce the degrading effects of our day to day activities. As the population grows further and further it will become more and more beneficial to use waterless plant growing for a lot more things than edibles, freeing up land for other commercial and domestic activities including the ever increasing demand for housing.
