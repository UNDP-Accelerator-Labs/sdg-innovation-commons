## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) CBT can go beyond leisure tourism and provide learning experiences for visitors as well as incentives for local people to become more interested in environmental conservation and climate action, for example, community-based environmental/biodiversity conservation, waste management and circular economy, etc. 2) Communities need to build the next generation of CBT leaders. Apart from continuing the operations, the new generation often has digital skills e.g. social media that are crucial for advancing and scaling their CBT. Involvement and incentives for the new generation are key for successful engagement and transition. 3) Multisectoral support is critical for CBT development e.g. capacity building on entrepreneurship, digital literacy, sustainability, etc.  4) Planning and decision-making for CBT ecosystem development at the macro level should be a bottom-up and collaborative process between the government and local communities to avoid projects which do not fit local contexts or serve the real needs of stakeholders. For instance, many tourism applications were created but abandoned. 5) Funding mechanisms must be further developed e.g. shifting from an informal arrangement to a social enterprise, setting up CBT development funds, etc.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Since CBT is very much embedded in the locality, support from local authorities is crucial. Some aspects of CBT cannot be advanced with the effort of local communities alone e.g. transport infrastructure. Depending on the area, understanding and support from local authorities vary and affect CBT development.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

What do tourists and stakeholders think of CBT and their further development to be more sustainable and resilient

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These methods helped us and local stakeholders understand local capitals, discuss the changing trends, and explore potential sustainability initiatives relevant to their local contexts.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Local communities in Yala province in the south, and Sakon Nakhon province in the northeast in piloting sustainability solutions 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Yala Rajabhat University in exploring waste management solutions

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Local Alike (social enterprise) being key partner in organizing national workshops and conducting field visits together to pilot sustainability initiatives 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Designated Areas for Sustainable Tourism Administration (DASTA) in organizing national workshops 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

New local community engaged and better-established relationship with DASTA and Local Alike for further work on CBT in the next year

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

n/a
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Without a strong relationship between Local Alike and local communities, it would have been difficult to engage and generate insights as quickly as we did. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
