> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is aimed at culturing and growing Azolla pinnata on a large scale under controlled conditions. The Azolla pinnata is a water fern that can double in mass in a period of two to three days. The Azolla is produced using a highly integrated production process with many purge/recycling streams to ensure maximum resource utilisation. The Azolla pinnata is then harvested, processed and used as the main source of essential amino acids (proteins) in the manufacturing of livestock feed.
The end product is a high quality, affordable and environmentally friendly livestock feed.
The resultant feed has since shown good performance results when given to our chickens at the trial site.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income by tapping into the huge animal protein feed industry in Zambia. This will be done by producing and selling a high quality affordable, organic and environmentally benign livestock feed to the target niche market.
The identified target market is: 
(A) the small scale free range poultry farmers 
(B) school Production Unit (PU) - animal production.
(C) small scale broiler poultry farmers
The value addition of innovation on the environment is that the production process is highly integrated and this results into maximum utilisation of the limited resources in the production process. The production of Azolla pinnata does not cause any harm to the environment. Azolla can capture carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the air and has genes that provide insect resistance.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently, the innovation is an integration of three enterprises that are used to produce the Azolla based livestock feed. This is as can be seen in the submitted pictures.
The first enterprise is the indigenous local chicken production and the second enterprise is the culture and growing of Azolla pinnata. The third enterprise is crop production.
The integration is in such a way that the chicken enterprise provides the manure that is used to fertilise the pond water where the Azolla pinnata is grown. The excess water from the Azolla ponds is used to water crops some of which are used as ingredients in the feed production process. The waste from the crops are used as food for the chickens.
With our existing farm land, the proposed implementation plan is as follows: 
phase one - enlargement of production ponds and multiplication of the chicken population.
Phase two - acquisition of industrial processing equipment and construction of production infrastructure.
Phase three - production and marketing.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will add to the livestock feed options in the animal protein market. 
The innovation will provide sustainable employment and it will provide high quality affordable organic livestock feed.
The production of this alternative organic livestock feed will reduce the cost of production in terms of feed for our targated customers.
