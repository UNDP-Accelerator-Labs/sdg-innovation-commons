Our natural fertilisers will help refuse from all kinds of chemicals in cultivation of plants, because they are not only completely natural, but overpower chemical fertilisers in terms of efficiency. This innovative method, using the unique compost earthworms “Staratel”, indeed allows us to say that our vermicompost has the value of gold and is an irreplaceable organic fertiliser. Our production unit, situated in a quiet and green nook of Palestine, creates a miracle of nature, which already now is used by professional farmers and gardening enthusiasts in various countries across the world. Due to this we pay special attention to ensure that the range of our offer would include products for various climate zones and types of plants.
