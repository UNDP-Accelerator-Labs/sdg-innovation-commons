## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic where travel restrictions exist and, consequently, where it is difficult for Acc Lab members to travel to the different islands of Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles, it is still important to perform data collection on the ground from people working in MSMEs in order to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on their livelihoods. The learning intent of this activity is to evaluate whether the UNV modality is adequate for recruiting, on a short-term basis, young people who have the capacity to learn and perform data collection tasks in the community.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF a proper recruitment process is put in place (strict screening, task-based evaluation, etc.), proper training is given (bootcamp, data collection training, etc.) and proper tools are used (Tablets with Internet data plans, Kobo, shared database, etc.) THEN the young UNVs will be valuable data collectors for the Acc Lab in the various islands.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

After recruitment, the UNVs had to follow a one week bootcamp and, from then, weekly management, training, brainstorming and catching up sessions with the three Heads. Before the sessions, the Heads had devised the methodology for effective data collection across three islands (training, tools, etc.) The idea is to create an environment for the UNVs to work effectively and autonomously. This is specially true in the small island of Rodrigues where only one UNV was recruited for the experiment (as opposed to the larger islands of Mauritius and Seychelles which had more than one UNV on the ground).

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The unit of analysis if the number of grassroots innovators or MSMEs engaged with in Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles. The quality of the engagement is also important and this ensured by making the UNVs use a comprehensive Kobo questionnaire when collecting data from on the ground.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

As this is a pre-experimental design, the objective is to see if the interventions made (strict recruitment, strict training and strict usage of tools) will have an effect on making a small group of UNVs become valuable data collectors in remote islands. If the outcome is positive, then it is possible, at a later stage, to recruit more UNVs for this task.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

3 hours per week (in general) for the Heads
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The hypothesis was proven. The UNVs recruited for doing data collection in Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles performed well: Grassroots Innovators: a combined number of 43 met across the 3 islands Youth in Tourism Dialogue: 45 for Mauritius, 20 for Seychelles and 2 for Rodrigues Stockholm+50 Survey: 49 interviewed in Mauritius and Rodrigues  Other people interacted with: 300+ across the three islands

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

9 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

More than 20,000 USD (mostly for paying the UNVs and organizing various events e.g. Youth in Tourism Dialogues in Mauritius and Seychelles)

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Not for the time being

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We learned a number of things. First, UNVs can become good data collectors if properly coached. Secondly, people in the three islands (Mauritius, Rodrigues and Seychelles) have been impacted by COVID-19 but they are positive in the future and are looking forward to further develop their business and engage with new opportunities.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The fact that we were on three islands but, fortunately, we could rely on technology.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All units, including other Accelerator Labs, which need to conduct data collection exercises across multiple regions remotely and relatively cheaply.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Anyone who needs to conduct data collection exercises across multiple regions remotely and relatively cheaply.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

To be sure to recruit quality people

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. The use of UNVs gives a lot of flexibility.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The three Heads worked together on this Experiment from day 1. In particular, the TOR, the initial interviews and evaluations, the training, the construction of the Kobo questionnaire, the brainstorming and catch up session as well as the various events and outreaches were organized by all the Heads.

> What surprised you?

How quickly UNVs can be brought up to level if the selection process is thorough and interviews are task-based (and not only talking). In our case, we actually asked all applicants to record a short video of a grassroots innovator and his/her solution during the interview process.
