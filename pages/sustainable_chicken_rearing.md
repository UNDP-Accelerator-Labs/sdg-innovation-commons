> Brief description of the innovation

Continuous rearing of broilers and layer for supply to domestic and export demand

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Located in chililabombwe a boarder town to Congo DRC chickens are in high demand and the market is readily available am currently keeping 150 chickens but have capacity for upto 1000..
Value addition is possible by improving parkaging and delivery. Smoked chicken costs higher and as a result attract more returns.

> Technical Feasibility

Prototype chicken run has good ventilation and air flow allowing for lower motality rates and thus ensuring zero to less that 10% mortality allowing for between 80-90% profits.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Currently 80 % of the Zambian population is unemployed. Chicken rearing willl allow for local people to participate in preparation of birds for the market the remains of the chicken like intestines and heads will be necessary to feed the  families and the payment after dressing the chickens will ensure no family goes hungry
