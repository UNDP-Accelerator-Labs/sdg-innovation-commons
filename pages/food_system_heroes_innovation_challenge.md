## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We'd like to learn what actions local youth believe they can take in partnership with other local stakeholders to solve food systems challenges in their neighborhoods.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the local youths are trained with innovative methodologies from UNDP Accelerator Lab and Youth Co: Lab, such as sense-making, grassroots innovations mapping, system thinking, co-creation, and experimentation, they will be able to develop creative solution on food system.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely
- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The youth innovation challenge will engage local youth, urging them to develop new ideas for solutions that work for their communities and moving them away from the belief that addressing food systems concerns is out of their reach. It will bring a bottom-up approach and a new generation's perspective to the issue of food systems.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Local youth teams and their prototype

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Observation and interview

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?
