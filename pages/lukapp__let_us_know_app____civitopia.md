LUKapp is an artificial intelligence supported participation platform that aims to establish a solution-oriented bond between city residents and local governments. Transparent governance is possible only when there is the possibility of co-creation for and with all. Designed as an easy, fun and accessible platform, LUKapp provides the opportunity to convey their demands, share their ideas and offer solutions to every stakeholder who has something to say about the city, with the support it receives from new technologies in the construction of sustainable cities.
