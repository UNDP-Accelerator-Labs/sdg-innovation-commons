## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The use of drones for agricultural and forestry purposes proves to be a technological innovation very promising and fundamental with regard to increased productivity, optimization of human, material and financial resources, as well as the reduction of the risk of accidents involving work.  The use of drones increased the productivity.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The first group of 12 trainees concludes the following: considering that almost 100% of the trainees had never had contact (drone) or with similar content, which may be the same scenario with the second group of 12 trainees, an additional time of 15 to 20 hours of practical sessions was suggested, in order to consolidate the skills of acquired piloting and thereby foster dexterity and confidence.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The use of survey, the continuous feedback proved to be a proof important to measure, with a degree of real objectivity, the knowledge of trainees regarding legislation that governs the use of drones in national territory, introductory basic concepts, architecture, operation conservation procedures to be taken into account.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The use of these methods of innovation has made it possible to collect more data on the impact of drone use on agriculture and reforestation, as well as the data how the use of drones affected or the impact on the rural communities where seed releases are made.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

I worked with Association of Ceramic Women of Tras-os-Montes (Tarrafal); Association of Women of Serra Malagueta (Concelho de Santa Catarina); they produced the seed balls (made of clay and seeds) and also supported in soil preparation for seed release.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

PrimeBotics, Lda, a private company owned by a young innovator was responsible for the production of the drones used on the training and launch of the seeds.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Minister of Agriculture and Environment: Mobilization of trainees (technicians from the Ministry of Agriculture and environment) for training; mapping and seed-throwing sites.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Association of Ceramic of Tras-os-Montes, they brought their knowledge and ancestral technique for the creation of seed balls; and Prime Botics, Lda a private company they brought all the knowledge on drone production and use of drone.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Portfolio of Energy, Environment and Climate Change: Technical support.
