“I want you to know that as King my passion will always be to nurture our youth, day after day, year after
year – for it is their skills, their labour and commitment to the country that will build our future. There is no
other path – no other tool – for Bhutan’s future success”

- His Majesty the King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck

Imagine a Bhutan that ensures 100% employment for an entire generation of young people with future-
oriented skills that are transferable, relevant and meaningful. Imagine that these young people are matched
to diverse, equitable, and digitally empowered job pathways, enabling them to thrive and advancing a
high-income flourishing, sustainable economy for all people in Bhutan. What if we started with such a North
Star? This is the question that guides this report, which will help inform and contribute to Bhutan’s broader
future skilling strategy.

This report consists of two parts: Part A which focuses on Demand Creation and Part B which focuses on
Future Skilling. With an awareness that supply-side approaches on skilling must be matched to the demand,
the report begins by delving deeply into job and demand creation as a starting point for the conversation
on future skills. Given its size, Bhutan lacks economies of scale and the operational efficiencies to out-
compete neighbouring Asian countries in attracting global talent, investors, and companies that can
contribute to its innovation and future of work ecosystem. Therefore, Bhutan needs to be highly strategic
in leveraging its globally recognized brand and tourism industry as an entry point but build a nuanced,
private sector-led, and professional follow through to turn that initial connection into deep FDI and skilling
engagement.

Part A lays out both the local and global evidence that has led to these insights. It also offers various
strategies on how to generate jobs in the ICT sectors as well as across other industries, both for the short-
term as well as the long-term. Second part of the report delves into future skilling and the future of work.
Part B brings attention to the rising foundational skills of the digital economy as well as the future skilling
system-wide challenges that are specific to Bhutan. It then explores a variety of different approaches that
can match demand-to-supply and advance improvements in future skilling across the various systems,
stakeholders, and providers that are already in place. The report concludes by sharing research insights
on global innovation labs and offers a strategy for future skilling specific to the BITE Hub 1as an anchor for
TVET system reform.

Future Skilling and Demand Creation
1. bACKGrOuND

“We can design our own future within the realm of our own practicality and we can pursue that future by
means we have to determine for ourselves, picking and choosing the policies and resources we need
to create the society we want. Either we will surrender our future to technology or we will consciously
determine what technology we need for what purposes, and actively pursue it.”

- Professor Mark Mancall, former Director of the Royal Education Council

1.1 The Big Picture: Envisioning Bhutan’s North Star in the Future of Work

Bhutan’s strategy for future skilling should be rooted in the deep aspiration of His Majesty the King of
Bhutan for the youths of Bhutan towards building a resilient and dynamic economy. As technological
and global trends reshape societies for better and for worse, we have to start with the end in mind. These
forces are powerful and inevitable, so how might Bhutan envision its place among them without being lost
or subsumed?

For centuries, the North Star, the night sky’s brightest light, has been used for the purposes of navigation.
People have looked to its guiding luminosity in the sky to calibrate and ensure they are travelling in the right
direction. In the work of positioning Bhutan for the ever-changing future, clarifying this North Star is critical.
What might that North Star be? imagine a bhutan that provides 100% employment to an entire generation
of young people with future skills that are transferable, relevant and meaningful, with diverse, equitable,
digitally empowered job pathways to thrive - advancing a high-income flourishing, sustainable economy
for all people. It begs several questions: What values and principles should fundamentally guide a strategy
that could lead to such a future? What would need to be in place for Bhutan to not only improve incomes
but also increase personal agency and aspiration? How might Bhutan not only consider the number of jobs
and those employed at this critical moment but also forge a wellbeing economy that promotes collective
quality of life and the thriving of future generations?

In envisioning that North Star, this strategy is informed by global trends and guided by 8 key principles
drawn from the National Task Force, TVET Curriculum Framework, and other local stakeholders addressing
future of work and skilling in Bhutan. Given the tremendous challenges and opportunities ahead, “good
work” and future skilling should strive to be:

• Dynamic: innovating to meet this moment and an increasingly digital future

• Prosperous: improving collective wealth, well-being, and quality of life

•

Inclusive: ensuring equitable, safe, and diverse opportunities for all

• Sustainable: advancing a sustainable economy for future generations

• Rooted: maintaining mindfulness and authenticity to Bhutan’s culture and values

•

Interdependent: collaborating closely within Bhutan and with the world

• Growing: strengthening pathways to quality jobs and professional development

• Purposeful: fulfilling the potential, agency, and aspirations of the people

1.2 The Context: Youth Unemployment, COVID-19 and TVET System Reform

1.2 The Context: Youth Unemployment, COVID-19 and TVET System Reform

In 2019, Bhutan’s overall unemployment rate was 2.7% and the youth unemployment rate was 11.9%. Youth
unemployment has, however, predated and been exacerbated by the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. As
of July 2020, more than 13,000 people have lost jobs and nearly 30,000 Bhutanese are seeking jobs.
Bhutan’s GDP is expected to contract by 2.1% this year. This research reiterates the challenges outlined by
the Royal Government of Bhutan, which are summarised below:

reiterates the challenges outlined by the Royal Government of Bhutan, which are summarised
below:

• As a largely rural and agrarian economy, 54% percent of Bhutan’s employment is concentrated in
(largely informal) small-scale and subsistence agriculture, livestock, and forestry. As a result, the
ratio of informal employment to total employment is high.

labour markets and sees much higher unemployment rates in urban as compared to rural areas.
Unemployed youth are also concentrated in urban areas as opposed to rural areas. The growth in
the urban population is also exerting pressure on public services in urban areas, with potential for
increased vulnerability among urban populations.

● As an urbanizing economy, Bhutan struggles to integrate rural-to-urban migrants into
urban labour markets and sees much higher unemployment rates in urban as compared
to rural areas. Unemployed youth are also concentrated in urban areas as opposed to

• As a resource-rich country, Bhutan struggles to translate its capital-intensive resource wealth into

the creation of a sufficient number of jobs.

• Due to its small size and remote, landlocked location; diversification of the economy and the export
base are more difficult to achieve in Bhutan than in some other countries. The small size of the
population and market also means Bhutan is unable to benefit from economies of scale.

There is an immediate opportunity with remote learning and work, but digital transformation both now
and in the future can increase inequities across gender, rural-urban, income, and educational divides.
Addressing the urgent current unemployment challenge and future economic revitalization therefore
requires a principled-centered system change approach, meaning not only shifting policies, practices,
and resource flows but also relationships and mental models beneath the surface. This strategy attempts
to incorporate a system lens looking at Bhutan’s stakeholder ecosystem in the future of work and skilling.

Future Skilling and Demand Creation

Bhutan is a small country and there are already many existing programs and initiatives. It is believed that
the TVET Reform Office is well positioned to convene actors to transform the conversation on future
skilling.

1.3 Overview: Towards a Demand Creation and Future Skilling Strategy

Through remote interviews, data collection and literature, the views of a broad cross-section of relevant
stakeholders including the TVET Reform Initiative, Prime Minister’s Office, GNHC, MoLHR, MoE, MoIC,
MoEA, Thimphu TechPark, TCB, DHI InnoTech, Code for Bhutan, FDI investors, CSOs, private sector
stakeholders, UNDP, and more have been drawn upon. Through the GNHC-TVET Reform Office-UNDP
partnership specifically, valuable systems data and youth personas ethnography collected by the UNDP
Accelerator Lab team were also accessed to inform this strategy. The report structure focusing on demand
creation is intentional given the understanding that supply-side approaches on skilling do not work if they
are not first driven and matched by demand-side strategies; therefore, the report outlines demand creation
and then consider the future skilling initiatives based on the assessment of local, regional, and global
demand. The BITE Hub and international linkages will be key systems change fulcrums for innovative
future skilling and demand creation approaches in TVET reform.

In March 2021, the TVET Reform Office and UNDP Accelerator Lab hosted two co-design workshops
on future skilling and demand creation. In the demand creation workshop, the stakeholders participated
in a lively discussion on the opportunities, challenges, and possibilities for strategic tourism, FDI, youth
learnings and insights from these workshops have been integrated into the findings of this report

main Recommendation

Assessing global, digital and future trends while finding bhutan’s place among them

In the global BPO/ITO sector, Bhutan will not outcompete leading
countries like India and China on the basis of operational efficiency,
cost and economies of scale. Big Tech is also not a great fit for
Bhutan due to similar reasons.

Prioritize ICT-related job creation based on
the highest return-on-investment: scale up
what has already worked by recruiting small-
and medium-sized
foreign BPO/ITO/ISSP
companies such as those employing over
800 youth at the TechPark.

Leveraging brand bhutan and strategic tourism to promote bhutan’s iCT sector an attractive fDi destination and
recruit global talent to build capacity of a local innovation ecosystem

While the updated FDI policy improves ease-of-doing-business in
Bhutan, there still remains limited global awareness and targeted
marketing of Bhutan’s tech-specific FDI opportunities to ICT
industry associations, tech entrepreneur associations, and other
relevant global platforms.

Several of the FDI companies currently at Thimphu TechPark were
initially connected to Bhutan through the former Bhutan ICT and
Training Association (BICTTA).

A thriving “future of work” ecosystem requires long-term local
capacity, institutional knowledge, and Bhutanese-driven innovation
that intersects with other local sectors, industries, and stakeholders.

Transformation in the broader fDi and local innovation regime

Launch “Tech meets Happiness” investment
summit, learning trips, and global network to
accelerate FDI in the ICT sector.

Pilot a Bhutan Digital Nomads Fellowship
program to attract global remote-working
talent and foster local talent in future skilling.

Enable Bhutan’s ICT industry private sector
stakeholders (BCCI, DHI, Google Developers
Group, Global Shapers, etc.) to lead and
integrate across demand creation initiatives

According to the World Bank’s Solutions for Youth Employment (S4YE) initiative, almost two-
thirds of youth employment programs fail to have any impact on youth employment due to the
lack of demand-side integration with companies to ensure that enough good quality jobs are
available or being created in the first place. We use S4YE’s framework on “Drivers of Demand for
Digital Jobs” to examine many of the potential sources of jobs made possible by digital and
frontier technologies. These jobs can be in industries dependent or directly focused on ICT as well
as adjacent to and enhanced by ICT.

Since current employment in Bhutan is limited for drivers that are not within the Business Process
Outsourcing category, we are first zooming in on ICT-dependent and ICT-intensive jobs connected to global
and regional external demand beyond Bhutan through outsourcing. We examined the outsourcing trends
that are driving the digital economy of the future. Outsourcing may be thought of as contracting various
business functions of a company to a third party outside of the organization. Outsourcing may be grouped
into 2 main categories, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Information Technology Outsourcing
(ITO). BPO commonly includes customer service, accounting, payroll, human resource management, and
other business functions while ITO mainly encompasses services related to IT.

BPO and ITO have proven to be steady growth markets servicing 3 main regions: America, Europe and
APAC (Asia-Pacific). In 2019, the market size of BPO was 92.5 billion US$ with an 8% growth from 2018.
Information technology outsourcing constitutes 66.5 billion US$ while business process outsourcing
constitutes 26 billion US$. The revenue for global outsourcing industry is the highest in the US region,
followed by EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) and increasingly Asia Pacific at 17.5 billion US$ in 2019.

human capital and talent, financial capital, knowledge and ideas, and sustainable collaboration and
networks to the country. These strategic experiences for global talent stimulate the tourism sector, ICT
sector as well as other industries and job creation opportunities. Bhutan already possesses some existing
resources and infrastructure that can attract global talent and investors from abroad, especially in the ICT
industry, but the value of these resources are not yet well-known to those who might potentially want to
invest and start companies.

After attracting them to the country, the key is to bridge and channel this global talent and investors into
the narrow part of the funnel: the future skilling system anchored in the BITE Hub, Thimphu TechPark,
and the TVET and education systems including RUB. In doing so, Bhutan can build the capacity and
skills of Bhutanese learners who supply the local talent into these new jobs created by FDI as well as
launch homegrown Bhutanese companies that strengthen the country’s young but burgeoning innovation
ecosystem. These educational institutions are well-positioned to capitalize on the global networks and
professional talent that come through Bhutan to transfer knowledge, skills, and technology to the next
generation. However, these research, training and academic institutions should be capacitated to leverage
on potential of technology, knowledge and skills transfer into the jobs market

Beyond attracting global talent, investors, and companies, Bhutan also needs to consider how to retain
them. The questions that we must ask are (1) how can the country be strategic in maintaining engagement
with global talent that are entering Bhutan through tourism in order to add value to the different industries
in the country? (2) how might Bhutan retain global talent to invest in the country for the long-term?

Talent retention requires a multi-pronged approach. Because of Bhutan’s lack of economies of scale,
Bhutan must focus on building strong relationships with influential individuals who are invested in the
country beyond the economic incentives. The individual’s heart for Bhutan can then translate into an
institutional partnership because of his or her influence at the company or institution. In the long-term,
establishing institutional partnerships will lead to sustainable investment and in country job creation,
however, in the short term, it immediately poses some challenges due to which Bhutan could also focus
on building practical affiliation and linkages between/within local institutions. For example - Dedicated
financing and targeted linkage between public sector agencies and tech sectors, academic and private
sectors to generate innovations and skills.

Strategically, Bhutan should invest in creating a data and knowledge management system to track inflow
of talent that is coming into the country, their interest, and link key talent to potential opportunities and
collaborations that can be a value add to the country. building a data infrastructure to compile information
of the high-value global talent and investors along with a clear navigation system to share with those
who enter the country of how they can engage with the country can help bridge human resources to
contribute back to the country in the long-term. Increasing global demand through strategic tourism to
make Bhutan a leading FDI destination stimulates the economy and creates new job opportunities. Over
time, this will create a positive feedback loop to develop a quality supply of skilled, local talent who can fill
in these jobs and create their own homegrown Bhutanese companies to create even more jobs.

process outsourcing in the areas of back office operations, transaction processing, content
The second priority which is good on long-term fit and potential for demand creation but which Bhutan
development, design and animation, geographic information system services, and related
perhaps does not yet have the full capacity for is expanding the home-grown Bhutanese software
development and “future of tech” industry. This is the North Star for long-term, Bhutan-rooted equitable,
quality job opportunities that serve both local and regional demand while advancing a thriving innovation
ecosystem. We explore how to build this industry in the next section. Meanwhile, high-skill, high-
mobility turnkey intermediaries and Impact Sourcing Service Providers (ISSPs) such as Andela, DDD
and Samasource also offer a potential avenue for demand creation. If Bhutan is able to recruit some
of these intermediaries, they could provide the entire spectrum of services from recruitment to skilling
to employment with plenty of high-quality opportunities for career progression within technology. We
believe there is potential to establish strong partnerships with Impact Sourcing Service Providers (ISSPs)
in particular. ISSPs function as intermediaries providing turnkey BPO and ITO solutions to Big Tech through
the training and employment of talent in the developing world. Many of the Founders and CEOs of the

28

15

Future Skilling and Demand Creation

ISSPs are themselves former Silicon Valley executives and entrepreneurs who have now committed to
use their expertise and strong existing networks to build social enterprises that benefit the unemployed
in low-income countries. For instance, iMerit, an existing company at Thimphu TechPark employing 125
youth, is an Impact Sourcing Service Provider whose Founder Rahda Basu was the former head of Hewlett-
Packard’s Enterprise Solutions group. These ISSPs are therefore among the leading global future skilling
providers (and direct employers) with strong existing BPO/ITO networks delivering software development,
data, AI services to top tech companies in the US and other developed countries:

• andela: Andela builds remote engineering teams to serve startups and big tech companies that
have shortages in engineering talent in their own geographies. The company sources and provides
6-month training and on-going professional development, and potentially secures employment for
4 years as Andela software developers enroll in the Andela fellowship program. Andela has trained
and employed over 1400 young people in Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana with a 96% match rate to Big
Tech and leading tech companies around the world.

• Digital Divide Data (DDD): DDD is a social enterprise that trains and employs young professionals
to work on digital content and technology services. DDD serves as a reliable BPO option for large
tech companies and businesses around the world. The types of services include content and data
science solutions, AWS cloud solutions, machine learning solutions, and social research solutions.
DDD is the largest technology-related employer in Cambodia and Laos, and also runs training
programs in Kenya. DDD has trained over 3,000 marginalized young people in these countries, and
on average, DDD graduates earn USD $175,000 more than their peers throughout their lifetime.

• Samasource: Samasource is a leading training data provider to address the full training data
lifecycle for AI and machine learning models. They built a data training platform that employs those
in developing countries to reduce time to quality using automation, advanced analytics, and a
highly agile training data methodology. Samasource has trained and employed over 2,900 young
people in Costa Rica, Kenya, Uganda, India, Haiti, Pakistan, Ghana, and South Africa.

• Global Impact Sourcing Coalition: ISSPs are a growing section of the broader global BPO and ITO
industries. Bhutan should leverage its existing relationship with iMerit, which is a member of the
Global Impact Sourcing Coalition, to connect with additional potential ISSPs within this network and
market the TechPark as an attractive ISSP destination.

The third priority is remote work and low-mobility, low-skill BPO opportunities (such as call centers).
While remote work has the benefit of flexibility and low-skill BPO jobs may provide an initial entry into the
ICT sector, these opportunities tend to have high attrition rates due to high competition, intense workload,
lower pay, fewer career advancement pathways, and other reasons. Bhutan is not well-suited to compete
on a large scale through low-mobility, low-skill BPO opportunities due to its lack of economies of scale.
These opportunities often travel to the next cheapest country as demands change and may disappear as
frontier technologies such as AI displace these jobs. With remote work and online freelancing, we have
seen this as a solid option for those who have the capacity and willingness to engage on shorter-term
contracts with less stability. However, at scale and on the aggregate, remote work does not provide a large
quantity of jobs that provide pathways to higher-quality employment and income generation.

The lowest priority we have identified is global and regional Big Tech. As Bhutan learned the hard way,
these large tech companies are not well-suited to direct employment of Bhutanese youth in-country. This
is not to say there is no role for Big Tech to play in Bhutan’s development or that Bhutanese youth cannot
secure employment in those companies in the long-term. There are tangible pathways to Big Tech through
long-term government talent investment programs such as undergraduate and graduate education
scholarships that send Bhutanese to top global universities that Big Tech tends to recruit from. This is the
case because these global Big Tech companies value the brand equity and reliability of recruiting from
these top universities where they already have formal and informal talent pipelines. For the Bhutanese

16

who are provided government scholarships to study and work abroad, perhaps some of them in Big Tech,
they can bring their critical global perspectives, knowledge, and skills back home, incentivized through
additional government supports to enable them as tech entrepreneurs that can innovate and advance
Bhutan’s broader tech and entrepreneurial ecosystem.

a 1. 6 Looking Long-Term: a Thriving Homegrown Entrepreneurship Ecosystem

The biggest long-term opportunity for demand creation and future skills development is through homegrown
tech BPOs/ITOs and local ICT-sector companies that can eventually have regional or global reach. This
solution also aligns with the vision of a Bhutan-led future skilling system and “future of work” economy
that enables self-reliance, connecting increasing numbers of youth to quality jobs in the country then to
the regional and global arenas. This model has proven successful for entrepreneurs in Thimphu TechPark
who have already established their presences in Bhutan. The government needs to commit more efforts to
scaling this high-ROI effort: lowering the barriers for global entrepreneurs and investors to start companies
in Bhutan by reviewing economic, tax, foreign investment, and immigration policies; providing incentives
to boost local digital economy, build capacity of the talented local, and invest in skilling Bhutanese youth.
Over time, more and more new young entrepreneurs in Bhutan will be created - and new employment,
capacity, and networks increase as well, creating a spiraling positive feedback loop that enables more
self-reliance and global reach.

At first glance, Big Tech may seem attractive; however, if we compare the uncertainty of young Bhutanese
being employed by Big Tech and also the amount of investment needed to get a small number of Bhutanese
into companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon, we will find it is a major opportunity cost
for investment in and the development of Bhutan’s own homegrown BPO/ITO sector. In terms of return on
investment, Big Tech is among the lowest for Bhutan. After all, we have found through our research that Big
Tech companies mostly recruit from leading higher education institutions in the US. The chance of being
recruited into Big Tech increases with a higher education degree from top global universities like Stanford,
UC Berkeley, and MIT where Big Tech already has informal and formal talent pipelines. In an increasingly
digital world, the brand equity of these universities still hold large sway as reliability of the talent that
comes out of these universities are more worthwhile for these companies than recruiting and providing a
US H1B work visa to a foreign engineer which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Therefore, for
an individual to gain employment at a Big Tech company, in addition to the education institution enrolled,
getting a job referral and being able to network with alumni who work in the company is also very important.
Due to the competitive nature of Big Tech, the companies heavily rely on current employees to attract
additional talent to the companies.

similar to the top global universities pathway, Bhutanese who make it to Big Tech should be incentivized to

a 1. 7 Transformation in the Broader FDI and Local Innovation Regime

Since the adoption of the first FDI policy in 2002, FDI inflows to Bhutan have been quite limited beyond
the service and tourism sector, which make up nearly 65% of the investments. Bhutan continues to be
among the Asian countries that attract the lowest FDI. The United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD) reports that foreign investors appreciate the government’s “open, flexible and
forthcoming approach” and a “readiness to entertain innovative ideas that are in line with the country’s
development philosophy” but that “some processes are still perceived as overly complex, time consuming,
or unclear.” These information externalities are a market failure that inhibit investors’ ability to identify
and pursue opportunities in Bhutan. Both the promotion of Bhutan’s ICT sector globally through trade
association linkages and a FDI e-services platform such as a simple digital one-stop-shop for all tech-
related FDI investments can go a long way in recruiting and retaining foreign investors. While Bhutan
has already mapped out relevant regulations pertaining to FDI on I-Guides and other locations online,
a more specific ICT sector case for investment alongside the business registration process, immigration
application process, Thimphu TechPark set-up, job recruitment of local talent, and government incentives
should be accessible at one convenient digital focal point. A promising case study for Bhutan is Taiwan’s
International Entrepreneur Initiative. The initiative has set up a simple online interface to provide a clear
picture of value proposition for investors and enable them to access all the services they need to set up
their business in Taiwan immediately.

Meanwhile, coordination failures also remain a challenge. Some Thimphu Techpark resident
companies, for instance, still rely on the MoLHR for connecting to and hiring potential employees
19
rather than through an open database of all ICT-related job seekers – which would allow the
TechPark to better market Bhutan’s talent pool to attract foreign investors. While government
interventions and regulation do produce positive results under the necessary conditions and a

well-provided service, an over-reliance on government coordination also can constrain private

sector flexibility, adaptability, and innovation over time. We know that Bhutan’s ability to recover

and grow its economy post-pandemic is dependent upon its ability to develop its private sector

and existing entrepreneurs.

in Bhutan’s innovation ecosystem

Increasingly, younger entrepreneurs and global talent are riding the wave of the digital economy and
remote work, particularly during COVID-19. This pandemic has accelerated the decentralization of tech
based in larger markets like the Silicon Valley to new frontiers. As the pandemic comes to its end and the
world returns to some sense of a new normalcy, it is believed that global entrepreneurs, investors and
talent will have a hunger to travel and work in new places, both for personal reasons and with the growing
norm of remote work in the ICT sector. Eric Meunier, President of ZOOP and current Thimphu TechPark
investor, explains that “digital nomads would want to come to Bhutan - it’s an extraordinary opportunity for
your country.” In partnership with DHI’s InnoTech department, Thimphu TechPark, BITE Hub, and other ICT-
specific national actors in the country, there is tremendous opportunity to create a new program for digital
nomads and global talent as a recruitment and human capital development strategy for Bhutan’s nascent
innovation ecosystem.

Through its high-end global brand of Gross National Happiness, there is potential for the Royal Government
of Bhutan to inspire and attract global entrepreneurs, investors, practitioners, academics, and leaders
in their fields through a national fellowship initiative similar to New Zealand and Hawaii. To align with
Bhutan’s high-value, low-volume tourism philosophy, these can be small, high-impact cohorts of global
talent, entrepreneurs and leaders that are recruited through a competitive global application and selection
process based on targeted industries and needs in Bhutan, such as technology. Thimphu TechPark has the
potential to host the “Bhutan Digital Nomads” program that plugs into the ICT sector immediately to build
capacity of local talent, generate jobs through FDI and new ventures, and expand social capital through
global connections. Island Innovation, a social enterprise that drives sustainable change across islands

and rural areas around the world, recently hosted a webinar on Adapting Tourist Destinations For Remote
Workers & Digital Nomads In 2021 that has relevance for what a digital nomads program could look like for
Bhutan - with valuable case studies and governments sharing best practices.

To serve as a core fulcrum for digital nomads and global remote working talent to dedicate their time to
connecting their valuable networks and resources to Bhutan, mentoring the next generation of talent
coming through the system, and supporting home-grown Bhutanese tech companies and organizations,
a dedicated hub is critical. Ultimately, a Bhutan Digital Nomads program run through the Hub can help
build global bridges to access top talent and resources in major innovation hubs such as Silicon Valley and
elsewhere. We believe this can be done in a way that honors Bhutan’s self-reliance and inward identity while
fostering connectivity and outward openness required for innovation and new job creation particularly as
it relates to the future of work.

a 1. 11 Private Sector Leadership, Coordination and Integration

The Bhutan ICT and Training Association (BICTTA) was a member-led association “to represent the ICT &
Training industry of Bhutan at national, regional and international level for the development and promotion
of the industry” as well as act as a policy forum and bridge for the industry with the government. Moreover,
the association was a key platform for connecting the national ICT industry to regional and global
stakeholders including many that ended up investing and setting up their firms in Thimphu TechPark, but
unfortunately, the association is no longer active. BICTTA, for instance, was a core member of the Asian
Oceanian Computing Industry Organization (ASOCIO) helping to facilitate multilateral trade visits, key
networking opportunities, and promotion of the ICT industry to FDI investors and companies. We believe
there is an opportunity to reimagine and revitalize the association as a private sector-led, government-
enabled national platform for demand creation in the ICT field or to empower other existing private sector
actors (such as Thimphu TechPark, Google Developers Group Thimphu, private entrepreneurs, etc.) to fill
in the gaps of some of BICTTA’s previous roles. Bhutan needs now more than ever to create an innovative
leading voice or set of voices to represent and promote the private ICT sector outside of the country, tying
together various demand-side initiatives from Thimphu TechPark, GDG Thimphu, DHI, MoIC, MoLHR, MoE,
Association of Bhutanese Industries (ABI), Bhutan Association of Entrepreneurs (BAE), Bhutan Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (BCCI), AB Ventures, and others.

Private sector leadership can help with not only advancing Bhutan’s attractiveness as a FDI
24
destination of tech-specific investments but also help young start-ups in Bhutan connect with
outside talent and investors. Through a variety of formal and informal networking opportunities,
international conferences and events, speakers, incentives, grants, and more, the association can
function as a nerve center for ICT industry demand creation both domestically and through FDI.

We also see possibility of the association being closely connected to the former BITE Hub along

with Thimphu TechPark to promote an innovation ecosystem across Bhutan.

Empowering the private sector to serve as the lead for market coordination and expansion

addresses some of the constraints to private sector development in Bhutan, including an over-

reliance on government agencies like the MoLHR to facilitate job creation. Market coordination

through the association also helps with a more nimble government alignment to the sector’s

needs, assets, and future directions. Generally, stronger trade associations lower barriers for

companies seeking to expand to new markets, pursue new services, and facilitate more capital

reinvestment. While this type of sector-led, government-enabled association platform does not

require high financial costs or administrative efforts from the government, it will require

increased levels of trust between the stakeholders along with institutionalized transparency

standards to avoid industry exploitation or monopolization. Critical to success is the private

sector’s own capacity to self-initiate partnerships with regional and global actors in partnership

and open communication with government. As many FDI activities are already being organized

Estonia’s Digital Nomad visa

Estonian Digital Nomad Visa (DNV) covers a broader range of digital nomads — in addition to freelancers,
it also allows teleworking from Estonia if the person has a foreign employer or is a partner in a company
registered abroad. The intention behind the DNV is to attract talented people from around the world to
Estonia, who can work independent of location and timezone.

43

When applying for a DNV, one can apply for either an Estonian long-stay visa (D-visa) or a short-stay visa
(C-visa), depending on the planned period of stay. The DNV provides eligible digital nomads a temporary
basis to live and work remotely in Estonia for up to a year. No person is automatically eligible for a DNV and
their application and background will be checked as carefully as for any other visa applicants.

Anyone can apply for Estonia’s digital nomad visa if they meet the following requirements: (1) able to work
independent of location; (2) can perform your work duties remotely using telecommunications technology;
(3) either have an active employment contract with a company registered outside of Estonia, conduct
business through your own company registered abroad, or work as a freelancer for clients mostly outside
of Estonia; (4) provide evidence that your income met the minimum threshold during the six months
preceding the application. Currently, the monthly income threshold is €3504 (gross of tax).

freelancers, it also allows teleworking from Estonia if the person has a foreign employer or is a

partner in a company registered abroad. The intention behind the DNV is to attract talented

people from around the world to Estonia, who can work independent of location and timezone.

When applying for a DNV, one can apply for either an Estonian long-stay visa (D-visa) or a short-

stay visa (C-visa), depending on the planned period of stay. The DNV provides eligible digital

nomads a temporary basis to live and work remotely in Estonia for up to a year. No person is

automatically eligible for a DNV and their application and background will be checked as carefully

as for any other visa applicants.

Anyone can apply for Estonia’s digital nomad visa if they meet the following requirements: (1)

able to work independent of location; (2) can perform your work duties remotely using

telecommunications technology; (3) either have an active employment contract with a company

registered outside of Estonia, conduct business through your own company registered abroad,

or work as a freelancer for clients mostly outside of Estonia; (4) provide evidence that your

income met the minimum threshold during the six months preceding the application. Currently,
the monthly income threshold is €3504 (gross of tax).

As a beautiful Caribbean island, Bermuda boasts a reputation as an open and comfortable island
destination. Now more than ever, factors that drive visitors to choose a destination are also influencing
where business executives, entrepreneurs and students retreat to work remotely. Bermuda is seeking to
meet the demands of each of these audiences in a world that has rapidly changed in the face of Covid-19.

To address this growing need and desire, the Government of Bermuda introduced the Work from Bermuda
Certificate, allowing executives, entrepreneurs, and students to work and study remotely from the island
in a stunning and worry-free environment. The Government of Bermuda also gathered resources workers
may need connecting their tourism offerings to work requirements, such as electric car rentals in addition
to broadband and remote workspaces. The certificate program is a partnership between the Bermuda
Tourism Authority and Business Development Agency.

creating a separate pilot Digital Nomad Visa?

• What visa restrictions might need to be in place (i.e. restrictions of digital nomads to work for a
Bhutanese company/organization/employer, setting an income requirement and asking for proof
of income, etc.)?

• How might DoI set up Special digital nomad visa fee to experiment the nomad culture and ease
application process to create an exclusive program given that Bhutan already has a strong global
brand to attract global talent (i.e. Antigua and Barbuda’s Nomad Digital Residence charges $1500
upfront to apply for the program)?

Assessing demand-side trends and forecasting future skills relevant to bhutan

Almost two-thirds of youth skilling programs fail to have
any impact on youth employment due to the lack of
demand-side integration with companies to ensure that
enough good quality jobs are available or being created
in the first place. The future skills most relevant to Bhutan
are constantly changing, dependent on the needs of FDI
BPO and homegrown companies.

Survey Thimphu TechPark FDI/BPO/local companies
annually as well as empower the revitalized ICT
industry association to be an assessor and voice for
the private ICT sector’s future skilling trends.

Industry Board

Advancing future skilling systems change for a thriving innovation and “future of work” ecosystem

There are a plethora of existing and new future skilling
providers: Thimphu TechPark
resident companies,
TTIR, private TVET providers, TVET/BITE mainstreamed
into schools, MoE and ICT integration in schools, RUB
(Gyalpozhing College of IT and CST), MoLHR programs,
Code for Bhutan, FabLab, DITT under MoIC, DHI and
InnoTech, BETA Park, Loden, other CSOs, etc.

Several challenges prevent a full systems transformation
for future skilling, digital employment and innovation that
will drive the Bhutanese economy of the future:

•

Lack of clarity, coordination, and complementarity
among initiatives
Skills gap and mismatch with demand
information flow between

job seekers,

•
• Weak

employers, and government

• Need for quality, scalability and sustainability across

the system

• On-going issues with digital access, literacy, equity

and inclusion

Decide which agency would be the key player as a
potential convener, coordinator, funder, and enabler
of future skilling and innovation initiatives unlocking
value creation among decentralized actors, assets,
capabilities, and opportunities in the growing digital
and “future of work” economy.

•

Leverage the Hub to pilot new experiments for
the future skilling ecosystem

• Map and build

Given Bhutan’s necessary focus on these categories of ICT-sector and other employers, future skills
needed for Bhutan must then match the specific skills identified in the local market by actors who have
already committed to employ Bhutanese job seekers. To build mass or universal skilling programs for
unemployed young people around other future skills without consideration of that local demand in Bhutan,

invest in the broader, more globally-identified advanced future skills (i.e. blockchain, AI, machine learning)
for only a select group of local Bhutanese talent that may receive targeted upskilling courses or study

abroad at top global tech universities, returning to build capacity for the entire system. Therefore, future
skilling curriculum development, standards, and certification frameworks at large must be guided by real-
time forecasting to the existing ICT industry partners in Bhutan. To institutionalize better forecasting of
future skills to real and emerging demand on the ground in Bhutan, a few standard operating procedures
can be put in place:

1. MoLHR to survey Thimphu TechPark FDI/BPO/local companies annually and produce a clear data-
driven picture of skilling needs, released through an annual report with easy-to-read charts. In this
process, MoLHR can empower a revitalized ICT industry association to be an assessor and voice
for the private ICT sector’s future skilling trends as this association would also be leading new
demand creation efforts in recruiting FDI companies.

2. The Hub should also establish an ICT Academy - Industry Board to ensure that existing industry
partners and FDI companies have a channel to communicate their ever-changing needs in the
industry while informing the types of market-ready skilling courses that can plug into their work.
Likewise, these companies can hear the perspectives of the “ICT Academy” - the future skilling
providers and academic institutions on the frontlines of training. For a stronger global perspective,
the Hub can set up a Global Advisory Board with leading international institutions and partners
such as Singapore’s NYP and ITE, Australia’s TAFE, Coursera, Harvard Kennedy School’s Project on
Workforce, and more. This informal advising will ensure Bhutan is also paying attention to broader
trends beyond its borders.

3. Rather than prescribing specific list of future skills, specific courses, and curriculum frameworks
which will constantly be changing based on the drivers of demand and the actual ICT sector FDI
companies in Bhutan, institutional operating procedures has to be put in place to ensure that the
country can constantly adapt to a changing future. Upon identifying the key future skill buckets,
competencies, and categories, the hub should use the MoLHR’s “Guidelines for TVET Curriculum
Development” and other curriculum development tools to guide future skilling providers on
course selection and development, curriculum framework creation, and requisite standards and
certification.

Figure 32: Spectrum of Digital Skills

A smooth pipeline from basic to advanced future skills unfortunately does not exist currently in Bhutan.
This is emblematic of several other large challenges in creating a coherent, high-quality, and equitable
future skilling system for Bhutan:

55

•

Lack of clarity, coordination and complementarity among the numerous governments, CSO, and
private future skilling initiatives, especially in the absence of a proper future skilling strategy and
system. Several initiatives by individual actors cannot bear fruit collectively for a country as small
as Bhutan because each of them will become rapidly stymied by their inability to leverage Bhutan’s
limited resources and scale up what works. The need for quality, scalability, and sustainability among
future skilling programs are equally critical and connected to the lack of clarity and coordination
among the various providers. For the system to thrive as more than the sum of its parts, it must
promote exponential and collective quality improvement at scale. Meanwhile, issues with digital
access, literacy, equity and inclusion, particularly for marginalized and rural groups, continue to
present major barriers to true systems change that ensures all young people in Bhutan have
opportunities to thrive through future skills.

• Skills gap and mismatch, including limited feedback loops and pathways for skills transfer:
Although Bhutan has a robust education system pathway including for ICT, misalignment in skills
and the gap in market-ready, industry-relevant competencies remain, resulting in lost opportunity
for the hundreds of new ICT and university graduates added to the market every year. Meanwhile,
the lack of data on skills needs and job demand along with the inability to feed the limited data
back into skilling initiatives further exacerbates this issue. This is all on top of limited skill building
opportunities from on-the-job experience as well as coordination and learning between and across
firms.

38

Digital Jobs in bhutan

• Weak information flow between job seekers, employers, and government: the UNDP Accelerator
Lab has identified and articulated well several of the weaknesses in information flows across
the system: “individuals lack information about jobs and skills, employers lack information
about upcoming trends and their skills needs and opportunities, and sectors lack mechanisms
for coordination (e.g. between firms or with government and other partners). Information silos in
government departments lead to silos in policy implementation and regulations and mechanism for
oversight that are not fit for needs. The system needs stronger distributed capabilities for learning
and collective intelligence at all levels in order to have the capacity to continually adapt and renew
itself.”

Because there is not currently a formalized system for future skilling in Bhutan, the former BITE Council as
an autonomous government agency is well-positioned to be the central convener, systems coordinator,
funder and enabler of all future skilling and innovation initiatives. However, considering how the future
skilling efforts are not well coordinated, a dedicated agency to leverage on is critical for Bhutan to unlock
value creation among its decentralized actors (training providers, companies, job seekers, etc.), assets,
capabilities, and opportunities in the growing digital and “future of work” economy.

B 1.4 moving Towards Systems Change for Future Skilling

Given the challenges above, we believe the key to future skilling systems change is not one-off project
solutions but rather larger adaptive actions that facilitate better systems coordination, enablement, and
acceleration. In terms of former BITE’s role, we think this was possible with several high-level mindsets and
broader systems approaches. BITE could first begin by asking existing future skilling providers and actors:
What would help increase the impact, quality and scale of your work?

As discovered during the Future Skilling Co-Design Workshop with relevant stakeholders, many future
skilling providers face challenges in financing to sustain and scale their programs to reach more young
people. There are additional bottlenecks in terms of reducing regulation or facilitating visas for programs
like Code for Bhutan which recruit instructors from abroad. We see many different possibilities for where
BITE could “play” and “not play”:

• Recruit global talent, digital nomads, and investors that can support future skilling initiatives

• Bridge demand (employers) and supply ( job seekers) through future skills industry linkages

• Map and build inclusive skilling-job linked pathways to ensure equity for diverse youth population

groups such as rural youth, university graduates, TTI graduates, and more

• Align and provide incentives across future skilling providers, to enable high-impact independent

programs like Innovate Bhutan Center to thrive

•

Leverage the Hub to pilot new experiments that benefit the TVET system more broadly

• Track data including learner outputs (i.e. course completions) and outcomes (i.e. # of jobs)

• Know when to allow providers to take the lead and reduce bureaucracy and regulation, thereby

allowing them to innovate and drive effectiveness in their work

B 1.6 What is a Societal Platform?

A Societal Platform is an innovative concept inspired by leveraging open-source digital platforms as a
societal public good to address a system change challenge at scale, with speed and sustainability. Societal
Platforms seek to answer the question of “what works at scale” starting at a systems-level rather than a
one-off project with the mentality of “scale what works.” In principle, they function as both digital impact
amplification networks and innovation co-creation enabling environments that bring together various
stakeholders and actors to develop contextual solutions. Societal platforms strive to “distribute the ability
to solve” rather than distribute a predetermined solution that may or may not work in context, thereby
promoting individual agency at the local level to learn, adapt, and lead change. Its principles are as follows:

B 1.7 BITE Societal Platform for Future Skilling

For Bhutan to address its future skilling and employment systems challenges, a BITE-enabled Societal
Platform can be the fulcrum and lever that makes the difference, addressing many of the challenges we
listed above through one national digital coordination and collective learning mechanism. The platform
can serve as a resource aggregator and national digital infrastructure for all future skilling education, with
several key design principles: human-centered, personalized, contextualized, on-demand, data-driven,
open-source, secure, learning-functional, and systems-interconnected.

As the frontline of contact with students, learners, and jobseekers, future skilling providers should be
the initial connection point for usage of this digital societal platform. The hub should encourage its
adoption and usage as a blended learning tool across all future skilling provider communities, whether
at the Gyalpozhing College of IT or Code for Bhutan or MoLHR online freelancing course. Thereby all
the students and learners in these future skilling courses will be empowered and supported to utilize the
societal platform to blend with their in-person training and improve the quality of the program and their
learning. The cross-system incentives are as follows: the societal platform serves as a resource aggregator
and best-in-class blended learning platform for providers, a skills assessment tool for employers, and a
digital one-stop-shop for learners seeking to upskill, get certified, and gain employment.

Some of the key functions would include:

1) assess learner and trainer skills, competencies, aspirations, learning progress, and outcomes (i.e.
monitoring through data – where do students who go through this provider end up? Where are
they employed? etc.)

2) map skilling pathways and career pathways to create clarity, inspiration and alignment among

learners as well as providers and employers

3) Connect with an online learning community including coaches, mentors, peers, and employers
through your own personalized profile – linkages to additional Q&A forums, Zoom groups,
Facebook groups, Messenger/WhatsApp groups, etc.

4) Learn and upskill through curated, best-in-class future skills content, training, short courses, long
e-courses via a digital library of existing online content (MOOCs such as on SkillShare, Coursera,
etc.) and user-generated content (prepared by the future skilling providers, learners, etc.)

5) Certify with micro-credentials (stackable blockchain badges, etc.) and e-certifications through a
secure, portable, digital e-credentialing system (see attached Indian Ministry of Skill Development
and Entrepreneurship “Adopting e-Credentialing in the Skilling Ecosystem” brief which provides a
valuable conceptual and operational framework)

6) match learners to jobs through digital linkage and interface with the MoLHR’s job portal system
whereby learners’ skills assessments, micro-credentials, e-certifications, GitHub code, etc. are
available for employers to access

Some of the next steps with this platform include:

• Attract and gain support of future skilling providers by understanding their needs and challenges,

adapting the features of the platform to their usage.

• Partner with the leading providers and employers who are looking to hire young people. Understand

the skills that are in-demand and the specificity of the jobs.

• Build M&E and data system that corresponds to the needs of the training providers such as tracking

job outcomes after youth have gone through the different courses and training programs.

• Develop a prototype of the platform using Sunbird, which is free and open-source (used to build
DIKSHA) and integrate other critical third-party technology platforms and tools such as GitHub,
Coursera, and Moodle.
Implement and continuously get feedback to iterate and improve the platform.

(engineering, medicine, business, law, the humanities and sciences, earth sciences and education) to use
design thinking process in collaboratively tackling real-world local and global challenges. Each year, the
d.school offers around 35 of these quarter-long classes for academic credit, and about 40 shorter learning
experiences called Pop Up classes or Pop Out workshops with leaders, practitioners and experts across
various fields. One of the d.school’s most well-known courses is called Design for Extreme Affordability,
which teaches students human-centered design methods to design products and services that will change
the lives of the world’s poorest citizens. Students and alumni of the d.school have designed and launched
hundreds of new products, social ventures, and companies such as Embrace infant warmer, d.light solar
lanterns, and LinkedIn Pulse.

creativity and enterprise in general but with the specific function of reforming the image, curriculum and
the relevance of TVET in Bhutan. The BITE Hub will include state of the art civil infrastructure, building
design, equipment for the PEA Labs, and online and digital facilities. Within the BITE Hub, there are four
major components:

70

1) Plumbing, Electrical and Automobile (PEA) Labs

2) Teaching Factory Lab with Applied R&D

3) National Technical Teachers Training Institute (NTTTI)

4) Future Skilling (FS) Lab

At the BITE Hub, the Future Skilling Lab (FS Lab) will play a role in the broader future skilling strategy for
TVET Reform by bridging supply and demand through value-added programming and industry linkages.

Digital Jobs in bhutan

The FS Lab will support existing TVET students and instructors to advance skills development needed for
an increasingly digital economy. Because the key demand-side strategies in this report involve recruiting
global talent, digital nomads, and investors to support innovation, skilling, and job creation, the FS Lab
will heavily leverage these strategies and local partnerships with existing agencies, private sector actors,
and civil society (such as Thimphu TechPark, DHI InnoTech, Code for Bhutan, Global Shapers Hub, Google
Developers Group, RUB, FabLab Bhutan, etc.) to create stronger cross-sectoral linkages to support Bhutan’s
burgeoning innovation ecosystem.

Overview

The FS Lab will serve as a platform to connect TVET students and instructors to digital nomads, talent, and
entrepreneurs, both global and local – to support the endgame of both future skilling and employment.
The FS Lab aims to bridge the demand of digital jobs and supply of youth in the TVET system who have
aspirations to work in the digital economy or gain 21st century skills for whatever career they choose.
The FS Lab will be resourced with quality physical infrastructure, technology, and equipment as well as
programming that focuses on mentoring, rising digital skills, and youth market-ready soft skills, a key
gap identified during the Co-Design Workshops with stakeholders. The FS Lab, if established will aim to
serve as a welcoming space for global mentorship, relationship building, career discovery, and community
engagement. It will be a place where individuals can unlock their potential by experimenting, lifelong
learning, and diving into future skills development, project-based learning, and career building. One key
value-add is that given the FS Lab’s proximity to the BITE Hub’s National Technical Teachers Training
Institute, its programming to support digital and soft skills for the future through digital nomad and FDI
entrepreneur mentorship will have a spillover effect on the knowledge and skills proficiency of TTI
instructors and teachers, who can bring back some of their learnings to their TTIs across Bhutan.

proposed programming

Through cross-assessment of the key lessons and quality features from the global innovation labs, it was
found that Bhutan already offers many of the components that were identified in the global case studies
through existing organizations and providers:

• Loden Foundation – entrepreneurship programs, financing, and networks
• MoEA’s Startup Center – business incubation and co-working spaces
•

Innovate Bhutan (iBhutan) – design thinking and social entrepreneurship programs

•

iHub – entrepreneurship programs, business incubation and co-working space

• Thimphu TechPark – business incubation and co-working spaces
• FabLab Bhutan – physical and digital manufacturing laboratory
• Other government, private, and civil society lab spaces

As a result, the programming for the BITE Hub FS Lab should be in a niche area that benefits TVET and the
broader future skilling system more broadly without duplicating efforts. That said, within the FS Lab, we see
potential value-add for programming that is TVET student-targeted and TVET instructor-targeted. These
groups rarely get the extra upskilling and mentorship support for the digital economy as well as their own
dedicated tech and co-working spaces. The global digital nomads will also have the chance to use the FS
Lab as a co-working space and hub for their own activities, allowing them to use high-tech facilities and
giving TVET students/instructors opportunities to engage and learn from this global talent.

Rather than offering specific skills courses (which many existing government, private, and civil society
skilling providers already do), the FS Lab should focus on a supplemental mentorship and experiential
upskilling program where a digital nomad is paired with 5-10 TVET students and a TVET instructor to
form a team that works on a real-world project with a participating industry partner/company (i.e. a DHI

51

Future Skilling and Demand Creation
company, Thimphu TechPark FDI company, private sector company, start-up, etc.), organization (i.e. UNDP
Accelerator Lab, CSO, etc.), or government agency (i.e. TCB, etc.) that has a digital transformation need.
This will ideally be a requirement or expectation for digital nomads when they receive their special visa to
come to Bhutan, give TVET students an opportunity practice digital and professional soft skills, and offer
TVET instructors an opportunity to improve their own competencies to bring back to their TTIs.

The experiential future skilling and mentorship program will be the highest priority due to its
direct impact on youth upskilling and employment. The power of this approach for TVET students
is that the FS Lab program can be combined with any existing future skilling course whether it is
Code for Bhutan, MoLHR courses, DHI BizAp digital skill-up freelancing program, or all-online
courses, such that the TVET student is learning digital skills in a more formal course environment
paired with the additional support from this FS Lab mentorship and experiential upskilling
program with digital nomads. Digital nomads will play a central role with two main
responsibilities - mentors/coaches and project leads/team mentors for 5-10 TVET students
working on a real-life project. The program will focus on both hard skills and soft skills with
emphasis on communication, professionalism, and collaboration.

Through the FS Lab, TVET students and youth will gain globally value-added employable skills, work
on hands-on experiential projects with concrete deliveries to showcase potential future employers, gain
mentorship from digital nomads, and be part of a life-long community of inspiring learners and practitioners.
The BITE Lab will also be a community space for knowledge and collaboration of ideas related to future
skilling and opportunities in the digital economy that have high impact for young people. Additional
community events like speaker events with various local and FDI entrepreneurs will help create industry
linkages for students to explore and secure potential job opportunities.

2. CONCLusiON

“As a small country, unencumbered by the complexities faced by much larger countries, we can do things
faster and better than others. Our institutions can be smart, flexible, responsive, dynamic and efficient. It is
my aspiration that, when my son Jigme Namgyel, grows up and when his generation, which includes your
children, come of age, they will be able to actualize their full potential and contribute to nation building.”

- His Majesty the King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck

Many of the core ingredients for future skilling and demand creation already exist in Bhutan. Looking
forward, leveraging “Brand Bhutan”, FDI and strategic tourism can help Bhutan continue to attract global
talent and investors as a growing destination for technology and future of work industries; however,
retention of digital nomads and FDI entrepreneurs will require critical investments as well as professional
engagement and follow-through that moves beyond the narrative of GNH alone. Meanwhile, many existing
efforts, stakeholders, and initiatives lack the momentum and coordination they need to thrive together
in a broader future skilling ecosystem and digital economy, especially with the lack of private sector
leadership, integration, and enablement. To accelerate systems-wide transformation for the long-term,
continued cross-sectoral efforts and societal platforms in addition to government flagship programs like
Digital Drukyul will help break down siloes and facilitate collective impact.

The BITE Council and BITE Hub or equivalent agency or setup will also have an important role to play
in expanding an equitable youth future skilling and employment agenda particularly as it pertains to
reimagining the TVET system for the 21st century – promoting not only a new image and relevance but
also a new way of working that empowers young people based on their diverse aspirations and unlocks
their full potential as change agents for Bhutan’s economy. The BITE Hub Future Skilling Lab will help to
bridge the demand-side and supply-side through the targeted value-add programming and innovation
ecosystem community building. As key stakeholders take forward the findings from this report, it will be
critical to deepen linkages and advance implementation between the various aspects of future skilling,
demand creation, stakeholder alignment, private sector leadership, local and international collaborations,
and BITE Hub prototyping.

3.1 more Room to Grow in Brand Bhutan and Tourism + 1 Industries

Beyond direct employment in the ICT sector, we also see several domestic demand creation possibilities
intersecting with the “future of work” in high-potential adjacent Bhutanese industries such as production,
e-commerce, wellness, ESL, and more. Similar to technology, these opportunities must be built on Bhutan’s
strengths and competitive advantages - Brand Bhutan and strategic tourism. We see these high-potential
industries as a “+1” to the foundation of tourism which draws global interest and talent. These industries’

57

Future Skilling and Demand Creation
local job generation and future skilling broadly defined can serve more diverse segments of the youth
population, particularly rural youth and marginalized youth, as well.

• Creative Industries and production: culture, arts, crafts, textiles, music, film, and more: At a global
level, Bhutan is increasingly becoming known for its high-quality cultural, crafts, and textile products
through the work of pioneering artisans such as Chandrika Tamang of CDK, who are interested
in exporting their works regionally and globally. These producers can serve as a champion of
Bhutan’s strategic tourism approach and Brand Bhutan adopting the same “high-value, low-
volume” approach. They should therefore focus on creating high-value products to serve a growing
market of art and culture connoisseurs who appreciate these products as works of art and are not
necessarily as quantity- or price-sensitive. In addition to products, there are also new creative
industries that emerging in music and film that are allowing for platforms such as Beskop Bhutan
to export the pioneering work of young Bhutanese creatives like Dechen Roder who produced
Honeygiver Among Dogs, which won several international film festivals including the Taipei and
Berlin film festivals in 2017. These films are also painting a fuller, more nuanced narrative of Bhutan
only GNH, allowing the younger generation to define Bhutan on their own terms.

• Production: Agriculture: Given its image as a green, organic GNH country, Bhutan may also consider
exporting its high-quality agricultural products (i.e. organic red rice, chilies, and honey) through
limited but high-value channels using both e-commerce and global supply chains as a vehicle to
extend connections regionally and globally. Mountain Hazelnuts, for instance, is already Bhutan’s
largest FDI and private sector employer of 800 young people in the rural eastern regions and has
focused on this unique juncture serving major global hazelnut buyers. There is potential to tap
even more of this market for high-value organic agro-products at a regional level as well. Through
additional investments Bhutan is now making in agtech, integrated logistics and digital supply
chains management, this sector has the potential to grow even more jobs for youth.

• Retail channels and e-commerce: Bhutan should also consider partnerships between larger, quality
producers such as SABAH or Tarayana and global companies that have a strong offline retail
channel that share similar values with the country and can market boutique, high-quality Bhutanese
products to its high-end consumer base. Partnerships with global brands with market access,
such as Muji, a leading Japanese retail brand, could form unique collaborations such as a Muji
“Bhutan collection” with a dedicated shelf section of seasonal and limited, high-quality products.
Now, innovative e-commerce tech platforms like Inspired by Bhutan and Druksell are beginning to
further grow the global demand for Bhutanese products and therefore its connected supply chains
(and jobs along the supply chains) to boost Bhutan’s economy. Bhutan should consider exploring
partnerships with Asia’s leading e-commerce platforms like Alibaba in China and Lazada, which is
a subsidiary of Alibaba in Southeast Asia.

• Wellness experiences: Wellness is now a rapidly growing $4.2 trillion USD industry, with wellness
tourism making up a $639 billion chunk of that pie. The Asia-Pacific is the second-largest region
for wellness tourism, only behind Europe, with 258 million wellness-oriented trips in 2017 alone.
Bhutan has long understood this and has been growing its local wellness experiences within the
tourism sector: yoga, massage, meditation, traditional medicine, etc. Beyond the wellness product,
the people experience of wellness in country is also a crucial way to attract new FDI companies
and create jobs, as those personal experiences and connections to Bhutan as a memorable place
of personal well-being can become a more professional engagement from tech entrepreneurs who
work in high stressful environments and are craving well-being.

• Education and International Exchange: Education is one of the best human capital investments a
country can make. Early childhood care and education (ECCE) is an even better return on investment.

58

Digital Jobs in bhutan
We know from Nobel Laureate James Heckman’s economic research that every dollar spent on
early childhood education in the lives of young children under 6 years of age produces a much
higher economic return to society, as much as 13% annually, than any later efforts in primary and
secondary education, job training, or rehabilitation. Fortunately, the MoE and RGoB have already
committed to the ambitious goal of 100% ECCE center coverage by 2030. However, in order to
get there, Bhutan needs hundreds of new early childhood education teachers and facilitators. This
is a massive employment and future skilling opportunity to invest in Bhutan’s future workforce in
their early formative years. Beyond ECCE, we believe investment in education can be beneficial
not only for the learning of local Bhutanese but also for global students who want to connect
with the country through study abroad and exchange programs. Globally, Bhutan’s competitive
advantage of high English literacy and high-end brand has already helped to expand this industry
through special educational tourism offerings with leading companies like National Geographic.
This strategy can also create employment opportunities and overseas linkages with students and
with educational institutions abroad to build Bhutan’s local innovation ecosystem.

• English as a Second Language (ESL): Compared to neighboring countries, Bhutan’s competitive
advantage is its high English literacy. An emerging market trend worth exploring is ESL, which
continues to see promising growth in the Asia-Pacific region. As the world becomes more globally
connected and distributed in terms of talent, English becomes a fundamental skill necessary for
employment and improving economic mobility. There are already several companies in China
namely (VIPKid and 51Talk) and Japan (Rare Jobs) that leverage video conference technology to
connect language coaches in countries, such as the US and the Philippines, to teach English to
Chinese and Japanese citizens without needing to know the local language. There are also models
in Southeast Asia, such as Globish, which is an ESL startup serving the Thai market and Topica
Native, which is servicing the Vietnamese market. In terms of employment opportunities, particularly
for university graduates, Bhutanese ESL tutoring can serve as an attractive career option to cater
to the Asia-Pacific market. Possible models for Bhutan include establishing partnerships with
companies directly or possibly establishing a homegrown DHI company that focuses on offering
ESL services abroad.
