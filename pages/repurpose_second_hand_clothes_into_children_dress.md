This solution is developed by a woman namely Ana Paula Sarmento, 38 Years-old. She reused second hand clothes/opshop material and creates children/girls dresses. She is unemployed and decided to use her sewing skills to repurpose women's long dresses and recreate small dresses for girls. Currently she is based at Taibesi market in Dili and has been doing this for more than 3 years.
