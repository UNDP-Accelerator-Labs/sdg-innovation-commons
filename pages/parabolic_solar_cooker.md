Problem: Scarcity of energy resources, high prices of fuel, long hours of electricity power cuts (total can reach 20 hours) Solution:  The solutions holder deployed a solution that he saw on the news being done by a Yemeni woman. The solution is a  parabolic-shaped reflector that directs the sunlight to a small spot which generates heat for cooking, The heat can reach 350 degrees. The solution holder was inspired by a Yemeni woman who build the solar cook from local materials and used it for cooking and heating during winter
