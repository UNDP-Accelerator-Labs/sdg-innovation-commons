There is a great mobility between the city of Tetovo and the capital city Skopje. Main administrative institutions (namely ministries) are all located in the central area in Skopje; The distance between Skopje and Tetovo is 40 km, and many people choose to commute rather then settle in Skopje. The rents are much higher in Skopje, so as the living expenses.  This situation is also getting more complex during the school year, where there are many students in high schools, as well as in university that choose to commute. Student housing is very limited, and private accommodation is a burden to many families.  The public transportation offers a bus every hour, this is not enough for the need. All the seats in the bus are taken, and people are standing in the corridor of the bus while traveling between the cities.  As a result of these circumstances, informal vans and cars have filled the gap. The informal meeting spot is in the exit of the city, and as the vehicles fill up the seats, they head to Skopje.
