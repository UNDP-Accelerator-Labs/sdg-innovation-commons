## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Experimenting user centric service rating tool 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Is to  see the feasibility of establishing a service rating tool for service users to enable them to provide feedback on the quality of services 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

This initiative started in February 2021. A multi agency taskforce would be commenced to form a digital service evaluation tool/system. The system aims t provide a formal platform for citizens to give feedback and voice their dissatisfaction, based on which service providers will be able to assess the shortcomings and re-design their services accordingly. We are also planning to revisit the service delivery standard of a commonly availed service. This will create a space for us to collectively deep dive, with the service provider in question, into the challenges faced by receivers and providers at various stages of service delivery to co-create solutions to shorten the overall turnaround time.

The in-depth interviews carried out with service users and providers brought to light the essential role empathy plays in public service delivery. Empathy requires service providers to understand service users' needs, pains and frustrations. Being empathetic could also mean taking actions that service users may dislike, but with humility and compassion.  In order to demonstrate the value of delivering services with empathy, we are working with experts to co-design an empathy module for service providers. It will attempt to model specific skills, techniques and behaviours to be adopted and contextualized at the workplace. We are trying to integrate best practice from the hospitality industry where customer care is the central tenet. Active listening, effective communication, and mindfulness are some of the skills that we are exploring. In keeping with the spirit of experimentation, the empathy module will be tested, its impacts measured and learnings shared.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Application of design thinking principles in the design of the tool. While citizen engagement is generally considered important, we have not had the means to gather feedback from service receivers in a systematic manner. The rating tool is an experiment to test how well we are able to capture the citizens’ feedback, and how effective the tool is in closing the feedback loop and bridging the accountability gap. It offers a tool for service providers to truly understand the needs of the service users and stay relevant. It is essential that after the experiment, the rating tool will be institutionalized so that it can be effectively scaled up. This will not be easy and we may face criticism, but I think this is something that we must take forward. Currently, we do not give enough voice to service receivers in designing, providing and evaluating public services. From this standpoint, we feel this is a major initiative.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Will the constant engagement of the service users help develop an effective digital service rating tool? How will we enhance the adoption of the service rating tool?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The innovative approaches will help us understand the experiences and their journeys that can be incorporated in the design of the tool

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Since there is no data on the feedback culture of the service users, this data sources will help us understand why and how feedback on services are low. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Service providing agencies and service users as well as those who are regular feedback providers
