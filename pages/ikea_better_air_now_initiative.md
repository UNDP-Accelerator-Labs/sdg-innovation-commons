> Description of the solution

In India, the burning of rice straw, a rice harvest residue, is one of the major contributors to air pollution. The Better Air Now Initiative by IKEA aims to reduce air pollution in Northern India by turning rice straw into renewable materials and products like baskets, rugs, and bowls. This provides a viable alternative to open burning for farmers, and turns a waste product into a valuable resource, while simultaneously reducing air pollution. The long-term ambition for Better Air Now is to include other parts of India and to share the pilot model with other crop-burning regions.
