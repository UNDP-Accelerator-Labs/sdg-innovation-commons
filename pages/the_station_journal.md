> Brief description about the identified local solution:

The Station Foundation for Entrepreneurship launched its newsletter earlier this year for the first time. The Station’s objectives is to highlight the efforts taking place within Iraq’s ecosystem and how it is benefiting the community as a whole. There is much debate as to whether the work of hubs such as The Station is having an impact overall, and the The Station’s newsletter is one means of filling this vacuum. Additionally, the newsletter can play a role in creating awareness about entrepreneurship and its importance in shaping better communities, ecosystems and individuals.
