> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Exploring ways to enhance UNDP Bangladesh's AI savviness in our work
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that as AI continues to rapidly transform our present and future, UNDP Bangladesh must keep pace by collaborating with AI to enhance our day-to-day efficiency as well as impact of our programmes. This requires navigating several complexities unique to our context.




> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The conversation around generative AI gained significant momentum in late 2022 and throughout 2023, particularly with the release of advanced models like OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022. This marked a turning point as generative AI began to enter daily life, with widespread adoption and discussions about its implications across various sectors. 

At the Bangladesh Country Office, the conversation around AI began with the a2i project, which supported the government in developing a national AI strategy. However, it quickly became evident that a more comprehensive and pervasive discussion on AI was needed within the office, extending beyond the scope of a single project. Despite this recognition, challenges remain in keeping up with the rapid advancements in AI and contextualizing its application to our specific needs and realities.

First, there is significant apprehension about the use of AI within our teams. Many perceive it as overly technical, requiring advanced skills that seem out of reach for non-specialists. Many limit their usage to taking help in writing emails and reports faster with generative AI. Then there is the widespread concern around how  AI could replace our roles and our jobs. These perceptions can affect enthusiasm, learning and adoption. It is thus essential to address these concerns with awareness-raising, culture development and capacity-building initiatives around AI.

Second, while AI holds immense potential for improving efficiency and impact, we must ensure it aligns with our broader goals of ethical governance and inclusivity. This means not just deploying AI tools for operational efficiency but also engaging with the national governance discourse to address issues of accountability, fairness, and equity in their application. Ensuring AI supports our human-centric development agenda is a critical challenge.

Third, as UNDP Bangladesh aspires to be a leader in AI adoption, we need a clear, actionable strategy that aligns with our organizational priorities. This includes collaboration across governance, digital and innovation teams and ensuring that our approach to AI is human-centric, inclusive, and reflective of Bangladesh’s development needs.

Finally, our challenge is to position the office as a forerunner in AI adoption within UNDP while ensuring that we lead responsibly. This involves developing not only technical tools but also frameworks for ethical and effective governance of AI. By addressing these challenges, we aim to build a cohesive strategy that empowers UNDP Bangladesh to harness AI for sustainable development, setting an example for others to follow.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

A rapid needs assessment was conducted in the CO through in-depth interviews with cluster, program leads, operations, communication and gender team leads, and project managers. The discussions focused on their daily work to identify areas where AI could enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Key areas were mapped, and potential tools were identified to address operational inefficiencies, such as repetitive administrative tasks and siloed data systems, which present significant opportunities for boosting productivity and collaboration.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

The rapid readiness assessment of the CO identified gaps in access to advanced AI tools, with most staff lacking institutional access to licensed software or subscription to tools like Copilot or ChatGPT. This is a signal of how the AI adoption has been limited beyond certain teams.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The lab is well positioned in the CO to lead a collaborative effort bringing together resources from across different teams. In this case, the lab is bringing together colleagues from the governance cluster and from a project with a primary focus on supporting the government in digitalizing its services. What sets the Lab apart in this consortium is its ability to integrate a human and planet centric lens into this exploration of technology adoption, ensuring ethical, equitable, and inclusive approaches to AI. The lab's unique way of engaging, listening and facilitating collective intelligence sessions and being able to draw unique and nuanced insights, otherwise overlooked, is what makes the Lab a good partner in navigating the complexities of AI integration.

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The grow phase for this challenge can benefit multiple stakeholders and engage key champions to drive success and scale.

Key beneficiaries include UNDP Bangladesh staff and teams, who might gain improved workflows, automation, and decision-making capabilities, leading to greater efficiency and impact in their operations. The improved familiarity can also increase the mindful adoption of innovative and frontier tech tools in programming to enhance impact of programming. The work will also support strategizing on how to support the government in AI governance including feasibility, SESP and ESIA of AI integration.
