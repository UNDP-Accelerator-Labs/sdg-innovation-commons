> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

The purpose of this project is to meet people’s basic needs in slums by harnessing waste recycling and "home" use of renewable energies.  Sumando Energías is dedicated to installing what they call “social plug-ins”. They offer workshops so that by means of using aluminum cans, plastic bottles, PVC pipes, Styrofoam, and tetra paks, volunteers and people interested in different disciplines can learn how to use solar energy, heat water, and provide a hot shower to families in left-behind neighborhoods. This project involves a collaborative and participatory construction with the families.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Prototype system

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

So far, over one hundred solar water heaters and their corresponding showers have been installed. In each case, feedback from end users is welcome.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

80% of the year, the family has free hot water, and the equipment always works, with almost no chance of breakage or natural damage, so it is maintenance-free.
