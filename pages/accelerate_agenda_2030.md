## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

SDGs as business opportunities in North Macedonia
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to try and to present the SDGs as a business opportunity for the private sector in N. Macedonia. We will accomplish this by working with the startup community through implementing the Accelerate 2030 program, a program designed by UNDP Geneva and Impact Hub.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

We have sensed that not many companies understand the SDGs nor the Agenda 2030 as a business opportunity. According to a report by the Business & Sustainable Development Commission (January 2017), the SDGs could generate US$12 trillion in business savings and revenue across four sectors by 2030: energy, cities, food and agriculture, and health and well-being. The report also estimates the creation of 380 million new jobs linked to these four sectors in the next ten or fifteen years due to alignment of business strategy to the SDGs. However, the implementation of the SDG in N. Macedonia is promoted as something that the government needs to take care of and are by no means seen as something that the business sector, startups or SMEs can contribute to. During the Leaders Dialogue, within the framework of the High-Level Forum of the Sustainable Development Goals Summit, as part of the agenda of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, Prime Minister Zaev  Stated that the Government of North Macedonia for the period 2018-2020 identified five priority Sustainable Development Goals: SDG 1 – No poverty, SDG4 – Quality education, SDG8 – Decent work and economic growth, SDG 13 – Climate action and SDG16 – Peace and justice strong institutions, which are at the same time the priority activities and measures defined in the Government program.   As the former CEO of Unilever rightly pointed out this is a time, like no other in history, when business needs to show the courage to adopt strategies that create long-term value for their companies and for the societies they serve. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

There is no data on business sector that is working on the SDGs. Further quantitative data would enrich the knowledge of the ecosystem. At this stage, the environment is at early stage and does not have comprehensive analysis on this matter. More evidence and data are needed on programs for startups, innovators and companies that work on the SDGs implementation. There is no Impact Hub in Skopje nor social entrepreneurship hub, that promotes this kind of work.

The current Government believe that investing in innovation and start-up companies will keep the young people in the country and reduce economic migration. In order to demonstrate their clear policy and willingness to follow the ideas of the young people in developing their businesses, together with the support of World Bank the Government has increased by 7 times the portfolio of the Fund for Innovation and Technological Development with an amount of 39 million euros. Nevertheless, two years has passed, and the State Fund for Innovation has not included the SDGs in the criteria for investment nor has created a call for startups and innovators that work within the area of tackling SDGs implementation. The #AccLab is certain that this situation is not acceptable and must be addressed.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can we learn more about the untapped potential for the business sector connected to the implementation of the SDGs in our country?  Can we transform the way the business community sees the SDGs and change the narrative around the SDGs as a business opportunity in North Macedonia?  We would like to understand and investigate the untapped potential for the business sector for the implementation of the SDGs within the country.   We would like to test and experiment how we can make the SDGs important to the business community and what it takes to change the narrative around the SDGs as a business opportunity in North Macedonia.  What is needed to change the mindset in the business sector in Macedonia for them to acknowledge that they can both make profits while becoming more sustainable.  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The methods that we are using is going to combine the work of the business sector and the development work. This would enable us to understand the complexities of both approaches, but also learn from the effectiveness and sustainability of the business sector.  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We aim at gathering the data from the business sector and use this on programmatic activities. Usually, the data from the business sector is not readily available, but through this partnership we will reach out the available sources, and can transfer this knowledge to the development work. The ecosystem is very new, and we are generally working in a white space. This situation is both challenging but also gives us the opportunity to collect the first data on this area in North Macedonia.   
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We see two potential beneficiaries through the partnership Accelerate 2030.   First, we bring in the table the unusual partners to UNDP – thus small businesses, startups and innovators which can apply and showcase all the grassroot innovations and initiatives connected to the SDGs; The selected business ideas will continue to receive support, guidance and mentorship from UNDP and startup Accelerator professionals in the field.   Second, this opportunity will enable the advocacy and raise awareness through carefully executed social media campaign that SDGs are a business opportunity further addressing green recovery in the post-Covid societies. Green deal is further getting a strong momentum and through this we will explore and enhance the role of the private sector in advancing SDGs.
