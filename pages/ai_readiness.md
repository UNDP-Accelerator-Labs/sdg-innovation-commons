> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Understanding AI Readiness of Bhutan 
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



To gain a deeper understanding of the Artificial Intelligence Readiness Assessment (AIRA) and the current state of AI readiness in Bhutan.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way organizations operate, reshaping economies, and transforming job landscapes globally. Bhutan stands at a pivotal juncture, with the potential to harness AI to advance its progress towards both the national goals and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This aligns with the nation's overarching vision, particularly in critical sectors such as poverty alleviation, healthcare, education, and economic development. However, the journey towards effective AI integration is not without challenges.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Accelerator Lab is the CO digital advocate and is at the forefront in learning the technological advancements, acknowledges the potential of AI to redefine its operations and the impact it can have on its member states. 

Supporting this assessment is the Accelerator lab and the Chief Digital Office (CDO), which have jointly collaborated to launch the AI Readiness Assessment (AIRA). The AIRA, crafted by UNDP, is an evaluative tool designed to assess a country’s current AI capabilities and aims at informing Bhutan’s AI strategy. It examines three core pillars: government as a user of AI in public service delivery and operations, government as an enabler of a wider AI ecosystem, and the country-wide development of ethical AI principles and practices. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



AIRA, a comprehensive tool developed by the UNDP, evaluates Bhutan’s preparedness for integrating ethical AI.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How might we gain a deeper understanding of the Artificial Intelligence Readiness Assessment (AIRA) and the current state of AI readiness in Bhuta? How would AI advancement impact Bhutan's economic development?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Coordinate with relevant agencies and key informants to collect data on AI through survey. Sense trends and weak signals of the AI landscape in Bhutan  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Government as Enabler: need for targeted policy work and enabling conditions for AI adoption in society.  This vision is especially integral to the governance of the harmful use of technology. 


Government as a user: need for both technical skills for building and adopting AI tools and non-technical skills for supporting the use and integration of new technologies.


Ethical AI: Accountability, Transparency, Safety, and Inclusivity. Educating civil servants and the general population about ethical AI would be beneficial as the danger is real and many of the pitfalls that AI brings can be avoided. 




## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Government and policy makers: AI readiness assessment will provide a baseline data for any digital adoptions. This will enable the policy makers to be open to both opportunities and weakness from AI adoption in the society and economy.  


Youths/Academia: present avenues to build skills and capabilities in AI space. Awareness on the adversites
