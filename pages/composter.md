> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This company will generate income for me because I will sell this natural composte to farmers and other interested parties. This composte will help the farmers they will be able to healthy non chemically induced produce for the country. It will also help with the nourishment of the soil .The challenge prize will help my business grow alot because I have to buy the necessary equipment for this company.

> Technical Feasibility

The company has designed the plan  in such a way that we would have the headquarters , trucks and waste bins. At the headquarters would be where we process the food waste collected and package ready composte . And the waste bins would be stationed at restaurants , Bakeries etc inorder to collect their food waste . At the end of the day the trucks would go through and collect the food waste from our bins and take them to headquarters for processing. And of course this company would have investors involved like the ministry of agriculture. And this would also create job opportunities.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Because the composte wouldn't have chemicals in it as compared to the typical fertilizeres a healthy food produce would be grown therefore improving people's lifestyle. The composte company is relevant to our country as we eat alot of maize grown in farms and the composte can help the farmers suppress plant disease and pests. This would also help with the control of our landfill waste .
