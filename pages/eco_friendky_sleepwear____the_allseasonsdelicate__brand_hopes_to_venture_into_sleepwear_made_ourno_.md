> Title of the innovation

Eco friendky sleepwear.   The Allseasonsdelicate  brand hopes to venture into sleepwear made ournof african prints from diffrrent parts of africa.

> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation was birthed after much research in the sleepwear industry that mainly use modern 
  western,oriental prints but found very little african prints. I found that the african content  has diverse prints which would bring a new niche in the sleepwear market.
The other reason is the type of fabrics being used for sleepwear manufacturing.  These included silk, cotton and polyester. I would like to explore eco -friendly materials that support a drive to sustainable production which then saves our planet.

The value addition on the environment is assist reduced  enironmental degradation by use of eco froendly materials and sustainable methods in the manufacturing process..

> Technical Feasibility

The prototype is  on paper illustrated  by the africa fabric print map earlier attached.  Proposed implementation  would be to make a head  start on the business by sourcing from eco friendly manufacturers  of sleepwear in Europe and China.  The designs and prints will be shared with the selected  manudacturers to make stock available.  A website ,facebook and Instagram  platforms have already been established.
