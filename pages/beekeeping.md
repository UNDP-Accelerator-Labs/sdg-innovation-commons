> Title of the innovation

Beekeeping

> Brief description of the innovation

Beekeeping is one of the most lucrative businesses one can venture in, at the same time it is also one which few consider as a business, with less than 50% bee occupation rate in the hives many who have attempted to do beekeeping have lost hope, regardless of this, the demand for honey and other bee products has kept on increasing but the supply is still low, Zambia only supplies 2500 tonnes a year, we are trying to solve the problem of low honey supply and at the same time solve the bee occupation problem faced by other beekeepers.  
As Hivers beekeeping company, we will be Breeding/ Rearing our own queens this will help us sort out the bee occupation problem that beekeepers face, and we will raise our own colonies and control the number of colonies we want and set up beekeeping out grower schemes thus increasing our honey production and contributing on the honey supply.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Hivers beekeeping will breed/rear its own bee queens so as to increase the number of colonies without having any problems of less hive occupation thus increasing honey production which will help increase honey supply in the country.
Profits will be made through the sale of honey and other bee products such as beeswax.
We are targeting HEALTH CAUTIOUS INDIVIDUALS These are people who are looking for a sugar substitute the end product which is honey will be sold to them. The export market is a $3.215m industry, honey is used for cosmetics and human consumption, we intend to tap into both the local and international markets.
The Challenge prize will help us purchase, Beehives, queen breeding kit, incubator, honey processing equipment, sachet filling machine and protective clothing it will also help us with capacity building of the out-grower beekeepers.

We will work mainly with charcoal burners by adding them to our out-grower program and giving them not only beehives as others do but also bee colonies which we will be breeding so as to help them have another source of income as they do away with the cutting of trees for charcoal.

> Technical Feasibility

In order to produce more honey, we will set up our own beekeeping farm and also set up beekeeping out-grower schemes after breeding our own queens.

> Anticipated Social Impact

We are going to empower rural people with beehives and a colony of bees which they will have to take care of and sell to us thus them having money to help them improve their social life
