This egg/ smokie trolley is locally made out of strong metal and glass that can withstand harsh weather. It is designed to keep the food hot in a hygienic way. The lower compartment accommodates a cookstove which not only keeps the eggs and smokies hot but also makes them tastier. The three-wheels and a handle ensure ease of movement over various surfaces as vendors search of customers. This trolley acts as both a display with partition for eggs and sausages and smokies. It is also spacious enough to accommodate a lot of eggs and sausages.  Customers at bus stops, marketplaces and bars are the main consumers of the snacks. The business is favored  by most traders as it requires low capital to start. The biggest expense goes into buying a trolley. Those who cannot afford to buy the trolley have an option of renting one.
