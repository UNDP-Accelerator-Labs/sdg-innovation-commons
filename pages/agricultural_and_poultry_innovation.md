3. Effective marketing strategy
::For broilers, the birds which have the marketable weight should be sold, even though the chickens are of the same age when they feed they gain weight differently. Because of this reason you need to sort the birds to separate the weightier ones from the rest. When this is done , you can sell the weightier ones at higher prices and make more profit
:: For table Eggs, you have to survey the market, before investing in egg production.marketing arrangements can be made in, local departmental store, local hotels, restaurants, local bakeries, cafeterias, groceries, and also other regular users. This may ensure the regular orders of the eggs. Sell graded or classified eggs. Properly grading or classification may attract all types of consumers.

Name of poultry farm will be Gama Bird Farm and we will concentrate on sales of eggs and the table meat bird
We will be the supplier of birds and eggs to different quick service restaurants in Lusaka province and also Eastern province Zambia. Our vision is to be one of the main poultry farm product suppliers in zambia aiming to raise healthy birds and in turn, promote wellness passively.

Firstly, to increase the number of our clients by 20% in the first 2years of operation. Secondly, to evaluate and add new tactics, if need be, to our strategic marketing quarterly. Lastly, to keep and maintain hygienic farms for healthy eggs and birds which will, in turn, promote wellness of the consumers

Our birds will be priced at a rate where customers would be assured they will obtain quality at a price that is friendly for their pocket. When markup is placed on any of our products, customers will be willing to pay because of the affordable price and quality

The firm will be a commercial poultry farm, therefore it will require full time labour and aims for productivity on a scale for the sales of eggs and sales of broiler birds
