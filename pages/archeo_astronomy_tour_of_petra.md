## Solution holder: Ma’moun Al Nawafleh

Petra, seen from a different angle! You will undoubtedly enjoy a tour that you won’t forget thanks to your local guide - Ma'moun Al-Nawafleh - who was born and raised in Wadi Musa. He will contribute his enthusiasm for Petra, the same enthusiasm that was passed down from his father.

The trip begins at Petra Visitor Center, where you will meet Ma'moun and start your tour. Here, you will learn about the renowned Nabatean civilisation, archeoastronomy of Petra, and the old clocks that are carved into its ancient walls.

After enjoying a delicious traditional supper and watching the sunset from Al-Bayda area, you may begin your stargazing experience with a laser pointer and telescope to explore the night mesmerizing sky.
