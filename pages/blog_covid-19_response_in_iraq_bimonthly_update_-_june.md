COVID-19
Response in Iraq

Bimonthly Update #2: June-July 2020

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In line with UNDP’s Global Integrated Response1 and the WHO Iraq Strategic
Preparedness and Response Plan,2 UNDP Iraq launched the project “Support
for the COVID-19 Response in Iraq” in April 2020. To ensure agile, quality
implementation in a rapidly evolving operational context, UNDP leveraged ex-
isting mechanisms and in-house resources to support its COVID-19 response in
Iraq. The implementation of UNDP’s COVID-19 response makes use of the op-
erational platforms of the Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS), the Iraq Social
Cohesion Programme and the UNDP Iraq Accelerator Lab.

At the start of the reporting period, UNDP confirmed its support to strength-
en designated healthcare facilities in 12 governorates. As the number of active
COVID-19 cases continued to increase during the reporting period (see Figure 1),
and in consultation with WHO, the Ministry of Health and local authorities, UNDP
expanded its plan to support a total of 15 governorates, subject to available
funding (see Figure 2).

Significant implementation progress was made during the reporting period, and
US$24.5 million from donors and UNDP’s own resources had been secured for
project activities by the end of July, as consultations with partners continued.

agencies. By the end of the reporting period, the plat-
form had 146,915 visits, a 2.6 percent increase since
the previous period. Nearly 26 percent of users who
chose to provide their details were women. With ac-
cessible language and simple messages, the platform
helps increase public awareness about the pandemic
and measures for prevention.

During the reporting period, UNDP also supported Kar-
bala Governorate to track and trace COVID-19 cases
using a modern geographical information system
(GIS). The system provides decision-makers with sit-
uational analysis tools and an operational dashboard
that provides a complete analysis of new cases and
recoveries, helping them to make quick decisions and
respond appropriately.

Work to support the healthcare sector is ongoing, with
the rehabilitation of one COVID-19 isolation ward in Fal-
lujah (Anbar) completed, and work on eight facilities in
Baquba (Diyala), Basra, Dohuk, Karbala, Kirkuk, Mosul
(Ninewa), Tikrit (Salah al Din) and Ramadi (Anbar) on-
going. The procurement process was underway for the
remaining four locations: Amara (Missan), Hillah (Babil),
Najaf and Nasriya (Thi Qar) (see Figure 2). UNDP con-
tinues to procure essential personal protective equip-
ment (PPE) for all locations. Each facility will receive the
equipment needed for functional, 20-bed airborne in-
fection isolation rooms, with the exception of Ramadi
and Fallujah, which will each have 10-bed facilities.

To support families that have been disproportionate-
ly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, UNDP signed
agreements with four Community-Based Organisations
(CBOs). The CBOs will receive low-value grants to dis-
tribute life-support packages and hygiene products in
collaboration with 18 Local Peace Committees (LPCs) in
Anbar, Ninewa and Salah al Din. At the end of the re-
porting period, the LPCs and CBOs were drafting work-
plans and developing selection criteria to identify fam-

ilies most in need, while ensuring that women-headed
households and families with disabled family members
are not overlooked.

UNDP also leveraged its integrator role to support the
UN Resident Coordinator and bring together the UN
Development System (UNDS) for system-wide coordi-
nation meetings on the Post-COVID-19 Socioeconomic
Response Plan (SERP) for Iraq. Finally, in coordination
with the UN System in Iraq, UNDP launched several im-
pact assessments to examine the far-reaching impact
of the pandemic on Iraq’s vulnerable population. The
findings and policy implications of these assessments
will be published starting in August.

Despite progress, UNDP also recognised challenges
and risks, which have been reflected in an updated
Project Risk Analysis (see Annex 1).

UNDP Iraq COVID-19 Response Update (June-July 2020)

PROGRESS AGAINST OUTPUTS (June-July 2020)

Output 1
The healthcare system in Iraq is strengthened to prevent the spread of COVID-19

1.1. 2 online platforms for
raising awareness and
monitoring COVID-19 are
operational

1.2. At least 200,000 views
of the online platform

1.3. WHO, MOH and other
official/authorised
guidance and
information on COVID-19
provided

UNDP Iraq’s Accelerator Lab supported the development and launch of the “Corona in
Iraq” platform, which aims to: (i) Raise awareness on the symptoms and risks of, as well
as combat misinformation about, the COVID-19 virus; (ii) Offer a symptom tracker to
encourage users to seek appropriate medical advice; and (iii) Provide a geographical
overview of emerging COVID-19 hotspots. The platform is the product of a partnership
between UNDP, the Government of Iraq (GOI) Commission on Media and Communica-
tion, and UNICEF.

Since the launch of the platform in April 2020, there have been 146,915 views of the
online platform, with a 2.6% increase in June and July. Of the users who shared their
data, nearly 26 percent are women. Furthermore, to increase women’s engagement
through the platform, UNDP continues to work with UN Women and UNFPA to curate
content specifically targeting women, in addition to the material provided by the Minis-
try of Health and Environment, WHO and UNICEF.

10,387 users have made use of the platform’s “Symptom Tracker” since its launch.
Data indicates that the feature is especially popular among users in Iraq’s liberated
governorates: 22 percent of “Symptom Tracker” users in June were in Ninewa, the
second-highest portion of users, after Baghdad. Some 88 percent of users access the
platform on a mobile device, suggesting the platform’s success among Iraqis on the go.

During the reporting period, UNDP also supported the Karbala Governorate to track
and trace COVID-19 cases using a modern geographical information system (GIS). The
dashboard is available through a web platform and phone application, enabling easy
access for the Karbala Crisis Cell, researchers, academics and the general public.
UNDP is working on new features, such as connecting potential blood donors to rele-
vant information.

1.4. 3 medical labs supported
by UNDP with priority
medical equipment
to strengthen testing
capacities for COVID-19

Work continues to strengthen and prepare Iraq’s healthcare system to respond to the
COVID-19 pandemic. The procurement process is ongoing to support the provision of
laboratory equipment for the Central Laboratories in Anbar, Dohuk and Erbil, in coor-
dination with the Ministry of Health. This includes the provision of the critical RT-Pol-
ymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Biosafety Cabinet Class II, which enable these
laboratories to process COVID-19 tests, relieving the burden on Iraq’s Central Lab in
Baghdad and, overall, expediting testing times.

13 designated healthcare facilities were identified in the 12 targeted governorates of
Anbar, Basra, Diyala, Dohuk, Karbala, Kirkuk, Najaf, Ninewa, Salah al Din, Babil, Mis-
san and Thi Qar (as at the end of the reporting period). These facilities were identified
by UNDP in coordination with the Ministry of Health and local authorities. They will
receive support through the rehabilitation of facilities and the provision of medical
equipment and furniture to make available the necessary airborne infection isolation
rooms to strengthen the ability of Iraq’s healthcare system to safely treat severe cases
of COVID-19.

ing the completion of site assessments for the remaining facilities in Amara (Missan),
Hillah (Babil), Najaf and Nasriya (Thi Qar).

While harnessing UNDP’s established systems, and making use of local and regional
vendors when possible, the procurement of medical equipment and furniture contin-
ued during the reporting period.

Output 2
Integrated crisis management and response is strengthened to enable the Government of Iraq to maintain core functions
and manage its response

2.1. Coordination meetings

facilitated among the UN
Country Team (UNCT)
on the post-COVID-19
recovery response plan
provided with UNDP
technical support

2.2. UNCT Iraq’s multi-

sectoral, Post-COVID-19
Recovery Strategy
developed with UNDP
technical support

The UN Country Team (UNCT) in Iraq continues to follow the coordination structure
outlined in the UN Framework for the Immediate Socio-economic Response to COV-
ID-19 (April 2020),5 with the Resident Coordinator’s Office (RCO) leading the overall
coordination structure, OCHA coordinating the humanitarian response, WHO coordi-
nating the health response and UNDP coordinating the socioeconomic response and
recovery.

Following a review by the UNCT in early June of the draft Socioeconomic Response
Plan (SERP), the RCO mandated the Programme Management Team (PMT) to coordi-
nate the overall process, with UNDP technical support. During the reporting period, an
updated version of the SERP was nearing completion with the engagement of all UN
Agencies, Funds and Programmes. It is expected to be finalised in August 2020. UNDP
supported at least 13 SERP-related technical discussions involving Heads of UN Agen-
cies, the PMT and Priority Working Groups.

2.3. At least 25,000 people
reached through social
cohesion activities

2.4. Local Peace Committees,
Youth and Women’s
Groups, and Community
Based Organizations
supported to work
collaboratively to
respond to immediate
community needs arising
due to COVID-19

To support families that have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pan-
demic due to the lack of access to services and difficulties earning an income, UNDP
identified and signed Agreements with four Community-Based Organisations (CBOs)
to receive low-value grants to distribute life-support packages and hygiene products
in collaboration with 18 Local Peace Committees (LPCs) in Anbar, Ninewa and Salah al
Din. At the end of the reporting period, the LPCs and CBOs were drafting workplans
and developing selection criteria to identify families most in need, while ensuring that
women-headed households and families with disabled family members are not over-
looked.

In preparation for a nationwide campaign on social cohesion and overcoming the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, UNDP is currently evaluating proposals from media
production companies. Following the selection of a production company, graphics,
advertisements and short videos will be produced and disseminated throughout Iraq.
To complement the information shared by the campaign, continuous discussions will
be held with UNDP’s Accelerator Lab to ensure messaging is aligned and consistent.

Finally, to support local youth and women’s groups in Anbar, Diyala, Ninewa and Salah
al Din in combating stigma associated with COVID-19 in their communities, UNDP has
selected 15 initiatives proposed by youth groups and 10 initiatives proposed by wom-
en’s groups to receive small grants for implementation. Selected initiatives include the
sewing and distribution of masks, an awareness-raising campaign focused on hygiene
and health, and an art project to provide a space to express coexistence, peace and
love during difficult times. The implementation of these initiatives is expected to begin
during the next reporting period.

Output 3
The social and economic impacts of COVID-19 are assessed to enable the Government of Iraq to define short- and medi-
um-term recovery strategies

3.1. At least 6 socioeconomic

needs and impact
assessments completed

3.2. Impact assessment

3.3. Post-COVID-19 recovery

strategies identified to
be supported by UNDP
Iraq

During the reporting period, UNDP Iraq reconceptualized the overall structure and
presentation of the Socioeconomic Impact Assessments (SEIAs). Accordingly, the
SEIAs will focus on the following thematic issues, which were identified as priorities in
the Iraqi context, and findings will be released through a series of Policy Papers start-
ing in August 2020:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Impact on fragility in Iraq
Impact on the macro-economic and fiscal space
Impact on social protection
Impact on social cohesion
Impact on household vulnerability
Impact on environmental sustainability

By the end of the reporting period, UNDP had recruited its team of technical experts
to support the SEIAs, including a Senior Coordinator and experts on resilience, mac-
roeconomics, social protection and social cohesion. Work is underway to contract an
organisation to undertake an assessment of COVID-19’s impact on household vulnera-
bility, which includes field-based research covering each of Iraq’s governorates.

Additionally, in partnership with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and
UN Habitat, an assessment of COVID-19’s impact on stabilization in Iraq was published
during the reporting period.

LESSONS LEARNED

The Need for Agility

Above all, UNDP has recognised the need to remain
agile to respond to emerging needs and to ensure the
quality and timely completion of activities in the rapid-
ly evolving operational context. UNDP has done so by
using and adapting existing project management sys-
tems, operational processes and in-house human re-
sources, including the safe mobilisation of technical ca-
pacities in the field to support the COVID-19 response.

PROJECT DESIGN: Drawing from the FFS experience
in designing and implementing projects in the health
sector, including complex hospital rehabilitation pro-
jects, the COVID-19 project design benefited from FFS
technical medical teams, allowing for the rapid identifi-
cation and prioritisation of needs, in coordination with
the Ministry of Health and Environment and WHO, as
well as the swift development of technical specifica-
tions for the rehabilitation design scenarios.

UNDP recognises the need for gender dimensions in
its COVID-19 response, in order not only to address
women’s participation and roles in the project, but also
to recognise and accommodate the different needs
and challenges that women and girls face in the current
situation. As such, UNDP has leveraged the expertise
of the FFS Gender Specialist and two Gender Officers
in the development of a forthcoming update to UNDP’s
COVID-19 offer (see “Gender Mainstreaming”).

PROCUREMENT: The dedicated UNDP Iraq Service
Centre was harnessed to provide the necessary oper-
ational backstopping for quick, efficient and transpar-
ent procurement processes to facilitate delivery. Using
this dedicated procurement team has enabled a quick
response, as well as the ability to rapidly address pro-
curement-related challenges, as needed.

viding geographical scanning. However, the Accelera-
tor Lab observed a demand in the local community for
reliable, trustworthy information on COVID-19. There-
fore, a specific section that provides more in-depth de-
tail on COVID-19 was added to the platform. Addition-
ally, the Lab continues to monitor the challenges and
needs faced by local communities to adapt the plat-
form, as needed.

Gender Mainstreaming in UNDP's
COVID-19 Response

Gender-sensitive approaches are incorporated into a
range of activities, for example:

1. Socioeconomic needs and impact assessments
(SEIAs): The SEIAs will have a gender focus, under-
standing that women and girls have different expe-
riences and face specific challenges when it comes
to the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

2. UNCT Iraq Socioeconomic Response Plan (SERP):
The SERP has mainstreamed gender considera-
tions to reflect the different needs and challenges
faced by women and girls in the current context.

3. Women’s engagement in social cohesion activi-
ties: UNDP has received proposals for community
initiatives to build social cohesion amidst the COV-
ID-19 pandemic from women’s groups in Anbar, Di-
yala and Ninewa. UNDP has selected 10 initiatives
for implementation, which is set to begin during the
next reporting period. UNDP will ensure that wom-
en-headed households are fairly included in the se-
lection process for the distribution of life-support
packages and hygiene products amongst vulnera-
ble families.

Emerging Needs and Project Prioritisation

IMPLEMENTATION: Implementation continues to be
supported by FFS technical experts from the medical
and engineering teams in the five liberated governo-
rates. New engineering teams were recruited in Babil,
Basra, Dohuk, Karbala, Missan, Najaf, Ninewa (Mosul),
and Thi Qar to implement activities in these governo-
rates under the supervision of FFS central engineering
teams in Baghdad and Erbil. By the end of the reporting
period, 39 engineers were supporting the implemen-
tation of COVID-19 response in the 12 governorates.
While having a field presence to support the response
has been critical, UNDP has ensured that all field teams
are provided with the required PPE.

UNDP initially responded by prioritising 10 locations for
rehabilitation (across Anbar, Basra, Diyala, Duhok, Kar-
bala, Najaf, Ninewa, Salah al-Din, and Kirkuk), based on
needs identified by the Government of Iraq, in consul-
tation with WHO. Babil, Missan and Thi Qar were add-
ed following a request from the Government due to a
spike in cases. The needs in these locations still remain
relevant despite the increasing COVID-19 caseload in
other locations. UNDP is therefore moving forward with
the rehabilitation and equipment in these 13 locations
across 12 governorates. UNDP also proposes to sup-
port a further three governorates, subject to the availa-
bility of funding.

Continued cooperation with CBOs, LPCs, and youth
and women’s groups has been important for maintain-
ing community-level engagement. These organiza-
tions and mechanisms have played an important role
in reaching out to vulnerable people in their respective
communities and providing information and support
during the pandemic.

The “Corona in Iraq” platform was first targeted toward
information dissemination, awareness-raising and pro-

UNDP’s COVID-19 response continues to support pre-
paredness and longer-term sustainability. The assess-
ment and project development process is oriented
toward achieving a comprehensive approach to reha-
bilitation, as well as the provision of necessary medical
equipment and furniture, to ensure fully functional facil-
ities. These units will support COVID-19 response in the
targeted locations and can also be used in the longer
term as isolation wards or for specialized care, such as
respiratory or burn units.

UNDP Iraq COVID-19 Response Update (June-July 2020)

Priority 3 (subject to availability of funds)

1. Provision of PPE for all locations.

2. Rehabilitation and provision of medical equipment
to establish isolation rooms for other hot spots, as
requested by GOI and WHO, and as needs arise.

3. Provide medical consumables and complementary
infrastructure and equipment for governorates in
urgent need of additional support.

LOOKING AHEAD

Risks and Challenges

Despite progress, the implementation of UNDP Iraq’s
COVID-19 response is not without risks and challenges.
Particularly within the rapidly evolving operational con-
text, UNDP has been working to mitigate these risks, as
far as is possible. An updated risk analysis is provided
in Annex 1.

UNDP continues to engage in high-level and technical
coordination with WHO, as well as with the Ministry of
Health. Through these channels, UNDP is updated on
the emerging needs in other locations and is coordinat-
ing with WHO on the support being provided to emerg-
ing hotspots. UNDP’s COVID-19 package is adaptable
and flexible: If additional needs emerge in locations
that are not being met by other actors, and subject to
available funding, UNDP is ready to provide additional
support.

Based on requests from the GOI and in coordination
with WHO, UNDP’s priority ranking of interventions is
as follows:

Priority 1

1. The rehabilitation of facilities in the original priority
10 locations (9 governorates) identified by GOI and
WHO, including the provision of equipment (four
out of the six identified priority medical equipment
items) and medical furniture.

2. Medical testing equipment for central laboratories.

3. Provision of essential PPE for all 10 locations (9

governorates).

Priority 2 (subject to availability of funds)

1. Two types of remaining priority equipment for all

locations.

2. Rehabilitation and provision of medical equipment
(all six priority medical items) and medical furniture
for additional locations (e.g. Babil, Missan, Thi Qar).

If rehabilitation work is undertaken in health
facilities already treating COVID-19 patients,
staff and third-party contractors will be provid-
ed with full PPE.

UNDP Medical Officers working on the Project
will closely monitor the accurate and full use of
PPE by staff and third-party contractors.

Contractors that undertake rehabilitation work
will be required to ensure workers are provid-
ed with the required PPE. This requirement will
be specified in the contract signed with UNDP.

Contractors/suppliers will not

UNDP Iraq will secure the required approvals
from the Government of Iraq to ensure safe
passage for equipment and supplies to be
provided through the Project.

UNDP Iraq will secure confirmation from the
Government of Iraq of the continued priority
placement of medical staff to the facilities that
will be supported through the Project.

UNDP will also coordinate with WHO and the
Health Cluster with regard to the support it
will provide, in order to help leverage any
complementary support services provided by
non-state service providers.

The Project has also proposed to provide
PPE for health sector staff in order to help
safeguard them from exposure to the virus.

For UNDP Iraq’s “Corona in Iraq
platform”, there is a remaining
risk that other online platforms
will be launched which will
address the same topics and use
similar features, which might, in
turn, affect the number of visits
to the Platform.

Delays in the delivery of medical
equipment, furniture, materials
and supplies to Iraq could take
place due to limited availability of
cargo space.

Once medical equipment,
furniture and PPE arrive in
country, delays in delivering
goods to the designated
healthcare facilities and the end
user could be experienced due
to restrictions on movement
between the governorates put in
place by the GOI and KRG.

The increase in global demand
for Personal Protective
Equipment (PPE) for health
sector staff could result in limited
global supply and present
challenges in procuring the
required quantities.

The Accelerator Lab is working to scale-up the
platform, making the design more engaging in
order to attract and reach men, women, boys
and girls.

The Lab is also working to ensure relevant and
appealing content is shared by liaising with
different partners, such as WHO, UNICEF, UN
Women and UNFPA.

This is a global challenge over which UNDP
Iraq has little control. However, in order to
mitigate against this risk, UNDP will arrange, if/
when needed, for partial delivery of orders in
order to take advantage of all available cargo
space and accordingly secure delivery of
items in smaller batches.

UNDP will also identify local representatives of
major manufacturers in order to try to resource
the required medical equipment in a timely
manner.

UNDP may also, in keeping with its procure-
ment rules and regulations, explore options
for partial bidding on procurement advertise-
ments, to facilitate procurement and delivery
in smaller orders.

UNDP is proactively working to obtain all
needed facilitation and access letters from
Governorates and the KRG Joint Crisis Co-
ordination Centre (JCC) to allow movement be-
tween governorates by the suppliers to deliver
the medical equipment and furniture.

If UNDP faces challenges in procuring PPE,
particularly with the necessary specifications
(i.e. types of masks), due to limited global sup-
ply, UNDP will:

1.

In coordination and consultation with end
users, reduce the originally identified
quantities to be provided in the initial
package for each designated healthcare
facility. This will ensure that all healthcare
facilities receive some supply of PPE and
subsequent follow-up deliveries can be
made once additional supply is secured.

2. Explore all available procurement options,
seeking to procure PPE not only locally
and regionally, but also through UNDP’s
Global Procurement Unit.

care for COVID-19 patients.
Some of the medical equipment
(e.g. ECMO) requires a high-
degree of technical expertise
and incurs some significant
expense to operate and
maintain.

Due to its complex nature,
there is a risk that targeted
governorates may have limited
technical capacity to utilise the
ECMO and also limited financial
capacity for the procurement
of patient starter kits that are
required to operationalize the
system.

In order to mitigate these risks, UNDP has
confirmed with the Public Health Directorate
that each governorate has adequate capac-
ity (i.e. technical human resource capacity,
and financial capacity to maintain the supply
of the Patient Starter Kits needed to use the
machine) to run two ECMO machines. Accord-
ingly, UNDP has decreased the number of
ECMO systems that will be provided to each
governorate from the originally proposed five
to two machines.

In order to ensure each governorate has the
needed technical capacity, UNDP requires that
the supplier provide orientation to each facility
receiving the ECMO. Moreover, the Ministry of
Health’s ICU Committee has agreed to provide
a detailed training on the operation and main-
tenance of the ECMO for medical staff who will
be responsible for operating them, once the
equipment is delivered and installed.

UNDP will continue to maintain a zero-toler-
ance policy for SEA and will continue to further
strengthen its accountability mechanisms to
mitigate SEA-related issues within the office
and project teams through enhanced sensiti-
sation and awareness-raising about SEA and
mechanisms in place to report cases.

Staff and partners will also be sensitised on
SEA and trained on how to prevent SEA.

Corresponding to the need to support three additional governorates through a second phase of support, the Project
budget was updated during the reporting period. UNDP Iraq mobilised US$24.5 million for its COVID-19 response
by the end of the reporting period.7 Funds have continued to be received both as new contributions and through the
donor-approved re-purposing of funds previously provided to the Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS). Funding
was also provided by UNDP’s Rapid Response Facility (RRF) and UNDP Iraq.
