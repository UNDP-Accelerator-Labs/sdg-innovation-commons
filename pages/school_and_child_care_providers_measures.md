> Description of the solution

Schools and Childcare Providers can ensure that children in nurseries, kindergarten and daycare centres are safe during every hot weather. This involves ensuring premises have adequate cooling measures in place, avoiding strenous activities during the hottest part of the day, and educating children on actions to reduce heat risks, which they can then share at home.
