It is the mixture between the liquid excreta of the digestive tract of the worm used for composting, the moisture of the composting system and the liquids produced in the aerobic decomposition within it. It is a thick brown/orange liquid, which should not generate any aroma.
This liquid is full of microorganisms, which are essential for soil regeneration and increased fertility in plants. The concentration of nutrients in the liquid depends on the materials used in the composting process, as well as the amount used when making the irrigations. 


It is used to remedy worn soil, to fertilize already established plants, protect roots, trunks and leaves from diseases and increase the number of microorganisms in the soil.
