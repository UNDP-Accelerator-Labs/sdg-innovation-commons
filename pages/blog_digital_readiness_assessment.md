Digital Readiness Assessment
JANUARY 25, 2024
The UNDP Digital Readiness Assessment is a survey-based tool to provide rapid, high-level insights into a country’s digital strengths and opportunities. It is intended to serve as an “entry point” for increased engagement between governments, UNDP Country Offices, a broad range of UNDP experts, and other international development partners.
The assessment has been designed to be used in conjunction with other tools and existing research. It is founded on several key principles: easy to complete, drawing on a mixed-method approach; providing real-time insights related to the 2030 Agenda, recognizing that technology is a foundation and an enabler; providing iterative, tailored, and actionable results; and founded on inclusivity.
The Digital Readiness Assessment also aims to improve coordination and clarity to drive a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to digital transformation. This is crucial in achieving digital inclusion, ensuring that no one is left behind from the potential of digital, and enabling countries to leverage digital to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
The survey is split into seven sections: perspectives on the digital foundational catalysts, infrastructure, government, regulation, business, people, and socio-demographic questions. The survey is targeted at stakeholders in government (both national and local government), the private sector (including business associations), civil society organizations, and private citizens. Several questions are only asked of those from particular sectors.
