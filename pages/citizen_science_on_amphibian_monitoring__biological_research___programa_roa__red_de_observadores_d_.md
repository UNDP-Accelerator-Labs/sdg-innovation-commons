## Overall goal

Build open and participatory knowledge about amphibians and their environments in different sites in Argentina, based on a Network of Amphibian Observers (ROA, by its Spanish acronym), in order to promote their conservation. 
## Description of citizen participation

Citizens sign up to participate in the Network's activities and receive theoretical and practical training through educational material to go on a field trip and record the local amphibian fauna (alive/dead). People upload their observations (photographic/audio recordings) to the iNaturalist platform (ArgentiNat), under licenses that allow their free use. Then, they are invited to upload their records during other self-organized outings, either individually or collectively in local observation groups (subprojects). The aim is to help people receive training and strengthen connections between the local community and the entities that manage these spaces (nature reserves, parks, etc.).
