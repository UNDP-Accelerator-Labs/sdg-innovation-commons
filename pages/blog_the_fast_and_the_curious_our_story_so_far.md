The
Buzz

“ We have the energy
and spirit of a
startup in the UN
space.”

Swetha Kolluri
Head of Experimentation,
UNDP India Accelerator Lab

“ Bringing dynamic innovation into big public
bureaucracies is never easy, and there’ll always be
plenty of resisters and cynics. It also looked risky
setting up so many Labs at once without a strong
supporting infrastructure. But without accelerated
innovation there’s little chance of achieving the
SDGs. The Accelerator Labs have made a good
start, with a fantastic infusion of smart, committed
people and a healthy focus on practical action.”

Geoff Mulgan Former CEO Nesta and now Professor at UCL

“ Our ambition and our
action needs to match the
scale of the issues that
we face. That’s why we’re
launching 60 Labs at
once.”

Achim Steiner
UNDP Administrator

“ Developing a portfolio of experiments around plastic
pollution in Pakistan will help us act on many leveraging
points including social, policy driven, technology-based
solutions. We are keen to explore opportunities with
UNDP’s Pakistan Accelerator Lab.”

“ I was born and raised in France from Malian
parents. My wish was to live one day in Mali, to
contribute to its development. I knew that the job
was for me when two friends of mine shared the

And I have to admit, I recognized myself in it too.”

Our Story
So Far

UNDP set out in 2019 to build the world’s largest
and fastest learning network on wicked sustainable
development challenges. In less than a year, we did
just that. Today, 60 Lab teams covering 78 countries
are now up and running within the United Nations,
creating actionable intelligence and testing solutions
with national partners.

UNDP is doing development differently because the
speed, dynamics, and complexity of today’s challenges
are fundamentally different from even twenty years
ago. We are creating a new capability for decision-
makers to explore, experiment, and grow portfolios
of mutually reinforcing solutions to tackle today’s
challenges.

The Accelerator Lab network is part of UNDP’s broader
efforts to expand the way the organization invests,

We Accelerate
Learning

We set out to test the hypothesis that a network

of Labs can accelerate learning on what works

and what doesn’t when it comes to sustainable

development. Our network builds on what we have

learned from public sector innovation labs around

the world – that operating in silos undermines

the great work they do.

The UNDP Accelerator Labs are sharing actionable

learning on a daily basis. As part of a globally

integrated network, each Lab draws inspiration

from solutions – both those generated locally

and those identified by the network. They benefit

from each other in real-time, creating powerful

collective learning effects.

Messaging channels have emerged organically

among the UNDP Accelerator Labs’ team of

explorers, experimenters and solution mappers

across Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East

and Eastern Europe. We see the synapses of the

network firing on multiple instant channels.

This creates the opportunity to surface ideas that

are on the horizon but not yet part of mainstream

development and allows for new approaches

to unfold across many different contexts in a

low-risk way.

The Accelerator Labs are generating surprising

learnings. For instance, people on the margins

We multiply returns on investment

The Lab network is part of UNDP’s drive to make

innovation a core way of working. The network

builds on wider efforts including the Innovation

Facility, serving as a vehicle for seed funding for

innovations in UNDP since 2014. We have seen the

return on investment in our Innovation Facility.

For every dollar invested, UNDP’s innovation

facility yields two dollars in return. We are thankful

to investors who have enabled UNDP to accelerate

the innovations around us, especially the inventions

and coping mechanisms of people living in poverty

or facing the effects of climate change.

How does one inject social innovation into a

$5 billion public sector organization spanning

over 170 countries? Finding people with the

right skill set is the first step. As we planned

and implemented a new type of search process,

looking for brilliant leaders to join 60 country

offices, this is what we found.

Unconventional job titles

deliberate deviations from the analysts and

specialists for which UNDP usually recruits. Out

of the box titles seem to have worked: the type

of people who ultimately joined the network are

curious, spunky and ready to operate and create

without edicts or instructions.

A social media campaign to
recruit unusual candidates

We tapped into our global network of UNDP offices –

and beyond – circulating bold and playful

advertisements on Facebook and LinkedIn. We

held open, interactive “Ask Me Anything” sessions

that were then posted on YouTube, reaching over

4,500 potential candidates. The website set up for

the UNDP Accelerator Lab recruitment received

almost 1 million visits during the two highest

months of activity during this enrollment phase.

When we finally met in person, many new Lab

teams had seen the video sessions and confirmed

that this outreach and responsiveness piqued

their interest.

Ultimately, the experiment paid off – we reviewed

8,000 applications for 180 posts in 60 developing

countries, an application rate 8.5 times higher

than similar level UNDP posts.

practices of international development and an

accelerated pace of change. To do this, the Labs are

creating new service lines in development that are

open-ended and safe to fail. The Lab network does

requires real time and participatory ways of

Becoming smarter together

Collective intelligence is the idea that a group

of people is smarter together than any one

individual person in that group. This is not a new

idea. It builds on participatory planning, pooling

knowledge and team creation processes dating

back to the 20th century or earlier. What has

changed is the advent of technology and mobile

connectivity. This means that pooling knowledge

has taken on a whole new meaning as more new

data is generated that can help us unlock fresh

insights in our world. The power of technology

means that machines can now perform some

It is not common for group discussions to

inclusive collective intelligence that the UNDP

Accelerator Lab network is tapping into to get a

more real time understanding of sustainable

development problems. Working with Nesta’s

Center for Collective Intelligence Design, we are

seeing Labs across the globe convening groups

and individuals with different perspectives and

ways of understanding, interpreting and problem

solving. For example, UNDP Uganda’s Accelerator

Lab began addressing deforestation issues by

convening representatives from government and

private companies managing natural resources.

To understand the problem from multiple

viewpoints, their analyses included the views of

illegal loggers, firewood sellers, school officials,

religious leaders and security agencies.

Republic of Congo

In the Republic of Congo, the UNDP Accelerator

Lab hit the road and embarked on a “Caravane de

l’Innovation,” where they met with community

members, entrepreneurs, and local organizations.

The caravan spent more than three weeks

covering 70 percent of the country. In Pointe Noir,

for example, the team talked to an entrepreneur

who found a solution for the ongoing electricity

challenges found in off-the-grid rural parts of

the country. Frustrated by the lack of light, he

created a portable electric light solution using the

chlorophyll and CO2 produced by plant leaves.

In Dollisie, a local farmer created an innovative

mobile peanut huller that cuts down on processing

time for farmers. This machine boosts farmers’

yields and incomes by enabling greater production

of the crop to take to market. Once these solutions

are mapped, the next steps will be to test them out

for broader application.

Experimentation allows UNDP Ghana to learn what works and what doesn’t to accelerate existing circular
economy activities.

The Future

As we look at the speed of change around us, and

the way many stubborn social and environmental

problems morph into new (and usually more

entangled) challenges, we’re driven by the question –

are there best practices for the challenges that

we are now facing? The COVID-19 crisis feels like a

time machine to the unknown. We’re dealing with

challenges that emerge and evolve. In order to be

agile, we have to learn and that’s what UNDP is

trying to do.

When UNDP established the network of

Accelerator Labs, we set out with an ambitious

vision: to become the world’s fastest learning

network on sustainable development challenges.

In this time of planetary crisis, when best practices

don’t always exist, we’re more convinced than

ever of the need for an agile network that learns

what works and what doesn’t for sustainable

development problems.

Digitizing
informality

In 2020 we will focus on embedding, spreading

and learning new ways of working within and

beyond the UNDP Accelerator Lab network. We’ll

be embedding the accelerated learning cycle into

Lab practice and into UNDP as the organization

works with partners to respond to COVID-19 and

beyond. We’ll also be sharing the Accelerator

Lab solutions, insights, and ways of working with

partners on the ground as they prepare, respond

and recover from the pandemic and its legacy. Our

learning objectives for 2020 include:

Plans for scaling

As solutions are mapped and new insights created,

the Lab network will design for handover to

ensure innovation becomes a regularized process

of public sector renewal. A pipeline of sustainable

development solutions will be available next year

in order to anchor our plans for scaling. To put in

place a strategy to grow the work of the Labs, the

UNDP Accelerator Lab network is working with

more mature labs, such as the SDG Innovation Lab

in the Prime Minister’s Office in Armenia and the

Citra Lab in Sri Lanka to develop tools to support

handover and spinoffs. A team from Columbia

University’s School of International and Public

Affairs has designed a scaling strategy as a

capstone project of the Master’s in Economic

Development degree. The refinement of an ethical

framework will also support scaling by de-risking

experimentation, new technologies and work with

vulnerable communities.

Reinventing Knowledge Management,
Monitoring and Evaluation

In 2020, we will strengthen the sensory network

to follow what the network is learning, so that we

can act upon what works well and what doesn’t.

The next horizon will require a balance between

setting directions in the network and following

where it leads. This is an area that will require

the re-invention of knowledge management and

organizational learning to make it more accessible

to the public and able to keep track of new models,

methods and technologies.

Balancing quick wins with
larger moonshot missions

In 2020, we hope to learn more about how to strike

a balance between demonstrating that the Labs

are here for action, while lining up partnerships

for larger systems change. This will require

accelerated action and creating deliberate spaces

for reflection. The portfolio approach will be critical

to redesigning systems such as employment and

entrepreneurship markets, waste management

systems and citizen engagement. In 2020 we will

build on the experiments underway to create

portfolios of experiments that take on systems

learning and innovation for broader impact.

The
Buzz

“ I have lived abroad for the past 11 years –
in Shanghai, London and Geneva. I heard
about the Accelerator Labs when a few of my
friends forwarded me the job description.
They were excited to share it with me as they
previously never heard of vacancies for a social
anthropologist in Ukraine. I am inspired by the
opportunity to apply my professional skills to
develop human-centered solutions in my home
country.”

Oleksiy Moskalenko
Head of Solutions Mapping, UNDP Ukraine Accelerator Lab

“ We must not lose any more time if we are to achieve
the SDGs. We need the commitment and ideas of
all players within society so as to find new ways of
approaching food security, climate change mitigation,
decent work and sustainable urban development. That
is exactly what the UNDP Accelerator Labs have set out
to do. Staff are working in 78 countries to develop new
ideas; they are drawing on the energy of young people
and start-ups and sharing their knowledge with others
across the world in order to solve global challenges
through their joint efforts. We need to make faster
and greater strides towards the SDGs, otherwise those
goals will not be achieved by 2030. That requires of
us not only innovations but also considerably greater
investment on the part of the international community
than has been seen to date.”

Dr Gerd Müller
Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany

“ Our Accelerator Labs are showing that
disruptive query and ‘messy’ analytics can
lead to new ideas and actions needed to tackle
the tough challenges to sustainable, peaceful
progress. Are we now ready – with governments,
private sector, civil society and partners – to
take some of this to scale through policy and
investment choices that have to look very
different from what we know today?”

“ The grassroots approach adopted by the Labs
emphasizes the importance of exploring
socially acceptable and locally-sourced
solutions that will make addressing 21st
Century development challenges more effective
and efficient. By taking a leap of faith in
investing the first 20 million dollars, we have
been able to enhance our delivery towards our
international commitments in the Middle East
and Africa regions.”
