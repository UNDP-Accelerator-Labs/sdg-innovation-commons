## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

-     System thinking methodology could be understandable only by doing it. Sense and Exploration of the portfolio approach help to see the whole picture of the problem. It is important to learn to step out from your comfort zone and learn how to zoom in and zoom out when working with the portfolio perspective  -       Involvement and collaboration with colleagues from different clusters/projects are crucial – this process of mutual enrichment, shares, and mind-changing - Their expertise and in AccLab new vision  -       Language of provided information should be clear and easily understandable for colleagues and partners (terminology of system thinking and portfolio approach challenging to accept for partners)  -       Learning is a treasure process, sometimes you gain more by learning than just concentrating on the measurable results – AccLabers understand that but classical projects prefer doing things in the old way  -       If you want to make a change to the system and mindsets – be patient, this process make take a long way but it is worth it.

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
N/A yet. We are in the process of presenting 3 blogs on Fow Phase 1

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

 - Limitation of public data and reliable data sources   -  Challenges in changing the old way of thinking 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

-       During the problem phase, Desk research/Literature review – helped us to gather information and gain data while we were sensing and exploring the challenge of the Future of Work in Uzbekistan. It helped us to understand the system structure and dynamics in the country. Data from the desk research was gathered from the sources of international development organizations, such as UNDP, ILO, WB, as well as open and available public data.  -       Through interviews with different actors (UNDP key staff, university professors, NGO representatives, and entrepreneurs) we identified the main aspects of the following areas that relate to the Future of Work: needs, resources, conditions, insights from different perspectives.  -       Collective intelligence – several workshops with a broad group of colleagues from different projects/clusters helped us to receive wide-ranging ideas, data information on the problem  -       The biggest challenge with the government and public data in Uzbekistan is availability and reliability. For many decades many sources were not available, and data was not easy being shared with the public. Due to that when talking about data usage in the country, it is challenging to gather comprehensive and fully objective data.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The portfolio design process we used was adopted and re-designed to fit the context of the work from the agora methodology, an urban system transformation tool co-developed with UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub (IRH) and the Chora Foundation.    Collective intelligence - directly links to the designing portfolio by collecting resources from the different intelligence groups (for example ideas, visions, the expertise we gained during the workshops with colleagues of UNDP from different clusters and projects). Collaborative work on the problem of Future of Works was b spotted from different angles, expertise, opinions, and perspectives.     Crowdsourcing – was conducted through the stage of interviews with different stakeholders and by using the survey to identify main aspects of the Future of Works issues, challenges on employment, current situation, needs, resources the country has at this point    System thinking – helped us to learn the steps (problem and solution) of the portfolio. It also helped us to design a portfolio and see all aspects from different perspectives and angels, to see the whole structure and cycles of the system, instead of having the classic projects that are aimed at resolving only narrow issues      Visual Thinking and Mapping - used to visualize ecosystems, partners, stakeholders, and other aspects of the portfolio Sensemaking. To show how Intent and Areas of Interest for the Future of Works are linked to each other and to the idea of system thinking.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NGO in Ferganana Valley “Mehirjon” – working with migrant youth, informal workers, women. AccLab conducted interview on following areas that relates to the Future of Work: needs, resources, conditions, insights.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Westminster University in Tashkent  & INHA University in Tashkent. Interviews with professors for the FoW survey on needs, resources, conditions, insights of the current situation, especially among youth, women in the framework of Future of Works

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A will be during the second Phase in 2022

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

-       Center for Economic Research and Reforms (CERR) -       Ministry of Economic Development and Poverty reduction External validation workshop that was presented to the broad external partners was conducted in close collaboration with both government agencies. Further work of the portfolio will be continued with mentioned above partners.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Academia Partners were somehow unusual, as we directly interviewed and gained sources from the field, from the actors who are directly involve with students and know the environment where young people share their ideas, views, frustrations, and future professional steps.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

UNFPA, ILO – participated in the external workshop discussions. Shared their ideas, expertise based on the three Ecosystem – Digital markets, Social Resilience and Green Transition
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Methods, data, and partners that we used in our first Phase of the portfolio on Future of Works, first gave us an opportunity to use system thinking approach on practice. Learn through the process and generate insights, gain results not only from the exercise itself but also to see the challenges partners and colleagues face when new system approach is presented. Second, this experience helped us to learn how to look at one problem from the broader perspective, to understand how to and when to zoom in and zoom out based on the process and moment.
