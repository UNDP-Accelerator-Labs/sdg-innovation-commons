Titir Cetar is a web-based platform designed to strengthen the disaster preparedness and response of the residents of Tegal Regency, Central Java. Users can find information regarding evacuation routes, emergency response facilities, and a disaster risk map on the platform, as well as report any disaster events to the authories. Local communities, including schoolchildren and housewives, were included in the design and development process of this platform. The site has been adopted by the Regional Agency for Disaster Countermeasure (BPBD) of Tegal Regency, and holds the potential for scaling, both at the local level in other regencies, as well as at higher levels.
