> Title of the innovation

Helping my fellow women

> Brief description of the innovation

I have about 20 mother who wants to do business But they don't have capital, so when I come back from buying groundnuts and fish I give them to sale for me , there very hard workers. If you can give us piece works to work and make capital then things will be better

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

It helps me support my children and other women I help. Despite giving them little money to feed there family I feel if they can have their own capital I would show them where to buy things and sale for themselves. And things can be better for us,, Because  i don't make enough money.

> Technical Feasibility

What I do is I go to the river and buy fish, or go to chinsali to buy groundnuts and when I come back I call the women and ask them to help me sale, after that I give them a small percentage I go somewhere else to buy other things and do the same when I come. I want them to be independent.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It can help them do more for there families, and educate there children. Because women are really suffering in my community. So when you empower a woman the community will benefit from us
