## Title

Digital Inclusion in Sudan 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is the stark digital access disparity in Sudan.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Sudan occupies 1,886,068 square kilometres (728,215 square miles), making it Africa's third-largest country by area, and the third-largest by area in the Arab League with a total population was 45.45 million in January 2022. At the start of 2022, 36.0 percent of Sudan’s population lived in urban centres, while 64.0 percent lived in rural areas.  Mobile phone penetration as a percentage of population reached 80.3% in 2020 in Sudan, according to World Bank. This is 4.09% more than in the previous year. This translates to 80 mobile subscriptions are registered for every 100 people. Internet penetration sits at 30.9% primarily concentrated in urban and peri-urban areas with 14.03 million internet users in Sudan in January 2022. Kepios analysis indicates that internet users in Sudan increased by 331 thousand (+2.4 percent) between 2021 and 2022.For perspective, these user figures reveal that 31.42 million people in Sudan did not use the internet at the start of 2022, meaning that 69.1 percent of the population remained offline at the beginning of the year.   Within those disparities, 14.3 million people in Sudan will need humanitarian assistance in 2022 due to numerous overlapping crises of which 1.2 million are refugees. In a context such as Sudan, where protracted and sudden-onset crises often take place in highly insecure environments, humanitarian access can be extremely challenging and unpredictable. Digital humanitarian assistance and recovery remains largely under explored in Sudan when there is a lack of an infrastructure to support it and lack of evidence on current access to and use of digital technology among host communities, refugees and IDPs. Whilst the largest population distribution is concentrated in Sudan, the highest population densities exist in the urban and peri-urban areas. Given the high CAPEX and OPEX needed to set-up a digital infrastructure, a privatised service sector, there is little financial inducement to expand the infrastructure into rural areas let alone fragile and crisis settings. Mobile Network Operators call these low-revenue sites where the minimum population threshold for GSM services sits at 30,000 people. On the other hand, the TPRA (Telecommunication and Post Regulatory Authority) the governmental body which regulates MNOs, has a program called the USA, the Universal Service Access which is mandated to achieve digital equity in Sudan. “Digital Equity" as defined by National Digital Inclusion Alliance, is a condition in which all individuals and communities have the information technology capacity needed for full participation in our society, democracy and economy. Under this program, MNOs contribute a percentage of profits to the USF, the Universal Service Fund which finances the CAPEX of BTS cellular towers in rural Sudan as per the geo-marketing surveys that TPRA conducts to identify and priorities off-grid areas. In 2021, the full liberalisation of diesel and gasoline prices after decades of fuel subsidies has made it financially unviable to operate existing towers under the USA let alone invest in new ones.  The entire digital infrastructure of Sudan runs on electricity from the National grid which only 55% of the population has access to or gensets, fuel generators.   Given this challenge, state level but also private sector has turned into more viable sources of energy for business continuity such as solar power across different sectors including Sudan‘s digital infrastructure particularly in rural, fragile and crisis areas. The longer communities are excluded within this digital divide, the longer citizen participation is compromised in nearly every aspect of society — from economic success and educational achievement, to positive health outcomes and civic engagement

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Expanding mobile telecommunication reach in target regions, can begin to facilitate access to economic and technical capacities to tools and extension services designed to build adaptive capabilities otherwise not available to communities in order to maximise and sustaining impact at the community level to boost collective impact on people’s living conditions, safety, and security.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can solar energy help bridge Sudan's digital divide?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

This challenge relies primarily on the Acclab proving the viability but also the business model to reduce OPEX of connectivity masts through solar energy. If the pilot proves successful, then a business case can be made to stakeholders to invest in expanding the digital infrastructure of the country.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These will support in developing the Access Dashboard. These draws data from sources to map fuel distribution lines, the National Grid and 33KV distribution lines, BTS coordinates, photovoltaic distribution and simulation during peak and rain seasons, geo-marketing surveys to pin-point exactly how big is the investment needed to expand the digital infrastructure in the country and which areas have to be prioritised.
