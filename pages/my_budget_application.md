My budget application

> Brief description of the innovation

Budgeting is an important activity yet very few people in this country do it.some it's because they feel budgeting is for the poor  but above all many feel it's time consuming or just a waste of time for this reason we came up with My budget which  is a mobile application that will simplify the process of coming up with a monthly house hold budget by making it simple, fun and less time consuming. The application will be having daily prices of food items on the market and not only that but it will also be giving information on where those items can be bought from. In this way will be simplifying the process by providing people with upto date prices of various items as compared to the current situation were people make budgets based on assumption of food prices and secondly the application will be calculating the total amount of money required to buy all the items on the budget, so the only thing that people will be doing is picking items they want and then the application will do the calculations for them and also indicate in which shops the items on the budget can be bought from unlike the current situation were people stress themselves with alot of calculations and moving up and down in the market and checking prices from one shop to another before they make a purchase!.....
