> Description of the solution

The Germ of Life project aims to address climate change by monitoring ecosystems and developing strategies for adaptation. CMCC, a key player in the project, focuses on using Earth observation data and advanced analytics to assess drought conditions and their impact on the environment. The project will develop new drought indicators and refine existing ones to improve drought prediction and risk assessment. Ultimately, Germ of Life aims to automate and enhance the process of monitoring soil and vegetation health, providing valuable insights for proactive drought management.
