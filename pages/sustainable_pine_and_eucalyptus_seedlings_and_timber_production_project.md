> Title of the innovation

Sustainable Pine and Eucalyptus Seedlings and Timber Production Project

> Brief description of the innovation

The Sustainable Pine and Eucalyptus Seedlings and Timber Production Project (the "project") focuses on the use of sustainable practices in the production of pine and eucalyptus seedlings in its Tier I (nursery), and the use of sustainable practices in the production of soft and hard wood timber in its Tier II (forest plantation).

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The main inputs (seeds) are acquired from the department of forestry under the Ministry of Natural Resources, and the main clients for the seedlings are the commercial farmers, schools, churches, and some corporate institutions such as (NGOs) championing tree planting.
Once the trees are produced the main clients will be; ZAFFICO and timber traders for soft wood, and; Zambia Electricity Corporation (ZESCO), REA.
TTI will address the following ICF KPIs; GHG emissions reduced or avoided; Deforestation avoided; Ecosystem value protected; Extent to which intervention is likely to have transformational impact; Number of people supported to better adapt to the effects of climate change; and Number of people with improved (climate) resilience. The application is being made under the conservation based economies.

> Technical Feasibility

Current annual production levels are 20, 000 seedlings with the vision of increasing that to 100, 000 seedlings in one year and 500, 000 seedlings in three years, and ultimately 1, 000, 000 seedlings in 5 years. 
Plantation - is the wooden poles and timber production side of the business. With the seedlings raised and maintained from the nursery, the business will establish plantations where it will sustainably grow pine (soft wood) and eucalyptus (hard wood) trees to maturity level and sale for timber and poles. The type of sustainable practices that will used in the production of the trees will be the Sustainable Management and Monitoring of Forests by the High Conservation Value (HCV) Network that will include; forest dynamics (regeneration); ecological adaptation (dispersal and climate resilience); planning and management. Currently, the project has not yet started the plantations and is only operating the nursery, however, a 100 hectares piece of land has already been identified and quoted in Serenje District Central Province for the plantation, with plans of also have similar size plantations in Mkushi and Kapiri Mposhi districts Central Province, and Solwezi District North-Western Province. The project is targeting to have the plantations in the Central and Northern Parts of the country due to the areas being in the Agro-ecological Zones II and III which receive over 800 mm of rainfall and have the longest rainy seasons.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Currently, major Zambian users of wooden poles are importing them from neighboring countries, i.e. Zimbabwe. By growing more trees locally, they will be within reach and easily accessible on the market and delivery time frame will be reduced, thereby reducing the cost and save on foreign exchange. As a pro-poor company located in the peri-urban areas of the Central Province and being led by a woman, TTI champions women and youth empowerment. TTI currently employs 30 rural women at the nursery and had trained over 100 rural households in nursery establishment and management. With the availability of funding, TTI plans to employ 100 rural women and youths, and train 1, 000 rural households of Chibombo District in sustainable forest tree nursery production and climate resilience, while engaging them as outgrowers.
