[[ai_summary:Alexandra Antunez, head of solutions mapping at UNDP Mozambique Accelerator Lab, discussed a project aimed at improving livelihoods through clean energy adoption in Mozambique. The lab mapped the energy system to understand user preferences, barriers, and opportunities for cleaner cooking sources. After conducting community-based research, including a cooking marathon with 300 households, the team developed an improved cook stove for one type of user and explored LPG adoption for another.

# Solutions Mapping in Mozambique to Improve Clean Energy Adoption

### [[0:01\]\]Hi, Alexandra\. How are you?

Hi, Olivier\. I'm OK\. You doing well?

### [[0:06\]\]Yes\. So would you tell me about you? Who are you? What are you doing in life?

OK\. My name is Alexandra Antunez, and I am the head of solutions mapping at UNDP Mozambique Accelerator Lab\.

### [[0:17\]\]Oh, wonderful\. And what's your best story? What have you achieved? What have you done?

Gosh, we have quite interesting stories\. But I think I would like to share with you a story that we have that is related to how can we improve livelihood through adoption of a clean energy\. So in Mozambique, 75% of the population relies on Bo mass for cooking and per Bo mass I'm talking about charcoal and firewood\. And of course this led to the deforestation issues and also to some to the increase of some health problems, public health problems\. But what we notice in Mozambique is that even in the urban centers where we have availability of different types of energy sources, where we have LPG, liquid petroleum gas, where we have electricity and where we have biomass available, even though the population they prefer to rely on charcoal and firewood\. So the lab was intrigued to understand why there is this dichotomy\. So we decided to intervene to design A series of a portfolio of intervention that aims to engage with different communities or users in order to understand what are the preferences, what are the barriers and what are the opportunities that exist in the in Mozambique to adopt A cleaner, affordable and reliant energy source for cooking\. So the first thing that we did, the first activity was to do a kind of a system mapping\. So the acclab team engage with the government sector, with academia, with the private sector, with the community, the, the local organization and also some development agencies\. And we were together, we brought all those actors together to discuss and to understand what is the energy system, what is the value chain related to the clean energy? Who are the actors, What are the resources that we have? What are the linkage and the connection between all those actors and resources and what are the gaps? What are the opportunities to understand? How can we start? Where are the weak point that needs to be leveraged and what we did after that? And based on the insights that we got from that exercise, we noticed that there is a huge need to go to the community, to the hand user\. So we went to the rural communities\. We decided to understand from them what are their insights and what we did was through a cooking marathon\. We decided to test different types of stoves because we found out that in rural communities they cannot afford, they don't have means to afford a more clean energy and cleaner, more clean energy\. We are talking about electricity or even the LPG\. So as they rely uniquely on charcoal and firewood and they don't pay nothing to get their charcoal and the firewood because they produce themselves, they go to the forest and they produce themselves\. But they also were saying to us that it's being quite difficult because they need to work more to find those resources\. Of course they are not\. They don't link it with the deforestation but they are just saying that OK now before we just used to work 10 minutes to find the trees, the resources and now we need to walk sometimes more than an hour\. So what we did is during a week we in a community we tested five different types of stoves made from ethanol, solar cashew, waste charcoal and firewood, rice also\. And the idea was to find out what could be build on what they already used to\. What could be the best design or the best stove that we could build up and then we could design the in a way that could be more efficient in terms of the consumption of the charcoal or fire hood\. So and then after that week we had received insights feedbacks from those community that were doing the test\. So what we did after that was we recruit a consultant that is an industrial designer lab consultant that would work with the community\. They will co\-design an efficient improved stove that could at least at least reduce\. Yeah we were quite optimist here, but we aim to reduce at least in 50% the use of charcoal or firewood and also that that consultancy, it will be able to train the community on create a kind a kind of a business model around the improved stove\. So we will create a kind of a small manufacturer where the local artisans could create a business model in order to produce themselves the improved stuff and sell within the community\. A part of it when we noticed that OK, we have the rural communities, but we have another group of people of communities that can afford that has a more regular income source\. So with those communities that are the ones that that lives in very urban areas, we decided that why not to try to incentivise them or to test with them what is their willness to adopt gas, domestic gas for cooking purpose\. And in that community we did a kind of we conducted the test where we we selected 300 households, low income as households where we give to them the first initial hit gas stove a cylinder and\. And the idea here was to test not only the willingness to adopt gas but also to test some innovative financing methods\. So there is a group that needs to pay us back in instalments and the other group doesn't need to pay\. So we did that experiment during three months and now we are in a stage where we are, we are in a stage of preparing the evaluation of this experiment to see at what extent those households really adopt or not the LPG for cooking purpose\. And after that, after we are able to do the evaluation process, we are thinking to organise an event, a technical seminar with the municipality, with the academia and the private sector to disseminate what are the insights and discuss what are the solutions that could be implemented\. Or how can we scale up that experiment that we did, adjusting other solutions that could appear based on the insights that we will get from the evaluation of the experiments\.

### [[8:59\]\]And how long did the entire learning process take you?

Gosh, this is a good question\. The entire learning process took us a while as we had to deal with really different not only different users but also we have to deal with even in geographical terms\. We have to deal with communities that were not located in the same geographical area that were located the users, the stakeholders and the actors that we engage\. For example for the for the first exercise for the system mapping exercise\. But it will took as almost I hear in doubt\.

### [[9:46\]\]Now if we had to talk about some of the challenges that you have encountered, I believe that you had some challenges sometimes when you felt like why are we doing this or are we really doing something that will bring positive\. So would you please tell me about one or two challenges that you had and how you overcame those challenges?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
Yes, the 1st, yeah, the first challenge that we got was more related to when we were starting understanding, trying to understand the problem and the, the owners of the problem\. Also we understood that there are that the owners of the problem, there are two kind of profiles or levels, OK\. And then that's why we thought that in order to address their problem, we couldn't choose one solution for both\. So that's where we had to understand how can we, how can we real, how can we real design our intervention or even how can we design our strategy in order to have a solution or a kind of, yeah, a solution that could fit on the needs of each group\. This was one of the problems\. That's why we came up with a portfolio of intervention\. We came up off with an improved cook stove for one type of user, one type of profile and the LPG adoption for the other\.

### [[11:20\]\]If this was to be done again, if you had to do this again, how would you go about repeating it again? What would you consider this time? I believe it was a process of learning\. When you started it, you didn't figure out or anticipate some of the challenges or opportunities\. But now if you had to do this again, what would you, how would you approach it if we have to do it again?

I think when the one of the approaches that we will do differently is the way we start engaging with the government with the public sector and the private sector\. So if we have to do it again, I would first we would first try to engage government and private sector in a more collaborative way and in a very early stage in order for them to start also kind of Co discussing Co understanding that issue with us since the very early beginning\.

### [[12:27\]\]OK\. A few minutes left\. In terms of the impact, talking about the impact, do you feel like the work that you are doing now even if it's only in your country, do you feel like it has an impact on the SDG achievement and would you elaborate on that?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
Yes, clearly I think it has a huge impact on the SCG achievement because we are talking about access to a clean\. OK\. When we are talk about, let's not we are talking about access to energy to affordable energy and I think it has a huge impact because for example in the case of Mozambique, there is a a government strategy aim to adopt massive adoption of LPG, OK domestic gas for cooking purpose\. And we think that with that experiment, we can have some very good insights that will support us on design solutions that could leverage the adoption of gas in the PERI urban areas in Mozambique\.

### [[13:49\]\]Well, I'm left just to thank you for the good story and the work that you are doing and I wish you all the best\.

Thank you\.
