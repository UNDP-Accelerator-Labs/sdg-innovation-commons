## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Preliminary research shows that while erosion is one of the most critical environmental challenges facing Pemba City, the overall unavailability of data means that neither the current extent, distribution or causes of the problem are sufficiently known. The study methodology aims to test effective and affordable ways to collect and store data, while ensuring that it remains relevant and updated for continuous use by relevant stakeholders.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF data gathering methods are streamlined and stored in open-source platform THEN then the availability of accessible and updated information will lead to better decision making and strategic planning. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Two Universities engaged to conduct field mapping and data digitalization with students, and also drive long-term integration of methodology in school curriculum. Local crowd mapping specialist engaged to train university students on participatory and open-source mapping methodologies. The process was documented, and a manual produced for further replication. Local erosion specialist engaged for validation of collected data to ensure scientific rigor for mass dissemination Municipality engaged to promote use and dissemination of methodology amongst municipal dpts. for general use

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

1.       X5 months of work (2 of prep and post experiment evaluation + x3 of coordination of mapping & data collection) 2.       Community knowledge and access brought on by Universities & local leaders. 3.       Support from graphics team to develop Results report 4.       Support from communication team to help disseminate study information results 5.       Support from in-house admin. teams to coordinate travel logistics, drone flight authorizations, and others.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Partially. The data gathered is raising awareness and is being used to design strategies to prevent and mitigate erosion as planned. However, the initial assumption that the methodology could be easily replicated and become an affordable solution to data access did not hold true. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

1.       The combination of x4 different teams who we believed would enrich the process, actually hindered it, as communication and accountability for various processes was very difficult to manage. Simplifying this structure would be beneficial in the future. 2.       The need for cellphones for data collection on the field, computers for data uploading and digitization, and internet connection throughout the entire process proved to be a surprising challenge. Some phones did not meet requirements for GPS tracking, student did not have enough computers to streamline digitization, and internet costs were far beyond budgeted. While these issues cannot be avoided, better planning and budget allocation could make them less noticeable in future experiences.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

10 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

66,000.00USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. We are using the data gathered (risk areas, most affected neighborhoods, types of erosion, etc) to map priority areas for intervention and pilot a low-cost, low-tech erosion prevention or mitigating methodology with local communities. The main goal is to keep this below 10,000.00USD.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The initial goal was to scale the mapping/ data gathering methodology to other areas of concern (ie. waste management), but currently we need to reflect on real potential for uptake considering (a) technological limitations in the area and (b) complexity involved in monitoring implementation of data collection strategy in the field.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

While the basic premise that access to information leads to better planning and decision making remains true, the idea that information can be easily gathered and made available to all still needs further reflection. There are issues of security and protocols that need to be considered. While not insurmountable, they do impact on how information is ultimately accessed by all. In addition, when designing an activity that so heavily relies on technology, it is critical to adapt the requirements of said technology to local context. This is a manageable issue if the project is funded by an organization, but if the goal is to, for example, see uptake of local students in their own individual right, the issue of access to technology can become a major obstacle.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Logistical obstacles were the most prominent. (a) Contracting the specialists and securing agreements with the universities proved to be a 3-month long process- as opposed to the 1 month we had allocated. (b)Because the CO is located 3hrs away from the study area, organizing trips to the site for monitoring activities was also a challenge. (c) Authorization to upload detailed drone images to open source platform is still under way- particularly because the study area (Cabo Delgado) is currently a conflict zone with security risks.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Environmental Unit which has a comprehensive portfolio for disaster management and resilience; Pemba Sub-Office which is conducting comprehensive infrastructure assessments (data gathering) throughout the province.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Universities: the use of open-sourced mapping methodology can complement other methodologies, with the added value of ensuring information is easily available at no cost to institution. Local government & agencies: open data platforms addresses current issues of information ownership and segregation. This could benefit stakeholders who historical

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

The methodology for data collection in the field was simplified to allow student to collect required data within specified timeline. Specifically , there was a revision (reduction) of the initial questionnaires.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

If working with inter-disciplinary teams, take the time to clearly discuss responsibilities and expected deliverables. Ensure that all parties are 100% aware of their role and how it impact others.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

They were an integral part of the process and helped shape the activity which combined components from all x3 areas. 

> What surprised you?

Everything. The different layers of results obtained, specially how they correlated with some anecdotal knowledge but also raised interesting new insights. The length of the various processes, both technical and logistical. The importance of being adaptable and willing to re-think and re-strategize when implementing an experimental activity. Mostly the commitment from the teams that worked with the AccLab.
