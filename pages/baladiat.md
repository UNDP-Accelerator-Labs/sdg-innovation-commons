## Local Tourism Products

This emerging Jordanian brand was created to fill the gap in locally made, authentic tourism products. Inspired by the rich cultural and geographical diversity of Jordan, the brand designs unique keychains and t-shirts themed around each of the country’s governorates. From the colors of Ajloun’s forests to the mosaics of Madaba or the desert landscapes of Ma'an, each product celebrates local identity and detail. The brand addresses the shortage of distinctive, high-quality souvenirs in Jordan by offering items that not only represent the country’s heritage but also support its creative economy.
