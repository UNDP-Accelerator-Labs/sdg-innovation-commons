1. Introduction

Since the launch of UNDP Accelerator Labs Network in 2019 and within each of the
four phases of their work,1 there has been a persistent challenge related to how
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) feature in the work of the Accelerator Labs. At
present, the system that governs how solutions are invested in presents burdensome
challenges when it intersects with IPR.

In this context, UNDP has hired the Center for Music Ecosystems (CME) to conduct a
body of research on the current IPR setup in UNDP that governs the UNDP
Accelerator Labs Network and identify findings inspired on other leading industries
with regards to IPR management. The result of the research is a set of findings that
challenges the current IPR setup in the organization, striving to optimize the benefits
and cooperation with all parties involved (UN agencies; governments; UNDP
Accelerator Labs; grassroot innovators; startups; universities and others), based both
on the IPR administration model in the music industries but also on the current IPR
management setup in multiple instances in the UN System such as UNICEF DPGA, UN
Global Pulse and Digital X Accelerator led by UNDP’s Chief Digital Officer.

This work included interviewing several UNDP Accelerator Lab members and subject
matter experts, all of which is detailed in the full version of the study.

2. Setting the Stage - Accelerator Labs Network and Innovation

The Accelerator Labs Network is a critical mass of social innovators inside UNDP. This
mass of social innovators is constantly building ideas, creating work and solutions
from their initial phases (sense and explore), medium phases (test) and final phases
(grow), whilst building new ways of working. Within the wide range of knowledge,
ideas, work and solutions, the key knowledge gap across stakeholders is the
distinction on what of all of that range is bound by Intellectual Property Rights
(IPR).

1 UNDP Accelerator Labs’ learning cycle consists of four steps: sense, explore, test and grow.

IPR definitions
For the purposes of this report, there are two categories of intellectual property:
Industrial Property and Copyright and Related Rights (WIPO, 2020). The former
includes patents for inventions, industrial designs, trademarks and geographical
indications and the latter refers to literary, artistic and scientific works, including
performance and broadcasts.

In the context of the UNDP Accelerator Labs, Gupta and Dey (2021) identified that out
of around 1,500 solutions, not all have IPR implications. However, copyright applies to
every single work (e.g. documents, data).2 A key element to highlight is how the
Accelerator Lab context works within the distinction on what copyright law protects
and what it does not: (...) “Copyright law, however, protects only the form of
expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. The creativity protected by copyright law
is creativity in the choice and arrangement of words, musical notes, colors, shapes and so
on. Copyright law protects the owner of rights in artistic works against those who “copy,”
that is to say those who take and use the form in which the original work was expressed by
the author.” WIPO (2004)

Determining what is considered to be bound by IPR is the first step in building a
framework for IPR, however it is also necessary to establish a framework to
administer and/or manage those rights.

IPR administration
To ensure the implementation and exercise of copyright and related rights, the
administrative role of the State is fundamental, but some countries lack robust
structures (WIPO, 2016). However, States should have a minimum role related to the
policy level function, monitoring of the legislation and the enforcement of strategies.
Some of their administrative tasks include: a. A system of registration of works and
subject matter protected by related rights and/or b. The operation of private
organizations that exercise copyright and related rights collectively or jointly on
behalf of rights-holders represented by them (known as Collective Management
Organizations, CMOs).

2 The other intellectual property rights (Industrial Property) such as patents, trade or service marks, trade secrets, geographical

indications, plant variety protection and industrial design, amongst others, may apply in specific cases.

The above-mentioned context is of most relevance for Accelerator Labs and UNDP in
general. Where there is a more robust IPR national framework, the higher the
probability of local innovators to have a wider understanding on the implications of
IPR and the higher the chances are of having an adequate institutional framework to
ensure their IPR is properly administered. Many Accelerator Labs, however, are not
in states with robust national frameworks.

3. Key Findings - Accelerator Labs and IPR pain points

The solutions the Accelerator Labs uncover are subject to the UNDP’s Procurement
and Legal framework:

● Any IPR resulting from UNDP assistance belongs to UNDP (SBAA, UNDP-

recipient Government, n.d.).

● Governments signing the agreement have the right to use the discovery or work

bound by IPR, within the country, free of royalty or charge (SBAA, UNDP-
recipient Government, n.d.).

● Any outcome from intellectual activity from a worker hired by UNDP in the
context of the Accelerator Labs will be considered ‘work for hire’ and the
copyright of such work will be under the ownership of UNDP (General T&C of
the Contract; UNDP, n.d.).

● In principle, the provision of monetary prizes is not allowed, however it may be
realized via the framework of an Innovation Challenge, limited to an amount
of USD $40,000. (Innovation Challenges Policy; UNDP, 2015).

This creates pain points that negatively impact the solution from developing.
Our research identified 12 of them. They are below:

1. IPR knowledge gap:

UNDP personnel in the field, dealing with IPR, have a knowledge gap with
regards to IPR regarding the difference of an idea and work bound by IPR.
Little guidance is provided to UNDP staff fieldwork commences, creating
misunderstandings related to the role of IPR in what they find and support.

●

(...) “You have to be able to explain Ts and Cs over and over again to people who are not experts in IP.
They just want to know what they should expect.” (Accelerator Lab Bosnia and Herzegovina).

2. No available IPR UNDP central knowledge center

UNDP personnel dealing with IPR do not have an official UNDP Global IPR
framework to use as a guideline. Even though the Legal Support Office of
UNDP is responsible for Legal matters in the UNDP, the scope of IP in the
Accelerator Labs is not part of their specific mandate and therefore there is a
gap to address these issues at the field level.

●

●

●

(...) “We are always trying to ‘grasp at straws’ internally regarding how we deal with guidance for IP,
under a legal framework which is paradoxical.” (Accelerator Lab Philippines)
(...) “We kept asking questions to legal and got no response or definite advice on what we could do. So
we kept it in the Country Office, but there was no guidance in the programs and operations policies
and procedures (our bible). Nothing on intellectual property.” (Accelerator Lab Philippines)
(...) “One of the pain points handling the issues of IP within UNDP, is that UNDP has not yet come up
with any policy guidelines for us to tackle.” (Accelerator Lab Uganda)

3. No visibility of all the IPR related issues by the Accelerator Labs Global Team

The UNDP Accelerator Lab Global Team does not have access to a
comprehensive compendium of concrete issues that are happening on the
ground with regards to IPR - available at the regional and global levels and
managed by legal teams. The UNDP Accelerator Lab Network Global Team
has created a channel in MS Teams for the Accelerator Labs but currently it is
not adopted in its full capacity. Such infrastructure requires a more robust
solution in order to ensure wider UNDP use and management. Country
Offices also lack this access.

4. Capacity gap across innovators: grassroot innovators and start-ups

There are cultural and practical differences across the grassroots innovators
(which bring traditional knowledge as a core element of the solution) and
start-ups operating in metropolitan areas. The latter are formal organizations
which usually have more knowledge over IPR, whilst the former are
individuals who are not represented by an organization.

●

(...) “If people are not institutionalized, we don’t know how to engage with them. If they aren’t
registered, have a company name, we can’t really engage other than inviting them to a meeting. One
of my greatest challenges is working with the informal sector. I’m trying to figure out how to give
someone in the field an allowance to do field work, but I can’t, because they aren’t in a group. I need
to look for an institution to house that person.” (Accelerator Lab Zimbabwe)

5. Fear of no retribution to grassroots communities from the developed IPR

work

Grassroot innovators, when sharing traditional knowledge, are often at a
disadvantage where their traditional knowledge is misappropriated,
transformed into a derivative work and subsequently turned into an IPR-
bound work. There is a fear of being taken advantage of and the local

community does not see any benefits being brought back to them through
IPR.

●

●

(...) “When you are working on the ground - you are working to face challenges, rather
than working for money… so the neighbor says you can do this, then another neighbor
adds this - so IP starts to be a big challenge, because it is the IP of a lot of people.”
(Accelerator Lab Colombia)
(...) “We are trying to create the future using a tool coming from the past - the IP has been
around maybe 200 years, but it is not going to be on the radar in 200 years. If we look
around, some of the biggest contributions are coming from the anonymous - the
grassroots innovators - who are not connected with institutions.” (Accelerator Lab
Colombia)

Innovators as original creators must give up the IPR of their work to UNDP
UNDP is the owner of the IPR for any work framed under the Accelerator
Labs, as per established in the General T&C of the Contract (UNDP, n.d.).
Innovators whose work which, during their relationship with UNDP becomes
a work bound by IPR, will be owned by UNDP.

●

(...) “It becomes a power dynamic issue - we have the info and access - so we’re going to
teach you how to trademark and register your idea - and then they become the person
you are fighting with, because they now know what they are supposed to get. So we are
the teachers of how things are supposed to work for them, but then when they work with
us, the game changes. Don’t know how we can fix it.” (Accelerator Lab Zimbabwe)

7. Limitation to modify contractual statement where ownership of IPR remains

with UNDP statement in the UNDP General T&C

The UN and UNDP, as a part of the UN system, are not able to modify the
definition of ownership of IPR, where the individual authors’ work is
considered ‘work-for-hire'. Modifications in the General T&C of the Contract
(UNDP, n.d.) are not feasible. Some Accelerator Labs use workarounds such
as strictly working with companies or individuals who already have a
sufficiently developed solution bound by IPR (pre-existing IPR) (see limitation
8). This limits innovation.

8. Limitations to share IPR for co-created work leads to workarounds

Since UNDP cannot share any IPR due to the ownership statement in the
General T&C of the Contract (UNDP, n.d.), the innovators often are required
to take a secondary route where the development of an idea into a work
bound by IPR is co-created without UNDP, avoiding this way to be subject to
UNDP owning the IPR.

9. With the current set-up of the Accelerator Labs as Engagement Facilities, with
limited resources, monetary incentives for innovators are limited, which is
even more challenging with solutions that come from individuals, rather than
groups or firms

UNDP Engagement Facility (UNDP, 2018) establishes that the Accelerator Labs
cannot fund low-value or micro-capital grants. Often the approach with
innovators is done via Innovation Challenges, which allows them to grant a
monetary prize up to US $40,000. The receipt of grants to test/validate a
solution is prohibited (without a competition).

●

(...) “We have a lot of ‘bedroom developers’ who don’t have degrees. They don’t qualify (for challenges)
- the concept and flexibility of what talent is, needs to change.” (Accelerator Lab Zimbabwe)

10. UNDP as owner of dormant IPR

UNDP as the owner of the IP has multiple works that are currently not being
maximized in their direct use or derivative modifications for other contexts or
countries. Such work has a high potential to serve as a means to support
worldwide issues that are part of UNDP and across the UN system’s mission
and vision.

11. No formal IPR licenses defined for UNDP owned IPR

UNDP does not have an IPR framework that includes the types of licenses
applicable for the IPR they own (e.g., copyright or permissive licenses). Such a
framework limits the possibility for other potential end users or intermediate
users (who can create derivatives from such work) to exploit such IPR work.

12. Local IPR administration systems are not homogenous across countries
The administrative role of Governments for IPR differs across countries
leaving some innovators with unclear local IPR rules and processes to adhere
to. If an innovator wants to register a patent (Industrial Property related) but
there is not an official national process or whenever the innovator wants to
reach out to a national administrator of their copyright work to ensure all the
royalties derived from the use of such copyright are realized and transferred
to them, but there is none (e.g., by a Collective Management Organization,
CMO).

These challenges are not exclusive to UNDP. There are other initiatives in the UN
system which have faced similar limitations but have found alternatives on how to
deal with IPR. Next, we have explored initiatives which can serve as a leading example
for UNDP Accelerator Labs IPR framework.

4. What We Can Learn From - Comparative Analysis

The management of IP created within the UNDP Accelerator Labs is contrasted with
the IPR framework in the other UN-driven initiatives and the case study of music
industries. Following are the examples which UNDP Accelerator Labs can take
inspiration from:

● UNICEF DPGA3 knowledge sharing: they have an expert advisor to support

innovators with several topics including IPR and have set IPR related content in
Agora Platform (UNICEF's global hub for learning).

● CMOs in the music industries: can use a percentage of collected royalties to

reinvest in the authors and copyright owners/holders.

● UNICEF DPGA’s legal annex to T&C: this was done to ensure that the IPR does

not remain with UNICEF but is owned by the innovator.4

● UNDP OIC5 and Global Pulse intentionally work with innovators with pre-

existing IPR: this workaround is done to avoid UNDP owning the work’s IPR.
This ensures that innovators can work with other partners (e.g., private
investors) who would require the IPR to belong to the innovator to be later
commercialized (depending on the objectives).

● UNICEF DPGA, UNDP OIC and UNESCO IFCD6 monetary prizes above USD
$40,000: UNDP OIC specifically obtained an approval from the UN CPO.

● UNICEF DPGA and Global Pulse registry: example of how to provide a

dissemination platform for the IPR financed by them. 7

● UNICEF DPGA’s license standard: establishes the requirements that determine
if a nominated software, data, AI models, standards or other content can be
considered a digital public good (e.g. open licenses that the solutions can adhere
to: permissive/copyleft or public domain).8

● CMOs in the music industries: act as intermediaries between the users of IPR
and the owners of the copyright, collecting the monetary outcome on the
owner’s behalf.

5. Evidence-Based Findings to Take Forward

The following evidence-based findings have been proposed to the UNDP Accelerator
Labs Global Team informed by the insights gathered on their main objectives. There
is no workable one-size-fits-all approach. As such, findings are focused on four
different groups: 1. Grassroots innovators, 2. Start-ups, 3. Universities (or other third-
sector stakeholders) and 4. the UN System. Each finding is discussed in significant
detail in the final report. The implementation of each finding can be addressed in the
short, medium and long term. See Table 1:

● Short term: can focus on topics that do not require immediate modifications in
UN or UNDP specific policy and where resources or infrastructure is already in
place.

● Medium term: can focus on the implementation of prototypes for findings.
● Long term: can focus on structural policy modifications and full embedding of
findings from the medium term. These require an update of the Procurement
Manual and/or of the UN General Terms and Conditions Contract, which shall be
done in consultation with the UN Office of Legal Affairs, OLA.
