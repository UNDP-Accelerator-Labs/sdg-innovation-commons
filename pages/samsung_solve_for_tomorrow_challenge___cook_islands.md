Samsung Solve for Tomorrow Challenge - Cook Islands
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



How might we encourage students to develop innovative solutions to pressing community issues through the integration of STEAM education?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Samsung Solve for Tomorrow (SFT) competition is a groundbreaking initiative designed to catalyse innovation within education. Developed in partnership with Samsung NZ, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Accelerator Lab as the implementer, and the Ministry of Education as the beneficiary, this competition serves as a beacon for empowering students. By integrating science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM), SFT provides a platform for students to tackle real-world challenges head-on. Through this collaborative effort, the aim is to cultivate a new generation of thinkers and problem-solvers who will drive positive change in their communities and beyond. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The UNDP Accelerator Lab (AccLab) can bring several key value propositions to the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow (SFT) challenge:

Expertise in Innovation and Sustainable Development: The AccLab possesses deep knowledge and experience in innovation methodologies and sustainable development practices. It can offer guidance and resources to help students understand complex community issues and develop innovative solutions that have a positive and lasting impact.

Access to Global Networks and Resources: As part of the United Nations network, the AccLab has access to a vast global network of experts, organizations, and resources. It can facilitate connections for students with mentors, subject matter experts, and potential collaborators, enhancing their learning experience and amplifying the impact of their projects.

Support for Local Contextualization: The AccLab's understanding of local contexts and challenges can assist students in tailoring their solutions to address specific community needs effectively. By providing insights into social, economic, and environmental factors, the AccLab can help students develop solutions that are relevant, feasible, and sustainable in their local contexts.

Capacity Building and Skill Development: Through workshops, training sessions, and other capacity-building activities, the AccLab can help students develop essential skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and project management. These skills are crucial for students to succeed not only in the SFT competition but also in their future endeavors as innovators and changemakers.

Advocacy and Amplification: The AccLab can amplify the impact of students' projects by advocating for their adoption and implementation at local, national, and even international levels. By showcasing successful solutions and sharing lessons learned, the AccLab can inspire broader action and contribute to positive change beyond the scope of the competition.
