CETIC is a professional training centre created in 2018, with the objective of providing computer courses to youth and professionals in the Bafatá Region to reduce computer illiteracy levels and increase youth employment, entrepreneurship and self-employment. The business has a focus on tacking the low access to IT, which often prevents young people from getting into employment. Iero Cande, the founder, was the winner of the Accelerator Lab entrepreneurship contest and his solution was mapped as positive deviance through entrepreneurship.
