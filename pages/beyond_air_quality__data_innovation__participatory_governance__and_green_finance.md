## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Data innovation: Build trust and awareness within the community by ensuring accurate (transparent, reliable, validated), complete (covering all city, using all data sources), real-time (+ storage of historical data), accessible (easy to understand, web portal+mobile app) and open (open APIs) air quality DATA provided for all 2. Participatory governance: with better access to valid data, improve citizen participation, collaboration; behavior change among air quality actors in Almaty; move towards participatory governance, distributed and collaborative decision-making. 3. Green finance: building on insights generated in UNDP supported green finance innovation over past years to all investors (including citizens and businesses)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

There were different types of barriers: lack of data / conflicting data, a large number of actors / sporadic actions, lack of trust in the official authorities, many primary causes of the problem.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

To explore the root causes of the problem and possible solutions, we used primary and citizen-generated data by conducting a series of interviews with the representatives of the city municipality, researchers, private companies, NGOs, and eco-activists. We explored the social media open data to learn and assess citizens' opinions and experiences related to the air pollution in the city: how it affects the spirit and attractiveness of the city, people's health and wellbeing, socio-economic situation.  Different types of data (local sensors, satellite data, transport data) have been collected at the air quality platform to analyze and provide complete accurate information to the citizens. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

As we partnered with the local public fund to develop the platform, we used collective intelligence and co-creation methods to generate new ideas and ways to create the most effective and user-friendly tool. This tool has a gamification feature to improve citizen participation and engagement: eco-coins. To test the platform, we launched a pilot. As a procurement method, we conducted an Innovation Challenge which is a type of crowdsourcing to collect creative ideas on how to tackle air pollution in Almaty.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We partnered with the AirVision public fund to develop the air quality monitoring platform. We worked closely with the Green Salvation NGO which protects human rights and the environment and provides eco-education for the population.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We met the professor of KazNU, Dr. Vinnikov, who is conducting research about risks of health impacts from air pollution. We talked to Dr. Kerimray who is a well-known expert in the field of air quality, she investigates the sources of pollution.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

One of our partners is "Sergek" private company that provides transport data to the platform which allows calculating the emissions from the transport as well as the volume of emissions on different parts of the city. The goal is to develop an algorithm that will generate the urban transformation models to reorganize flows, reduce transport loads and decrease air pollution from the transport system.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We communicated with the departments of Green Economy and Digitalisation of the city municipality to identify existing barriers and gaps as well as current projects aiming at air pollution reduction. We revealed the problem that the municipality has no reliable evidence for decision making, as they receive air quality data in raw format.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All above-mentioned partners were new to UNDP

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

no UN partners
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
