However the kids pupil from school can become the first experimenters of doing the recycle and be able to gain money from what is around them. In a sence that they will throw waste acording to the compartment of the bin and be able to arrange the waste freely and happily.The fund collected from the waste will be used for pupils only and also helping the poor kids pay school fees and also with things like funeral fair too .
