- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Create a drone/app that can detect garbage in the environment at  a specified location and alert the garbage  collecting  companies, thus charging a fee. This will also create micro employment and macro employment in the long run

> Technical Feasibility

As at now its still in the process,  research as it that many diseases in Zambia in the rainy season are due to environmental pollutions. . we believe in clean environment that can help to combat these challenges by being the frontiers of garbage collection. Am proposing to start a tech hub here in Zambia where youths and students can be part and parcel of the success.
