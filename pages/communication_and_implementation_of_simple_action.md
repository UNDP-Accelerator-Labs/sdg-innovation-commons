> Description of the solution

Communication during extreme heat could be via media including TV, radio, bulk SMS messaging, newspapers, social media, emails and websites. It is important for actors to support the implementation of simple actions to reduce the impact of extreme heat. This involves emergency managers, community-based organisations, healthcare workers, city head meteriologists and the media all walking together.
