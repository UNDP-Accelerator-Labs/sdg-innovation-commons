## Overall goal

Co-create a digital repository of ultrasonic bioacoustic records of local bats to contribute to the conservation and study of these mammals and, at the same time, promote technological and scientific professions among secondary school students. 
## Specific goals

Acquire, co-design, and implement the hardware and software necessary to store, manage, and share bioacoustic records. 

Obtain bioacoustic records in field sampling distributed throughout the country. 

Co-design tools for mathematical analysis of ultrasonic signals. 

Assess how the experience affects the academic journey of secondary school participants. 
## Description of citizen participation

The project's citizen scientists are secondary school students who participate in science clubs. Depending on the interests of the participating clubs (environment, electronics, computing, or mathematics), the citizen scientists, together with the coordination team, university students, and specialists, form different commissions in charge of specific co-creative tasks aligned with the specific objectives.
