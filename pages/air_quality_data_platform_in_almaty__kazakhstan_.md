## Title

Air quality data platform in Almaty (Kazakhstan)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that Almaty is one of the most polluted megacities in Kazakhstan. The COVID-19 crisis has severely hit the city. The air quality is not within acceptable levels, which exacerbates the health crisis at the time of the pandemic. The average annual PM2.5 concentration in Almaty was 53 μg/m3 in 2018 and PM 10 = 74 (average 2019) exceeding the WHO yearly limit by 5.3 times and 4.1 times, respectively.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In winter, concentration levels of pollutants are several times higher than concentration levels in the summer. This could be explained by intensive coal combustion at power plants, domestic boilers and furnaces, and auto transport that does not meet ecological standards (cars with high emissions). Epidemiological studies show a high prevalence of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Almaty, which correlates to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, air pollution in the city leads to increased mortality, morbidity, with an extended increment in cost and expenses for healthcare services.  The main government entity responsible for air quality efforts is the department of green economy, Almaty Akimat (=municipality). Whereas they are aware of the dismal situation in Almaty, the akimat lacks capacity (people) and capabilities (skills) to fully address the issue. What's more important, the akimat does not have the trust of the wider community which makes it challenging to engage people. Almaty's eco-activists have been vocal about the worsening air quality calling for the government's action through petitions and small-scale environmental events (recycling, cleaning days, educating the public). Startups emerged as well that address overall ecological situaiton in the city attracting companies to be more 'green' as a part of the corporate identity. These actions are positive, however, they do not happen in coordination leading to very low impact. The barriers are: 1) lack of trust among all stakeholders 2) Limited usage of new financial instruments (green bonds, loans, gov't subsidies) 3) lack of reliable real time air quality data.

-“The main problem in Almaty is ecological illiteracy and indifference. It is time to become a civic activists. The situation is dire because among our population there is a common belief of the issue is "not in my backyard". Evgeniy Myzhamedzhanov, ECO Network, YouTube video.  "Our problem is that there is no real picture and clear understanding of ecological situation in Almaty. The data we have differs based on the source. We acknowledge that Kazgidromet [official gov't data source for air quality] provides data once a month without analytics which does not allow for any analysis by akimat or other partners. Even though we try to address the issue, it is tough due to the general low trust among the public - people think that we manipulate data for our benefit. The solution that we see is to establish an analytical data center with dashboards on all ecological issues (air, water, waste, soil, GHG)." Adapted from the field interview with Natalia Livinskaya, Head of Green Economy department, July 3.  “I grew up in this city – it has always been associated as a green warm city, but now the number of parks is 7 times less that WHO recommendations; air quality is linked with the greenery of the city. What local municipality is doing is not enough (Madina Yelikbayeva, blogger, YouTube video  “I moved back to Uralsk because of smog – there is no air to breathe in Almaty” (high-rated comment under the YouTube video about polluted Almaty air) -Distrust to government promises of moving the heating station to gas by 2025 as it is unrealistic (Vadim Boreiko, Facebook post).  “Government accepts the problem, but no real action. This question is not prioritized.” ‘Air’ documentary by Khabar “As the resident of this city, I think that you need a political will to solve this important ecological problem.” (Vlast) -Petition (Google Docs) with 31,000 signatures printed and sent to Almaty mayor with “demands that the Almaty akimat recognize the catastrophic air pollution” (Adamdar, ENG).  Flash mob “Smog kills” – Almaty residents share the photos of air to bring attention to the problem

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

UNDP Kazakhstan Accelerator Lab is working with local Almaty stakeholders to create an EcoData Center that collects, analyzes and visualizes air quality data. The team gathers actors whose data complement each other with the help of edge computing, neural networks, and remote sensing.  EcoData Center uses the latest technology to retrieve data from satellite images, sensors, and transport streams.  This will be a new platform for bringing together governments, the private sector, international organizations and citizens to tackle air pollution. The data center provides citizens with the opportunity to playfully exchange ideas and recommendations for improving Kazakhstan's air quality and  overall ecological conditions. Access to real-time data and crowdsourced ideas from the general public is used in decision making and  air quality policy.   UNDP Accelerator Lab team in Kazakhstan is leading this work with international partners inside and outside UNDP. The aim is to bring together data, digital solutions and innovative financing methods and adapt to local conditions to improve Almaty's air quality. UNDP Kazakhstan is already cooperating with the Almaty municipality in both  the digital and green economies. As a result of this three-year project, UNDP Kazakhstan will develop lessons on leveraging data innovation for the public good in the field of air quality. In the future, the team hopes to expand its eco-data center to other major cities in Kazakhstan.  UNDP Kazakhstan is committed to building resilience to the economic and social challenges arising from climate change and anthropogenic activity. The fight against air pollution will contribute to UNDP Kazakhstan's ongoing efforts  to promote low-carbon urban development.
