> Title of the innovation

Good health and well being. We need good health for everyone to be well such that whenever someone is sick the medicine should be found in the hospitals or clinics cause most of the times in clinics they lack medicine to give the patients and without medicine we can't survive, I'm appealing that the health ministry should do something about this

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is about the medicine that normally not found in the clinics and hospitals, everyone needs good health and well being, everyone needs to live longer, so many people die due the same issue of lacking medicine in the hospital, there are so many people who can't afford to buy medicine when given a note on the medicine that should be bought, they try by all means to find money but they can't due to this economic issue, things are expensive things get expensive each and every single day, that's why a lot of people die not because they are not taken care of but due to lack of medicine in clinics and hospitals, as you can see from the picture about that is uploaded I was given a note to go and buy medicine in the chemists were I found one tablet of Panadol is K2, we can't manage to buy Panadol while this painkiller is given from the hospital.
    The government should put more effort in providing medicine in all the hospitals and clinics to save lives of others sick in beds

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The government should be aware of this, people in markets are complaining about business, things are not going on the way they should be, some needs empowerment from the government, people can't survive without eating without good health and well being everyone needs good health, some of teens need Job some are jobless but only if the government looks after this everything can be possible and easy, we need everyone to live a happy life with their families.
  Working hard is also another solution for everyone's living, there people who are keeping disabled people who can't do anything people who does nothing for living, but if only our new government looks after these people no one will be suffering in this country

> Technical Feasibility

The government should be aware of this, people in markets are complaining about business, things are not going on the way they should be, some needs empowerment from the government, people can't survive without eating without good health and well being everyone needs good health, some of teens need Job some are jobless but only if the government looks after this everything can be possible and easy, we need everyone to live a happy life with their families.
  Working hard is also another solution for everyone's living, there people who are keeping disabled people who can't do anything people who does nothing for living, but if only our new government looks after these people no one will be suffering in this country

> Anticipated Social Impact

The government must come into power work on every project people are complaining about
