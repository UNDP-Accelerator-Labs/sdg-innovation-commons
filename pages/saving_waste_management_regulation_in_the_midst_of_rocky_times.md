## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



1. The “Transition Plan” began as a seed finding solutions to accelerate Waste Management with local governments with the Ministry of Environment & Natural Resources (MARN). However not everyone joined this bet on how it could be a key solution to escalate across t the main polluted river in Guatemala. From starting from 2 pilots on the Transition Plan, as Acc Lab, we expanded into 4 more municipalities, after 3 months into 17 and with a lot of effort from Solutions Mapping team, we covered 38 municipalities. With the involvement of a GEF funded project within UNDP and MARN, we got help in the finance another 16 workshops, reaching 92 municipalities, including 82 within the Motagua River Basin, the largest watershed across the country.

2. The process was conducted under the National Regulation for Waste Management (AG 164-2021), which had a major deadline to comply waste classification by August 2023. When some detractors and media came to the Ministry of Environment, to claim the Regulations withdraw, the Transition Plan Approach was the crucial element to sustain how the Ministry of Environment was taking into account the local governments, and the efforts to work together with them to accelerate a waste management transition.

3. Although the AG 164-2021 was launched 2 years ago, by August 2023, public officers were put on the spot on how the Ministry included minorities; one of the crucial pieces to defend "Rule of Law" was the approach to the informal sector in the waste management, which from the Acc Lab we had reached 2 years ago, together with Academia and citizens. Later on, officials from the Ministry came on board, which allowed us to demonstrate that a bottom-up line, brings a comprehensive way of understanding and tackling waste management, without compromising the Regulation. 

 4. Sometimes our “qualitative approaches” are undermined in a digital and techy era by many actors around our challenge. Today after 10 months of intensive hard-work, the human-centered strategy has been the cornerstone in which the Ministry of Environment and many municipalities had relied on during political rocky times.

5. Although as Acc Lab we have successfully transferred knowledge, methodologies, built products of knowledge, solutions escalated, still there are other actors with a limited understanding of sustainability and why poor waste management is costing us health problems and critical environmental contamination. Unfortunately, these actors are noisy, tempting the Rule of Law on environmental minimum practices as well as neglecting the responsibility we all have on waste management. Recently, they raised noise, chaos and misinformation. Yet we need to come up with stronger solutions that involve misinformation on the political level that can threat the efforts conducted by the ecosystems we have built on sustainable waste management. 

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)


- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country
- Our private sector partners have expanded our joint work through their own resources in our country or internationally
- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



When a co-creative process includes from the beginning counterparts such as public officers either from central or local government, informal sector, citizens, and Academia, a genuinely engagement and appropriation from the methodologies happens, opening to a fully transfer of capacities.

Key steps were:

1. Running pilots and demonstrate how "in real-time" participatory workshops based on agile strategy can co-create a plan from each municipality towards waste management. 

2. Transferring knowledge on the usage of soft skills to public officers from the Ministry of Environment, who rule over the municipal technical offices was key, due to the history of tensions between municipalities and the Ministry. Sanctions-based narrative was the standardized way to deal with local governments. Instead, we switched the narrative to a "how can I help you?" to manage waste in your local territory?

3. Although we did not conduct a strict Design Thinking nor Strategic Plan approach, we combined elements to co-create an agile route with the topics and requirements, in layouts and methodology itself to identify activities, roles, deadlines within 3 waste management strategic pillars for each municipality. 

4. From Solutions Mapping we standardized the methodology into a guideline including layouts for each stay as part of a toolkit shared via QR for digital open access with other support guidelines from the Ministry of Environment as well as the Presidential Commission for Municipal Affairs. The toolkit has been shared in further workshops both Institutions are running in other territories.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



With the 80% of the Transition Plans we were able to actually build the first database on how municipalities were running the handling of domiciliary waste along the rural territories covered with the Acc Lab and Ministry of Environment workshops. Surprisingly, there were no databases on that information. 

Even though the process involved and early stage of how to collect and build information as a baseline, this begins to the key element if we want to measure the shifts taken by each municipality on waste management. 

With this data we can also identify the number of smaller municipalities that do not have any plot, site as landfill, identifying opportunities to work in commonwealth systems between 2 or more municipalities.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



At UNDP we talk about strengthening capacities and institutions, and automatically one tends to consider technical capacities oriented towards processes, regulations, infrastructure, or even digitalization. However, most of the time, we forget about the importance of cultivating soft skills; these tools that begins with each person, help out to break barriers and overcome a sense of defeatism in the face of complex challenges. 

Soft skills have allowed us to open the doors to new narratives in the relationship between central public institutions and local governments and communities. In addition, it has allowed the public officers that have been involved along these processes to discover themselves what are the dynamics of the informal sector operating in waste management without any public institution orchestrating their roles and actions. Without them the amount of waste to be treated, processed and disposed would have been a 30% more, in addition to the costs that all these services require from municipalities to step in. 

We as Accelerator Labs aim for behavioral change, however in a realm where political fragility is around the corner, the struggle for power by institutions persists, and the lack of comprehensive and participatory planning, does not allow for any behavioral change from anyone. If we start focusing how can a single person, a single officer, waste collector, decision maker or even citizen, we will begin to cultivate change from the understanding and empathy to others. 
## Partners

> Please indicate what partners you have actually worked with for this learning challenge. 



<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the partner:



92 municipalities across the Motagua River Watershed and the "Verapaces" which is the indigenous - rainforest territory. 


</div>



<div class="group">


> What sector does your partner belong to?

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the partnership.



Except for 3 municipalities, the rest of the 92 municipalities are in rural areas, 82 across the River Motagua Watershed and 10 others in the rainforest mountainous interior of the country, where 95% of the population is indigenous. Most of the municipalities are facing problems to strength their financial capacities, which places environmental actions in a secondary plane. Most of these municipalities had a limited relationship with the Ministry of Environment, however with the Transitions Plans, we broke the barriers, creating new spaces of collaboration.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?



"The test of time will prove everything" (Uche Onyinyechi Richard). As said before, our processes began as a seed, betting on innovating the way of planning and accelerating together with local technicians. Many people thought that they were traditional meetings or simple workshops, but by placing the technician who faces the day-to-day challenges and with many limitations of each of these 92 municipalities, the focus changed, generating appropriation of the tools as well as outcomes from the knowledge exchange with the facilitators trained from the Ministry of Environment. 

After many hours away from home, going from one territory to another, training the trainer, facilitating, systematizing information, we can gladly say we succeeded providing backbone outcomes when a national regulation went under fire and institutions were questioned about their approaches with minorities and addressing rural territories. Together we have effectively passed the test of time, proving why the tools and methodologies are contributing to a sustainable and health country. 

Perhaps we can say that these processes were also part of a collective intelligence, and although the data arrived very late from other sources, the Transition Plan process generated databases and hand-to-hand knowledge of what is happening in rural territories with their limitations and daily challenges on environmental management.
