## Title

Biowaste as an entry point for private sector engagement  
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to engage with the private sector in supporting the UNDP North Macedonia and Acceleration Labs agenda to transform bio-waste into viable products that will reduce the bio-waste on Landfields, in the medium to long term, as well as design skills for future high paying jobs. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The challenge is a continuation of our previous learning cycle where we were pursuing system transformation within the City of Skopje. What we explored in that learning circle was that biowaste is an entry point where we can make a system transformation on a city level.  Among the key learning points was that the transformative power of bio-waste in North Macedonia has not been explored in depth by the business community, the civil society sector nor the national institutions. Furthermore, we tested the nexus between academia and the private sector on a small scale and one of our conclusions was that that link is weak and especially fragile when it comes to transfer of knowledge. Moreover, the Faculty for Technology and Metallurgy is the second in the country by research papers in scientific magazines with impact factor, but few of those scientific methods have been used by local industry so far and little impact has been made.

The Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning (MoEPP) is revising the Macedonian Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), supported by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNDP) Climate Promise Initiative (UNFCCC, 2015). Furthermore, According to the annual data of the State Statistical Office (SSO), the total quantity of generated solid communal waste in North Macedonia in 2020 was 913,033t, out of which the total quantity of collected communal waste in the country was 630,086t. For the remaining quantity of 282,947t there is no evidence on its endpoint. The biggest quantity of collected communal waste in 2020 was in the Skopje Planning Region (170,660t) or 27.1% of the total collected communal waste in the country. This is not only due to the highest population number in the Skopje Planning Region, but also due to the fact that this region has the largest coverage with the waste collection public service. The Annual amount of generated communal waste per capita in 2020 was 452kg. Based on the overall available data from the SSO and official waste planning documents, it may be concluded that in 2020 around 40% of the total collected communal waste, or 252,034t was biodegradable waste which ended up in landfills throughout the country. Our activities are in line with  the goals of the National Waste Management Plan (2020) to divert the bio-waste from current landfill disposal into a more useful, reusing and recycling activities, mainly biowaste transformation.

Our previous research has shown that the absence of linkages between the bio-waste processing companies, and the bio-waste by-products treatment facility is one of the main criteria for choosing alternative valorization pathways. Macedonia is a small and open economy which is dependent on imports when it comes to production of final food products. The same goes to the consumption of products that come from bio-waste materials. However, regardless of the short age of materials, there is still significant potential in using the bio-waste which is created throughout the industry to create valuable and wanted final products, that at the end can be used by the very same industry

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Biowaste transformation as a entry point for collaboration between private sector, academy and UNDP on accelerating the SDGs was introduced to the UNDP CO office in North Macedonia by the AccLab team through the City Experiment Fund. Teamed up with the Inclusive prosperity unit  we explored where we can test the methodology, and apply the learning on biowaste transformation that we have generated in previous learning circles;

The center working within the Ministry is responsible for the creation of occupational standards. Our goal is to partner with them in order to create an occupation title "bio-waste technician", for which hopefully in the future we can create a learning curriculum.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can biowaste be our entry point for collaboration with the private sector in achiving the SDGs? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We want to explore if by having such workshops with the private sector and using our core expertise in the area motivate companies to start transforming their bio-waste into viable products.  An ideal way forward will be that some of the companies get an idea what type of biowaste then can transform and we show them how. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are missing data on how the state agencies are collecting data from the private sector on how much bio-waste they produce.  
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Early leads in the whole process are supermarket chains in the country that create a lot of biowastes but don't know what to do with it. We envision having one supermarket that will transform the biowaste it creates into a biohacking lab as part of its premises. Furthermore, we expect to create a new classification for work positions in the Katastar of the agency of employment - biotransformation specialist.
