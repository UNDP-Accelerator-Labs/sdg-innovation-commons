> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

to use dialogue with women on understanding triggers for behavior change when it comes to cooking and recipe choices 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we changed women behavior in cooking decisions we can alter the eating behavior of the household

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Design an engaging dialogue with a big women cooking community on FB and analyze engagement, sentiment, and content for insights.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

social media engagement activity

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Social media analysis

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 month

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

time allocation from the team
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

disproven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

I would expand it to more social classes 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

one month

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

5000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Not at the moment.  However, from the full portfolio, we are building a new offering for the CO on transformation of agri-food system (production-market-consumption).
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We were able to identify five main triggers that can have direct influence on food consumption decisions within the household: 1.     The strongest motive to meal choices and diversification is family acceptance. The experiment initially targeted women since they are the main caretakers in the household in Egyptian culture. They are in charge of food intake for the family and hold the purse strings when it comes to food purchase. However, their meal decisions are found to be extremely influenced by husbands and kids' resistance to change. Nudging should hence target the whole family eating behavior not only women choices.   2.     The second most repeated trigger was accessibility of ingredients in the house. The decision of what to cook today mostly starts with “shopping your pantry”, that is checking what’s already available in the kitchen. To consume more climate resilient ingredients in our recipes we might need to start nudging early on at the supermarket, influence the shopping list or purchasing behavior.   3.     Third trigger was fit to easy recipe with clear ingredients and steps. Partial introduction into simple dishes came strongly as a suggestion with much of recipes ideas was leaning towards salads, appetizers, and soups.   4.     Fourth determinant is price of ingredients, specially concerns associated with seasonality. Here questions and reflections on local production dominated the conversation, as it can highly affect price and accessibility. This links directly to the idea of system change: shifting to climate resilient consumption must come hand in hand with affordability, change in national agriculture production pattern and food market update.   5.     Finally, healthy replacements were very appealing but conditional to previous triggers.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

women initial awareness on climate change and its implications

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Biodiversity portfolio as it can expand in a new territory (agri-food diversity) specially with the recent risks of food security with Ukraine crisis

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

agriculture, food, and trade authorities 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We did couple of iterations on type of content used with the audience to drive more engagement

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Integrate automated social media listening tools and advanced analysis to save time

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes the use of social media analysis for behavioral insights can be mainstreamed across many areas since it provide timely and expansive access to data.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

we relied on solution mapping but needed more collaboration with exploration

> What surprised you?

women engagement with climate action
