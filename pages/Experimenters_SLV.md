# El Salvador's Innovative Public Internet Initiative: Scaling Up Sustainable Development

### [[0:03]] And if I could have you tell me your name, your title, and then say I consent to this recording\.

All right, My name is Victor Tablas\. I'm head of experimentation at the UNDP at club in El Salvador\. And of course, I do consent to the interview and recording\.

### [[0:24]] All right, let's start off\.

### [[0:33]] Could you tell me about an R&D activity you would like to share?

[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
Of course, a few months back we had the chance to have a a public Internet connection in a big public space in in El Salvador\. It was an investment produced by another project\. It was not a ACLAB funds\. So it was about $40,000 to have this massive public space connected to the Internet for a year\. And when the, when the contract was generated with the public institution and the provider, it stated there somewhere that the UNDP AC lab will work on a learning cycle\. So it was quite an opportunity to to, to understand more about public Internet connectivity\. And The thing is that if you look at the literature where it has evolved so much, if you take a look at a paper that published on the 2000, for example, it's a so many great things that will happen about the Internet\. It will say it, but it hadn't been proven\. It was just theoretical\. And then you move a little bit forward and you have some little evidence about certain topics, mostly about security of using a public Wi\-Fi\. So it was very interesting in what the people of the, of the public institution would, which was the Institute of Tourism in El Salvador was expecting, is that by deploying free Internet that will bring more visitors to the park\. And even though it's a, it's a public space, they generate income to sustain these public spaces by having more and more visitors to the public space\. Aside from that, we have been working within the park with some micro and small businesses, enhancing their capabilities and understanding of digital tools\. And this happened after the pandemic, right? So people in the touristic sector was hit the hardest because the tourists weren't coming in\. They were unable to work from home and all that\. So this was a very unique opportunity to to test in a small scale, let's say a, a public service\. So that was a research and development of a public product and what it meant to have that public product being deployed\. So what we did is that we gathered some information from these people that have businesses in the public space, and we also gathered information from people visiting the public space\. I mean, this is a public space that has been available to the public since the 1950s\. All right, So what did it mean now to have free access to the Internet? So we built a portfolio of experiments about will this bring more people, more visitors to the public space?Will this generate more income to the to the to the owners of small businesses? Will tourists find this like as an interesting feature for coming to the public space? And we had around 10 relevant hypothesis to answer throughout this portfolio of experiments\.

### [[4:46]] Great understanding the context of this\. Let's talk about the development issue which you've touched on a bit\. What was the development issue that you were addressing? What did the situation look like?

[[skills:Digital skills]]
[[skills:Information management]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[tools:Facilitation skills]]
OK, So people have been, I mean talking about a micro and small business owners, they have been trained on how to use tools to to undertake digital marketing, to contact providers, to undertake for example digital payments, to receive digital payment\. But what happens especially in developing countries is that Internet connection is super expensive\. So you have to pay so much for getting 1 gigabyte of Internet, but it becomes somewhat a burden, right? It's very, very expensive\. So people are saying like, yeah, this is fascinating\. I like to have apos\. I like to Polish my things on the social media\. But it gets super expensive to have a permanent dedicated Internet connection\. So they were saying what we would like to see in the future is that we have access to to to public Internet\. So they did have the tools because they were given a cell phone, a smartphone too\. They were given an 8 week training on how to use these tools but they were somehow being still left behind in terms of not having access to to Internet\.

### [[6:41]] Great\. Who was involved in your journey? What was their role and were they, were they diverse stakeholders?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Beyond borders]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
Of course, the Institute of Tourism was involved and was very excited about having the opportunity to Polish space, being connected as a as a, as a little test\. The Ministry of Tourism that's above was also very excited to have this\. Of course there, there was a private sector company that was providing the service, which is a large company across Latin America, Telefonica in the, in El Salvadoritz, Diego, Let's see who else people working directly in the park like, I don't, I don't know how to say this, but the people who overseas the functioning of, of the park, of that specific park\. And of course my colleagues at the UNDPAC lab, how did they help shape the R&D journey? Well, it starts from the solutions mapping\. When you identify what people feel about this, this opportunity or this challenge\. It also goes through having data about what it means to have this challenge\. And we had a baseline and we have an end line\. And we were also able to use exploration by getting real data because what was also special about this Internet connection is that it had a smart layer\. So it was not only the access to the to the Internet, but you could also see how many people were using it, at what time they were using it, if they were coming back to use to use the network from which country\. And all this data was super interesting to to understand a little bit more about a public connectivity\. And afterwards once we had all this information, we had several hypothesis, several hypothesis even more than what we tested\. So that's how we built the R&D\. And the final stage is that afterwards there was coming loan from the International Development Bank, an $80 million loan for the country to conduct a public, I'd say I can remember a social connectivity program which involved connecting all these public spaces, schools and hospitals\. So we were pioneering that\. We had insights before the, the, the, the, this loan, this huge loan was coming into place\.

### [[10:16]] That's great\. That's amazing\. What was the outcome of your R&D journey? How did or will your work impact sustainable development?

[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[tactics:Proof of concept]]
Well, the outcome is that we were able to inform the, the national authorities, the Institute of Tourism of what it meant to have public connectivity\. We have this belief that if you provide the Internet, people will come\. And what we found out throughout the experiments is that that's not true\. In 2023\. It wasn't true anymore\. Maybe it was true somewhere in the in the 2000, 2010, but at least in 2023 we were able to prove that that was in the case\. And these public actors were the ones that were talking to the International Development Bank about the needs of this loan\. So they told us that the insights we have provided were super useful\. And actually I want to also mention that we were kind of afraid because it's the Institute of Tourism\. And what they want to hear is it worked\. Installed public Internet everywhere, people are going to come\. And the result was no, people are not going to drive this far just to get online\. And they were like, OK, all right\. But we found other things\. We found that throughout some some other experiments that for example, we had a control group and a treatment group\. And to the treatment group of customers, we provided some Flyers saying, hey, Balboa Park has now access to public Internet and you can do this and this other thing\. And the control condition, the control group, they were not given anything\. And data was taken from both, both groups by having observations\. And what we discovered is that people who were given the flyer were much more likely to recommend the public space\. And also people that were given the customers that were given the flyer, they were more likely\. No, they were not more likely\. They stayed in average 16 more minutes in the business\. So that's an opportunity for increasing consumption\. But it but it didn't just by itself it didn't\. Maybe people stay there making a phone call, downloading something, but but by itself it didn't\.  
So what it meant is that you need to push on not only delivering the public service, the Internet, but also in creating capabilities so that people, owners of small businesses can take advantage of that infrastructure\.

### [[13:50]] One last question, and if you could keep it super short, what was how, how would you see this sort of work being embedded in the country office? What were your successes in, you know, in being embedded into broader UNTP?

[[tools:Citizen science]]
[[tools:Citizen science and gamification using digital platform to crowdsource solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
All right, so after after the pandemic everything was about digital and the rest of the UN agencies were also interested UNICEF of well all of them\. And by having these experiences that were like small investments which results in a very short time put NDP as the as the lead of the digital and development connection\. And right now UNDP else have our leads, the digital cluster in the country among UN agencies and that was that added up to what we have before that we had conducted the digital readiness assessment\. So the I think the government looks to UNDP just by having in terms of digitalization, it looks to UNDP just by having these resources and there they recognize that if somebody can help it's UNDP\.

### [[15:34]] That's great\. Thank you\. That's great\.
