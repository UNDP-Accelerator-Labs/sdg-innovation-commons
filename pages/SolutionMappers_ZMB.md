Thank you\. My name is Salome Nakazwe, I'm head of solutions mapping UNDP in the Zambia country office\. My research and development journey experience I had was during a COVID time when the country was, I should say under lockdown and most of the communities were facing challenges, especially those that are in the informal sector\. So one of the identified communities that the country office took interest in was informal cross\-border traders and a study was initiated and I had the privilege to join that mission, which went to three border towns in Conde, a border with Tanzania, in Kasumba Lesa, a border with Congo DRC, and in Livingston, bordering with Zimbabwe\. So the mission team consisted of myself as head of solutions mapping, the deputy resident representative, representatives from UNCDF and a few other staff from the program units\. And when we went to these communities, one of the interesting points that came out was the grave impact of COVID on the trading communities which had seen most of the towns actually become dead, so to speak, in terms of their economic performance\. Most of the traders faced challenges as they could not now cross the borders to do their business\. And the key critical points that they faced was the issue of the requirement of COVID certification\. So this made it very difficult for them to change in businesses because most of the products were buying were small products which they could just sell within the towns of where they were living\. And the other aspect was that most of them were forced out of business\. And the key challenges highlighted was that they could not go across the border\. And some of them started just changing the type of businesses that they could trade in\. They couldn't go into the normal trading businesses that they were engaged in\. So when we went back into the office, one of the key aspects that came to my mind was the challenge was which was highlighted around the saving groups that the small communities had as small businesses\. And the village saving model is what actually helped most of the small businesses kind of bounce back into business\. But because of the COVID situation, the village saving groups were also not operating and they were not meeting\. So this kind of cut the access to the finances that the small businesses would have to ensure that they recapitalize their businesses\. And then the other challenge was that they could not access the formal banking sector because the formal banking sector was looking at them having a credit history before they could give them loans\. So most of them were kind of like stuck on where to go to get some finances to recapitalize their businesses\. So in the previous experiences as the accelerator lab, we had been running a national innovation initiative and identified quite a number of solutions\. So one of the solutions that we had identified was a solution on digitizing how village saving models are operated\. And I saw this as a very good opportunity to give to those informal groups so that they could actually continue meeting without having to meet physically using the digital solution that was being provided\. So with the opportunity that we had to access finances through the Africa Borderlands Centre, we went to the community in Livingston\. And with that community, we sold the idea of the saving groups reconstituting themselves, but reconstituting themselves to operate their model using a digital platform\. And this was an exciting opportunity because all of them were having challenges to still continue meeting and some of them had fallen out because they didn't have money to continue with their businesses\. So when we proposed the idea of them having a digital platform as a lending opportunity, as a lending platform where they could keep records of how their money was being distributed, how their records were being managed, and also use mobile money network as a way of depositing their money, it made it very possible for them to continue meeting even with the restrictions that Kovid created\. And then also when we looked at this as a solution for the informal cross\-border traders, we didn't go with any funds to give them because we didn't want them to come from a point where they would look at UNDP as a source of funding\. But we presented it to them as a business preposition because the innovator who had created this platform wanted to operate it as a business\. And we were using the opportunity that we had to link that innovation to the community that actually needed the solution to help them to continue running their businesses\. But we also appreciated the fact that the space in which the small businesses were operating had other actors as well\. For instance, there was the local government who were operating the markets where the traders were doing their businesses\. We had the immigration department, the customs department from the government offices and we also had other people from the private sectors that were supporting the informal business sector\. So we thought that it would be a good idea to encourage the adoption of the app by ensuring that all the stakeholders were involved\. So we approached them tactically in terms of appreciating the challenges that the town as a border town was facing\. And the government were also quite conscious of the impact of the small informal traders not doing their businesses and it's negative impact on the overall economy of the town\. So they were ready to support and come on board to try a solution that was going to ensure that the small traders continue doing businesses\. So we use them as a convening body in terms of engaging the other stakeholders within the town so that they formed what we called a steering committee\. And the idea of the steering committee was to try to provide oversight as we were piloting the innovation because we knew that this was something that was new\. Most of the informal cross\-border traders were not people who worked with digital tools or with digital platforms\. So it was something that was completely new and in a small way was going to revolute the way that they did their business\. So we wanted to make sure that in terms of the actors, particularly those from government, they were there to kind of provide the support but also to provide the oversight that would ensure that there was smooth running of the businesses that the smoke traders were going to be engaging in as they recovered from the impact of COVID\. So the steering committee became a very good platform to ensure that we had government support as well as the government provision in terms of especially those crossing the borders providing that particular kind of support\. Then within the cross\-border traders also they are constituted as an association which is called cross\-border Traders Association\. So they have offices at district level and at national level\. So we engaged the national level cross\-border association with the concept and the idea and they were for the idea to actually see if we could pilot it in one of their towns and see if it's something that could be scaled up in the other areas\. So when we engaged them and then went down to the district, we also had that positive reaction from them in terms of participating in the in the in the pilot\. But what we particularly wanted was that the individual traders who came and participated in the pilot should do so willingly\. They should not be coerced into participating in the pilot and they should demonstrate that they had a smartphone because this is one of the tools that was required for them to be able to to engage in the in the direct servers app model\. So we identified about 85 of them and almost 90% of them were women traders who actually make up most of the informal cross\-border traders\. So with the 85 that we constituted, we asked them to self select into smaller groups, which were going to be the saving groups\. So five groups were created and these five groups, most of them constituted themselves according to the products that they were mostly dealing with, like those who sold blankets from their own groups and those who sold these other products also formed their own groups\. So the five saving groups were now trained on the use of digital platform, that is the VH Savers model, as well as how to navigate around the digital platform\. So two trainings were done and when they were trained, the capacity that was built in them was what we relied on to ensure that they were able to continue engaging in the saving model using now the app\. And the beauty the app introduced was that it improved their record keeping\. It also improved accountability and transparency because now each person had access to their saving records\. They would easily just go on the app and get the information and they knew how much they had saved and how much interest they had earned and how much they were going to get at the end of the cycle\. So this was different from a traditional village saving model where people didn't know how much they were saving, if either money was even there\. And sometimes they would get reports of the money being stolen\. So all these negative aspects were removed when they started operating on the digital platform\. And then we also introduced an external person, a consultant to be there to ensure that they monitored how the process was going\. So we did a baseline study and then an end line study and introduced an online matrix where the record and the performance of the groups were being monitored just to see how and if any challenges were being faced on how they were making progress on their saving models and be on hand to support\. Particularly for the innovator, it was a very good learning opportunity for him to test his innovation as well as get feedback from the from the participants on what they needed to do and what he needed to do to improve how the model was being run\. So the results that came out from that particular model was that it actually improved the saving of the groups\. Their income levels went up and most of them now were able to go back to the type of business that they were initially doing before COVID hit\. And this is something that also encouraged them to build their confidence on how they operated on digital platform to an extent that now they were positioned to be able to transact digitally when it came to how they bought their products\. So these were very good results that came out from there\.

### [[11:20]] OK, thank you\. Salome, you've talked about your results in terms of the experiment\. Please tell me more about the learnings you had as well as how you facilitated, if at all, the diffusion of this solution as well as the scaling or catalyzation of the solution\. But also tell me a bit about any skills, if at all, that you had to develop in order for you to be able to implement this experiment successfully?

Thank you\. So in terms of the learning that we got, I think the big learning was the need for us to continue building capacities of the informal traders on the use of digital platform because this was a very good solution in terms of how they run their businesses\. And the other thing in terms of diffusion, we had formed a steering committee where we had all the key partners on board from the web go\. So the opportunity of passing on the adoption of the skill to the government was already easy because they were also working the process with us\. And then at the same time also we used that platform to also invite private sector, like for example, we invited a bank to come and learn from what impact that app was creating\. And when they saw the way the app was working, they actually indicated that it's actually a good system that they could adopt in when it comes to infusing the traders into the banking services and getting them to receive opportunities or getting loans from the bank, which was not the case before that\. So that was a very good opportunity that was created by that\. And then in terms of the skills, I think mostly it was the data analytic skills that was required\. And we engaged, for instance, the innovator himself had the skill, but we also engaged an outsider like the consultant we've talked about to be there on hand to ensure that they were able to monitor and provide the Technical Support that was required in terms of validating what was happening with the use of the app\. So the opportunity of engaging the other networks was very good in terms of bringing that skill on board\.

### [[13:34]] OK, thank you\. Just a last one\. Did you at any point during the experiment have to change the way that you had planned to do things or had to change any methods that you had initially planned to use? Did you find yourself needing to do that?

[[tactics:Proof of concept]]
[[tactics:Play do not preach]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Trust]]
We actually changed the methods in terms of earlier on we had said the participants in the experiment should have smartphones as a criteria for them to actually go through the process\. But we eventually discovered that in families, a smartphone is owned by the whole family\. So then if like for instance, a female trader is participating in the experiment and had financial records on the phone, the financial records were being exposed in the family\. So we saw the need that it may actually need to be revisited in terms of how we view the ownership of the phone and encourage the traders themselves to have a phone that was personal, which they would actually keep as private information\. Because as it was, the information and the record was openly going to be exposed within other people who could see the record\.

### [[14:39]] All right, thank you so much, Salome\.

Thank you\.
