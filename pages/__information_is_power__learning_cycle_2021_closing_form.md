## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- (1) "El Viaje del Agua" (Micro survey and collective intelligence exercise): The experimental session covered the water crisis from three angles: a) social, b) environmental and c) economic. An interactive survey was conducted online to reveal the biggest concerns in each area, to afterwards be used as guiding principles for communication campaigns to nudge on a better usage of hydric resources. In terms of social issues, people are most concerned about imagining a future without regular access to water (89%), in environmental matters, what people are most concerned about is thinking about a future with polluted oceans (70%), while in terms of economic issues, imagining a future where water is much more expensive due to scarcity would be a main concern. (2) Likewise, the interactive survey revealed that people in the communities are interested in being active participants in their hydric resources management process. Among the actions they are willing to carry out, the following can be listed: 1. Invest in environmental services, 2. Organize days to clean up water sources, and 3. Become members in community groups that deal with water issues.  ; (3) Sea and river water quality measurements: The key insight on this activity is that all potential government partners consider that measuring the quality of river and sea quality is important, none of them have a legal mandate to do so. UNDP can play a key role in articulating such efforts and mobilizing resources to establish a national protocol for measuring river and sea quality on a regular basis. Additionally, we consider that Citizen Science can play a key role in monitoring the quality of rivers and oceans, as demonstrated by our colleagues in Argentina with their citizen science experiment around air quality;  (4) Community Profiling and Solutions Mapping: +64 % of participating households purchase water as their main source of obtaining drinking water.  This insight is currently being used by a new UNDP project focusing on green microenterprises to foster community cohesion in the coastal area of Surf City;  (5) Additionally, by using a wiki-style online repository (Appropedia) to document grassroots innovations and community profiles, we discovered that this has tremendous scaling potential as an approach to generate relevant information about communities that can be enriched, updated and verified by multiple stakeholders, avoiding community fatigue due to repeated participation in consultations from NGOs, and local governments. The local government of La Libertad is considering using this approach to replace/complement a more expensive census.

N/A

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Our main government partner's agency for the learning cycle (Presidential Water Commission) was disbanded and the governance of water-related issues is not clearly defined in the current legislation, which additionally, was being revised at the time, generating a complicated political climate around the issue ; There were no UNDP projects actively working with water-related issues which made working on this issue a lot harder.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

El Salvador does not currently have national standards for measuring river and sea water quality. Therefore, the Lab researched other countries' standards and created an ad-hoc protocol for testing sea water quality, specifically. In order to make sense of the results, the Lab created an interactive story map, utilizing spatial data and visual mapping techniques.  For the Community Solutions Mapping exercise, the Lab partnered with a local NGO to carry out social cartography exercises, focus groups, informal conversations and in-depth interviews to generate quantitative and qualitative insights around community perceptions and recurring practices around water and livelihoods. Additionally, in a separate exercise to sense different demographic groups' perceptions around water and livelihoods, the Lab carried out online sessions using Zoom and (prior informed consent) analyzed the automatically-generated script using Google Speech to Text and word cloud analysis, in addition to qualitative interpretation.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Our challenge is that information around the different dimensions of water in El Salvador is hard to access and eminently technical. This creates and entry barrier for people to understand its complexities and engage in action. Additionally, it was important to retrieve communities' perceptions and identify recurring behavior patterns when facing issues around water access and livelihoods. These tools helped us approach the system in a different way than many water-related development projects, focusing on the role of information asymmetries in different dimensions of the water cycle (governance, market dynamics, community access to water, scientific data around water quality, and more). 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with a globally recognized NGO (TECHO) to develop an integrated Community Profiling and Solutions Mapping methodology.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with the Higher Education School of Business (ESEN) to test our Accelerator's kit through the Introduction to Innovation course, taught by our Head of Solutions Mapping. The courses' final project was a Solutions Mapping exercise to identify existing grassroots innovations around water and livelihoods and design new business models using such open-source solutions.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with a private data analytics firm (AS Analytics) to codesign an experimental session through an interactive survey and micronarrative inspired by the hero's journey methodology to identify problems and relevant calls to action for different audiences, as well as a Collective Intelligence activity to collect qualitative insights from different demographics around water and livelihoods by collecting stories and memories that were interpreted through illustrated characters. Speech to text tools were also used to analyze participant's perspectives on the subject matter. Also, we worked with a geospatial technology solutions company named ADEVCOM to visualize the community profiling and mapping of solutions related to access and use of water in the coastal area of the Department of La Libertad in El Salvador, through a GIS StoryMap to show the results of the sampling of water in rivers and sea. Additionally and unexpectedly, two large private firms (Ternova Group and Siemens-El Salvador/Mexico) reached the Lab to exchange insights around sustainable businesses that tackled some of the core issues around water access, quality and conservation in El Salvador. What these companies had in common was that both of them were working on intrapreneurship challenges for sustainable businesses.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We were supposed to coordinate with the Presidential Water Commission but it was unexpectedly disbanded and there was no handover of our joint plans to any institution. However, the Ministry of Tourism expressed interest in our water quality storymap and we are in the process of publishing it, including other relevant information for the tourism sector in the Surf City area.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Private sector firms like AS are new and unusual partners/vendors for UNDP. Data analytics using innovative methodologies has not been a part of mainstream UNDP activities in the El Salvador CO.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The linear way in which traditional UNDP projects and units operate does not allow for a 360° exploration of any subject. The combination of innovation methods, new forms of data and partnerships allow for a better integration of the CO, from a portfolio standpoint.
