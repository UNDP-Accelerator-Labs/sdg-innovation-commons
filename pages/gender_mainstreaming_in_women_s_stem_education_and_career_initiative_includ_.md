## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Gender Mainstreaming in Women’s STEM Education and Career initiative includes 2 phases:

- First phase is based on conducting focus group and deep interviews among girls in STEM education and Women who persuade their career in STEM.

- Second phase – survey on identifying positive factors that influenced on women and girls to choose this field. Second phase will also include further options of work, that might include solutions/testing/behavioral experiments, AI in this area.

First insights gathered during focus group talks and deep interviews are:

- Even though Uzbek society does not approve/support girls perusing their education in STEM, we have strong personalities that move forward in achieving their dreams

- Many girls who are in STEM education want to be role models, for other girls in achieving their dreams. With their example they want to encourage others no to give up

- Surprisingly many fathers support their daughters in getting STEM education

- In one of the Universities in Tashkent the number of girls increased in STEM education after government provided special subsidies for girls

-  In general picture – for the last several decades the overall number of women/girls in STEM education/profession dramatically decreased in the country (that perception came during identifying respondents for our interviews)

 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
Blog is on its way (we have got first result at the end of the 2022)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Challenging to find the right number of respondents (girls/women) in STEM (the ones who dream to obtain their careers in STEM and did not attend university just to obtain diploma)

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There is very little data on gender issues in the country. With women and girls in STEM – there was no such study and data available. That is why we as AccLab Uzbekistan is pioneering in this area and result that we will gain by using mentioned above methods will show the first picture of STEM education and profession with focus on gender. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

During the first stage, it helped to identify first results of motivation that girls and women in STEM have. These methods helped us to identify and understand the risks of dropouts from the STEM education, motivation of gaining this profession and what social/individual factors help them to stay and continue achieving their goals. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A – during the next stage 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Universities that have STEM departments - to engage girls to our study 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Private companies engineering that have women staff - we collaborated with them to engage into the study 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A – during the next stage 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

N/A – during the next stage 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A – during the next stage 
## End

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
