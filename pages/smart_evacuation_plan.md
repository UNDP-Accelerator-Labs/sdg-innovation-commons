The Smart Evacuation Plan (S.E.P.) is the brainchild by the group One Step, of the Kuala Lumpur Fire and Rescue Department Malaysia. This was a project that entered the Department's internal innovation competition in 2020. 
The project is inspired by the rise in fire incidents such as the fire incident at Hospital Sultanah Aminah in Johor Bahru on 25th October 2016 that saw 6 casualties because the victims were trapped in the building. The accident was a departure point for the Setapak Fire Department to increase their service delivery for the year 2018. The One Step group was hence created. 
Post-mortem discussion of the fire incident suggested that ineffective Fire Training was a contributing factor to the fire. This caused the following reasons: failure of fire warning system, lack of preparedness by building occupiers towards fire incidents, physical obstruction at fire exits, late action by the emergency response team, and inadequate handling of the fire by the response team. 
The S.E.P. was born from the need to improve the efficacy of disaster management for fire incidents. The S.E.P. is an innovative and cost effective online integrated system with multiple functions to:
(a) access building evacuation guide online
(b) contact the nearest Fire and Rescue Department without dialling
(c) contact other Fire and Rescue Department, hospitals and safety agencies without dialling.
The S.E.P. works through the building occupiers' smartphones. It is activated through scanning the S.E.P. 's QR code that is placed at strategic locations in the building. On the interface, the user only has to press the icon Fire Exit Plan to access the evacuation guideline with animated directions. Pressing the Fire Station icon allows dialling to the nearest fire department, while the Emergency icon connects to other fire departments and safety agencies.
