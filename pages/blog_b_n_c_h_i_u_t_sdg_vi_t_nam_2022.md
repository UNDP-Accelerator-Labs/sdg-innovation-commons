INTRODUCTION

Achieving the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) could create millions of jobs,
expedite growth trajectories and unlock trillions of dollars in market opportunities. Yet, with
less than eight years left to meet the SDGs, the need for sustainable flows of private capital
remains more critical than ever before. Unlocking private capital requires robust market
intelligence and strong investment relationships.

The Vietnam Investor Map has been developed through research and a consultative
process with 30 government stakeholders, think tanks, enterprises, and leading impact and
commercial investors to produce tangible market intelligence. Such insights provide
tangible investment opportunities that lie at the intersection of government policy priorities,
development needs to be framed through the SDG targets for Vietnam, and the role of the
private sector. The highlighted Investment Opportunity Areas (IOAs) can help address gaps
in capital flows towards the achievement of the Vietnam government’s commitment to
achieving the SDGs using commercial business models that can create deep development
impact and optimal shareholder value.

OVERVIEW OF VIETNAM’S SDG INVESTOR MAP

What is an SDG Investor Map?

The methodology for the development of an SDG Investor Map follows a ‘funnel’ process
that starts with taking into consideration national development needs and policy priorities
investment/financial momentum by public and private stakeholders, priority sectors,
subsectors, and regions with the highest development needs.

They are backed by data and evidence gathered through research and are provided as
a public good to investors and governments to facilitate productive and SDG-aligned
capital deployment. Gender and marginalization, digitalization, and climate are some of
the underpinning themes/lenses for analysis for all the Investment Opportunity Areas (IOAs)
for the Viet Nam SDG Investor Map.

The methodology also helps in identifying “white spaces”, which are investment area(s) that
serve a strong development need in a specific national context but have not recorded a
strong policy momentum by way of government commitments or have not seen significant
private sector momentum due to the absence of viable business models, or both.

Globally, using this methodology, 24 maps showcasing 350+ IOAs for UN member countries
across the globe have been published on the SDG Investor Platform by August 2022. More
specifically within the ASEAN region, The Vietnam SDG Investor Map joins other countries
such as Cambodia, Indonesia, and Thailand that have already published their maps.

Impact investment is also trivial, albeit an increasing interest has been seen since 2015. From
2007 – 2017: the total investment values are USD 25 million and USD 1.4 billion by Private
Impact Investors (PIIs) and development finance institutions (DFIs) respectively, in which 23
deals are accounted for by PIIs and 50 deals by DFIs (GIIN, 2018).

Government priority

The Government of Vietnam (GoV) views the private sector as an important driver for
economic development. The GoV continues to commit to open foreign investment policies,
encouraging and attracting foreign investors through reforming administrative procedures
and investment incentives. Typically, the revised Investment Law 2020 and the Enterprise
Law 2020 continue to demonstrate Vietnam's opening foreign investment policy by cutting
various administrative procedures on investment approval.

The Government also specifies a list of industries and fields that need to attract foreign
investment and the fields in which only domestic investors can perform. Especially,
regulations and standards are being developed as new filters to select foreign investors with
advanced, environmentally friendly technology to contribute to the country’s achievement
of SDGs.

This report covers highlights of IOAs that aligned with SDG-relevant sectors to build a case
for private sector investors to mobilize funds towards sectors that have potential for healthy
returns as well as for high development impact.

EDUCATION

Photo by Le Tan

Investment opportunities: Vietnam's government expenditure on education has been 5 – 6%
of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the last 10 years (VnExpress, 2022). By adding a
household contribution of an estimated USD 350/household (GSO, 2021) to education, total
expenditure towards education would reach about 8%, equivalent to more than USD 20 billion
indicating a large market potential.

Development needs: Vietnam is experiencing a shortage of skilled labour, with 33.8% of
enterprises facing difficulty in recruiting professionals or technically qualified workers locally
(Vietnam Agriculture, 2021). This gap is further exacerbated by low enrolment in higher
education at 30%, compared with 50% in China and Malaysia, and disparity in access to
education across income groups (IFC, 2021).

Policy priority: Vietnam’s service sector development strategy (Decision 531/QD-TTg-2021)
focuses on the enhancement of education quality, technology application, human resource
development in highly skilled technical industries area, technology, business management,
and overall institutional reforms and changes that are required for this sector’s improvement
for the education sector.

Investment Opportunity Areas that lie at the intersection of policy, development needs, and
investment momentum in the Education sector are described below.

HEALTHCARE

Investment opportunities: The healthcare market size was USD 17.3 billion in 2018, with
spending per capita projected to increase from USD 170 per capita in 2017 to USD 400 in
2027. The pharmaceutical market in Vietnam is the second largest in Southeast Asia,
estimated at USD 5.9 billion in 2018, and is projected to grow at 14% CAGR by 2025 (British
Business Group Vietnam, 2019). Medical equipment is estimated at USD 1.6 billion (2021),
growing at a CAGR of 10% from 2017-2021 (Babuki JSC, 2021).

Development needs: Regional disparities exist in access to quality and affordable healthcare
services between rural and urban areas. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) increase due
to unhealthy habits like excessive smoking and drinking. NCDs were the cause of 77% of
deaths in 2016, as opposed to 68% in 2010 (Shaaban, 2020). Slow reduction of under-5
mortality rate at 23% in 2013 and 20.6% in 2020 (GoV, 2020).

Policy priority: Improve healthcare service quality and the healthcare system efficiency
towards accommodating the aging population, international integration, and digital
application; diversify medical services, encourage private sector participation (KPMG, 2021),
and increase access for the population (Decision 531/QD-TTg) (GoV, 2021). Investment
Opportunity Areas that lie at the intersection of policy, development needs, and investment
momentum in the healthcare sector is described below.

Healthcare providers

IOA-specific development needs

• Hospitals in large cities are overburdened - bed
occupancy rates have reached 120–160%, especially in
central hospitals in large cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi
Minh (Vietnam News, 2018). Healthcare services are
understaffed: only 8 doctors
for every 10,000
population, compared to 15 doctors in Malaysia and 23
in Singapore for the same denominator (World Bank,
2016).
The population in Vietnam is ageing (the percentage
of the population aged 65 and over is predicted to rise
from 7% to 21% between 2015 and 2050) (Shaaban,
2020).

•

• 65% of the Vietnamese population live in rural or remote
areas where access to and quality and affordability of
healthcare are not equal to urban areas due to the
shortage of medical workers (Shaaban, 2020).

Business model: B2C model to provide distance medical
consultation, diagnosis, and prescription via a digital platform
to patients. The business model may also combine online and
offline (traditional in-person) services.

► Market growth: > 15% - 25% CAGR
► Market size: USD 100 million -1 billion
► Market potential: Health care expenditure in Vietnam is

estimated at 6% of GDP, more than 17 billion in 2018. 66%
of the population have internet access, 94% of the
population have daily use of the internet.

► ROI: estimated at 20-25%

Impact risks and obstacles

•

If adequate incentives and coverage are not provided
to nudge the uptake and adoption of remote health
tech solutions through the Vietnam Social Security
system or insurance providers, for instance, the benefits
of such business models will remain restricted to a niche
population segment.

• A fragmented healthcare value chain may result in
ineffective health management if online consultation is
not followed by expert care services.

for drug production and
of medicinal herbs
treatment, 80% of these are imported from China
through unofficial channels with unassured quality
(Hanh, 2021).
Issue of counterfeit drugs and poor-quality drugs - in
2019, Vietnam had the highest number of enterprises
producing low quality drugs in the world (Vo &

► Market potential: The total value of drug use in Vietnam is about

5.14 billion USD, out of which, the total value of medicinal
preparations from medicinal herbs (medicines, traditional
medicines, herbal medicines) is estimated at about 440 million
USD (8.4% of the total value of disease treatment)

► ROI: estimated to be 10-15%.
► Ticket size: USD 1-10 million

FOOD & BEVERAGE

Investment opportunities: The market size for the agri-tech market is estimated to be USD 300
million and USD 1.8 billion for the cold chain services market (Vietnam News, 2021). Current gaps
in the domestic supply of pesticides where 100,000 -120,000 tons of pesticides are imported
annually (Vietnam Agriculture News, 2021), point to opportunities that need to be addressed. In
addition, a low fruit processing capacity of 600,000 tons versus total national production of more
than 12 million tons also indicates opportunities that can yield commercial and impact returns
(Luc, 2020).

Development needs: In 2021, Vietnam was ranked 65/113 on the Global Food Security Index
(The Economist Group, 2021), indicating poor nutrition due to low access to quality food
products and low labour productivity in agriculture production, i.e., 2.4 and 2.1 times less than
that of Indonesia and Thailand, respectively (MoST, 2020). Vietnam is also severely affected by
climate change requiring innovations in climate resilient and sustainable food systems. The
impact of floods alone causes a loss of 2.3% of GDP each year (General Department of
Hydrometeorology, 2022).

Policy priority: Resolution 26-NQ/TW/2008 by Vietnam Communist Executive Committee offers
strong support from the government for rural development, including the activities in agricultural
value chains, e.g., market access, technology transfer, access to capital, human resource
improvement, infrastructure investment, business model development, and food safety for the
population.

Agricultural products

IOA-specific development needs

Technology solutions are needed to address: (a) Low
income in Vietnam’s rural areas which is 1.6 times less than
in urban areas (Dan, 2018), (b) the limited area of
sustainable agriculture - 0.3% of total plantation land area
and only 0.5% of aquaculture area is certified for
sustainable farming practices (GoV, 2020), (c) a high post-
harvest loss rate of 10-20% in agricultural production, and
food safety issue - 1,556 cases of food poisoning were
reported, with more than 47,400 people infected during
2010-2019 (An, 2020).

Business model: B2B agri-tech solutions for various activities
in agriculture production, such as implementing essential
tasks, monitoring crops, predictive analysis, and precise
agriculture.

Benefit stakeholders

Food

Development needs

• Production of fruit and vegetable drinks is a solution
to improve the absorption of fresh produce from
farms, bringing down the large volume of post-harvest
loss and waste which accounts for over 20% (GoV,
2020) of the national production of more than 30
million tons/year (GoV, 2020).

• Fruit and vegetable farmers have low incomes, which
can be improved if the farmers establish supply
that will usually offer
contracts with
competitive purchase prices and provide technical
assistance for farmers to secure production inputs.

factories

Business model: Processing plant for the production of fruit
and vegetable drinks or investment in existing factories to
raise capacity and operational efficiency under a B2C
model targeting end-consumers on the domestic market.

► Market growth: > 5% - 10% CAGR
► Market size: USD 100 million - 1 billion
► Market potential: Total value of the fruit juice market in
Vietnam is USD 450 million, accounting for nearly 11% of
the beverage industry in Vietnam in 2019 (Minh H.V,
2021). The source of raw ingredients for processing fruit
and vegetable juices in Vietnam is large and diverse: 12-
15 million tons of fruits and 17.6 million tons of
vegetables. Vietnam has over 150 industrial-scale fruit
and vegetable processing establishments with a total
designed capacity of over 1 million tons/year, but the
actual production output is only over 600,000 tons (GoV
Directive 5/CT-TTg/2020, 2020)

► Gross Profit Margin: estimated to be 15% - 20%.
► Ticket size: USD 500,000 - 1 million.

►

Expected development outcomes

• Reduce post-harvest loss and waste, raise product value
3-4 times, and create favourable conditions for market
expansion - especially for export.

• Meeting

the consumer demand

for high-quality
(processed) fruit and vegetable products, with ensured
safety and hygiene and long shelf lives.

23

Impact risks and obstacles

• Securing enough supply volume might be challenging
as traditional local traders and collectors often pay high
temporary prices to appeal to farmers.

• Limited understanding of

INFRASTRUCTURE

Investment opportunities: Vietnam's waste management market was valued at USD 3.8 billion
in 2020 (Mondor Intelligence, 2021). The potential of waste to electricity in Vietnam is estimated
at 1,517 MW with an average power output of 10,617,740 GWh/year (Energy Institute, 2021).
Under utilities, the investment demand in the water sector is estimated to be between USD 1.3
billion to USD 2.7 billion over the 2021 - 2030 (Lambert, 2021).

Development needs: Despite progress made, there are some gaps in availability and access
to key infrastructure and utilities in Vietnam. For instance, in 2018, 6.3% of the population in rural
areas did not have access to sanitary, potable water (GoV, 2020). Moreover, an average of
84.3% of solid waste from urban activities is collected and treated as per national standards
but this still mainly lands up in landfills, with the ratio being much lower in some other regions
(e.g., 63% in the Highlands) (MONRE, 2019).

Policy momentum: As specified in the Socio-economic Development Strategy 2021-2030 of
the Vietnam Communist Party, infrastructure development is one of Vietnam's key strategic
development pillars. In addition, the application of high and green technology by the private
sector is strongly encouraged by the government for infrastructure projects.

► Market Growth: 5 - 10% CAGR
► Market size: > USD 1 billion
► Market potential: Vietnam consumes nearly 4 billion m3 of
clean water annually. Each m3 is worth between 0.3 - 0.9
cents. Daily consumption is expected to rise from 10.9
million m3 in 2019 to 20 million m3 by 2030 (MONRE, 2020)

► Business case example: BIWASE, DNP-Water

Expected development outcomes

•

Increased supply of, and access to, quality water for
the underserved population.

• By 2030, Vietnam’s ambition aims to end epidemics of
tuberculosis, malaria, and other tropical diseases by
2030 oblivion; and enhance the prevention of
hepatitis, water-borne diseases, and other infectious
diseases.
Improved health and wellbeing of citizens with
cascading impact on economic productivity.

Impact risks and obstacles

Low water prices set by the provincial government may lead
to sub-par commercial models which in turn will lead to the
supply of low quality of water as the investment is not
commensurate with the needs of target communities.

Waste Management

IOA specific development needs

•

There are challenges around the required capacity to
process solid waste in Vietnam. 75 % of collected solid
waste went into landfills in 2020 and 80% of this is not
compliant with sanitary standards (Vietnam Standard -
TCVN 6696:2000 by STAMEQ); The rate of waste
collection is only approximately 40% and 60-80% in rural
and urban areas respectively (MONRE, 2019)

• An estimated 3.1 million metric tons of plastic waste is
discharged on land in Vietnam annually. At least 10%
of this mismanaged waste leaks into the waterway,
making Vietnam one of the top five plastic polluters of
the world’s oceans (Mahler, 2022).

• Women constitute 60% of the waste sector workforce in
Vietnam that largely remains informal in nature. Their
income is modest, capacities are limited and there are
significant health implications as women are exposed
to toxic waste, and high levels of air pollution (Mahler,
2022)

Business model: Invest in modern technologies for solid waste
processing, for example in pyrolysis with energy recovery to
reduce treatment costs, sanitary landfilling, and microbial
production. (Pyrolysis technology provides an opportunity for
the conversion of municipal
solid wastes, agricultural
residues, scrap tires, non-recyclable plastics, etc. into clean
energy. It offers an attractive way of converting urban wastes
into products that can be effectively used for the production
of heat, electricity, and chemicals).

This can be made by greenfield investment or through joint
ventures with local companies and may focus on (a) Solutions
for solid waste recycling, (b) Application of advanced
technologies for processing solid waste before they go to
landfills (current investment in technologies is low; waste
processing equipment/machine
is generally outdated
causing environmental pollution), or (c) Waste-to-energy
generation. This investment opportunity is B2B, in which the
buyers are municipalities or businesses.

28

► Market growth: 5 - 10% CAGR
► Market size: USD 100 million - 1 billion
► Market potential: 27.8 million tons of solid waste produced in 2018,
63,000 tons/day from households (Mondor Intelligence, 2021). The
cost for processing solid waste is approximately 20 - 40 USD/ton
(MONRE, 2019).

► ROI: 10 - 15%
►

Investment size: Ticket size will vary depending on per-day capacity.
A minimum investment of 50 tons/day capacity is the usual practice,
and the maximum capacity can be up to a few thousand tons/day.
Estimated investment standard is about 20,000 USD/ton/day.
► Target areas: Northern Key Economic Zone: Hanoi, Hai Phong,

Quang Ninh, Hai Duong, Hung Yen, and Vinh Phuc. Southern Key
Economy Zone: Ho Chi Minh City, Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Ba Ria –
Vung Tau, Binh Phuoc, Tay Ninh, Long An và Tien Giang. Central Key
Economy Zone: Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, and Binh
Dinh

► Business case example: Vietnam Waste Solution (VWS)

Expected development outcomes

• Contribution to Vietnam's aspiration for a circular
economy. By 2030, the proportion of urban daily-life
solid waste collected and treated meets standards and
regulations through the circular economic models to
reach 50%; 100% of urban organic waste and 70% of
rural organic waste are recycled (GoV Decision,
687/QĐ-TTg, 2022).
Improvement in the quality of life of the population in
general, by reducing pollution, especially in urban
areas. For those involved in the waste management
sector, it is the improvement in the income and working
environment.

•

• Contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and
energy-saving; the CO2 reduction is estimated to be
0.12 tons per ton of garbage.

• Women and informal workers in the landfill areas will
benefit from the improved environment that resulted
from applying sanitary standards in waste treatment.

Impact risks and obstacles

•

•

Inefficient operational management due to the
fragmented value chain leads to low profitability,
hence crowding out investment, hindering the target
of 95% of solid waste treated set by the required
standards.
If requisite capacity building and sector formalization
measures are not built into the business model, the
waste sector workers, a large percentage of them are
women who may continue to face suboptimal work
conditions.

Waste Management

IOA specific development needs

• Vietnam lacks the adequate capacity to process
solid waste: 75% of collected solid waste went into
landfills in 2020 and 80% of this waste is not treated in
compliance with sanitary standards. The rate of waste
collection is approximately only 40% in rural areas and
ranges from 60-80% in urban areas (MONRE, 2019).
• Domestic waste landfills are often located on the
the city, directly affecting poor
periphery of
communities, resulting in the loss of a lot of arable
lands, along with creating air and water pollution.
• Communities living near garbage treatment plants
are exposed to pollution resulting from landfilling.

Business model: Waste-to-energy plant
in which the
generated power is sold to the state national grid and/or
directly to industrial zones. The service price for solid waste
treatment and the sales price of electricity is decided by
negotiation with local authorities based on investment
incentives. Fly ash from waste burning would be stabilized
and buried according to hazardous waste standards while
other solid, liquid, and gaseous wastes will be treated as per
safety standards.

► Market size: USD 100 million - 1 billion
► Market potential: Vietnam's total installed power capacity is

76,620 MW. The national revenue of the power system is nearly
USD 17 billion. The total potential for waste-to-energy power is
about 1,100 MW (Energy Institute, 2021).

RENEWABLE & ALTERNATIVE ENERGY

Investment opportunities: Annual growth rate of national electricity demand was forecasted
to be 8.5%, and 7.5% in the periods of 2021 – 2025 and 2026 – 2030 respectively; To meet this
demand, 130,000 MW is needed by 2030 (Chi, 2020). Expansion of transmission lines, energy-
efficient equipment, and electric vehicles, including charging stations, are needed to meet
the policy and investment commitments in Vietnam while also smoothening the relevant value
chains. Meanwhile, efficiency levels of energy use are high at 380 kilograms of oil equivalent
(kOe)/USD 1000 of GDP (2017), 30% more than Malaysia and 40% more than Thailand (Minh,
2022).

Development needs: High volume of investment amounting to about USD 14 billion/year is
needed for the power grid and power sources (Kim, 2020). The share of renewable power is
set to increase significantly to 42% by 2045 (Energy Institute, 2021) to contribute to addressing
the increasing carbon emission per capita, from 1.75 tons in 2010 to 2.81 tons in 2018 (GoV,
2020).

Policy momentum: At the COP26 conference, the Government of Vietnam committed to
achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Vietnam National Power Plan No.8 (being
finalized) states that by 2045, the total share of renewable energy sources, including small
hydroelectricity, wind power, solar power, and biomass power, will account for 43%. Coal-fired
power will reduce from 29% in 2020 to about 13% in 2045. Vietnam also plans to put together
a carbon tax and regulations on the management of carbon credits.
