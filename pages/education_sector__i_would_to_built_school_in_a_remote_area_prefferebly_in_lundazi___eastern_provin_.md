> Title of the innovation

EDUCATION SECTOR: I would to built school in a remote area prefferebly in Lundazi , Eastern Province.. I want to encourage both boys and girls how important it is to have an experience to be in a classroom.  I would also discourage early marriages especially among girl children... I would build a community recreation club so that each pupil discovers their talend and  to recognise which field they good in.

> Brief description of the innovation

The school that I would like build should be in a remote area. Because many children don't have the opportunity to to school because of many challenges, be it finances, or disabled children who don't  support in terms of wheel chair or any type of walking aid. The community school would be able to provide books and other school requirements. As well as uniforms and school shoes. As for the teachers I can build small houses within the school grounds.. because the teachers need to be coming from a nearby place so that the pupils are able to start learning on time.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The value addition of innovation on environment is that once the pupils complete their education,  They will add value by working in different organisations and hence we shall have a better Zambia.. and they will be able to look after their parents and siblings and their family at large.

> Technical Feasibility

The building will be built by burnt bricks. The building being in a remote area

> Anticipated Social Impact

It can improve in a lot of ways because they would have improved their lively hood
