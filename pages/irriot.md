> Description of the solution

IRRIOT applies IoTs to drip irrigation systems. Sensors in the field monitor the temperature, soil moisture, even the pH level of the soil. They send that information via a radio signal to a remote terminal unit in the field, which then sends it to a controller, which is essentially a computer. The remote terminal also opens and closes the valves on the irrigation system. The third part of the system is cloud software, the intelligence that processes the data and knows when to send the correct commands to the controller. IRRIOT sells RTU, mobile application/cloud, and controllers. For the moment, the company has two pilot installations on strawberry fields.
