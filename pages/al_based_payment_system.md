AL-based payment system to pay for communal water use.


The app aims at optimizing water supply infrastructure through using machine learning. The users can see the payment on the screen via automatic calculation and pay at the same time online by drawing the meter reading to pay for water use in areas without a smart card. 


At the same time, the information collected from all subscribers is analyzed in real-time, both the customer can see their data on the website on the same server, and the admin user can analyze all subscriber data.
