[[ai_summary:Tong Atak, Head of Solutions Mapping at the UNDP Africa Borderlands Centre, embarked on a research and development journey to improve access to finance for informal cross-border traders in Warwar, South Sudan. The team used innovative methods, including convening various actors, developing language skills, and creating mobile Sanduk applications, to digitize traditional saving schemes. After piloting the project with 6 groups, they saw significant improvements, such as dropped interest rates from 30% to 15%, and increased access to loans for women traders. The success of the pilot led to the expansion of the mobile Sanduk application across South Sudan, reaching over 1.7 million customers, and it is now being considered as a digital public good to be shared globally. The project's impact was felt personally by individuals who benefited from the initial pilot, and the team believes that even small initiatives can have significant effects when adapted to local contexts.]]

# Digitizing Traditional Savings Schemes in South Sudan

### [[0:00]] Well, hello, can you start with saying that's your name and your position please?

Yeah, sure\. My name is Tong Atak\. I'm from the South Sudan UNDP country office\. I work as a part of the Accelerator Lab as the Head of Solutions mapping\.

### [[0:15]] Can you give your story that you're about to tell a short title so we understand what it's about?

Yeah, the R&D story I'll be talking about today is called Digitizing Traditional saving Scheme\.

### [[0:31]] Where did it start? How did your journey begin?

It began with an innovation challenge which was run by UNDP's Africa Borderlands Centre\. The challenge asked different labs to come with proposals for how to help informal cross\-border traders be able to trade better, to increase the trade of them and have better access to finance\.

### [[1:02]] What did the situation look like in the beginning? What was the development challenge you were trying to solve with this journey?

The area that we decided to explore this intervention in is a place called Warwar\. Warwar is in the borderland between South Sudan and Sudan\. The area has been known to have conflict as well as have no access to formal banking\. There's no banks there\. There's basically no formal financial services\. So we thought that it could be a good place if we could be able to try and see if we pilot a project there\.

### [[1:39]] Great\. So you saw an opportunity where there was an empty space?

Pretty much, yeah\. There was an empty space\. Also, the local community there literally had no access to finance, no way to bank or keep the money secure, and they were as disconnected from the financial industry as you could imagine\.

### [[2:00]] Coming back to our research and development practice, which tools or methods did you use to do what you just described?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[skills:Partnerhsip coordination]]
Yeah, well what we did is we convened various actors together\. We realized that in that space, the banks as well as some other financial service providers wouldn't necessarily go there because it's quite remote\. The number of people which are there or the potential customer base is too small for them to go and build a bank\. So we have to think out\-of\-the\-box\. So we have to think how could we get them more included in the financial services\. So, yeah, we just thought, OK, we convened with the local government, the local community and then as a part of the R&D journey, we also brought in the private sector and we act as a convener to bring them all together\.

### [[2:54]] Can you tell us more about the stakeholders apart from the private sector?

Yeah, all right\. The before we actually went into the community, we had to meet with the local state government, the county government, as well as community leaders within the area so that we could at least explain to them what the pilot or the experiment was going to be about, what we hope to achieve\. And then we went actually to the community and had a chance to speak to them to see if it's something that they feel actually could be of benefit to them\.

### [[3:33\]\]OK\. And were there special skills or tactics first you needed to deploy or to develop your develop yourselves to do this to embark on this journey?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Play do not preach]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Yeah\. You know, because we had so many different actors and they have so many different understandings of what the technology that we were going to pilot could do that we had to develop almost different language skills to be able to speak to the different actors\. So when we brought in the mobile money service provider, we needed to be able to talk to them more in a technical language, but then with the local community for them, they had no understanding of what this technology could be able to provide them with\. So we also had to find a way to be able to decimate that information towards them in a language that was easy for them to understand\. And the way we did that is to show them what the benefits of it were like how currently this is what is happening and then with this is how we project, it could be able to benefit you or the community itself\.

### [[4:45]] OK, So by using these tactics, skills and methods and with the involvement of your stakeholders\. How did the pilot look like in the end? What did you do in practice?

[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[skills:Sharing knowledge]]
[[tactics:Share your value upfront]]
Yeah, alright\. What we did is when we went to the community, we found that the women as well as the cross\-border traders, they had formed themselves into wild call saving and cooperative groups\. We call it a sanduki in South Sudan\. So what are Sanduki's is basically a box where they put money into each one of them\. They do it basically every week\. They put some money to put it aside as a savings\. Then they have somebody who has a Ledger and within that Ledger they take down all of the name of the person, the amount they've put in\. And then after a period of time, say maybe six months, each member has a chance to be able to get that money back within that\. They also offer loans to anyone within the community who wants to be able to get access to finance\. Now that exists because there were no formal banking services\. So what we did is we brought in the mobile money service provider and we said, look, this group of women traders, they actually have on paper all records of how they transact\. But the challenge is it's on paper\. And for the banks as well as the financial service providers to be able to actually accept it as a record, it needed to be digitized\. So that's where we spoke to the mobile money service provider and we said we understand that this community is quite far remote\. But we believe that if we are able to give these group of women traders the opportunity to instead of having it on paper to be able to bank their money onto the mobile money service provider to create a wallet there that now their financial transactions could be recorded\. So when we spoke with the mobile money service provider, our idea was that, look, we feel that this could be an opportunity for you, for them, they were reluctant to go by themselves\. So for us, we said that, OK, what we will do is we will support the pilot so that we can prove that this could be something of benefit\. So when we actually managed to do the pilot and the experiment, the actual R&D research and development for them to be able to develop this this system, we found that the mobile money service provider after they created the mobile Sanduk application on their platform and then the pilot was successful\. They then decided with all their customer base of about 1\.7 million they put on their platform and they then opened it up to the whole country\. So now what we have is from that small little pilot, that small chance of research and development, we were now able to have a finalized project product where now we've got a private sector who has decided now to take it, utilizing their platform to reach all of the country of South Sudan\. And yeah, this is this, this all began from just that that fact that we were able to absorb some of the risk and to actually, you know, take hold the hands of the mobile money service provider to this community which represents so many others around the country\. And not just they actually there's so many other countries which also in similar situations\. So we hope now to not just only have it within South Sudan, we're working the next step towards creating it as a digital public good\. And we're hoping to open it up towards the world\.

### [[8:24]] Amazing\. Can you, can you tell us now how does this journey and this pilot and the, the scale that you reach change the lives in the communities that you were working with?

[[tools:Gamification]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Share your value upfront]]
Yeah, it really tangibly changed it because when initially they began, they used to offer loans at about 30%\. After the end of the pilot, the interest rates dropped to 15\. So what we did is because each we had about six different sandal groups and then we had three of them\. We used them, we actually digitized it\. The other three, we left them on the old system, but we provided them with not just we provided them with some devices so that everybody has at least a phone to be able to use it\. Then we also provided them with financial literacy training\. From some of the conversations that we actually held with the groups, we found that some of the women told us when their husbands find that they have their businesses and they when their goods are done, they say to them that, you know, we need to go to another town to be able to buy the goods\. That their husbands sometimes feel like, no, you're going there to maybe meet men or something\. So from that we learn a lesson\. We said, OK, you know what we're going to do? We're going to actually do gender sensitivity training\. So we brought together the, the husbands as well as the women, and then we all together sat and the training was given to them\. And at the end of it, the men actually realized that actually this is a benefit to them all, to the whole household\. So that helped them\. We also provided them with digital literacy training as well as mobile money service training\. So by the end of it, we found that because each group were now competing with each other to offer loans and because of that, the financial literature training, we ended up finding that the interest rates dropped from 30% initially down to 15%\. And then also other groups started to form as well when they saw that this was happening within the town and it was just a positive traction that started to pick up and build\.

### [[10:32]] Amazing, amazing story\. Can you can you point out a critical moment in this journey? What, what was the point when you said this is going to be a success?

[[tools:Data Powered Positive Deviance]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
I think, you know, the point was there was a time we went back to do monitoring and evaluation\. And when we got there, the women, they actually, they slaughtered a, a goat for us\. They cooked a big meal for us and they said, you know, we want to thank you\. So we sat down and then we ate and they explained how they expressed the gratitude\. There was one lady there called Bakita\. She had a small hotel where she had about 6 rooms\. These are small, kind of locally reconstructed, so when traders come from across the border, they would be able to sleep overnight before they go back again\. She was able to increase from 6 to 15\. And she, she really was thankful\. And it was a beautiful moment because we got a chance to break bread with the community and to see actually that whole process and the R&D journey that we took with them\. You know, it took about a year for us to really get everything done and to see the finalized results\. And it made us believe that, you know what, even if you start with something small, it can have a huge impact, not just say for the country as a whole, but even personally for those individuals that were able to benefit from the initial pilot\.

### [[11:56]] Great\. And now final question about learnings\. What would you do differently if you had to start again?

Oh, if I had to start again, honestly, I think I wouldn't really change anything because like throughout the whole journey, definitely there were bumps and hurdles\. But as we go through it, we learn\. So I see nothing in it as a challenge that can't be overcome\. And I'm sure if we were going the next R&D journey that we're going, there will still be challenges\. But likewise, we will always be adapting to them so that we can be able to achieve the success of the project\.

### [[12:37]] Amazing\. And you already talked about the fusion and even scaling out for the countries, but were they any growth in terms of policies, ecosystem change that didn't only kind of concern this very process, but other ones as well?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
Yeah\. You know, generally if I say the ecosystem there, it's still quite young\. South Sudan only gained independence in 2011 and mobile money just came in like 2 years ago and it's still an infancy\. The banking infrastructure is currently still quite weak and there's a lot of room for growth\. So I think by us taking this lead and for by us bringing in these diverse sets of actors, we start sparking a change, a positive change and a chance to show others that, you know, if we come together on this journey, we can really be able to make an impact and a difference\.

### [[13:43]] Beautiful finalizing words\. Thank you so much\.
