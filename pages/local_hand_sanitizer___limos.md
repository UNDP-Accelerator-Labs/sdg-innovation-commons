LIMOS
is a Timorese-owned company producing Hand-Sanitizers using local ingredients.
Since the supply chain disrupted during COVID-19 the supply of standardized
hand-sanitiser and PPEs were limited so local creativity is needed. The owner
had invented his own distillery machine to extract alcohol from local palm
wine. Other local ingredients include aloe vera.
