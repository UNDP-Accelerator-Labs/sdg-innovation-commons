Overall goal: Conduct assessments on urban floods, by directly engaging the affected community in data collection and in the proposal of joint solutions incorporating their experience and needs. Specific goals:

• Perform a diagnostic assessment of the problem, identifying the different hazards to which the community is exposed by zones, depending on its place of residence.

• Work with students at all educational levels and residents in recording and characterizing the rainfall events affecting the community (determine the rainfall level that causes flooding).

• Gauge the amount of stormwater runoff on streets using videos and photographs recorded by the residents previously trained. 

Description of citizen participation: The community offers valuable insight into the basin behavior, which is combined with the technical expertise of the research team to produce a conceptual model of the system operation. Both hydrometeorological (rainfall) and hydrological data (flows draining through the streets) must be recorded for this. Additionally, citizens collaborate to define pertinent locations for collecting hydrological data. Different solutions are also proposed in collaboration, working on their sustainability and feasibility, both to be presented to the corresponding governmental institution and to be applied by the community. The research team in charge of the project receives the records created by the community. Reports are created, published, and sent to the community following the record validation
