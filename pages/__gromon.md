> Description of the solution

Agromon is a unique plug-and-play device that enables Smart Agriculture. It is incredibly easy-to-use, as it practically needs no configuration at all. By simply plugging in the sensors included in the package, the device is ready for use. However, other sensors and devices are also available to be interfaced with Agromon, according to the user‚Äôs needs. Wireless communication is based on Sigfox, LoRa, or WiFi.
Agromon is based on ESP32-WROOM-32, which is a powerful, generic Wi-Fi &amp; Bluetooth/Bluetooth LE module that targets a wide variety of applications, ranging from low-power sensor networks to the most demanding tasks, such as voice encoding, music streaming and MP3 decoding. On top of these, ESP32-WROOM-32U also has a U.FL connector.
