## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Lorena Moscovich

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

9 December, 2021

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

  

It corresponds to our portfolio of Financial Inclusion.

  

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Our challenge is to connect the community of Concepción del Uruguay, located in the province of Entre Ríos, Argentina, with digital inclusion. The Con Vos Network is a project that fosters digital inclusion. The Network was designed to allow neighbors in the community to carry out online procedures through stores close to their homes. This facilitates access to essential services and allows people to save time, money and distance, plus it increases sales in nearby stores. 

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How can we promote decentralization, inclusive digitalization and small stores?

Originally, our learning question on financial inclusion was how to promote the use of different financial tools that allow people to improve their levels of inclusion but, with the COVID-19 pandemic, a related challenge came up as it was necessary to discourage the use of cash to avoid the health associated risks. In fact, the question or issue solved by this solution went beyond both of the above and can be summarized in how to foster digital inclusion, decentralization and community markets all at once.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The specific learning intent of this activity is understanding how nearby stores can facilitate the adoption of new technologies at the neighborhood level. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

The experiment had two sets of hypotheses: one related to the goals of the Network ‒decentralization of procedures, promotion of online procedures and tasks, and the strengthening of community markets‒ and another related to the effects of different treatments that could affect the demand of procedures.

Decentralization: If neighbors find alternatives to get their procedures and errands done closer to their homes, they will save time and money.

Digital inclusion: If their procedures and errands are solved digitally by a trusted store owner, then neighbors will go online with more of these procedures.

Strengthening of community markets: If a store offers doing digital procedures as a service, expanding its range of services, then it will result in more sales, by increasing the number of things their customers buy in their stores or by attracting new customers.

The evidence to test these hypotheses came from observational data.

At the same time, we designed an experiment by which we applied different treatments that allowed us to test the following experimental hypotheses:

If we grant demand-side subsidies like coupons with different kinds of discounts, then the number of procedures completed will increase.

If store owners have incentives (like hardware, such as printers and specific merchandising with the identity of the Network), then they will feel keener on promoting the services of the Network among their customers.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

To evaluate our hypothesis, we conducted a training of nearby store owners to teach them how to do online procedures (digital inclusion). This enabled local neighbors to complete their procedures with the store owner’s help, instead of traveling for two hours to the capital city to do the procedures in person. Therefore, the number of completed procedures and their decentralization would increase as well as digital instruction, plus it would boost sales in nearby stores. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The unit of analysis being tested is the number of persons, person-procedures and community markets. 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Nearby stores play a fundamental role in bringing products and services closer to neighbors so that they can access them within a few blocks from their homes and through a person they trust.

These stores are a means for innovation because they offer new technologies that have become essential on a small scale, such as public telephones in the recent past, then photocopy machines, printers and topping up cell phone credit, among others. Today they can also contribute to the digital inclusion of local neighbors.

To this end, the UNDP Argentina Accelerator Lab launched the Con Vos (With You) Network, a network of nearby stores where neighbors can carry out digital procedures of all kinds.

We worked with the Con Vos project in Concepción del Uruguay, in the province of Entre Ríos, with 20 participating stores of different business lines.

The Con Vos Network was visited by 401 persons who carried out 216 digital procedures of all kinds. Neighbors asked for appointments to apply for loans, charged their cell phones or the SUBE card to use public transportation, accessed a municipal program that provides them with eyeglasses, consulted their real estate debts, applied for pregnancy benefits or unemployment benefits. In short, they made inquiries, requests, payments, and recharges; they made transactions with the federal, provincial, and municipal governments, and, to a lesser extent, with private companies, such as cell phone companies, satellite TV, credit cards or banks.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The hypotheses we were able to test were the ones that came from observational data:

Decentralization: If neighbors find alternatives to get their procedures and errands done closer to their homes, they will save time and money.

Digital inclusion: If the procedures and errands are solved digitally by a trusted store owner, then neighbors will go online with more of these procedures.

Strengthening of community markets: If a store offers doing digital procedures as a service, expanding its range of services, then it will result in more sales, by increasing the number of things their customers buy in their stores or by attracting new customers.

We could not test the experiment given the poor distribution of the procedures among the three groups of stores: 80% of the procedures were concentrated in 2-3 stores. Also, we could not test the supply-demand hypotheses:

“If we grant demand-side subsidies like coupons with different kinds of discounts, then the number of procedures carried out will increase”. 

 “If store owners have incentives (like hardware, such as printers and specific merchandising with the identity of the Network), then they will feel keener on promoting the services of the Network among their customers”.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Con Vos is a network of local community stores, where neighbors can carry out digital transactions and operations close to their homes. We recruited stores and trained their owners and/or storekeepers to offer support to their neighbors. Along with the local government, we advertised the service offered in the stores to attract clients. We also delivered merchandising and promotional materials to the stores. Each store had an identification to show neighbors that it belongs to the Network offering the services. In addition, we launched advertising campaigns to attract users to the stores. In parallel to the evaluation of the Network's performance in terms of the aforementioned dimensions of analysis, we designed a small-scale experiment with three groups of stores. Two of them received promotional materials (eco-bags, wallets and pencil cases to be given away to the people who carried out procedures in the Network) and printers. In addition, we distributed coupons with discounts in the vicinity of the stores in one of these groups so that neighbors could come and do their paperwork.

Finally, the third (control) group was included in the Network, provided services, but did not receive any additional element or incentive, nor did it appear on the coupons. In order to make the comparison between the groups of stores, we depended on the populations’ demand for procedures. This was very uneven, i.e., the observations collected in the different groups were very disparate, making comparison between them unfeasible.

Therefore, we would change the way of appealing to clients to have them more evenly distributed among the stores in the three groups. In addition, as a proportion of storekeepers did not fill out the forms we provided, we would also change the way to collect information to be able to learn about what people did in the stores.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Nine months in total: 4 months doing a pilot test with 5 stores, 2 months to organize the full-scale launch of the initiative, 3 months for the experiment.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

We spent 18,200$. However, it should be noted that the fieldwork manager, recruiters, and trainers were afforded with public resources. They were either public employees or paid with public resources by the municipal government.

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The Secretary of Production of Concepción del Uruguay, Victoria Giarrizzo, oversees both the evolution of this initiative and whether people keep using these services.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

 Undersecretariat of Administrative Innovation of the Chief of the National Cabinet of Ministers. 
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

This experiment was designed to evaluate the impact that certain stimuli had on the demand for digital errands and procedures offered by the Network. To this end, we randomly assigned nearby stores to three experimental groups (one control group and two treatment groups) while considering a diverse distribution in terms of geographic location. The experimental phase took three months.

Eight nearby stores were included in Treatment Group 1 and got printers and merchandising of the Network. Seven stores were in Treatment Group 2, they got coupons to attract clients, as well as promotional materials. Seventeen stores were part of the Control Group, which got neither.

All store owners were asked to complete a digital form after each transaction, with information about their clients including the reason for going to that Network store. We used these online forms to collect data and to analyze the performance of the stores and the characteristics of the clients. We also learned that it is difficult to attract clients and that they did not go evenly to the stores in the three groups. At the same time, as a proportion of storekeepers did not fill out the forms we provided, we encountered another challenge related to how we can collect all the information concerning what people do in the stores.

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

We could not test the supply-demand hypotheses:

“If we grant demand-side subsidies like coupons with different kinds of discounts, then the number of procedures carried out will increase”.

“If store owners have incentives (like hardware, such as printers and specific merchandising with the identity of the Network), then they will feel keener on promoting the services of the Network among their customers”.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Our results shed light on the fact that there should be public policies in place to decentralize procedures bringing them outside of the state offices, and to promote the growth of community markets and digital inclusion for those who do not have the appropriate knowledge or the technological means to perform digital tasks. The differences we found when comparing results by age, gender and educational level, highlight the importance of creating solutions that take different socio-economic levels into account when designing policies to optimize the benefits of their implementation. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

We believe that the public policy community as a whole ‒especially those actors interested in the financial inclusion policies‒ will benefit from the insights gathered in our experiment. These insights refer to collaborating with different actors to scale up initiatives and working in alliance with local actors to improve the potential of local initiatives to foster development in their communities. Local governments, which usually lack both evidence and resources to collect them, can use this model to reduce officials’ efforts to get relevant information for evidence-based policy making. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Our experiment has been co-created and implied several iterations at different stages. First of all, the goals of the experiment, the dimensions of analysis, and its operationalization in variables and their proxies were entirely designed in weekly meetings in collaboration with the team of the local government who later led the field work. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Our advice would be to build an identity and a narrative for the action in question. This will make it easy to share it with other stakeholders and to communicate it to participating partners and citizens.

Choose local governments with a high level of commitment to actions since they will require their time and effort.

Take time in co-creation meetings to customize the tools to suit local governments’ needs. This will encourage the municipality officials’ involvement who will eventually take ownership of the tools being used.

Furthermore, regarding the experiment, there are also challenges that should be addressed in relation to collecting the necessary information to evaluate how the Network performs in terms of the hypotheses tested (we anticipated positive effects on inclusive digitalization, and decentralization for users, plus more new customers and increased sales for nearby stores). Attracting more customers to the Network and distributing them evenly in the three groups, and working out how to make storekeepers complete all the required forms are the three main challenges.   

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

This solution favors gender equality, SDG5, as it translates in greater help for people who face more difficulties to go the city centers, such as those who take care of dependents.

This experiment can be replicated in other thematic areas in two different dimensions. First, using the same model of the Network to promote digitalization which can be in itself a means for many purposes. For instance, through digitalization, neighbors can have access to health services and supplies, improve their educational background or make use of financial services.

Furthermore, digitalization has great potential to amplify the role of nearby stores for introducing new technologies at neighborhood level and providing peer-to-peer support for different purposes. This would help to reduce inequalities, facilitating the access to other basic supplies or services, such as water, health, or education. In all, it would be very easy to replicate this solution to achieve other SDGs, such as 3, 4 and 6.

  

In fact, we are planning to replicate this experience in the province of Catamarca.

  

> What surprised you?

We were surprised by the significant imbalance in the use of the stores during the experiment. Although it could not be tested because there were not enough observations, it seemed that providing photocopiers would not explain this difference.

In addition, we were also surprised by the willingness and hard work of the municipality officials.
