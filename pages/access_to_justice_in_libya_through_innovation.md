Access to Justice in Libya through Innovation
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that women in civil cases in Libya face significant obstacles in accessing justice, due to a fragmented and under-resourced judicial system, cultural and social norms that discriminate against women, and ongoing armed conflict and political instability in Libya.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The challenge of access to justice for women in civil cases in Libya has a complex history. Following the fall of the Gaddafi regime in 2011, Libya has experienced a period of political instability and armed conflict, resulting in the fragmentation of state institutions and the breakdown of the rule of law. The judicial system has been particularly affected, with limited resources, corruption, and lack of capacity contributing to a lack of access to justice for many citizens.

Women in particular face significant challenges in accessing justice in civil cases, including divorce, child custody, inheritance, and property disputes. Cultural and social norms that discriminate against women further compound the challenges they face. Women may also face harassment and intimidation from judicial officials, lawyers, or male family members, making it difficult for them to assert their rights in court.

The current situation in Libya is marked by ongoing armed conflict and political instability, which exacerbate the challenges faced by women seeking justice. The fragmented and under-resourced judicial system is unable to adequately address the needs of its citizens, particularly those of women. This situation results in a lack of trust in the judicial system and further marginalization of women.

The undesired effects of this challenge include gender inequality and limited economic opportunities for women. Women who are unable to assert their rights in civil cases may be denied access to property, inheritance, or financial resources, limiting their ability to participate in the economy and make decisions for themselves and their families. The lack of access to justice for women also contributes to a culture of impunity and perpetuates discrimination and violence against women.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

According to Human Rights Watch, nearly 6,000 women were held in pretrial detention without judicial review as of October 2022. According to UN Women, women face challenges in accessing justice due to gender-based violence, discrimination and lack of legal aid. According to ILAC, women are among the most vulnerable groups in Libya who suffer from limited access to justice due to COVID-19 pandemic.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Some weak signals that indicate the urgency of access to justice for Libyan women are:

- The rise of violent extremism and conflict-related sexual violence that affect women disproportionately.

- The lack of due process and fair trials for civilians, especially women, in the military courts.

https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2023/country-chapters/libya

- The absence of legislation and protection mechanisms for gender-based violence and women’s rights.

https://ilacnet.org/access-to-justice-for-vulnerable-groups-in-times-of-covid-19-libya-2/

These signals show that Libyan women are facing serious threats to their safety, dignity and equality, and that they need urgent access to justice and legal aid.
