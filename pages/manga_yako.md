Manga Yako

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is meant to help struggling Small Medium Enterprises exapnd their businesses. We aim at offering expansion packages that come at no cost at all on the end of the business owners. All we will need is hold a small percentage of not more that 20% in shares of the business that enables us to stay feasible and help other business expand too. All packages will include mentorship for all applicants in order to guide them into their transition stages and maximising profits.
We wish to have as many businesses as possible in Lusaka have access to funds and grow their business.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We are going to establish a holding company that will generate profits through monthly returns from the businesss that we invest in. 
We will be targeting marketeers in compounds and townships with eagerness and potential to grow. 
This will result into the lowering the cost of goods and servies as larger businesses get to older in bulk at less prices and hence resale at a lower price.

> Technical Feasibility

We shall first rent an office at central place in Lusaka where our prospects shall be accessing the funds and training from. A sensitisation program will then be undertaken in oder to enlighten people of these funds, how they can access them and benefits that come with letting us invest in their businesses. 
When we have at least half of the targeted number of 500, equipment classes will begin and go on for 1 month and then we shall help the businesses set up and see them through the growth stage and up to the maturity stages of the business.
In order to avoid monopolisation, the business will operate independently at mature stage while we continue getting the monthly returns in order to have resources to help other Business acres the funds. 
Some of the successful business owners will be recalled to sit on the board of our company, so as to ensure continuity.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will not only bring about economic growth in the city, it will also help reduce poverty levels in the district. Because parents and business owners will have enough money, a good number of children and people in general will be able to go school. Also, a good number of people in the I formal sector can't afford decent accomodation, food and sanitation this innovation will help cushion these burdens as people will then afford. A lot of problems such as increased crime rates which are consequences of lack of resources will be drastically reduces.
