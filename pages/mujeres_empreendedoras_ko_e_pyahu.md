> Description

The Ko'e Pyahu women entrepreneurs are members of a coordinator of social and community organizations of the northern wetland (flood zone) of the city of Asunción. Through entrepreneurship, they carry out sales fairs in key points of the capital, with which they maintain their respective families, since almost all of them are single mothers and heads of household.
