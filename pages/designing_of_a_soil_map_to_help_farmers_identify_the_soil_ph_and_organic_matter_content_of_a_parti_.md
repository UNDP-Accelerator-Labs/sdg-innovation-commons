> Title of the innovation

Designing of a soil map to help farmers identify the soil PH and organic matter content of a particular soil

> Brief description of the innovation

design of a soil map using arc gis software

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

When the small scale know the type of pH and organic matter ,,they will know the recommedeble types of crops to be grown there by increasing yield .

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is designed using ARC Gis software on a computer ,,,,we first collect soil samples from the field and determine the pH and organic matter,the figures collected Will be entered on the software. Using interpolation kriging will be able to generaterate the type ,class and PH of the soil.

> Anticipated Social Impact

my innovation will help farm managers ,small scale farmers to increase production,by them knowing the recommended crops to grow after knowing the soil ph
