Collective Mapping and Data-Driven Approach in Flood Mitigation
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is lack of data on existing infrastructure, particularly on natural and artificial lakes, that has potential to mitigate floods and other water-related disasters in Jakarta and its satellite cities.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Floods are one of the most common natural hazards. According to a recent study[1], an estimated 1.47 billion people globally are exposed to its substantial risks. Majority of the at-risk population live in low- and middle-income countries. Indonesia has the third highest absolute population exposure to flood risk, where 76 million people or 27 percent of its population are prone to flooding.




The densely populated capital and its satellite cities, collectively called Jabodetabekpunjur, experienced flooding regularly, which has displaced tens of thousands of people every year. While the government has invested in infrastructure including providing water pumps and conducting large drains, flooding remains prevalent. Lack of efficient drainage is responsible for much of the flooding issues. In order to strengthen a coordinated flood mitigation effort, a Presidential Regulation was passed in 2020[2] highlighting the need to improve the conditions and functions of natural and artificial lakes throughout the Jabodetabekpunjur area.




Initial restoration efforts identified a wide range of interconnected elements that contributed to the lakes’ functions - such as land disputes, urban sprawling, sedimentation, and physical alterations - exhibiting a far more complex system than anticipated. It is estimated that the area loss of lakes in Jabodetabekpunjur could cost IDR 250 million (USD 17 million) in damages annually.[3]

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

As an agile entity, the Indonesian Accelerator Lab is strategically positioned between policymakers, UN agency and communities to be able to reduce the proximity to deliver systemic transformation. While there are CO units that are working on reconstruction and resilience and disasters and government stakeholders such as the National Planning Ministry (BAPPENAS) and National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) are prioritizing policy design, infrastructure development and early warning systems to mitigate further disasters, many programs and policies are focused on physical environment and economic recovery. Based on discussions with the Accelerator Lab, CO units and government stakeholders have identified an unmet need of incorporating socio-cultural perspectives to complement and sustain existing innovations.




Initial mapping of several lakes has been conducted in 2021 by the ATR-BPN, there is a need to  scale up this project to cover the Jabodetabekpunjur area. Thus, the Accelerator Lab is trying to intervene the project design by integrating qualitative aspects to be included in the questionnaire, mainly to bring insights regarding flood mitigation in the mapping process. So we could identify potential attributable to artificial and natural lakes and forthcoming governance issues. In addition to that, the Accelerator Lab want to include citizen in the mapping process in order to encourage collective mapping, where data collated by citizens will by analyzed by mapping experts and made accessible for public.

 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Indonesian Accelerator Lab is exploring innovative methods to mitigate urban flooding in Jakarta through lean experimentation in collective mapping of natural & artificial lakes, incorporating geospatial data, survey insights and photo documentations.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

(i) What are the real condition of existing lakes as part of the built-infrastructure for flood mitigation? (ii) How to elevate the type and quality of dataset for government partner to be integrated in decision-making process? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The project relies heavily on mapping technologies, particularly the ability to leverage existing geospatial data and survey insights, that were later transformed into an insightful data visualization for the government partners - also employing tools of visual thinking and mapping. The overall project aims to increase government data quality and enable transparency of data collection processes, contributing to Smart Cities development. This pilot project built upon an initiative from the government project in 2021, and was followed up by a citizen science component whereas there is an open call for public volunteers to map lakes in their neighborhoods to complement the existing data.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Previously, the existing map of lakes that are available to the government were solely confined to static maps developed using drones. Through the use of open-source platforms such as Open Street Map, Ushahidi and Mapillary, the project elevates the types of data integrated for future maps, including geospatial data, qualitative interviews (that captured socioeconomic data) and crowdsourced photos and observation.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning/National Land Agency (Kementerian ATR/BPN) through Project Management Office of Jabodetabekpunjur area will potentially use the updated dataset to formulate a protocol/regulation for lake management, which will solve governance issues surrounding the lakes, provide better classification of each lakes, and later on support the utilization of lakes for flood-mitigation.
