> Title of the innovation

The design of a urea fertilizer plant to produce urea on a larger scale

> Brief description of the innovation

This is design of a plant to produce urea, designing each equipment that is involved in the process. With the necessary calculations to give accurate measurements and energy that will used to run the plant so as meet the raising demand of fertilizer in our country

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our target market is the farmers in Zambia and also other countries. this innovation with benefit not just us but the people of zambia. By producing our own urea the fertilizer prices will reduce and farming won't be as expensive as they are now. When we export this fertilizer it will add GDP to the country improving the country's economy. It will also provide jobs to a large number of people, youth's elder people and so on reducing the level of unemployment in our loved country

> Technical Feasibility

Planning on first erecting a pilot plant to produce at small scale then at go ahead and work on a bigger plant

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will give jobs to many people and help improve the agricultural sector

> Name of the Innovator

Priscilla polomondo and wamaka mutale

> Age

- 19-35
