## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Enhancing Utilization of Data for SDG Acceleration and create knowledge ecosystems in the city space
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the use of data and actionable intelligence that can be generated from the data analysis are not adequately utilised in policy decisions and improving public service delivery in the context of urban living

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Despite rapid urbanization and digitalization, opportunities and resources are unevenly distributed in the Maldives. With the dense population and concentrated investment in the Greater Malé Region, infrastructure, public services, and business development has been heavily skewed towards this region, leading to imbalanced access to quality service in education, healthcare, housing, transportation and economic opportunities for the other islands. The consequent domestic migration to Malé creates a vicious cycle, further intensifying social inequalities as domestic migrants face a stronger pressure on living cost and raise the demand for more public services in the Greater Male' Region, which in turn lead to more investment being directed there rather than other islands. 

Given its archipelagic geography and widely dispersed population across atolls, the Maldives is also restricted in diverse income channels that creates economies of scale. Provision of decentralized public service in the islands is also a continued challenge due to this reason. Climate change has compounded these vulnerabilities, with Maldives being prone to multiple climate-related risks including sea-level rise, coastal erosion, rapid and slow on-set natural disasters.  

All these accumulative factors have affected people’s quality of life and impede sustained development across the streams of governance, economic development, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability. Hulhumalé, a reclaimed island city in the Greater Male' Region is being developed as a long-term solution to many of the recurrent problems and is now home to over 90,000 residents.  

While additional land may relieve some of the issues or their symptoms, for promoting inclusive growth for Hulhumalé, it is important to understand people’s needs for a better quality of life, and based on that, design the built environment, public policies and services. Undoubtedly, relevant data channelled from various sources and actionable intelligence generated from the data analysis can be used to make better policies, better decisions in the investment deployment and improve public service delivery. Housing Development Corporation (HDC), the state-owned enterprise as the master planner, developer and regulator of Hulhumalé is extremely well position to demonstrate the value of data for decision making to meet the demands of people to ensure economic prosperity, social and environmental sustainability that has direct impact on the community and their quality of life

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

UNDP Maldives Accelerator Lab will work with Housing Development Corporation to demonstrate a new development paradigm to promote local economic prosperity, embrace social inclusion, create resilient and sustainable environment, enable participatory and anticipatory governance, and offer higher quality of life for the communities driven by the advance of technology, and data innovation. As such, we will work towards: 

 1) harnessing the power of data to map the liveability of islands to understand the communities’ needs for higher quality of life and assess the services provision; 2) utilizing the actionable intelligence generated from the data analysis for decision-making, specifically for the urban development of Hulhumalé;  

3) adopting a human-centered design principle to enable the community to participate in the development of solutions, and  

4) enabling a learning ecosystem by creating and curating space for planners, policy makers and city/local councils to exchange knowledge and experience on utilizing data for inclusive, sustainable development.  

This initiative also taps into the ‘3*6*3’ framework of the UNDP Strategic Plan 2022-2025. More specifically, Accelerator Lab methodologies and approaches will be applied through out the initiative. These include citizen-centered methodologies to develop a local liveability index. In additional to conventional data sources, new data sources will be explored. Addressing complex development challenges like improving the prosperity and livability in a city will need a systemic mindset and a portfolio approach which constitutes of a suite of concerted interventions that acts at different levels. Building on the existing portfolio of interventions, the project will add significant value to it by providing reliable and actionable data-informed intelligence to support the strategic decision on the improvement of current interventions and design of new interventions, through different stakeholders. Learning cycles will be carried out to co-design and test at least one innovative solution aimed at better quality of life for the community. Furthermore, human-centered design principle will be adopted to enable the community to participate in the development of solutions. The power of collective intelligence will be demonstrated via the convening of central and local government partners, stakeholders and communities to share and exchange knowledge.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we build and scale a co-learning ecosystem to enhance urban public policy and service delivery through data-driven analytics, citizen-centred, inclusive, sustainable and systemic approaches.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Solutions Mapping: Solutions mapping will be used to identify and collate exiting solutions that exists within the community that addresses urban liveability issues. This would help in elevating grassroot innovation 

Data visualisation: Data collected will be integrated in a data dashboard open to public that will demonstrate the key aspects of liveability index and various data sets that shows the quality of urban life in Hulhumale’. Visualisation will help the public to differentiate and think about the score for liveability index based on administrative data on one hand and perceptions of the people on the other hand. The digital data platform will put inclusivity at the heart of design to ensure the digital dividends can be shared and enjoyed by the communities as much as possible, especially for the marginalized and vulnerable communities. 

Collective Intelligence (CI): As part of growing stage, as we work on replicating and adapting the index in other cities of the country, CI will be used and applied thorughout the project in order to incorporate knowledge and expertise of the wider community. 

Pilot: Gaps in data and the need to alternative data sources and alternative ways of data collection were the key learnings from the process of formulating the liveability index. Moreover, one key area diagnosed as a pain point during the community consultations for the index was lack of key amenities and services in selected neighbourhoods, and in cases where they were available there was a lack of information. Another unmet need identified was the lack of accessibility for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), especially by private businesses and service providers. To address this, we'll test the use of participatory mapping as a toll to enhance existing GIS data and incentivize business and service providers to improve PWD accessibility.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Geospatial data is an emerging area of expertise and a very new source of data in terms of the extent to which it is used in studies and initiatives and the local technical capacity is also limited. HDC has this capacity in-house, and is currently collecting a rich source of geospatial data. Inclusion of this geospatial data will allow for innovative ways to analyse urban issues.
