Aid Card facilitates aid/grants administration to the vulnerable, hungry, displaced, poor and people living below a dollar per day. According to the UN, over 2.7 million people are displaced in Nigeria and 60% are living below the poverty line of US$1.90 a day. In Africa, about 18 million people are displaced and globally, 821 million people are undernourished, and depend mostly on aid/grants from government and non-governmental agencies to survive. Leveraging a growing network of vendors, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, development agencies and philanthropists are able to administer aid/grants to their intended beneficiaries conveniently without the risks and high costs associated with typical processes of aid delivery. As a lot of vulnerable populations do not engage in the formal economy and might not have bank accounts to receive aid especially cash programmes, Aid Card meets them where they are and provides them a way to receive aid when needed. Aid-givers can also track and see how distributed aid/grant is expended by their beneficiaries in Realtime.
