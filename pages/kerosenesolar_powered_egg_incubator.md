> Brief description of the innovation

The egg incubator innovation has the following parts:
A. Wooden housing
B. 65 Watt solar panel
C. Inverter 230V Ac
D. 12V battery 50Ah
E. Micro computer Digital temperature controller.
F. Copper tubing
G. CPU DC fans
H. Egg trays
I. Kerosene heater
 The innovation uses a wooden housing for maximum heat retention and the heater being a Kerosene operated. A 65 Watt Solar panel charges the 12V  battery that runs both the inverter and Fans. The copper tubing is coiled around the heater and the coil once heated has its convention heat sucked in by fans into the egg compartment where it is controlled to a desired incubating temperature by the micro computer digital temperature controller.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Innovation will generate income by using it to hatch village chicken eggs for myself as it on high demand than broilers. I can also  charge small fees for those that want to hatch from my unit  depending on how many eggs they have.
 Also I can build many of these units for those who want to do incubation on their own at a reasonable cost than that existing on the market.
 My other businesses can be expanded from cash that sales and services  of the innovation. At the same time the employment of solar energy removes carbon footprint from environment.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation uses a wooden frame to retain heat as it is a good insulator. 
The Kerosene heater heats up the coiled copper tube which in turn heats up the fresh air as it gets sucked up by DC fans located inside the incubator.
 The Micro-computer temperature controller then regulates the temperature by turning fans on and off automatically. eggs are turned manually easily by way of two ropes pulled down.

> Anticipated Social Impact

There will be zero hunger, children malnutrition reduced, more income for households in rural areas to cover for daily life expenses including sending of children to school.
 The innovation is cheaper and economical in that it can be afforded by those earning less than a dollar per day.
