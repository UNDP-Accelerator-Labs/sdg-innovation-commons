## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



Importance of Diverse Citizen Engagement: Engaging with various groups of citizens through diverse tools and media channels is essential. This approach ensures a broader reach and facilitates the collection of diverse perspectives and ideas. By utilizing a variety of communication avenues, we tap into a wider range of experiences and insights related to our learning challenge.

Relevance Drives Engagement: A significant finding is that people are more willing to engage when the topic is relevant and meaningful to them. A clear connection between the learning challenge and the participants' concerns or interests enhances their motivation to participate actively and contribute constructively.

Value of Partnerships: Partnerships play a crucial role in tackling learning challenges effectively. Collaborating with individuals or organizations that possess complementary skills, knowledge, or networks enhances the overall impact. Through partnerships, we can harness combined expertise to address challenges more comprehensively and progress further.

Learning Through Piloting: The process of piloting various engagement tools provides valuable insights. Trying out different approaches helps identify what works best for specific audiences and uncovers unexpected outcomes. This iterative process of experimentation and adaptation contributes to refining engagement strategies.

Continued  Advocacy: Advocacy remains pivotal at all levels. Advocating for the learning challenge, whether on a local, regional, or global scale, raises awareness, mobilizes support, and drives necessary changes. Consistent advocacy efforts ensure that the learning challenge remains on the agenda and encourages continuous action and improvement.

- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



The idea of creating a Cool Hero Community landed very well with our environment team, where they are creating Youth Environmental Hubs; in addition a community of cool heroes fits well with the programmatic activities that the environment team is working on; namely they have meaningful participation in decision making processes.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



We chose these specific data types due to the following reasons, addressing gaps in our existing knowledge:

Micro Heat Islands: Limited knowledge on micro heat islands in the city prompted us to investigate this aspect more deeply. Understanding localized temperature variations was essential to comprehensively tackle the learning challenge.

Heat Perception and Coping: We recognized a gap in our understanding of how people perceive heat and their coping mechanisms. This data type allowed us to explore individual experiences and responses to micro heat islands.

Mapping Solutions: Our research revealed gaps in knowing effective solutions for micro heat islands. By mapping potential strategies and trends, we aimed to identify practical interventions tailored to our context.

Citizen Engagement: Recognizing the limited insights into public interactions with the issue, we introduced citizen engagement data. This approach bridged the gap by capturing public perceptions, concerns, and contributions through various tools.

These new data types build upon our existing knowledge by filling gaps in understanding micro heat islands, heat perception, coping mechanisms, and potential solutions. Through this comprehensive approach, we aimed to gain a holistic perspective on the learning challenge and derive effective strategies.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



We actually used the following key innovation methods in addressing our frontier challenge:

Solutions Mapping: We employed solutions mapping to visually outline potential strategies and interventions for addressing micro heat islands. This method helped us organize ideas, identify trends, and prioritize actionable solutions.

Collective Intelligence: Leveraging collective intelligence, we engaged diverse stakeholders, including citizens, experts, and organizations. By tapping into their collective knowledge and perspectives, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and potential approaches.

Crowdsourcing: We utilized crowdsourcing to gather insights, ideas, and opinions from a wide audience. This approach allowed us to harness the power of collective wisdom, fostering participation and generating innovative solutions that we might not have discovered otherwise.

Co-creation: Co-creation involved collaborating with stakeholders to jointly design and develop potential solutions. By involving citizens, experts, and relevant organizations, we ensured that the solutions we explored were contextually relevant and viable.

These innovation methods were necessary to apply on our frontier challenge for the following reasons:

Complexity of the Challenge: The challenge of addressing micro heat islands is multifaceted, requiring diverse perspectives and expertise. Collective intelligence, crowdsourcing, and co-creation allowed us to tap into a wide range of insights, contributing to a more holistic understanding of the challenge.

Innovation and Creativity: Innovating in the context of micro heat islands required creative thinking and exploring unconventional solutions. Crowdsourcing and collective intelligence enabled us to generate a diverse set of innovative ideas and perspectives that fueled our creative problem-solving process.

Engaging Stakeholders: Involving citizens and experts was essential for creating contextually relevant solutions. Citizen science and co-creation facilitated direct engagement, enabling stakeholders to contribute firsthand insights and collaborate in designing effective strategies.

These innovation methods helped us unpack the system by:

Broadening Perspectives: Collective intelligence, crowdsourcing, and co-creation facilitated the inclusion of diverse viewpoints, helping us identify interconnected factors and potential solutions from multiple angles.

Generating Insights: Solutions mapping provided a structured framework for visualizing potential strategies and their interrelations, aiding us in identifying gaps and overlaps in our approach.

Identifying Novel Approaches: By embracing innovative methods, we discovered unconventional ideas and novel approaches to address micro heat islands, enriching our understanding and expanding the range of potential solutions.

Identify Possible Synergies and New Partnerships: These innovation methods also enabled us to identify possible synergies and new partnerships. By engaging diverse stakeholders and soliciting input through crowdsourcing, we uncovered opportunities for collaboration with individuals and organizations that share a common interest in addressing micro heat islands.
