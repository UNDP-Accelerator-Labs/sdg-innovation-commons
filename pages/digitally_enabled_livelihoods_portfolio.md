## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

  1.       From testing our initial messaging, it was clear that to help mobile money gain traction, it would not be enough to simply motivate people of its benefits. We also need to give people the best chance to progress by reducing friction points, and wherever possible, creating the conditions for them to build their confidence in making the most out of it.  We therefore recommended a strategy composed of four pillars, each associated with a different combination of communications and non-communications-based interventions: Loyalty programs providing users with points or cash-back on every purchase and the money they win stays in their mobile wallet and can only be spent using mobile payments at any store accepting this payment method. 2.       The workstream we developed around inclusive digital finance and the many probes we launched around it surfaced one key insight: Developing an SDG-aligned local fintech ecosystem is financial inclusion 3.0. Local fintech are uniquely posed to scale new digital financial services for the low-income segments, the underbanked and micro, small-and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). 3.       Collective voice and protecting the most vulnerable: When digital financial services consumers have a voice in financial consumer protection regulation, it makes it much more effective. 4.       Unlocking markets for women to International digital trade: Working with women-led argan oil coops, our action research aimed to encourage women to trade cross-border through digital ways. Empathy interviews we had showed that what seems to get into their way to export is related to the lack of the volatile seeds market that is owned by unchecked intermediaries. 5.       Design for multiplicities: we worked for four months with the regional Innovation and Gender Teams in the Arab States to “Design for Multiplicities” — a pilot new learning tool to design interventions that serve multiple groups and cater to the need of those most left behind, in effective and unfragmented ways. One key insight that surfaced throughout the ethnographic study we carried out with women from extremely underserved areas in the Southeast regions of Morocco, was that often communities are time-poor and therefore our offerings although are a spectrum (portfolio) of solutions need to start radically simple with instant gratifications. Piece by piece and then spiral out to the fully-fledged support we designed for them.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The national elections and change of cabinets members. In addition: i) Most of the experiments and action research are seed-funded while being considered as future lever of interventions. As such, these activities already led to long term agreements to support national partners. However, these efforts were not always synced with the related procurement responsiveness during the last months. Further increased adaptive capacity is needed, encompassing a comprehensive; ii) Lengthy discussions on the approval of tenders and a low-value grant with a uniquely qualified NGO we were hoping to work with as an entry point for implementing some of the experiments and that were not considered according to inadequate selection rules despite taking co-creating the experiments during the course of months; iii) Delayed procurement processes.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These alternatives data sources were really useful to uncover levers of our interventions that we advocated to the national partners based on evidence..

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Both digital and financial inclusions that are very much overlapping with our big bet challenge, are perplexing since they are heavily jeopardized as a result of demand side issues and therefore are complex by nature -required us to use innovative methods.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Emerging Business Foundation and the Anou fair trade proof of concept to help co-design a low-literacy friendly serving grassroots market vendors sell specific agribusiness products to other regions of the country.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

MASCIR, the only research center  in the fields of materials, biotechnology, microelectronics, and life sciences.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Viamo which uses simple, low-cost technology for data collection and for developmental projects delivery via mobile. Our joint solution delivering country-wide digital financial literacy micro-training using Interactive Voice Response (IVR) as a medium to reach out to people with low literacy levels.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Central Bank of Morocco. Ministry of Finance. In process: Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Employment.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Viamo. We are co-designing a digital literacy chatbot suited to the vulnerable low income settings like informality and women micro enrepreneurs.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Joint UNDP-UNCDF Team with whom we launched the SDG Digital Finance Ecosystem Assessment. This collaborative is set to guide policy interventions and investments that propels an inclusive digital economy, the assessments reports will be instrumental for Morocco to create a digital strategy spanning digital finance, social protection, SDG-aligned fintech and digital green bonds.
