## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The experiments [policy pilots] that we implemented, were designed in order to test the best ways to promote the functionalities of a digital engagement platform [www.nrs.mk] that we have set up to promote the process of developing the National Development Strategy. The experiments were conducted for a period of three weeks in 2022, and each of the three experiments tested a different lead generation process, through different channels for promotion. The main focus of the experiments was to test the different ways of promotion, the initial response from the audience, and how they engage with the functionalities of the website. The experiments measured the reach of each communication (impressions), the level of interaction (click through rate/ visitors) and the quality of the visitors engagement (i.e. conversions per visit / actions done on the platform). Three experiments were designed and implemented, including: --&gt; sending targeted emails to Civil Society Organizations, with links and explanations about the platform --&gt; sharing links about the platform in student groups on social media --&gt; advertising campaign on social media.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we can learn what engagement mechanisms work the best for citizens to engage with the digital platform, then we can make them active participants in the public policy making process.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment
- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The designed experiments were meant to test the reaction of the different audiences as well as to test the effectiveness of the web platform www.nrs.mk


> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The experiments measured the reach of each communication (impressions), the level of interaction (click through rate/ visitors) and the quality of the visitors engagement (i.e. conversions per visit / actions done on the platform).

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Website, social media, mail analytics


> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

One month


> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

For this experiment, we had an introductory meeting set with the digital media company in order to explain to them what our idea was, and to go over the six proposals we've had in mind for experiments/policy pilots. After our initial conversation, we had two more meetings to fine tune the idea, and then a final get together to present the results. This happened over a period of one month.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Overall, through all three experiments over 91.700 people were reached out of which more than&nbsp; 1.900 visited the website/platform. The average time spent on site was above 2 minutes and the visitors in average opened 2.3 pages per visit.&nbsp;

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

I would definitely do the experiment longer, and I would use two groups [similarly to how we implemented the CSO group] in order to test different nudges and how they would work for engaging users to the platform.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Between one and two months.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Close to 1000$

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Based on our policy pilots, and their results, we have planned the redesign of the digital platform, and improving its functionalities.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We will present the experiment to the country office, and mindful that there are many digital platforms that we are supporting, we would like to propose that we use these findings, and experiment further on what type of methods engage citizens in these websites.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity.&nbsp;**

> 

www.nrs.mk

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Based on the engagement of citizens with the platform, we now know what segments work, what don't, and what type of reforms we would need to pursue, if we truly want to use this platform to capture citizens feedback about the public policy-making process.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

No major challenges in implementing this activity.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

It gives a very clear picture of how we can improve our digital platforms [and how to invest in them] to make them more user-friendly and interesting for citizens to take part.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

In this particular instance, the national institutions are fairly interested in the results, because we are working in close collaboration with them on this process.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No, no iterations were required.


> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Expand the duration, and use more engagement mechanisms

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

I think this experiment can be replicated for other thematic digital platforms, corresponding to different SDGs


> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

We wanted to try different nudges to test, what type of provocations would get citizens more interested in the platform, and we never fully implemented that. That would've been a great upgrade to the existing activity.

> What surprised you?

The results of the experiments were interesting and to an extent surprising. We learned a lot about the content we need to create to keep citizens engaged in this process.
