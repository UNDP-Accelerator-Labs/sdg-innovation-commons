> Description of the solution

As part of the research GAF (waterproofing manufacturer) installed two roof-level weather stations in the neighbourhood which monitored a wide range of actors, including humidity, wind direction and incoming solar radiation. To monitor streel-level heat, a specially adapted golf cart with sensors travelled around the block and satellite technology and drones were displayed to test how effective the new surface coatings were. The coating project worked closely with community at every stage of the project. Community meetings were held.
