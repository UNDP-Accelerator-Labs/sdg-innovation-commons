The toolkit is a boost for local artist-preneurs. It encompasses a modular technical training system that incorporates wood-carving equipment with video training and woodcraft manual. It hones professional wood-carving skills in schools and other grassroots communities, while promoting an interest in traditional woodcraft as a creative and sustainable business model.
