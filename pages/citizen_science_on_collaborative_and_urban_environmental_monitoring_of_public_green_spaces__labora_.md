## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection. 

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis. 

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process. 
## Overall goal

Characterize, from an open laboratory, citizen engagement and the condition of public green spaces (PGS) in the city of Rosario and Gran Rosario, and the quantifiable relationship between these spaces and the environmental and social needs of the community, and determine minimal conditions and optimal indicators.
## Specific goals

Compile a georeferenced inventory of characteristics and features of selected spaces including size, access, coverage, maintenance level, artificial elements, tree quality, and different cultural, sports, and landscaping elements, and create maps to this end. 

Classify PGS according to their deficiencies and potentialities. 

Analyze the types of community use, behavioral aspects, environmental profile, and perception of PGS. 

Encourage the participation of citizens, civil society organizations, and government bodies in the exploration and consideration of PGS and the development of a useful survey and monitoring methodology. 

Co-design a set of verifiable protocols for the assessment of PGS based on the parameters of territorial sciences and public opinion. 

Raise awareness of the environmental importance, care, and ownership of PGS. 
## Description of citizen participation

Meetings and training are held to address PGS issues and combine collective and individual methods of recording data. Individual mapping notebooks are used to collect data on the relationship between proximity to green spaces and personal satisfaction, and the condition of public green spaces. Group records are also carried out to survey information, such as plant species, the different uses of the public green spaces, etc. Both types of records include aspects, such as gender perspective, accessibility, and inclusion. In addition, the collected data is evaluated, analyzing the following categories: furniture, trees, amenities, design, issues, maintenance, and accessibility.
