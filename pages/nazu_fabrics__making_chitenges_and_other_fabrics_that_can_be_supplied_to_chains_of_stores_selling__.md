> Title of the innovation

Nazu fabrics. making chitenges and other fabrics that can be supplied to chains of stores selling all sorts of fabrics

> Brief description of the innovation

This project is based on offering the country cheap quality fabric and chitenge materials hence help promote the fashion industry in Zambia.
So for we don't have any textile company to manufacturer fabrics which has resulted into having expensive fabrics which has disadvantaged the fashion industry in Zambia.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project once in existence will create job opportunities for the Zambians as well as bring in foreign exchange as most of the Africa countries uses chitenge materials.
Market for chitenges or any other fabric is readily available,traders in most of the shops selling are able to sale 25-35% of their commodities per two days at the expensive rates that chitenges are being sold. But with the coming in of a local textile company which will sell the products at a reduced prices will bring relevance to the business and boost the existing ones because they will be able to buy more.
Wining the challenge prize will help us purchase necessary machines needed to process cotton to fabric as well as setting up a manufacturing plant.

> Technical Feasibility

To run a textile industry you need a team with experience in textile management which Nazu fabrics has.
farmers are the most important people and are the wheels of the factory as they produce the raw material needed.
We will be providing cotton seeds then buy cotton from them.
cotton being a soft absorbent and breathable natural fiber, making it a perfect material for clothing has a process to undergo which sees it been turned from cotton fibers to yarn then into fabrics.
to be able to come up with a quality fabric there machines that are used from gunning cotton fibers to crocheting yarns.
To be able to achieve this 150 hectares of land has being reserved for setting up a factory and other use it as demo farmers.
A team of experience health personals to ensure the plant is controlling pollution is also in place.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project will create atleast 100 direct jobs and over 300 indirect jobs.
It will boost and create business opportunities for many and the products will be sold at an affordable wholesale price hence bringing relevance to the current market.
