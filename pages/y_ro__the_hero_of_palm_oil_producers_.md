Again he, yes him, Yéro Kanté, here he takes on the savior of palm cultivators in the sense that given the difficulty of these in extracting oil properly and therefore to market on a large scale due to the fact that it required transport to processing plants which were excessively expensive, at least for the average producer. Our friend Yéro kate has designed a machine that crushes palm kernels and extracts the oil, bark and seed separately. This solution is of three types: one manual, two other motorized but respectively medium and large capacity. To date, Yéro has managed to make a good situation thanks to the sale of this solution which is very popular with our average growers and which finally allowed him to reach neighboring countries so as to facilitate the sale of his productions. .
