Ecosystem Building for Sustainability Agenda
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to convene unusual stakeholders in the ecosystem to adopt the SDG and impact measurement in the design and implementation of solutions for current societal and environmental challenges. Specifically, we are looking at convening youth and start-ups/SMEs to tackle challenges related to climate change and green sustainable recovery by incorporating the SDG and impact in their endeavors. There are currently 3 ongoing projects for this portfolio- Youth Environmental Living Lab (YELL), MSME Support Solutions Documentation and Showcasing with Islamic Development Bank, and Impact Measurement and Management for National Technology and Innovation Sandboxes for Smart Cities, Energy, and Environment start-ups. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Sustainable Development Goals are not commonly known in Malaysia due to the limited translation and utilisation of SDGs in the local language and narrative. Though the Malaysian government widely adopts the ESG frameworks and regulations for the private sector, much of the efforts are still superficial and done merely as a tick-the-box exercise. The grassroot and start-up/entrepreneur communities are also largely unaware of the SDGs, making efforts to mobilize collective efforts towards the achievement of goals in Malaysia an uphill battle. We recognize that in order to achieve the desired results for climate change and greener economic growth in Malaysia, it requires significant behavioral and systemic changes involving multi-stakeholders. A whole-of-nation approach and breaking the current siloed approaches needs to be a thing in the past. NGOs/CSOs working independently/ in silo - convening ecosystem in YELL of youth and environmental actors.

<div class="group">


> 

Through speaking with start-ups and government agencies, we notice that businesses are largely profit driven and do not think about sustainability as a priority. They also lack expertise in measuring impact and collect the necessary data, which hampers the government from gathering the necessary information to allocate their resources for grants.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

For YELL: The AccLab is uniquely positioned to integrate across programme/portfolio silos (in this case: youth, climate change, and community grant facilities). The AccLab also brings foresight and creative communication into the mix. It is worth investing resources in this challenge because just and inclusive climate/environment futures require a new and fresh take on things. The AccLab has successfully catalysed an operational partnership between UNDP and UNICEF in Malaysia. For NTIS and IsDB: Working with SME and Start-ups in the innovation scene is a new portfolio in the CO, which was also a build-up from AccLab's pilot with MSMEs in Sabah e-commerce. Units in the CO are more used to working with government ministries directly and implementing regulatory and policy programmes that have limited experimentation and proof of concepts. Impact measurement and management and SDG Financing is also a new frontier that CO is exploring and could use more innovation, sensemaking and testing to help shape the course for Malaysia. Accelerator Lab is also in the business of reaching more unusual partners including the start-ups, SMEs and technologists at the grassroots.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The whole-of-society has a part to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), whether you are a young person, a start up or an SME, you can make a positive impact for Malaysia today!

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

NTIS: How might we chart the course for impact technology ecosystem for the start-ups by incorporating SDG and impact measurement in their solutions tackling environmental challenges? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. Pilot and collective intelligence - learning what the perception and understanding of the SDGs and impact of the start-up ecosystem are and sourcing innovative ways to incorporate them into business models through a piloting approach. 2. Solution Mapping - mapping solution from MSME and technology sandboxes with high impact and SDG linkages for scale and possible testbeds with investors globally  3. Regulatory sandboxes- NTIS functions as the regulatory sandbox that tests out innovative tech solutions in solving societal and environmental challenges, which now have SDGs and impact measurement. 4. Smart Cities - We are looking at 3 main sectors that build up the element of smart cities eg. energy, smart city, mobility, and environment solutions. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Data from the business sectors especially from start-ups and MSMEs are often lacking, especially on impact related data of how solutions are aligned and contributing to SDGs.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

IsDB: How might we map and scale MSME solutions that are sustainable and inclusive for post-COVID recovery?

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Collective intelligence and crowdsourcing: We are engaging ministry partners, agencies and accelerators to identify MSMEs with innovative solutions and collect insights from them on the evaluation matrix needed used to select MSMEs for funding and scaling. Horizon Scanning: Desk research and interviews with stakeholders to further understand the current and future gaps and opportunities for MSME. Solutions Mapping and Sensemaking: Interviews and desk research will be conducted to map out innovative solutions and emerging issues among the MSME to frame the showcasing scope.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

YELL: How might we strengthen the ecosystem of youth-led climate and environment advocates? Need to know or understand: who's out there, doing what, and what are their challenges?

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. Positive deviance - who are the youth environment leaders out there and what are they doing?   2. Collective intelligence - learning what the needs of the youth/environment ecosystem are through grassroots consultation and input.  3 & 4.Co-creation and participatory design - co-designing YELL with actors within the ecosystem, such as youth-led environmental organisations. 5. Sensemaking - identifying opportunities through a needs/gaps analysis

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Data-wise, we may adopt a fairly conservative and "old-fashioned" approach to the learning question. The results we want (building up ecosystem maps) are time-consuming but don't necessarily need fancy tech. It's the time investment that's really needed (and which UNDP often doesn't have the luxury of).
