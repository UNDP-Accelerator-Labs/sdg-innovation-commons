## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Collaborating with the entire community is crucial for the success of any intervention aimed at granting women their rights. To effectively overcome social norms and traditional barriers, both men and women must be involved in the process. Merely working with women alone is insufficient in creating lasting change and empowering women to claim their rights. Working with men is crucial because they hold the power and influence in many societies to challenge and change the gender norms that perpetuate discrimination and injustice towards women. By involving men in the process, they can become allies and champions for women's rights, and help to shift societal attitudes towards a more equitable and respectful view of women. 2. The conflict has transformed the power dynamics in communities, particularly those that were previously considered closed and conservative. These communities have become more open, and women have been exposed to various awareness programs that have made them aware of their rights, the inequalities they face, and how they can overcome these challenges. Furthermore, due to the absence of male figures in the family, women have taken on the role of breadwinners and decision-makers, giving them a greater sense of control and agency. As a result, Syrian women are now more likely to demand their rights when equipped with the proper knowledge and support

Accessing communities regarding housing, land, and property rights is a delicate matter in Syria due to the ongoing conflict. To minimize the sensitivity, we decided to specifically focus on women's inheritance rights. To do this, we relied on participants from previous legal awareness programs for our focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KIIs). This approach was chosen as we had already built a level of trust with these individuals, making it a safer and more viable option for addressing the sensitive topic of HLP rights in Syria.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These data sources (KII, ethnography, behavioral insights, FGDs) were essential in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the targeted community, their drivers and barriers and avoiding making assumptions about their behavior. They allowed us to delve into the complexities and nuances of the community and to approach them with a more nuanced and informed understanding.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The use of innovative methods was crucial to the success of our project. The sense-making phase, in the beginning, enabled us to clearly define and understand the behavioral challenge we sought to address. This was achieved through a collaborative process with various stakeholders who supported us in implementing our solution. By incorporating behavioral insights into our approach, we aim to develop behavior-informed solutions, which we will experiment with, and ultimately choose the most effective strategies to design an intervention at the end of the project, aimed at increasing women's access to justice

## End
****

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Partnering with new organizations allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues surrounding women's inheritance rights, leveraging the power of collective intelligence. This holistic approach to learning has provided valuable insights and has enhanced our ability to address the challenge effectively.
