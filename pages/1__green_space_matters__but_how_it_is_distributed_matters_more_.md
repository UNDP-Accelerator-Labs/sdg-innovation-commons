## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Green space matters, but how it is distributed matters more. 2. Better distribution of green space increases accessibility and brings nature closer to us, but this is a double-edged sword—more integrated green space may cause human-nature conflict. 3. Cities are a gateway to understanding and appreciating the complexity of biodiversity and ecosystems. 4. Citizen science is a great way to (re)discover and reconcile with nature.  5. Beyond protecting existing green space, we must create new ones—hand in hand with people and nature.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The frontier challenge attempted to address barriers to urban biodiversity. Shifting public perceptions and attitudes toward urban ecology is difficult, and the action plan encountered (and expected) these barriers. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There are large gaps in the following areas: (1) baseline data on urban biodiversity; (2) understanding of the relationship different types of communities have with "unused"/open spaces in urban settings; (3) and factors that enable successful placemaking work. Citizen-generated data addressed #1; ethnographic data, focus group, and in-depth interviews addressed #2; systems maps and participatory observation addressed #3. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Behavioral insights, ethnography, and systems thinking were part of sense-making and exploration, helping us to map the system of relationships that various urban actors have with urban biodiversity. Citizen Science enabled baseline data collection on urban biodiversity and the ways in which the public perceives it. Gamification was a way of testing and growing the work, by providing a tool for the public to explore design of urban spaces and how vegetation can be employed for different purposes. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Friends of Sungai Klang River Three; Di Sekitar Kita

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Water Warriors (University Malaya)

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Animonsta

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Iskandar Regional Development Authority

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Sekitar Kita was a new and unusual partner, brining experience in citizen science to the CO. Animonsta was another new and unusual partner, being one of our few private sector partners (as opposed to sponsors/clients) and enabling the CO to embark on animated media engagement.
