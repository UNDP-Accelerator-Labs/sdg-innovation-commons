> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

The doormat is made of 100% pure coconut coir, which is one of the strongest natural fibers in the world. The material easily captures moisture, dirt, and other particles. Due to the way our coir mats are cut, sizing may show slight variations. Light shedding may naturally occur when unrolling coir mats out of the package the first time.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

Coconut coir is naturally resistant to bacteria and fungi, making this the most low-maintenance doormat possible. It is also water-resistant, and will dry quickly so you won’t need to worry about mildew or moldy messes. Simply shake it out or vacuum it once in a while, and let the coir do the rest. The rug is designed specifically for both indoor and outdoor use, making it ideal for any room or entryway in your home. Built to last, the durable material will withstand whatever weather or conditions come its way.
