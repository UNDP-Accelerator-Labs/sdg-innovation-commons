Student engagement in online learning has been growing in Bangladesh, specially with the advent of the pandemic. However, data on the trends around it remains scarce. Little is known about the perspectives of youth on the role micro-credentials such as those offered by the massive open online course platforms (e.g. Coursera, Udemy, Edx) can play in addressing the educational and employment challenges, especially in the ICT and BPO sectors. There is much confusion about micro-credentials in Bangladesh, and there is little or no information on what students understand about micro-credentials, what the requirements of students are in terms of the type of courses they want and how micro credentials can meet those needs.   In this context, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab through its study on ‘Exploring Student Perspective on Micro-credentials’ is conducting a university level student survey to understand current use, and the level of interest in micro-credentials, validate specific micro-credential courses which are important specially to succeed in Bangladesh’s growing BPO and IT sector. The study is further investigating the following themes: study habits, learning preferences, experience with online learning, university experiences, post-graduation plans, and career aspirations At least 1000 students from public and private universities are being surveyed.
