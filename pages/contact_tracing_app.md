The idea originated in Singapore through an application called Trace Together, which uses the advantages of a mobile application to help epidemiologists use bluetooth technology to identify a large number of contacts that an infected person had in a very short time. On the basis of bluetooth, the devices exchange fully anonymized mobile ID codes within a range of 2-3m, and the data is stored within the application for the last 20 days or so for the maximum incubation of the virus. The Belgrade company IPification is in contact with the application developers from Singapore and they are working on a potential adaptation of the application for the Serbian market. If the application becomes available for our market, they hope that with the support of mobile operators and the Serbian Government, they will find ways to distribute the application to end users in a short time.
