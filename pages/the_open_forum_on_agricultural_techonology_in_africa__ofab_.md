> Description of the solution

The Open Forum on Agricultural Biotechnology in Africa (OFAB) is a project that aims to increase understanding of agricultural biotechnology in Africa. It does this by facilitating conversations between policymakers, scientists, and the public. OFAB provides accurate information and promotes the benefits of modern biotechnology, such as increased crop yields and resistance to pests and diseases. By engaging with key stakeholders, OFAB helps to inform policy decisions and advance the use of biotechnology in African agriculture. It also includes the establishment and management of a range of platforms to enhance understanding of biotechnology in agriculture for productivity.
