Introduction

In 2023 there was a pervasive feeling that there was little
room for hope.

Headlines recounted a somber narrative of conflict,
displacement and the challenge of coping with the escalating
cost of living. Poverty increased while trust receded. Climate
change continued to accelerate, adding to a rising toll on lives
and livelihoods, changing the way we look at how we survive
and thrive. The world’s interconnected crises still pose a
significant threat to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, ultimately impacting all 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs).

The UNDP Accelerator Labs offer reasons to hope. The Labs
learn firsthand that solutions at the grassroots level are often
working – and working well – in their community contexts.
This 2023 Annual Report “The Labs 2.0: Evolving into a global
research and development capability for the SDGs” highlights
accelerated action towards the SDGs through new ways of
working, new and more real-time data, grassroots solutions
and diverse partnerships in 115 countries of the Global South.
The Accelerator Labs are harnessing the power of research
and development (R&D) to push the boundaries of what is
known and unknown about the biggest problems we face.

With special thanks to founding investors, the Federal
Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development of
Germany (BMZ), and the Qatar Fund for Development
(QFFD), and support from Partners at Core for UNDP,
including the Italian Ministry of Environment and Energy
Security and the Japan Cabinet Office as action partners, the
Accelerator Labs have steadily matured into a fast and agile
Network which is turning learning into action.

The Accelerator Labs Network conducts experiments, creates
prototypes and amplifies grassroot solutions leading to new
value propositions: supporting public sector innovation
capability, evolving approaches to informal and circular
economies, generating AI-informed tourism and tapping into
digital tools for financial inclusion as part of poverty
reduction efforts.

In this 2023 review, the way ahead is clear: the Network is
evolving into an open, globally distributed R&D capability
for the Sustainable Development Goals. (See: Chapter 6,
Looking Ahead: A Global South-driven R&D capability for the
SDGs, pp. 58-59). This Annual Report maps the evolution of
that journey.

What you will find in this report

This report illustrates the enhanced impact and potential for
scale of the Labs as they generate insights and deliver value
for development efforts by UNDP, governments, private and
public sector partners, grassroots innovators, and
marginalized and vulnerable populations.

In this introductory chapter, you will learn about the Labs’
contribution to the SDGs. Chapter 1 presents the insights
and value propositions that emerged from the Network in
2023 and how these enable collective action and help
reimagine global cooperation for sustainable development.
Chapter 2 shows how the Labs have started to shift towards
becoming an open, globally distributed R&D capability for
the SDGs and what are the new avenues to scale insights
and solutions regionally and globally. Chapter 3 describes
the way forward on the creation of an SDG Innovation
Commons backed by the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network
that will support SDG acceleration.

In Chapter 4, partnerships have their chance to shine. The
Accelerator Labs have engaged with more than 1,800
partners at the global, national and local levels. Discover
how they continue to bring on board unusual actors to
collaborate and to reimagine development for the 21st
century. In Chapter 5, the Labs’ top communications
achievements for the past year are presented. The report
concludes in Chapter 6 with a look ahead at the evolution of
the Labs as an R&D function.

Connecting the dots: Bringing the SDGs
back to where they belong

The UNDP Accelerator Labs catalyze localized action and
take an experimental, community-centered approach to
finding development solutions tailored to local contexts. The
Labs engage directly with communities to understand needs
and perspectives, co-design interventions and rapidly test
new ideas and innovations. By fostering grassroots
participation and ownership, the Accelerator Labs
increasingly:

create (near) real-time, contextual and experiential data
on various development challenges;
tap into off-the-radar opportunities to accelerate the
SDGs from the ground up; and
develop and scale inclusive and sustainable development
solutions that leave no one behind.

In 2023, the UNDP Accelerator Labs experimented on 268
unique development challenges impacting and facilitating
linkages across all 17 SDGs with the highest impact on:

SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth: 46
Accelerator Labs worked on this SDG and conducted 58
experiments.
SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities: 36
Accelerator Labs worked on this SDG and conducted 50
experiments.
SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure: 37
Accelerator Labs worked on this SDG and conducted 48

SDGs 5, 8 and 10
The Maldives lacks granular data on island infrastructure and vulnerabilities, hindering disaster preparedness.
To address this, the UNDP Maldives Accelerator Lab engaged volunteers in Maafaru island to create a
participatory map of infrastructure and hazards using digital tools such as Mapillary and OpenStreetMap
alongside paper maps. This collective mapping exercise produced a detailed baseline map and a Hazard,
Vulnerabilities and Capacities (HVCA) map, identifying household risks and resources for disaster response.
Involving locals improved data accuracy and relevance. The maps informed the island's disaster plan and can
support risk modelling by authorities. The experience highlights the value of mo bilizing collective intelligence
to contribute to effective local and national planning and decision making. Moving forward, the Lab aims to
institutionalize this approach across other islands.

SDGs 8, 9 and 11
According to the North Macedonia National Waste Management Plan (2020-2030), biowaste represents 45
percent of the total municipal waste in the City of Skopje. As part of UNDP North Macedonia’s portfolio, the
Accelerator Lab started “Re-Thinking Biowaste” through biowaste audits. They found that transformation of
biowaste can open new opportunities for sustainable business models, new economic activity and innovation.
Through the award-winning endeavor: “BioHack My World,” UNDP, UNICEF and the City of Skopje established
the first BioHacking Laboratory, putting Skopje on the map of cities in Eastern Europe with a state-of-the-art,
open, innovative space. The BioHacking Lab brings science closer to a new community of entrepreneurs,
young people, and other enthusiasts who want to pursue circularity activities with a focus on, but not limited
to, biowaste. More details about the BioHack My World intervention can be read on the website.

SDGs 9, 2 and 13
Smallholder farmers play a pivotal role in Nigeria’s economy, constituting over 90 percent of the country's
agricultural yield, which accounts for around 20 percent of Nigeria's GDP, and employs 36 percent of the
working population. Faced with increasing challenges of dry weather shocks and extreme flooding, farming
communities lack essential data to adapt, minimize waste and mitigate vulnerability to weather shocks. In
collaboration with partners, the UNDP Nigeria Accelerator Lab worked with over 250 smallholder farmers,
providing access to timely weather data, and promoting climate-smart farming practices – improving their
yields by over 100 percent. This initiative not only enhances agricultural productivity in the short term, it also
strengthens the resilience of smallholder farming communities in the face of climate-related challenges.

SDGs 11, 8 and 13
Egypt’s national innovation scene is facing funding constraints, market uncertainties and regulatory
complexities. UNDP Egypt, powered by its Accelerator Lab, collaborated with the Ministry of International
Cooperation and the American University in Cairo for a systems analysis of the national climate tech
ecosystem. Beyond the need for essential policies like public funding, tax credits and regulatory clarity,
creating a conducive legal environment is paramount for scaling start-ups and establishing a robust venture
pipeline. To support climate tech entrepreneurship, insights from the Lab's systems analysis were showcased
at COP28, reaching development partners, government representatives and the private sector.

SDGs 13, 11 and 17
UNDP Bolivia, powered by its Accelerator Lab, partnered with the state governorate of Chuquisaca to pilot
the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to identify mines that are environmental liabilities. Leveraging satellite
technology, near real-time data collection helps identify potential environmental issues across vast mining
areas. The initiative in Chuquisaca focused on digitizing mining royalties and georeferenced mapping of
environmental liabilities using AI algorithms. These experiments signify a technological leap, enhancing
institutional capacities of the governorate, providing timely information for decision making, improving the
delivery of public services related to the mining sector, and facilitating the evaluation of public policies.

Chapter 1

New insights and value
propositions to scale up
collective action and reimagine
global cooperation

Output 1: The Accelerator Labs Network increased
capabilities and ways of working, providing new
insights and value for sustainable development

In 2023, the Accelerator Labs and their partners led the
way in creating decentralized, bottom-up, citizen-powered
and data-driven development solutions. By harnessing
both the capabilities and insights of diverse groups of
people, and the power of data and digital technologies,
they came up with new pathways to tackle problems such
as the climate crisis and waste management, and to seize
digital transformation opportunities for small informal
businesses in the Global South.

Another achievement of the Network in 2023 was the
ubiquitous use of inclusive and participatory
approaches to fill SDG data gaps. This is due to the
unique set up of the 91 UNDP Accelerator Labs. Acting as
a connective tissue, the teams are deeply rooted in and
connected to local communities while being in direct
relation with policy makers and private sector actors. The
data they collect goes beyond ones and zeros to become
insights for decision making.

Thirdly, the Labs demonstrated the value of conducting
and learning from hyper local, low cost, fast and agile
experiments which help policymakers derisk their
broader, more resource intensive programs. Like a speed
boat, the Network can be deployed to test the waters and
map the current for the larger fleet to make informed and
sound decisions.

2023 was also a year of consistently pushing the edge of
knowledge. By zooming out and connecting the dots
between the agile and mature work of the 91 Labs, a
breakthrough happened: the Network started to identify
which data sources bring value for specific sustainable
development challenges, thus positioning the Global
South to explore the use of frontier technology for the
Sustainable Development Goals.

1.1. Creating new data sources
for the first time

In developing countries, scarcity of data impedes effective
policymaking and development planning, making it challenging
to address specific local needs, capture new issues and measure
progress.

Around 90 percent of the data used by the Accelerator
Labs comes from firsthand, primary sources where the
Labs collect and make it available for the first time.

Because some SDG-related datasets simply do not exist, many
Accelerator Labs generated data directly from firsthand sources
such as interviews (in-depth, semi-structured and informal), focus
groups and surveys. Once available, these datasets then become
useful for other practitioners or can help understand other
development challenges.

By grounding experimentation in community knowledge, needs
and experiences, the Labs helped amplify the voices of those
closest to the problem. Ethnographic, observational and
experiential data give policy makers a sense of what is happening
and is often missing in decision-making processes. The Labs are
contributing to filling this gap, as featured in the below snapshot
from the UNDP Paraguay Accelerator Lab.

Data to drive the empowerment of the
garment sector in Paraguay

The UNDP Paraguay Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with the
Municipality and the Association of Garment and Related Industries,
conducted a census of garment workshops in the City of Yaguarón,
Paraguay’s main textile cluster. The census identified 159 workshops in
the city and characterized their access to infrastructure, production
strategies, labor force, employment practices, and markets and
institutions.

This initiative was aimed at collecting primary data to empower the
textile workers to work together while also informing the development of
local industrial policies and strategies. The datasets and results from this
census are now openly available for research, academia and
benchmarking with other industrial policies and sectors.

Making data openly available:
the case of UNDP Serbia

The UNDP Serbia Accelerator Lab’s focus on Artificial Intelligence, the
future of work, women in STEM and migration is leading to unique
insights thanks to new types of data sources. The team is making these
datasets available in the public domain.

For example, their Depopulation Data Challenge helped them uncover
diverse data types from mobile phones, job ads, social media and
satellite information to run predictive modeling of population trends to
inform policy making. This data is now freely available to the public
globally, in Serbian and English languages. The accessibility of this data
encourages individuals and organizations to explore it to garner new
insights to stem depopulation, create opportunities for women in STEM,
drive circular migration and understand the future of work in Serbia.

1.2. Cracking the code: which digital data
for what development challenge?

Along with deep immersion in communities, the Accelerator Labs
have also advanced on mainstreaming data innovation in
development. In 2023, the Accelerator Labs’ global team curated
patterns across the Network, looking specifically at how the Labs
use different new types of data, combined with various advanced
computational techniques, to inform and serve different
development priorities.

use cases for new data in development.

This Sankey diagram shows how broadly categorized data types and sustainable development challenges are connected, as well
as the Labs that are leading in this space.

A main takeaway is that earth observation and remote sensing data,
whether low-quality satellite imagery or high-resolution drone imagery,
are the most used in the Accelerator Lab Network. In 2023, 13 Labs actively
used this data. This is likely due in part to the relative simplicity of
accessing imagery and the maturity of the computational techniques
required to process them.

These data types are often used for agricultural and waste management
purposes, in particular to detect crop diseases (Cameroon and Cabo Verde)
or areas of accumulated waste (Guatemala, the Philippines, Serbia and Viet
Nam), and to generate land use and cover maps (Ecuador and India).

Online comments and posts, mostly on travel websites,
are another increasingly used source of data in the Network. These are
typically used to better understand sub-national tourism dynamics
(Jordan, Malawi, and Tanzania).

1.3. Maturing and evolving the innovation
practice to drive systems change

1
In 2023, the Labs continued to use a diverse set of innovation methods
(on average five per learning experiment) with an uptake of sensemaking,
data visualization, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and
foresight. A noticeable trend is that Labs are increasingly using inclusive
innovation methods. Around 80 percent of learning experiments
conducted in 2023 have employed one or several people-centered design
approaches such as co-creation, participatory design or sensemaking.

What stood out is the Labs’ ability to evolve the practice of core innovation
methods such as collective intelligence. By focusing the work of 16 Labs
on collective intelligence for climate action in 2023, the Network has
created new knowledge on climate adaptation in the Global South while
evolving the application of collective intelligence as a way to build the
future of climate action.

1.

The innovation methods used by the UNDP Accelerator Labs are part of a portfolio of
nearly 40 in total. This list evolves over time as the practice continues to change. See
Annex 1 for a detailed overview, p.61.

Deep Dive:
Empowering Indigenous Peoples
through collective intelligence
for climate action in Bolivia

The Global Climate Risk Index, 2021, places Bolivia as the 10th
most vulnerable country globally, grappling with recurrent
droughts, forest fires and floods. In the last four years, forest
fires and agricultural burning have affected more than 15
million hectares, damaging biodiversity, ecosystems and
livelihoods of rural communities. Yet adaptation planning in
some of the most affected regions such as the Amazon,
Chiquitania and Chaco is complex due to the priorities of local
people who rely on the land for their homes and livelihoods.
The Bolivian government introduced the “Lifesystems” plans
for Indigenous Peoples to include their perspectives in
territorial development and climate adaptation planning.
However, gaps persisted, particularly in representing the
views of Indigenous Peoples communities, hindering the
integration of traditional knowledge into official climate
strategies.

To bridge this gap, the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Bolivia
used collective intelligence to engage Indigenous Peoples
communities and municipal decision makers in deliberative
workshops. The Lab saw an opportunity to support Kaami,
one of the Indigenous Peoples in the Chaco region, by
prototyping a crowdsourcing process to understand the
community’s climate adaptation needs and contribute to
their local Lifesystems plan. This work culminated in the co-
creation of a 3D climate adaptation map which will contribute
to territorial planning developed by the Municipality of Camiri,
with budget allocation reflecting a commitment to connect
the Kaami Lifesystem plan with municipal planning.

"Indigenous Peoples have a heritage of profound
connection with nature, empowering them to live in the
present. Their current challenge lies in integrating
scientific and indigenous knowledge to anticipate the
future and effectively adapt to the climate crisis.”
Patricia Choque Fernandez, Head of Solutions
Mapping, UNDP Bolivia Accelerator Lab

The benefits of this collective intelligence initiative were
profound. It demonstrated the value of developing highly
localized, inclusive climate adaptation land use plans,
empowering Indigenous Peoples to contribute to national
planning. Bringing together Indigenous Peoples
communities, municipal representatives, and the
Plurinational Authority of Mother Earth fostered mutual
understanding and bridged the gap between traditional
and official knowledge.

citizen science, making information more accessible to community
members. Photo: Carlos Arce, UNDP Bolivia.

Understanding water
scarcity in Kenya’s
Tana River County

Extreme weather events have had
devastating effects on the local population
in Kenya’s Tana River County by disrupting
access to fresh drinking water, reliable
irrigation and fishing. The UNDP Kenya
Accelerator Lab is developing a prototype
for a collaborative mapping platform that
seeks to combine data on water
infrastructure in Tana River County from
satellite data, hydrometeorological data,
ethnographic data from the community and
other relevant data sets from related
Government agencies. Insights generated
from the water resource mapping can
support communities and vulnerable
populations to build resilience and adapt to
climate impacts. See the photo essay:
“Water Scarcity in Tana River County.”

The work led by the UNDP Accelerator Labs in
Bolivia and Kenya underscores the potential of
collective intelligence as a transformative tool for
climate action, enabling marginalized communities
to actively participate in shaping resilient and
sustainable futures.

At the forefront: experimenting with
adapting generative AI

2023 was a year of experimentation with generative AI across the
Accelerator Labs Network. UNDP Guatemala, powered by its
Accelerator Lab, tested the potential of generative AI on topics like
participatory budgeting, water usage efficiency, peaceful electoral
processes and the promotion of digital culture to gather initial ideas for
brainstorming sessions on policy interventions and development
programs with relevant stakeholders.

Similarly, the Lab team in Serbia investigated how generative AI models
might replicate gender stereotypes in Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Mathematics (STEM) fields. They prompted the models with terms
like “engineer,” “scientist,” “mathematician” and “IT expert” to see how
women were represented. They found that over 75 percent of images
generated showed men, reinforcing the stereotype of STEM professions
being male dominated. This implies that AI tools alone cannot be relied
on to create more equitable systems.

These early-stage experiments are firstly conducted internally. They are
limited in scope to allow the Labs to learn and experiment before
engaging with external partners.

Signposting to the future with UNDP’s work
on signals and trends

In 2023, the Accelerator Labs contributed to UNDP’s inaugural Signals
Spotlight 2023 report thanks to their active involvement in signal
scanning and foresight. The report provides a comprehensive view of
emerging changes and asks what these might mean for the future of
development.

The Labs identified one in every five signals on the platform, bridging
local insights with global trends. The UNDP Panama Accelerator Lab
for instance, identified signals and trends which helped inform the
redesign of the new country portfolio, particularly in addressing social
cohesion. Looking ahead, the contribution of the Accelerator Labs to
UNDP’s future scanning capabilities will expand further, with Heads of
Exploration from all Labs joining the scanning network, augmenting
UNDP's ability to anticipate and better understand the evolving global
landscape.

1.4. Experiments that help derisk
policy making

In 2023, the Accelerator Labs across the world rolled out small-scale,
cost-effective and fast experiments to test new hypotheses and learn
alongside policymakers what works or what doesn’t in sustainable
development. The results provide decision makers with insights to react,
learn and correct the trajectory of public interventions in a more agile
manner. On average, Heads of Experimentation conduct five
experiments per portfolio.

Space to fail and to learn. Prototyping and proof of concepts help to
understand and address sustainable development problems early on. By
creating a safe, controlled environment where new ideas can be trialed,
the Network has used prototypes to explore the viability of policies and
intervention.

Snapshot:
Collecting and recycling waste.
What works and what doesn’t?

To date, 55 percent of the Accelerator Labs have conducted experiments
to address the issues of waste management and the opportunities of
circularity to provide policy makers with new insights on ways to increase
recycling rates in urban areas and address improper waste management.

For instance, the UNDP Tanzania Accelerator Lab tested whether
satellite data could be used to monitor and quantify waste in the city of
Mwanza. In Guatemala, the Accelerator Lab team investigated if publicly
available satellite images can help to identify the location of clandestine

All three prototypes show not only an accessible and cheaper way of
monitoring waste, but also reveal the existence of new sites that were
previously not registered and thus off the radar of government services.

Another approach to experimentation in the waste management space is
the use of social media messaging to influence waste collection and
recycling. For instance, the UNDP Ghana Accelerator Lab tested the
impact of strategic communication to boost household recycling. These
insights have informed discussions on recycling by the Ghana National
Plastic Action Partnership.

1.5. Sharing insights with the
broader development ecosystem

In 2023, the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network produced 201 blogs and
over 65 publications (global and local) to openly share its learnings and
insights spanning the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the
wider development and innovation ecosystem. Notably, Latin America
and Africa emerged as the regions with the highest number of blog
publications, key indicators of creating public knowledge on innovation
in sustainable development.

For example, the UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab published a report called
“Rural Resilience in Egypt: Exploring finance as a tool,” to share the
results of an exploratory qualitative study conducted with women and
men whose livelihoods depend on agriculture. This publication examines
the notion of rural resilience to inform community-centered solutions to
alleviate poverty in rural Egypt.

Learning in Uncertainty: Tourism Recovery Across Mauritius, Rodrigues
and Seychelles outlines the learning cycle of the UNDP Mauritius and
Seychelles Accelerator Lab and lessons learnt on tourism recovery in
both countries. The report provides a glimpse into the realities of
communities who have coastal and tourism-dependent livelihoods. The
report also demonstrates ways to leverage new and old resources of
intelligence, harnessed at various levels – from government to
grassroots – to understand complex problems, make informed decisions
and find new solutions.

Uncovering the potential of
informal innovation for the SDGs

The UNDP Accelerator Lab Network, in collaboration with Utrecht
University School of Economics Entrepreneurship, MIT Sloan
School of Management and the University of Johannesburg,
conducted the first in-depth study of informal (household)
innovation on the African continent spotlighting grassroots
innovators. It was launched virtually in July 2023, on the sidelines
of the High-Level Political Forum, with more than 200 registered
attendees from Member States, academia, African start-ups and
the wider UN system.

As the first inquiry into informal innovation using internationally
comparable methods for household innovation, it helps fill a
major research gap in understanding informal innovation in
Africa. It sheds light on many informal innovators whose
knowledge could unlock progress toward the Sustainable
Development Goals.

United Nations Innovation Network
(UNIN) Webinar: Scaling social innovation
with the UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab

The Accelerator Labs continued to be invited to speaking
opportunities to share their learning and drive collaboration and
engagement in the wider development and innovation ecosystem.

On November 23, 2023, the United Nations Innovation Network
(UNIN) invited the UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab to share how,
together with e-commerce company Jumia and other partners,
they scaled an innovative digital solution to support the
digitalization of informal market vendors in the midst of COVID-19.
With over 100 participants, 96 percent reported gaining new
insights. The webinar recording is now accessible in both the UN
Innovation Library and on YouTube.

Chapter 2
Embracing a bottom-up R&D cycle,
breaking the scale barrier
Output 2: Sustainable development insights and value
(as products of R&D) will be scaled regionally and
globally as part of UNDP’s programmes

In 2023, the Network shifted towards becoming an open,
globally distributed research and development (R&D)
capability for the Sustainable Development Goals, allowing
it to continuously renew UNDP’s contribution to the future of
development and accelerate impact and scaling nationally,
regionally and/or globally. R&D refers to early-stage
innovations and socialized learning that help define a set of
interventions for systemic change and navigate uncertainty.

The Network started to write this second act by prototyping a
new R&D cycle based on distributed knowledge. It begins with
discerning patterns from the diverse initiatives undertaken by
Labs (from building more resilient foods systems to rethinking
cities) which are then curated so they become open and
publicly available resources that facilitate global learning.

Two examples of such assets
are on the topics of digital
financial inclusion and
national innovation
ecosystems.

This cutting-edge open
innovation approach gave
birth to UNDP Accelerator
Labs-powered value
propositions on emerging
sustainable development
challenges readily available
for national innovation
partners, communities and
governments in the Global
South and offers new
avenues to scale insights
generated by the Labs for
SDG acceleration.

2.1. Cross-country scaling: our bottom-up
R&D cycle in full action

In 2023, we progressed with our bottom-up R&D cycle. Each Accelerator
Lab chooses the directions for its work based on perceived needs and
opportunities in its local context, then shares its work on digital
platforms. By aggregating the work of all Labs into a bigger picture,
emergent coherence appears. In this sense, the Accelerator Labs
Network functions as a global grid of sensors for opportunities to
advance the Sustainable Development Goals.

We call a pattern a situation where Labs across different
contexts work on the same issues. They signal new
demand and new opportunities.

A pattern requires breadth (over 10 Labs involved) and/or depth
(evidence of scaling). Patterns are the first stage of the Accelerator Labs'
R&D cycle, some of the patterns emerging in 2023 were related to
circular economy, foods systems or digital financial inclusion for
instance. Deep dives into patterns are then documented for cross-
country insights, enabling scaling of the learning globally.

Below is a table of the main patterns identified in 2023:

Pattern

Circular economy & climate action

Data and digital innovation

Digital financial inclusion

Food systems

Informal economy

National and public sector innovation

Percentage of Labs
working in this area

80%

18%

25%

20%

26%

75%

Insights are generalizable results from learning.

For example, 16 Labs collaborated in a survey on the use of digital
tools by informal businesses and came to the conclusion that the
"digital breadcrumbs" generated using these tools offer a new
pathway to formalization. (See Chapter 3: Accelerator Labs’ open
research on digital uptake by informal entrepreneurs, p. 32)

While insights are based on evidence from a subset of countries,
some of these insights inform development interventions
elsewhere. Here lies the first building block of the potential for
scale. Backed by insights, the Lab Network then moves on to build a
value proposition, the third stage of the R&D cycle.

UNDP Accelerator Labs Annual Report 2023

21

Value propositions are action-oriented statements on
what the Network learns to respond to emerging
sustainable challenges. They help UNDP and
development partners chart an action-driven journey
from where we are now to where we want to be in
2030.

For example, the Accelerator Labs have demonstrated with evidence
that governments that invest in innovation policies, innovation units
in the public sector and budget lines for innovation, develop a
greater capacity to engage with broader sustainable development
agendas.

UNDP Accelerator Labs Annual Report 2023

22

By investing in support to public sector innovation, then, UNDP can
improve its cooperation with its government partners across the
board. Based on this value proposition, the Accelerator Labs have
contributed key value to UNDP units enriching the organization’s offer
on governance and digital transformation, and connecting with the
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs which
launched, in 2023, a new facility for public sector innovation called
FutureGov.

In late 2023, the Accelerator Lab Network created a value proposition
on financial inclusion through the use of digital tools. It is based on
the work of 26 Labs on finance, 19 of which focused on the inclusion of
groups underserved by both traditional banks and fintech companies.

Snapshot:
Strengthening national innovation ecosystems

In 2023, 75 percent of the Accelerator Labs
responded to governments’ demand to help
develop national innovation policy, map national
innovation ecosystems, or strengthen their
existing innovation capabilities. These Global
South governments attempt to learn from one
another. Most of them turn to UNDP for support
in this learning process.

The Labs ran a survey that shows that
governments that have invested in innovation
learned to absorb new processes and methods
faster and more smoothly. This suggests that
investing in the public sector's innovation
capacity can speed up progress towards the
Sustainable Development Goals.

To help development practitioners and Global
South governments strengthen their national
innovation ecosystems, the Labs created an
open source toolkit.
It contains resources from the highest impact
work they have done in this area. Anyone can re-
use and remix it.

Deep dive:
Facilitating financial inclusion
for marginalized communities
in South Sudan

In South Sudan and Sudan, women living in
borderland areas like businesswoman Bhakita
Ghedai, found a way to support each other amid
tough financial times, an idea that can be traced
back generations to the South Sudanese concept of
“sanduk,” or “box.” Each member deposits money
periodically and the collective lends the pooled
savings to one recipient each cycle.

This simple savings and borrowing scheme was
created out of necessity to scale up small
businesses and help to provide supplementary
income for women who can’t access credit and
suffer from predatory high-interest rates. The
system has helped women across both countries
plan savings as well as raise start-up capital at an
interest free rate.

UNDP Sudan and UNDP South Sudan, powered
by their Accelerator Labs, and the UNDP Africa
Borderlands Centre experimented with a migration
of three sanduks to digital platforms for activities
such as saving, lending and money transfers
among their members.

“This experiment has been a game-changer for
me. It has enabled me to access more loans,
which I used to increase my hotel capacity. I now
have more rooms, which means more business
for me. My fellow traders can now have a
comfortable and affordable place to stay while
conducting their business at Warawar Peace
Market and the digital money has provided
security for my money.” - Bhakita Ghedai

Trained sanduk group members (131 participants in
total, including women, youth and cross-border
traders), received booster packages and small
phones to facilitate the adoption. This shift
contributed to an 80 percent increase in the adoption
of digital platforms by the three experimental
sanduks comprising of 75 participants and offers an
avenue to formalize groups into credit cooperatives.

This first-of-its-kind digital fintech sanduk group
wallet, facilitated by a collaboration with M-GURUSH,
South Sudan’s main mobile money company, now
reaches 1.6 million people in South Sudan.

From local experiments to
a global value proposition

As the Labs move to contribute more
deliberately to UNDP’s R&D function (following
a bottom-up R&D cycle described in this
chapter), they have started to identify a pattern:
over two-thirds of the Labs doing finance-
related work focused on financial inclusion and
relied on the use of digital tools, such as South
Sudan’s digital sanduk experiment.

The Labs then started to connect the dots
which led to the creation of a unique value
proposition: community-based approaches to
saving, borrowing and paying are viable where
traditional financial services are not, because
they can leverage local knowledge and trust.
Supporting, digitizing and connecting them to
existing financial networks is the fastest and
cheapest path to financial inclusion.

discussion with chiefs and stakeholders in Warawar village

needs. Photo: UNDP South Sudan/Buay Tut.

What did the Labs learn along the way?

The Labs’ approach to financial inclusion is
characterized by two key learnings:

1) digital tools are most inclusive when they
are designed to support effective, existing
local practices and local knowledge, such as
the sanduk; and
2) digital instruments work well when
delivered in proximity to community
because the groups most underserved by
finance – women, the elderly and low-
income populations – can greatly benefit
from in-person socialization to financial
literacy.

The success of the sanduk initiative
indicates that it is possible to extend the
approach to neighboring countries in
Africa.

It has the potential to provide access to
credit and banking support for those who
are traditionally unbanked, and thus holds
the potential to lift women and informal
laborers out of poverty.

The UNDP Accelerator Labs produced a toolkit
that serves as a collection of documented
resources. These resources are brief, country-
specific cases describing how to facilitate
digital and financial literacy and improve
access to borrowing, saving, payments and
insurance products for underserved
populations. It is designed to empower
champions of digital financial inclusion to
adapt its ready-made resources to new
contexts and reuse them.

2.2. In-country scaling

In 2023, the Labs handed over a growing number of experiments to
UNDP program teams or policy makers at local, national and
international level, nearly one out of two experiments conducted.
This trend illustrates the increased maturity of the Labs’ work and their
ability to unlock new avenues of scale.

By integrating innovations into government policies, programs and
strategies, 43 percent of learning experiments resulted in
institutionalized changes at the national or local level. By collaborating
with local governments and municipalities, 28 percent of successful
experiments led to replication or expansion across different locations
in the country. Leveraging the specialized expertise and resources of
partners within academia, civil society and the private sector enabled
the uptake of 16 percent of experiments to benefit more people
across wider geographical areas in the country or internationally.

Designing experiments with an emphasis on handover and scale
enables the Labs to validate approaches, achieve greater development
impact, catalyze systems change and mainstream innovations to reach
more people, sustaining outcomes over the long term, thus driving
national transformation.

STORIES OF SCALE
FROM AROUND
THE WORLD

Informal market vendors like this woman experienced a 40 percent increase in daily sales while using the Jumia platform.

Snapshot:
A Lab prototype evolves into
tackling digital transformation
for Uganda

Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, small
businesses in Uganda faced an existential
challenge. Eighty percent of Uganda’s private
sector is informal, and 60 percent of these
informal micro-, small and medium-sized
enterprises (MSMEs) risked going out of
business. In response, the UNDP Uganda
Accelerator Lab worked with Jumia Uganda and
government partners such as the Ministry of
Trade, Industry and Cooperatives, to connect
informal vendors to consumers through Jumia’s
e-commerce platform. To do so, they built the
“Jumia vendor app” to enable digital payments
and contactless boda boda deliveries.

UNDP chose Jumia as a partner to leverage its
well-established platform, brand and logistical
experience. But part of that experience included
a failed attempt to scale a similar pilot in urban
markets, due to the high cost of public goods
investments.

This time, UNDP made critical, market-creating
investments that Jumia couldn’t – procuring
smartphones, airtime and data for vendors, and
hiring young people to help them use the
technology and develop digital literacy skills.

Ultimately, the pilot launched in seven markets
and expanded to 10 in Kampala that enabled
online trading. With support from the UNDP
Chief Digital Office, the pilot also expanded to
two other cities. There are now 4,000 vendors
online, 60 percent of whom are women and
youth. And these vendors have experienced a 40
percent increase in daily sales.

But the Lab team recognized that scaling
e-trade for MSMEs won’t happen in a vacuum; it
requires investing in a system of digital
transformation. To continue the push for scale,
the team is working on several interventions,
including working with government partners on
an e-commerce policy and strategic plan, and a
digital transformation roadmap that will tackle
key pillars such as skilling, e-services, security,
infrastructure and big data.

In 2022, Madaba became the Arab Tourism Capital, attracting
international visitors but facing low local attendance. In response,
UNDP Jordan powered by its Accelerator Lab collaborated with
Madaba's Tourism Directorate and the Municipality to boost tourism
and the local economy.

The Lab mapped and analyzed tourism offerings yielding valuable
qualitative insights, typically unavailable to decision makers, such as
conducting a sentiment analysis of 70,000 TripAdvisor reviews. They
conducted immersion trips to co-create tourist offerings with youth
and other local stakeholders. Scaling efforts involve sharing insights
with the government and expanding prototypes to other Jordanian
governorates. Similar interventions in Aqaba city and discussions with
municipalities in other regions are ongoing, highlighting UNDP
Jordan's role in generating new actionable insights for tourism.

Co-creating a Smart Solar Dryer
for women entrepreneurs in Malaysia

As a winner of the Japan SDGs Innovation Challenge, the UNDP
Malaysia Accelerator Lab received funds to address the economic
recovery of Sabah, the country's poorest state, hit hardest by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing the key challenge for rural
entrepreneurs: lack of affordable and clean energy, the Lab
collaborated with Penampang communities, alongside Japan’s AGC
Green Tech and TONIBUNG. Together, they co-created an affordable
“Smart” Solar Dryer prototype, addressing market issues like high
costs and inefficiency.

The open-source blueprint costs less than US$1,000, in contrast to
existing solar dryers at around US$4,000, and its schematic design is
openly available as a public good. Piloted successfully in Sabah, the
initiative expanded to three more locations in 2023. The Lab is now
developing a modular Smart Solar Dryer Prototype 2.0, with more
capacity and higher energy efficiency, while training programs and
scaling pilots support around 100 women entrepreneurs. The Smart
Solar Dryer not only tackles energy challenges but empowers rural
communities, turning produce into high-value products, contributing
to sustainable economic development.

Developing the digital identification system
and supporting the national digital strategy in
Trinidad and Tobago

The Trinidad and Tobago government sought UNDP’s support for their
objective of driving digital transformation. The UNDP Trinidad and
Tobago Accelerator Lab conducted a Digital Readiness Assessment,
which established baselines, benchmarks and milestones for digital
development, and developed a Digital ID proof of concept in just three
months.

This partnership led to an US$8 million investment, funded by CAF
Development Bank, for UNDP Trinidad and Tobago to implement the
National Electronic Identification System and digitalize critical
government services. Another key achievement was the development
and launch of the National Digital Strategy in collaboration with the UN
Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), a significant milestone in the
country's digital transformation. This strategy not only addressed
immediate digital challenges but also established a foundation for
future digital infrastructure in the next 10 years, facilitating
connectivity, shaping new industries and opportunities, and ensuring
that public services can reach even the most remote areas.

The UNDP Serbia Accelerator Lab incubated the Returning Point
initiative, aimed at tapping into the vast potential of Serbia's four
million diaspora members.

This initiative was a key part of UNDP Serbia's strategy to counter
depopulation, focusing on helping individuals reintegrate into Serbia
or connect with local opportunities from abroad. The pilot evolved
from a Lab-supported program into an independent, financially self-
sustained organization, setting a replicable model for diaspora
engagement, and a close collaboration with national government,
including the establishment of a new fast-track residency procedure
and the introduction of diaspora-targeted loan programs.

Chapter 3
Paving the way for the creation
of a global innovation commons
for sustainable development
Output 3: The global learning network supports an
SDG Innovation Commons driving public domain
experimentation, inquiry and investments to
unleash action on sustainable development.

To make progress toward the SDGs in an increasingly
complex world, the need for open research and development
(R&D) is clear. It fuels continuous exploration and
experimentation and accelerates impact and learning, in
partnership with other changemakers.

This is where the vision of the SDG Innovation Commons,
backed by the UNDP Accelerator Labs, a Network of social
innovation teams sourcing innovations from over 100
countries in the Global South – is starting to become a reality.

In 2023, the Network further evolved as a globally
decentralized R&D function, articulating a unique “R&D for
the SDGs” manifesto, opening up a catalogue of thousands of
grassroots solutions and sharing open data and results of
early experiments to pave the way for the creation of a global
innovation commons for sustainable development.

The Accelerator Labs’ approach to an open R&D function rests
on the understanding that development is not exclusive to
the select few, but a common good that is created from the
bottom up and facilitated by the people for the people.

3.1. Defining our approach to open R&D to
support SDG acceleration

In 2023, the Labs Network has started to define what open R&D for
sustainable development for UNDP means across all five regions —
Africa, the Arab States, Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, and
Latin America and the Caribbean — and why UNDP and the ecosystem
need it. The result of this reflection led to an activation strategy for open
R&D anchored on five key values seen in the graphic below.

UNDP Accelerator Labs Annual Report 2023

This activation strategy helps define the Network’s way of doing R&D
and provides a clear path to explore and scale with broader social
innovation ecosystems. Open R&D can position UNDP at the cutting
edge of key issues, enabling novel approaches to address
development issues.

3.2. Acceleration campaigns to speed up
learning and action on emerging and pressing
development challenges

In 2023, the Lab Network ran targeted campaigns to speed up learning
and action and generate cross-country value for the Sustainable
Development Goals.

Firstly, they continued to build on the PeoplePowered energy campaign
as a contribution to UNDP’s Strategic Plan, which aims to mobilize
partnerships for sustainable, reliable and affordable energy for 500
million people by 2025. Secondly, through learning devoted to
digitization in the informal economy, the Network released new and
open knowledge on how to forge a more inclusive economy for
vulnerable workers in the Global South, many of whom are women.

UNDP Accelerator Labs Annual Report 2023

employed. In these regions, women are more likely to use digital tools in their businesses, and are more likely to own a fully informal
business. Photo: iStock.

Snapshot:
Accelerator Labs’ open research
on digital uptake by informal
entrepreneurs

The UNDP Accelerator Labs have detected an
emerging trend: informal businesses across the
Global South are embracing digital tools. This is
important news because the informal sector
accounts for 60 percent of the world's jobs, and as
many as 90 percent in the lowest-income regions.
This shift to digital could open new opportunities to
learn about and support inclusion for vulnerable
informal workers in the Global South, many of
whom are women.

To make these results findable and reusable by
development practitioners across the globe, the
Labs prototyped tapping into data sharing
standards in 2023.

They published a report called “How is the Digital
Transformation Affecting Informal Businesses in the
Global South?” and shared publicly the results of a
survey on the use of digital tools by informal
businesses conducted by the Labs in 13 countries –
namely Bangladesh, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia,
Fiji and Vanuatu, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico, Morocco,
Namibia, Peru, Syria and Uzbekistan.

The report and its dataset were published on a
repository serving the global research community
using open licenses (Creative Commons) and open
standards (Data Package). To date, thousands of
page views and downloads have been recorded,
demonstrating the potential that open repositories
of insights and data hold for inquiry, analyses and
contributions from academia, governments, civil
society and private sector partners.

3.3. Opening up a catalogue of grassroots
innovation as a vehicle for scale

Since its inception, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network has mapped
more than 6,000 grassroots solutions locally, from which more than
3,700 are curated on a global Solutions Mapping Platform. While not
all mapped solutions represent scalable products – some are
knowledge artifacts or community practices – most of these are
home-grown or community-led solutions that have never been
codified, or applied elsewhere (Chapter 2, Ecuador deep dive, pp. 34-
35). These customized solutions are often frugal and, given their
proximity to the problem, hold specific insights that external
designers might overlook.

As part of this evolution towards an open SDG Innovation Commons,
the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network can share openly 1,480
solutions (40 percent of the 3,700 globally mapped solutions). To
support the diffusion of such innovations, they will become freely
accessible to an outside audience over the course of 2024.

Diversity and geographic distribution of solutions
mapped by the Network to date

Heatmap of the +3,700 solutions revealing that 43 percent of solutions are identified in rural areas – areas that usually have little
agency in development practice. Darker areas in regions such as Central America, Eastern Europe and the Pacific Islands indicate higher
solution density, while lighter areas in North America and Northern Europe indicate lower density.

Preserving ancestral
knowledge in growing
medicinal herbs in Ecuador

In the hustle and bustle of the busy market in Quito’s
San Roque, women hierbateras work around the clock
to grow and sell medicinal plants like chamomile,
anise, calendula and hundreds of others.

The methods that medicinal herb foragers and
growers use to reap and to find these plants are from
indigenous, traditional knowledge that has been
handed down through the generations. The
hierbateras currently have reason to worry about their
precarious livelihood and their ancient practice. They
fear the knowledge will disappear as younger
generations seek other trades. They worry about the
future of the market, which has been threatened by
urbanization, and about disappearing plant varieties,
as climate change disrupts the ecosystem.

The UNDP Ecuador Accelerator Lab learned
firsthand from these women of the May Day Central
Platform, the most important wholesale market in
Quito for the commercialization of medicinal plants,
and aided municipal authorities in making better
policies surrounding the future of the market and the
hierbateras.

The Lab worked with over 100 herb vendors, 30
students, alliances with academia, museums, the
private sector and the municipality. The aim was to
make the medicinal plant trade more resilient,
amplify ancestral practices, reduce waste created in
the marketplace, gather data on the herb trade and
facilitate knowledge exchanges between innovators
and the hierbateras on best practices for growing,
dehydrating and selling the herbs. Finally, the Lab
set out to create “blueprints” for innovations created
to streamline plant production so that the learning
can be scaled to other contexts.

The Accelerator Lab also crowdsourced a
catalog of over 100 medicinal herbs, then
had the list validated through traditional
medicine men. As the first time this has been
documented, the catalog preserves the
traditional Andean medicine of Ecuador and
helps the women showcase their plants at
market for better sales.

Innovation by design to
improve livelihoods

The pilot interventions in Ecuador were designed with
the people closest to the problems. Hierbateras,
mostly women over 60-years-old like Fanny Asimbaya,
had a say in the way that their problems were
addressed, and the municipality could see immediate
results in waste reduction, market organization and
improvements all along the value chain, from the herb
gatherers, to producers, farmers and sellers.

Open-source DIY innovation:
an irrigation solution for gardens on steep land

Image from the open-
source blueprint of
the irrigation system
designed by Bryan
Vargas.

Picture it: To water a 1,000-metre garden on a steep volcanic
mountain takes three people a total of 15 hours of work. In
summer, the garden loses half its crop. With the support of
the Lab, Bryan Vargas, a 23-year-old innovator from the
National Polytechnic University worked to help herb farmers
improve irrigation techniques. He created an irrigation
method that uses a humidity sensor to measure soil
moisture and avoid excess water.

The farmers were able to reduce the time and effort
spent watering and to increase the health of their yield.
For example, on one plot, the person/hour requirement
was cut in half and water consumption decreased by 24
percent, bringing in water efficiency and savings. Bryan’s
irrigation system is now available as an open-source
blueprint providing a step-by-step guide to this low-cost
solution for the SDGs.

Lesotho finds a nature-based solution
for food security

Motseki Ratefane, a farmer based in the Mafeteng district of Lesotho
near the border with South Africa, owns a 500-600 square meter plot of
land where he grows a variety of vegetables like maize, spinach and
cabbage. He developed his own innovative method of using crushed
“elegant grasshoppers” as a natural pesticide to deter pests from his
crops. The UNDP Lesotho Lab unearthed this solution when they
realized that Motseki’s crops were much healthier than other crops in
the area. Together with the National University of Lesotho, the Lab
confirmed that the crushed grasshopper solution far exceeds the
speed and performance of commercially found pesticides.

This bottom-up and nature-based solution may have scaling potential
in the Horn of Africa where these insects swarm across countries,
reproduce rapidly, and pose a challenge to the region’s food security
while causing harm to farmers' livelihoods.

3.4. Early-stage results paving the way
towards the SDG Innovation Commons

By sharing their work and insights out loud, and making the results

Samamma, farmer and innovator
of a climate resilient seed storage

Samamma of Bidekanne Village in the Sangareddy
district in the southeast region of Telangana, has
been practicing traditional farming for over three
decades. Samamma has been using a unique seed
storage method that she created – bamboo
baskets coated with a mixture of cow dung, neem
leaves and cow urine – that has helped her and
other farmers in her village store their seeds for up
to a year before sewing. She has been growing
over 100 crop varieties, but many were becoming
extinct due to climate change and the lack of seed
storage structures in the village.

“Seeds stored in these baskets remained safe
and we could sow them after the rains
receded and realize good profits. These seed
baskets make us independent from the
private seed companies and reduce the cost
of seeds and our overall cost of cultivation.”
- Samamma

Deep dive:
Building a digital public good for
climate resilient farming in India

Samamma's practice of conserving indigenous climate
resilient seed varieties was one of 25 climate resilient
agriculture practices that the UNDP India Accelerator Lab
and partners surfaced in 2023. Such community practices
are identified on the ground using a methodology called
Data Powered Positive Deviance, to support community-
centric (bottom-up) policy making in agriculture.

Using what they learned in the field, the Lab initiated a
collaboration with the State Government of Telangana to
experiment with a digital commons capable of delivering
agricultural intelligence on climate resilience and
vulnerability at the village and farm level across all the 10
million hectares of land in the state.

Using an initial seed investment of US$20,000 and
support from UNDP Asia’s innovation team, the Lab
formed partnerships with over 100 volunteering data
scientists and 14 organizations (including research
organizations like ICRISAT and Tilburg University) to build
a data collaborative model to prototype the Data in
Climate Resilient Agriculture (DiCRA) platform.

A public domain experiment

After rigorous evaluation, DiCRA was accredited as a first-of-
its-kind Digital Public Good for Climate Resilient
Agriculture by the Digital Public Goods Alliance. DiCRA
leverages Artificial Intelligence, remote sensing, and pattern
detection algorithms using open satellite data to assess the
climate resilience of farms, providing about 20 agriculture
parameters that help decode crop health, crop stress and
soil conditions across 50 million hectares of agriculture land
in the seven states of India.

DiCRA is guided by the digital public good principles of open
access, open software, open code and open AI which make
it easy to scale. It is “plug and play” for any other geography
in the world. Through the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network,
DiCRA has received scaleup interest from 10 countries in
Africa, Asia and South America.

While the initial prototype serviced 10 million hectares of
land, within a span of six months and the financial support
of the Rockefeller Foundation and the Government of Japan,
the Lab successfully scaled DiCRA from one state to seven
states in India - extending its reach to 50 million hectares of
agriculture land.

Recently, the Lab handed over DiCRA to the National Bank
for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the apex
agriculture development bank in India, who intends to scale
DiCRA country-wide across all 28 states and to use the data
from the platform for data-driven policymaking and
decision-making, including informing their climate portfolio
of approximately US$150 million.

“We see the DiCRA platform as an enabler to
support our role as the largest development
bank in India, in an effective and efficient
manner. In fact, we are now in the process of
digitizing almost 100,000 farmer cooperatives
so they can avail advisory service support”
-- Shaji K.V, Chairman India’s National
Bank for Agriculture and Rural
Development

DiCRA works because it combines both top down and
bottom-up approaches. The technology informs which
geographies are positively deviant over long horizons of
time while ethnography reveals positive deviant farmers
and resilient agricultural practices so both can inform
policies. By delivering valuable data-driven insights as
open source, DiCRA is driving sustainability, collective
action and long-termism in agriculture.

These insights are being used to inform the design of
agriculture programs on climate resilience, directing
more investment towards areas of high vulnerability
while learning from successful resilient geographies and
farms. DiCRA has proven its scalability, servicing climate
action across vast geographies in India.

Chapter 4
Partners, an engine for scaling
the results of experiments

The UNDP Accelerator Labs are a strong convening power for UNDP
and beyond, as they bring together a unique coalition of actors with
a common vision to help spearhead new experiments, tap into novel
data sources and experiential knowledge, test and develop
prototypes and allow room for the R&D element of trial and error.

Since its inception, the Accelerator Labs Network has engaged with
over 1,800 partners at the global, national and local levels,
demonstrating the Network’s ability to attract and engage with
unusual development and innovation actors.

In 2023, the Network doubled down on its engagement with mobile
phone operators, energy companies, start-ups, banks and financial
institutions, tech or digital products and services (e.g., drone or
satellite imaging companies), academia and research institutes –
both local and global – plus informal sector groups (for example,
vendor associations, women’s market collectives, waste pickers),
social enterprises and innovation hubs.

Partners across the
Network in 2023

To date, more than a third
of all private sector
partners are with new
partners and nearly one
out of two partners from
civil society are new to
UNDP.

4.2. Global knowledge partners

Through experimental and exploratory activities in 115
countries, the Network often spots leads for action that develop
into emerging R&D priorities on a global scale. The Labs
unearth potential research agendas for academic and private
sector partners. For instance, they partnered with Ikea Social
Entrepreneurship and Ashoka to look at the intersection
between circular and informal economy, Columbia’s School of
International and Public Affairs to study mis- and
disinformation, and collaborated with Utrecht University
School of Economics Entrepreneurship, MIT Sloan School of
Management and University of Johannesburg on the first
internationally comparable study of household innovation on
the African continent. (See "Uncovering the potential of
informal innovation for the SDGs" in Chapter 1, p. 19)

Ikea Social Entrepreneurship and Ashoka:
learning about the intersection of informal
& circular economies

The Accelerator Labs partnered with IKEA Social Entrepreneurship
and Ashoka to advance an R&D agenda on the role of informality in
circular economies. The focus is to collectively learn how
unregistered small-scale businesses and informal workers (who
make up 85 percent of Africa's economy) contribute to economic
models that prioritize the continuous utilization of products
and material, rather than their disposal. Ashoka’s community of
over 4,000 leading social entrepreneurs from 95 countries and
IKEA’s network of co-workers across the globe, joined the UNDP
Accelerator Labs to surface robust insights from social
entrepreneurs and communities to design more circular supply
chains. The partners organized two “learning circles” sessions in
2023, which brought together over 100 participants from different
backgrounds (social entrepreneurs, IKEA co-workers, the UNDP
Accelerator Labs Network), to codify insights towards a circular
economy. The insights from the learning circles will be shared
publicly in 2024.

With the support and engagement of the Japan Cabinet Office and
advisory of the Japan Innovation Network (JIN), the Japan SDGs
Innovation Challenge has enabled UNDP to generate new insights to
make progress on sustainable development challenges across seven
countries. This has been achieved through collaborative experiments
led together with private sector entities from Japan.

This partnership shows how matchmaking between development
problems and private sector expertise can test out new ways of
working and create market intelligence.

Using emerging
technologies to
tackle threats to
food security in
Zimbabwe

In 2023, the UNDP Zimbabwe Accelerator Lab partnered with Pegara,
a Japanese start-up specializing in AI and automation, to test out ways
to protect small grain production.

The red-billed quelea is a small brownish bird that is endemic to Africa.
Queleas are the most populous bird on earth with around 1.8 billion
birds estimated in the wild. They destroy at least 40% of traditional
grains in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Zimbabwe, the quelea bird is a major
threat to food security as it damages small grains such as millet and
sorghum. Unfortunately, the only way to control quelea birds is through
spraying Fenthion, a chemical toxic to humans and other animals and
plants.

From chasing birds away with drones…

The Lab and Pegara conducted a series of field tests in partnership with
Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Agriculture and National Parks and Wildlife to find
out the best deterrence mechanisms for quelea birds. After testing
sounds, scattered lasers and drones, it concluded that drones were the
most effective method to chase away quelea birds from fields.

Over a period of 10 months the team conducted six field missions which
resulted in the development of a prototype called “Bird Shield.” Bird
Shield is a system which uses an AI-powered camera to automatically
detect quelea birds and chase them from fields using drone swarms. Bird
Shield would allow rural farmers to save 100 percent of time lost to
scaring quelea birds and make significant savings on the amount of grain
lost while preventing the use of Fenthion. The main obstacle remains the
cost of Bird Shield which is too high for most farmers. Pegara is currently
working with local drone companies to bring it down.

... to catching them with traditional nets

While they were in the field, the Lab team and Pegara came across a
group of men who have been using homemade nets to capture quelea
birds for years. Mapping this local knowledge led to a new focus area on
working with the quelea catchers to improve their approach. Currently,
due to limitations in net design and the bird-catching process, the men
can catch a maximum of 50,000 quelea birds per night, which falls short
of market demand as quelea is big business in southern Zimbabwe.
Traders, mostly women, buy quelea at $1 for 50 birds and sell them fried
at $1 for 8.

Over the course of 2023, the team continued data collection and training
of the AI algorithm to improve its accuracy in detecting quelea swarms.
They also started to collaborate with the University of Zimbabwe on R&D
challenges to enhance the netting system, aiming to double the nightly
catch of quelea. The Lab and Pegara plan to continue the scaling of the
tested solutions in 2024 with the support of the Japan Cabinet Office.

From fish waste to high quality leather
goods in Samoa

An experiment in Samoa is creating the means to transform fish
waste into fish leather for wallets, purses and more. This
collaboration between the UNDP Samoa Accelerator Lab and Think
Sea Corp (Tototo Fish Leather Brand) tested how to turn fish waste
into leather. This partnership experimented with using Samoa’s fish
skin waste as a new value chain and a new income stream for local
fishing communities. Tototo spent a total of 50 days on the small
island and worked with communities on fish leather production
techniques, leather processing and business models to accelerate
the commercialization of fish leather in Samoa for the Japanese
market.

4.4. National and regional partners: from
scaling knowledge to co-financing
cutting-edge programs

From research institutes and other UN entities to members of the
national and regional innovation ecosystems, multiple actors work
together with the Labs to surface new data and intelligence that
help inform and shape UNDP portfolios and programs. Notably,
some of these led to substantial financial investments.

In 2023, the UNDP Accelerator Labs
attracted and nurtured 302 new partners.
Almost half of them are considered new
to UNDP and nearly a quarter are from the
private sector.

Collaborating with UNICEF Tanzania to explore
futures where waste is a valuable asset

After winning the Greenshark Innovation Challenge in 2022, UNDP
and UNICEF in Tanzania co-launched WasteX Lab to change
perceptions of waste and drive the circular economy on the
archipelago of Zanzibar.

UNDP Tanzania, powered by its Accelerator Lab, together with
the State University of Zanzibar and UNICEF engaged with
enterprises, predominantly led by youth and women, to design and
implement solutions addressing the pervasive and systemic issues
surrounding solid waste management in Zanzibar. The initiative
combines human-centered design, behavioral science and digital
technologies to foster peer-to-peer knowledge exchange,
experimentation and business growth.

As a result of the technical and financial assistance provided through
the initiative, 40 Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) have
successfully generated a total of 1,070 green jobs, 59 percent of
which are for women. The SMEs involved in this program specialize
in the recycling and upcycling of both organic and inorganic waste
materials to manufacture products such as plastic paving blocks,
organic fertilizers and bio-briquettes, thereby contributing
significantly to environmental sustainability and economic
development.

Innovation in crisis – Engagement with German
Development Cooperation actors to bring solar
power on the go in Sudan

In Sudan, the UNDP Accelerator Lab conducted experiments with the
“Solar-in-the-Box” prototype since 2021 to fill gaps in digital and energy
access. This solar-powered module provides energy to a mobile cellular
connectivity tower, which can expand into a mini grid.

The success of the experiment resulted in a grant partnership agreement
of EUR 2.5 million with the German International Cooperation (GIZ). As the
prototype can be reconfigured for specific contexts, this partnership aims
to support the recovery of micro and small enterprises owned by women
in communities affected by conflict and scarcity. GIZ and UNDP Sudan plan
to deploy Solar-in-a-Box in 2024 in three states, targeting 3,300 women.
Scaling up this innovation involves private sector partners, including
national mobile network operators and energy service companies. These
units will power three "smart" facilities equipped with electricity and
internet access, serving as safe spaces for peer-to-peer learning, digital
literacy and business collaboration, thereby empowering women and
displaced persons to rebuild and support their businesses.

Toward a systemic approach
for the circular economy in
the Philippines

The UNDP Philippines Accelerator Lab has
applied a portfolio approach and systemic
design to move towards a circular economy in
the country, beginning with Pasig City. Waste,
including plastic and other marine litter, is
among the most pressing environmental issues
in the Philippines. The country’s waste
generation has increased steadily and is
expected to reach 77,776 tons by 2025, with
Metro Manila generating the largest volume.
This waste, particularly plastic waste, leaks into
waterways. Changing this unsustainable status
quo requires a dramatic shift towards
sustainable production and consumption. This
entails the transition towards a circular
economy: where waste is avoided in the first
place, properly managed and redirected back
into the economy.

To start unpacking this complex issue, the
UNDP Philippines Accelerator Lab collaborated
with the Japan Manned Space Systems Corp.
(JAMSS) as part of the Japan SDGs Innovation
Challenge in 2021-2022.

The objective was to test new approaches to
monitor marine litter leakage using remote sensing
and improve how data is collected, analyzed and
considered in policymaking and enforcement.

The work of UNDP Philippines on circular economy
through a systems lens drew an additional
investment of US$2.9 million from the Japan
Supplementary Budget to the program
“Accelerating Nationally Determined Contributions
through Circular Economy in Cities (ACE).” This
program entails the use of data analytics and policy
support at national and subnational levels,
implementing various systemic interventions for
circularity in five cities, and deepening knowledge
exchange. Systemic interventions include data
innovations, behavioral change campaigns,
investment in technology and equipment, and
capacity building for entrepreneurs, local
government officials and other circular economy
actors.

In addition, the portfolio work of the Lab in tackling
circular economy has attracted co-financing for
UNDP Philippines via a EUR 60 million investment
from the European Union, kickstarted through the
Green Economy Program in the Philippines. This
ambitious program will be implemented in 2024 by
a consortium including UNDP, GIZ, Expertise France
and the International Finance Corporation (World
Bank Group), with UNDP responsible for
implementing local circular actions.

As a means of survival for many women in the islands of Cabo Verde,
illegal sand gathering for construction remains a common practice. The
women wake at dawn and enter the ocean with just a shovel and a
bucket to gather sand to sell. The UNDP Cabo Verde Accelerator Lab
supported “Sumara Maré,” a film that tells their story and shows the
trade’s impact on nature, their health and the economy. The message
unfolds through a dance performance and voiceover by the women

Sparking sharing with levity: a Network-driven
crowdsourcing initiative for World Creativity and
Innovation Day

For World Creativity and Innovation Day on April 21st, 2023 the Labs
engaged audiences in a new way. They experimented with a bottom-
up co-creation campaign called “Caption This,” inviting the Network to
craft their own captions and share their perspectives on innovation
and creativity using the #InnovatorsUnite hashtag across social
media. Inspiration for this came from the Labs’ WhatsApp groups
where team members share insights, questions, ideas and laughs.

Sn apshot:
Hosting an Instagram Live

The launch event of the publication
“Making the Invisible Visible: Informal
Innovation in South Africa” was followed
by an Instagram Live session featuring
Siphiwe Zuma, an informal innovator
featured in the report, who shared his
entrepreneurial journey in creating an
inclusive umbrella in South Africa.

This innovative approach supported the
disseminating insights and strengthening
of the innovation ecosystem in Africa.

Along with a global press release, this
event was promoted in various formats
through UNDP Accelerator Labs’ digital
channels such as X (ex-Twitter), LinkedIn,
Instagram, and YouTube which received

Chapter 6
Looking ahead: A Global
South-driven R&D capability
for the SDGs

The way forward for the UNDP Accelerator Labs is converting
our learning from experimentation in 115 countries into
practical global action to move from SDG innovation to SDG
achievement.

The aim is to move towards a distributed “Research and
development (R&D) function within UNDP’s Country Offices
around the world to ensure continuous exploration and
experimentation related to evolving sustainable
development challenges,” as per the recommendation of the
2021 Midterm evaluation.

As this report illustrates, the Labs Network has started to
transition into an open and global capability for R&D on
the Sustainable Development Goals. What began in 2019
as a temporary initiative to inject new ways of working into
UNDP is now becoming the backbone of UNDP's R&D
function, enabling UNDP to learn from women and men
living in poverty and facing the effects of climate change to
build out new solutions which reimagine development for
the 21st century.

Many accolades are due to the UNDP Accelerator Labs’
founding investors, the Federal Ministry for Economic
Cooperation and Development of Germany and the Qatar
Fund for Development, and the support from Partners at
Core for UNDP, including the Italian Ministry of Environment
and Energy Security and the Japan Cabinet Office as action
partners – who believed in the power of exploratory work for
the Sustainable Development Goals and to whom we look as
we broaden partnerships for the next chapter towards open,
global and distributed R&D through an SDG Innovation
Commons.

UNDP Accelerator Labs Annual Report 2023

2024-2025 foresees a deeper transition towards the SDG
Innovation Commons (see chapter 3), a space for public
domain experimentation to unlock progress on what is
needed to reach the goals set in Agenda 2030. To usher in
this transition, the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network will focus
on opening its platforms, solutions and experiments so
the knowledge, data and insights gathered will become
available publicly. Opening up our data lays the foundation
of an SDG Innovation Commons Exchange Suite.

In 2024, the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network will codify its
approach to R&D and test out the distributed R&D Cycle (see
chapter 2) to turn knowledge on emerging niches into global
action that advances the Sustainable Development Goals,
and navigates uncertainty on the road to Agenda 2030.

First, the network will build coalitions around digital
financial inclusion, food systems, circular economy and
information integrity as areas of emergent demand in the
countries of the Global Majority and where we have a higher
probability of driving systems change.

Second, the Network will also develop a toolkit of R&D
practices that have emerged over the past five years in the
Lab Network driven by the three roles of Heads of
Exploration, Experimentation and Solutions Mapping. This
will serve as documentation of the approaches to embed
these practices in UNDP, attract public visibility and create a
public repository of R&D approaches.

With open innovation as a scaling strategy, the corollary
agenda is to integrate the R&D function, which has been
modelled by the Accelerator Labs into UNDP. The Accelerator
Labs have become core to the organization’s capability for
renewal in light of emerging circumstances, the complexity
of operating environments and the need to evolve its
organizational niche and value add as part of the effort to
“reimagine development for the 21st century.” The results of
R&D thus far will inform UNDP processes to review progress
towards its strategic plan (2022-2025), and look towards the
final plan on the road to the SDGs.

Looking for a new round of partners

Sometimes it can be hard to find reasons for optimism when it
comes to a fair and sustainable world. Here’s one. Looking
globally, the energy, solutions, networks and initiatives are
actually vibrant, but they are not operating in concert or at
scale. Connections, recombinations and handovers among
partners is now no longer a luxury. SDG open innovation will be
a priority in 2024 in order to unleash actionable partnerships,
curated but not necessarily brokered by UNDP, to accelerate
learning on what it will take to achieve the Agenda 2030
Sustainable Development Goals.
