1.   Climate change induced disasters such as tropical storms, cyclones and monsoon floods are recurring events in Bangladesh. Every year different parts of Bangladesh face different types of disasters. Exposure to disaster causes considerable damage to assets and livelihood opportunities of affected households. In response, households adopt private defensive measures investing their private funds, which acts as an additional financial burden. There is very limited information available about expenditure on disaster risk reduction and recovery in the country.       In this context, to understand the types of expenditure, differences in expenditure by gender and help minimize them, the Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with the UK based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) commissioned a survey to assess the percentage of climate-related expenditure as a share of household income and expenditure in climate-vulnerable regions of Bangladesh. This research closely complements the “Strengthening Governance of Climate Change Finance to Enhance Gender Equality” project of UNDP Bangladesh. The findings of this study can help the Accelerator Lab narrow down specific district and female-headed households, most vulnerable and in risk of exposure to floods and storms, which holds promise for the lab to pilot new climate financing approaches and innovative adaptation solutions in the future.
