Communities across Indonesian cities grapple with the issue of water-related disasters, especially flood, through various strategies. One of them involves the creation of boats made of bamboos and jerry cans. These boats are constructed and used by community members as a means of transportation, carrying people, equipment, and other items for daily needs during flood. A replica of this was showcased in a Solutions Mapping Festival organised by the Accelerator Lab team, which was attended by representatives from the Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas) and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology.
