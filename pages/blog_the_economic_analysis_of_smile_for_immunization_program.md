iMMUNiZATiON iS AN EFFORT TO CREATE or actively increase a
person’s immunity to a disease to reduce mortality and morbidity
against the diseases, as explained in the Regulation of the Minister
of Health Number 12 of 2017. Therefore, the Government has
made the immunization program as one of the national priority
development programs in the health sector.

Indonesia faces several challenges in the supply chain management
of vaccine logistics and other health commodities, such as drugs
and test kits due to poor visibility and unreliable stock monitoring
(no real time stock monitoring) in health facilities. The current
paper-based routine reporting of vaccine logistics is impeded by
poor accuracy, validity and timeliness of the reports. Data are
not available in real-time and electronically to all stakeholders,
therefore very limited visibility in the pipeline at sub-national levels.
These issues, in turn, cause delayed planning, unequal distribution
and delivery, inaccurate and less transparent vaccines monitoring.

In order to implement an effective and efficient monitoring system,
the Directorate of Immunization Management in collaboration
with UNDP (United Nations Development Programme)
Indonesia developed an Electronic Immunization and Logistics
Monitoring System/Sistem Monitoring Imunisasi dan Logistik
secara Elektronik (SMILE). The development of SMILE system and
app is in line with, even one step ahead, than the Ministry of
Health’s commitment to implementing one of the six pillars of
transformations in health sectors, namely Transformation in the
Health Technology Sector. SMILE has been roll out since 2018 before
the Digital Health Transformation Strategy Blue Print was launched
in 2021.

SMILE ensures all information and transactions of vaccines supply,
distribution, storage, disposal, and destruction can be accessed
anywhere. SMILE empowers health workers to order vaccines as

needed and managers to monitor program implementation in real-
time. Armed with valid data, SMILE allows policy makers develop
better program planning from Central to Regional levels. The data
collected in the SMILE application becomes basic information
that is accurate and crucial for improving the quality of vaccine
planning, procurement, and distribution, so that it can be managed
faster, easier, and on target.

As a learning objective for improving the program and providing
evidence on the benefits of digitizing health programs, an economic
analysis of the digitization in the immunization program was
held by the Directorate of Immunization Management, UNDP
Indonesia, together with SurveyMeter Research Institute, the
Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program
(HITAP) Thailand, and health economic experts from University
of Indonesia. Various economic aspects of the use of technology
in supply chain management are analyzed, resulting in Return on
Investment (RoI), Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR), resource savings, savings
from vaccine disposal avoidance, savings on inefficient vaccine
expenditure, and potential loss due to temperature excursions in
vaccine storage refrigerators.

It is hoped that the results of this study will provide an overview of
the benefit values of digitizing the immunization program through
the SMILE application to record, monitor, and report vaccines and
logistics distribution from Central level to health care facilities.
Despite some of the limitations found in this study, we are proud
that this study is the first one conducted in Indonesia that present
an economic analysis of an innovative health program monitoring
through digitalization. We hope that the results of this study will
inspire and convince all parties, especially policy holders and
health program managers to apply technology and digitization in
the health programs.

I thank all those who have contributed to this study. We hope
that the results of this study will benefit all of us and can be used
as a reference in monitoring the effectiveness of digitization in
immunization and other health programs, not only in Indonesia,
but also in other countries.

Deputy Resident
Representative UNDP
Indonesia

UNDP HAS BEEN WORKiNG CLOSELY with the Government of
Indonesia on its response to the COVID-19 pandemic while
strengthening our support to increase the coverage of routine
immunization, by contributing to the delivery effort of critical
vaccines nationwide.

Indonesia has one of the most ambitious immunization programs
in the world. To reach every child in the country, one of the most
significant challenge has been the absence of real-time information
on vaccine stocks and flows to make informed decisions.

Sistem Monitoring Imunisasi dan Logistik secara Elektronik (SMILE)
was developed by the Ministry of Health and UNDP to support
the immunization program by providing real-time monitoring of
vaccine stocks, its flows, and the storage temperature across all
cold chain points. This innovative solution is in line with SDG 3
and UNDP Digital Strategy 2022–2025. Importantly, it supports the
Ministry of Health’s commitment to carry out one of the six pillars of
transformation in the heath sector, which is about transformation
in the Health Technology. As of today, SMILE has currently been
implemented across 34 provinces, in 514 districts, benefitting
over 10,000 community health centres and 3,000 public hospitals
targeting at least 15 million children and 5 million pregnant women
per year.

The economic evaluation has been an extensive exercise which
has brought to light several benefits of SMILE, including the
achievements and gaps from an economic perspective. I am happy
to share the findings of the assessment including the return on
investment (ROI), the benefit cost ratio (BCR), savings and potential
loses. All these findings provide evidence that it is worthwhile to
invest in digitalization for health program. We are hopeful that
with an understanding of the benefits of digital transformation,
the Ministry of Health and other agencies will have the necessary

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF SMILE FOR IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM

evidence to guide their future investment to achieve country’s
health outcomes.

I am also pleased to share that this assessment also presents the
success of a new initiative introduced by SMILE in ensuring vaccine
quality while in storage. As we are aware, vaccines lose their efficacy
when exposed to excessive heat and cold. Study findings showed
that the IoT-based remote temperature loggers installed in 633
vaccine storages and connected to SMILE could potentially prevent
loss from temperature excursion valued at an estimate of as much
as USD 32,000 per community health center in a month.

I would like to thank the experts who contributed on this study.
Colleagues from SurveyMeter Research Institute, the Health
Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP)
Thailand, and the health economic experts from the University of
Indonesia, who provided systematic feedback of the study findings.
Sincere appreciation to the Ministry of Health especially to the
Immunization Management Directorate who has been a steadfast
supporter in the use SMILE for immunization even prior to the
pandemic. I want to conclude by thanking all colleagues from the
UNDP Bangkok Regional Hub, the Access and Delivery Partnership
(ADP) for their continued support and connecting us with previous
studies from UNDP India.

I am confident that these study findings would be helpful to use
at national, provincial, and district levels to improve the quality of
vaccine supply chain services. I convey my best wishes and look
forward to its future success.

Executive Summary

13

Sistem Monitoring Imunisasi Logistik secara Elektronik (SMiLE) is an electronic immunization
logistics monitoring system, a program developed by the Government of Indonesia
supported by UNDP to ensure the availability of safe and effective vaccines in Indonesia.
SMILE inception was carried out in Bogor and South Tangerang City in 2018. The pilot
phase showed satisfactory results where the SMILE system achieved a high-level of user
satisfaction and acceptance among cold-chain handlers and managers, as evidenced by
over 9,000 to 15,000 transactions since August 2018. The system reduced vaccine stockouts
by 70% in the first six months of its introduction. Building on the success of the pilot
projects, SMILE was then used in 25 districts/cities for routine immunization, and in all
districts/cities for the COVID-19 vaccination program in 2021. At the end of 2022, SMILE
reached all districts/cities as an effort to catch up with the routine immunization program
for children nationwide. All calculations of the benefits focused on activities related to the
use of the SMILE application for the routine vaccine cold chain management and logistics
at the health centers that directly provided services to beneficiaries.

An economic evaluation of SMILE in 2022 found that the return on investment (ROI) was
2.77. It means every Rupiah (IDR) invested in the SMILE program yields a return of IDR 2.77
along with the initial investment. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of SMILE was 3.77 indicating
the SMILE program has a huge positive benefit to the routine vaccination program. In
addition, it was estimated that the Internet of Things (IoT) Logger could prevent the
potential loss due to temperature excursion by as much as IDR 457 million per month per
community health center (Puskesmas) although it is possible that this calculation may
lead to an overestimation.

The study recommended each vaccine storage should be equipped with an IoT Logger
to avoid waste due to temperature excursion and to ensure the quality of the vaccines.
Continuous training is key to improve the skills of pharmaceutical personnel to support
the implementation of the one-gate policy in vaccine logistics management. Inter-sectoral
collaboration plays a significant role to brand SMILE as a reference for the examination and
reporting of vaccine management and logistics. SMILE would be an integrated solutions
in logistics monitoring, not limited to digitalization but also innovation and development
financing, with impact and scale to be accelerated in other health programs in Indonesia.

Introduction

I MMUNiZATiON iS A PRiORiTY PROGRAM of the Government

of Indonesia, which aims to reduce child morbidity and
mortality due to diseases that can be prevented with
routine immunization/ Penyakit yang Dapat Dicegah dengan
Imunisasi (PD3I), such as polio, hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria,
Haemophilus, type B influenza, measles, and tetanus. Efforts
to strengthen the vaccine logistics and cold chain management
system are crucial in achieving the government’s targets for the
health sector under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Recording and reporting of the use and distribution of vaccines and
manual temperature monitoring have an impact on the accuracy,
validity, and time of reporting. Monitoring temperature manually
also affects the quality of the vaccine.

To overcome the logistics and cold chain management issues, the
Indonesian Ministry of Health, with the support of the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), developed a web-based and mobile
digital application to monitor vaccine supplies and cold chains. An
application called Electronic Immunization Logistics Monitoring
System/Sistem Monitoring Imunisasi Logistik secara Elektronik
(SMILE), adapted from India’s Electronic Vaccine Intelligence
Network (EVIN), provides visibility of cold chain vaccine logistics in
real-time, including monitoring the temperature of vaccine storage
at each location. Through the SMILE interface, health officials can
find out vaccine stocks, whether overstock, shortfall, or complete

stockout, making it easier to manage programs by providing data
even from difficult to reach areas (UNDP, 2022). After introducing
the system in two districts in 2018, SMILE was implemented in 25
districts/cities for routine immunization in 2021, and in 514 districts/
cities for the COVID-19 vaccination program. At the end of 2022, all
districts/cities used SMILE for routine vaccinations to support the
national immunization program.

Economic analysis of SMILE was conducted in 2022 as requested by
the Minister of Health. Obtaining data for one year period prior to
the use of SMILE was challenging. Data for six months in SMILE areas
were selected as a reference period for pre- and post-SMILE phases.
The six month-period was chosen due to the rationale that the data
was valid enough and the health staff were trained to optimally
utilize the SMILE app. The study assessed routine immunization
vaccines, such as BCG, Measles-Rubella (MR), DPT-HB-Hib, Hepatitis
B, IPV, and Polio.

The objectives of the analysis were to assess the efficiency of vac-
cine management and logistics using SMILE, conduct an economic
assessment of SMILE (Return on Investment), propose recommen-
dations to the Ministry of Health to improve SMILE’s business model
and scale-up the SMILE usage, and provide important lessons for
Indonesia and other countries to develop similar policy decisions
on digital health and the immunization program.

Methodology

a. Study Design

This study applied primary and secondary data. Primary data related
to vaccine logistics and immunization cold chain management were
obtained from the officers-in-charge in Puskesmas, and District
and Provincial Health Offices. The secondary data in the form of
records related to Pharmacy and Immunization program were
gathered from Puskesmas, District and Provincial Health Offices,
and Ministry of Health as well as the finance departments at the
Ministry of Health and UNDP. The vaccines observed in this study
were vaccines for routine immunization for children, including BCG,
Measles-Rubella (MR), DPT (Diphtheria, Pertussis, and Tetanus),
DPT-HB-Hib, Hepatitis B, and IPV (Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine).

The study was carried out in seven districts/cities in seven
provinces, namely West Java, DKI Jakarta, Riau, Central Java, West
Sumatra, East Java and East Kalimantan from June to December
2022. The data collected were related to vaccine benefits, vaccine
sustainability, and program challenges in 2018 to 2022.

b. Sample Size

1) The study involved 21 Puskesmas facilities spread across seven
districts/cities in seven provinces in Indonesia.

•

A total of 12 Puskesmas facilities in four districts/cities within four
provinces using SMILE for routine immunization logistics and cold
chain management were grouped into Routine SMILE Puskesmas.
• Nine Puskesmas facilities in three cities within three provinces
that did not use SMILE for routine immunization logistics and
cold chain management were classified as Routine Non-SMILE
Puskesmas.
The graph below depicts the sample size in Routine SMILE
Puskesmas and Routine non-SMILE Puskesmas.

2) Data collected in the SMILE Routine Area-2 could not be used
because the SMILE program in that area started in February 2020,
coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. The government policy
to restrict public activities during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted
in a decrease in the number of routine vaccinations for children.
As a result, the data obtained during the pandemic could not be
compared with the data collected before the pandemic. Therefore,
data from the three Routine SMILE Puskesmas facilities in Area-2
were excluded from the assessment.

3) Among the remaining nine Routine SMILE Puskesmas sampled,
there was one Puskesmas that used a different reporting format
which caused an inconsistency. This Puskesmas was then excluded
from the assessment.

4) Thus, only eight Routine SMILE Puskesmas facilities were eligible
to be sampled for this study because the pre- and post-SMILE data
were comparable. The pre- and post-SMILE data in three Puskesmas
in West Java was from 2018 (before the COVID-19 pandemic).
Meanwhile, the pre-and post-SMILE data in the rest of the five
Puskesmas in Riau and Central Java were during the COVID-19
pandemic.

5) The Routine Non-SMILE areas (n=9) were not part of the economic
analysis because the observation on these areas were only for one
time period (January – March 2022). It was for qualitative analysis
purposes.

6) Selected districts and Puskesmas which used SMILE for routine
immunization program were randomized using Stata.

7) Observations were made with the following conditions:

•

•

A pre-SMILE versus post-SMILE comparative analysis was carried
out to calculate the cost evaluation: Six months prior to the SMILE
program implementation and six months after the SMILE program
was implemented.
January – March 2022 as current condition (for qualitative study
only).

c. Economic Assessment

1) Return on Investment (ROI) and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) are
two forms of economic evaluation that assess the benefits of an
intervention against the total costs of its delivery.1

2) Return on Investment (ROI) was used to find out how much
benefits were generated from investment spending.2

ROi = Net National Savings/Total investment Expenditures

• Net National savings was calculated from total national savings

•

•

minus total investment expenditures.
ROI = 1 means that $1.00 is returned for each dollar invested, ROI =
0 indicates break-even investment, ROI < 1 means the investment
costs exceed the dollars returned (an investment loss), and ROI >
1 indicates the benefits derived from the program exceeding the
investment costs incurred.
Cost components to calculate the ROI were obtained in 2021 with
an adjustment of 2018’s cost to 2021.

3) Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) was applied as an indicator of the
profitability or the ratio of benefit generated relative to the costs
required of the SMILE program for vaccine management and
logistics intervention.

BCR = Total National Savings/Total investment Expenditures

A BCR >1 indicates that the program had positive benefits and vice versa,

a BCR=1 indicates that the expected profits equals the costs.

4) The economic assessment in this study was calculated from the
perspective of the provider, not from the beneficiaries.

5) The ROI and BCR assessments used investment expenditures
for equipment procurement, application development and
maintenance, renting a server and public cloud hosting, staff
training, and helpdesk.

•

•

•

The investment expenditures used the 2021 data obtained at
national level.
The SMILE program has been implemented in the routine SMILE
Puskesmas since 2018. It means that the SMILE application
was developed in 2018 or even before 2018. The availability of
investment costs data was found in 2021. The value of money did
not need to be adjusted because the data was the accumulation
of investment costs from 2018 to 2021.
Data collection in the field in 2022 discovered that all Puskesmas
utilized the SMILE application for the COVID-19 vaccination
program although many of them did not use SMILE for children’s
routine immunization. In addition, all Provincial, District, and City
health offices took advantage of SMILE application for supporting
the COVID-19 vaccines distribution.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF SMILE FOR IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM
24

6) Data on benefits were savings generated from the implementation of the
SMILE program, which were obtained both from SMILE and Puskesmas reports.
The savings came from vaccine disposal avoidance, prevention of unnecessary
vaccine distrbution, and human resources savings for temperature control and
reporting activities.

•

Savings from prevention of unnecessary vaccine issuance
• The SMILE application minimized vaccine stock-outs and overstocks,

ensuring effective vaccine utilization.

• Savings from the prevention of unnecessary vaccine issuance was assessed
by the change in the number of vaccines distributed during the pre- and
post-SMILE periods for each vaccine type.

• Savings occur when the total difference between issuance costs after SMILE
implementation and the cost before the implementation is negative. This
shows that by using the SMILE application, the vaccine distribution is in
accordance with the needs based on the set immunization coverage targets.
• Field survey data was used as the source of vaccine issuance in the
pre-SMILE period, while data from the SMILE database was used as the
source of vaccine issuance data in the post-SMILE period.

•

Savings from vaccine disposal avoidance.
• Vaccine disposal is caused by expired, damaged, and remaining vials that

are not possible to be utilized.

• The SMILE application contains information on the batch number of doses
per vial which makes it easier to monitor vaccine expiry dates. It is very useful
to minimize the wastage of vaccines. Vaccine dispensing is based on the
expiry date with those near expiry to be used first.

• Savings occur when the difference between disposal costs of various
vaccines after SMILE implementation and the costs before the implemen-
tation is negative.

• Field survey data was used as the source of vaccine disposal in the pre-
SMILE period, while data from the SMILE database was used as the source
of vaccine disposal data in the post-SMILE period.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF SMILE FOR IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM

7) The SMILE application supports and encourages the one-
gate policy in logistics management and the implementation of
vaccinations under the Pharmacy unit. The SMILE application
reduced the working hours of staff in handling vaccine logistics
and management, as well as provided opportunities for staff to
develop themselves through training on digitalized logistics and
vaccine cold chain management.

•

•

Savings from human resource activities in monitoring the
temperature twice a day.
• Real-time temperature monitoring using SMILE from each
officer’s smartphone is considered to increase the efficiency
of monitoring vaccine logistics and has the potential to save
human resource activities.

• Temperature measurement is carried out twice a day in
accordance with MoH Regulation No. 12/2017 on the Imple-
mentation of Immunization.

• Salaries were calculated based on salary data of temperature
monitoring staff involved in vaccine and cold chain logistics
monitoring activities.
It was assumed that temperature monitoring activity was
carried out by one officer in every Puskesmas.

•

Human Resources Savings from preparing vaccine logistics reports
• SMILE application makes it easier for staff to prepare vaccine
logistics reports, which were previously done manually using
data recapitulation of vaccine transaction records.
It is assumed that the preparation of vaccine logistics reports
is carried out by one officer.

•

• Before SMILE was implemented, the average frequency of
preparing vaccine logistics reports is once a month, and took
3.7 hours for each activity.

• The total cost required for the salary of logistics staff in
preparing reports for one year was estimated from the total
time required for preparing logistics reports for one year
multiplied by the average hourly salary for report preparation.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF SMILE FOR IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM
26

8) Data on pre-SMILE period was obtained from monthly records
in each Routine SMILE Puskesmas. While data on post-SMILE
period was collected from the SMILE database for Routine SMILE
Puskesmas.

9) The study also observed other benefits of using SMILE
application, including SMILE for routine Childhood Vaccination
Procurement Planning, and the usage of the Internet of Things
(IoT)-based temperature monitoring tool (Logger).

• The application provides access to real-time vaccine stock
information for all parties involved in the vaccine logistics
management, such as Puskesmas, District/City Health Offices,
Provincial Health Offices, and the Ministry of Health. The
application simplifies the planning of vaccine procurement
and vaccines distribution as well as providing more data for
monitoring.

• The Internet of Things (IoT)-based temperature monitoring
tool (logger) that was connected to the SMILE application
helped maintain the quality of vaccines in storage. It provides
notifications if the storage temperature was above 8oC or below
2oC. The use of the IoT Logger reduced potential loss from
vaccine degradation due to temperature excursion.

e. The 2023 Routine Childhood Vaccination
Procurement Planning with SMILE

1) The SMILE application simplifies the planning of vaccine procurement and
vaccines distribution as well as providing more data for monitoring.

2) The Ministry of Health utilized SMILE application for the 2023 routine
childhood vaccination procurement planning. The story can be read below.

Box 1. The 2023 Routine Childhood Vaccination Procurement Planning with SMiLE

PLANNiNG FOR PROCUREMENT OF CHiLDREN’S ROUTiNE VACCiNES FOR 2023 STARTED
in early 2022. Following the National Budget cycle, in February-March 2022, the
Directorate of Immunization, Ministry of Health (MoH) carried out a baseline review,
compiled, and determined the indicative ceiling for the procurement of routine
childhood vaccines for 2023, such as Hepatitis B, BCG, Polio/bOPV, DPT-HB-Hib,
IPV, Measles-Rubella.

Based on the review, the Directorate of Immunization submitted a proposal of
13.284.485 vials for the routine children's vaccines for 2023 to the Pharmacy
Directorate. As of December 31, 2022, the Immunization Directorate estimated
9.628.936 vials of vaccines were available nationwide. Thus, 3.665.550 vials should
be procured in 2023.

At the end of 2022, as a directorate at the Ministry of Health that is responsible for
the procurement of drugs and medical devices, including vaccines, the Pharmacy
Directorate used the SMILE application to identify the availability of routine
children’s vaccine stocks as of December 31, 2022. Based on the records on SMILE,
it was known that the availability of routine children's vaccine stocks as of December
31, 2022, was 12.207.138 vials. This information was then reaffirmed by the results
of stock-taking conducted at 8,000 Puskesmas (80% of total Puskesmas). The stock
taking recorded the remaining stock of routine children's vaccines that were not
expired was 7,830,350* vials.

Thus, the additional number of vaccines needed for 2023 based on SMILE information
was 1,077,347 vials. This data could minimize irrelevant vaccine procurement and
make it more precise as vaccine planning uses real-time vaccine stock data in the
SMILE app to ensure an effective vaccine procurement strategy.

f. Potential Savings from Temperature Excursion

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Loggers that are connected to the SMILE application can prevent
potential losses from temperature excursion events.
Temperature excursion in a vaccine storage with no immediate
actions taken will cause the vaccine to lose its efficacy (all
vaccines spoilt and need to be discarded) which could lead to huge
potential loss.
Loggers that are connected to the SMILE application can prevent
potential losses from temperature excursion events by as much
as iDR 457,152,196 or USD 32,002.25 per Puskesmas per month
from temperature breach below two degrees during weekdays
and weekends.
In the event of cold chain breach, vaccine storage temperature
below two degrees will result in vaccine spoilage. In non-
intervention areas (before the loggers were installed), vaccine
handlers manually checked cold-chain temperature twice daily
within office hours. As such, the vaccine temperature was not
continuously monitored. Any temperature excursion will affect
the vaccines if no action is taken immediately.
Based on handling practices at Puskesmas during SMILE pilot
and scale-up phase, the study assumed that vaccine handler at
Puskesmas discarded vaccines which were frozen and/or exposed
to heat for >eight hours regardless of the VVM status.
Thus, the total savings from temperature excursion preven-
tion nationwide is iDR 4,598,951,091,760.00 or equal to
USD 321,942,673.55
The potential losses are predicted to be higher than the existing
estimation because many Puskesmas facilities do not use IoT
loggers.

Limitations
and Assumptions

a.

In this study, the benefits were estimated based on
data collected from eight Routine SMILE Puskesmas.
All of the puskesmas were located in cities and
had adequate facilities because at the time this
assessment was conducted (in 2022), SMILE had
been used for routine immunization in 25 districts.

b. Benefits across different level puskesmas, and
district and provincial health offices were assumed
to be equal and were extrapolated to the national
level.

c.

Investment costs incurred for the development
and maintenance of the SMILE application, such as
cost for staff training at each level was low because
many were held online during the pandemic and
may not reflect the actual cost of offline training,
therefore might overestimate the calculation of ROI
and BCR.

d. The calculation of potential loss due to temperature
excursion assumed that all vaccines stored in a day
will be degraded. This may lead to overestimation
because handling the vaccines from excursion
exposure may differ from one to other Puskesmas
staff due to level of knowledge to conduct shake

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF SMILE FOR IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM
33

test and VCCM observation, as well as level of
confidence prior their decision to keep or discard
those vaccines. However, this potential loss
calculation can provide an estimate of the loss
that would be incurred if a temperature excursion
occured without any alert from the IoT logger.

e. Differences in data sources, such as missing
data, and different reporting format found in one
Puskesmas were omitted in calculation, but might
have some impact on the RoI calculation.

f. There is currently no standard methodology to
evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a digital system
like SMILE, and the research team encountered
significant challenges in accurately defining and
calculating all costs and benefits related to SMILE,
and obtaining appropriate primary comparator/
baseline data. The approach implemented in this
study is of an exploratory nature, and was refined
based on consultations with various experts as the
study progressed. As such, the study findings should
be carefully interpreted with these limitations and
assumptions in mind, and should be viewed as
preliminary.

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF SMILE FOR IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM
Conclusions

35

1. The Return on Investment (RoI) is almost three-fold for every Rupiah

invested in SMILE system.

2. The Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) is 3.77 (almost 4 times), meaning that SMILE

has quite huge benefits for immunization program.

3. Savings from SMILE as a whole amounted to USD 9.3 million per year.

4. Vaccine damage from exposure to cold temperature for more than one
hour (with an absence of remote temperature loggers connected to SMILE)
causes a potential loss of USD 32 thousands per month per Puskesmas.

Recommendations

1. Continuous training is key to improve the skills of cold chain handlers to

reduce unnecessary vaccine issuance and avoid vaccine disposal.

2. Each vaccine storage should be equipped with an IoT Logger to avoid waste
due to temperature excursion and to ensure the quality of the vaccines.

3. SMILE is an integrated solution in logistics monitoring. It is not limited to
digitalization but also includes innovation and development financing,
with impact and scale to be expanded and replicated in other health
programs in Indonesia.

4. Through the experience of conducting this study, a number of
methodological challenges have been uncovered and documented. The
lessons learned will be immensely valuable in informing the design of
future economic evaluations of similar interventions.

5. There are more opportunities to discuss on how we can leverage the
experience of this study to explore other priority policy questions on digital
health and the immunization programme.

•

In all types of vaccines, after six months of SMILE implementation it is assumed that there will be
savings in terms of vaccine expenditure.

• This is due to the decrease in the coverage after the implementation of SMILE is smaller (4.7%)

compared to the decrease in the percentage of vaccine expenditure (28.7%).

• This decrease can be assumed as a result of improvements in logistics management and the cold

chain of routine immunization programs after the implementation of SMILE.

• Savings occur when the total difference between issuance costs after and before SMILE

implementation is negative. This shows that by using the SMILE application, the vaccine distribution
is in accordance with the needs based on the set immunization coverage targets.

Savings from less work hours spent preparing vaccine logistics reports

• Before SMILE was used, the average frequency of preparing vaccine logistics reports was once a month,

and took 3.7 hours for each activity.

• The total cost required for the salary of logistics staff in preparing reports for one year was estimated
from the total time required for preparing logistics reports for one year multiplied by the average hourly
salary for report preparation.

• The results of the analysis showed that the cost incurred for salaries for logistics report preparation

per Puskesmas per year was IDR 1,427,726.00.

• Assuming that the salaries of staff at all Puskesmas in Indonesia (10,060 units) were the same, then the

potential savings in human resources was IDR 14,362,923,560.00.

• The potential savings that can be obtained from human resource was USD 99.95 per Puskesmas or

USD 1,005,454.92 at the national level.

6. Potential losses due to temperature excursion events

• The presence of temperature excursion events - temperatures outside the range of 2°C to 8°C for

freeze-sensitive vaccines (should not be frozen), can result in vaccine spoilage. Some vaccines, such
as Hepatitis B, DPT-HB-Hib, IPV, DT, and Td will potentially become degraded if exposed to freezing
temperatures. Meanwhile, Polio, BCG, and Measles vaccines will be potentially degraded if exposed to
hot temperatures.

• The degraded vaccines due to temperature excursion will be discarded and replaced with new ones.
Otherwise, the vaccines would not be effective when used or they might have unwanted side effects
on children.

• The potential losses due to temperature excursion was estimated from 633 units of logger that were
spread in a number of Puskesmas facilities nationwide, including in Provincial and District Health
Offices.

• The estimation of maximum vaccine value was calculated from the maximum storage capacity of
Puskesmas and the price of the vaccine per dose, obtained by calculating the average of the 15
months between the highest initial stock, final stock, or quantity received in one month.

• Loggers that were connected to the SMILE application can prevent potential losses from temperature
excursion events by as much as iDR 457,152,196 or USD 32,002.25 per Puskesmas per month from a
temperature breach below two degrees during weekdays and weekends.
In the event of cold chain breach, vaccine storage temperature below two degrees will result in vaccine
spoilage. In non-intervention areas (before the loggers were installed), vaccine handlers manually
checked cold-chain temperature twice daily within office hours. As such, the vaccine temperature was
not continuously monitored. Any temperature excursion will affect the vaccines if no action is taken
immediately.

• Based on handling practices at Puskesmas during SMILE pilot and scale-up phase, the study assumed
that vaccine handler at Puskesmas discarded vaccines which were frozen and/or exposed to heat for
>eight hours regardless of the VVM status.

• Thus, the total savings from temperature excursion avoidance nationwide would be iDR

4,598,951,091,760.00 or equal to USD 321,942,673.55.

• The potential losses were predicted higher than the existing estimation because many Puskesmas

facilities did not have IoT loggers.
