## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Gamification can accelerate the process of involving more citizens into important urban development projects - the methodology can be scaled to other topics such as waste management, for example

2. Youth are very active learners if engaging state-of-the art technologies such as NFT and AR are integrated into activities

3. Local governments on rural areas are in need of knowledge and skills to recognize full potential of the territory and integrate innovative approaches into local development agenda

UNDP is testing a creative placemaking, an innovative approach to local and urban development. In 2023 in collaboration with the creative association ILGERI, UNDP launched the game ILGERI JOLU in the format of a quest for the residents of Bishkek.

The aim of the initiative was to raise awareness and support the protection and preservation of the city's cultural heritage using innovative approaches and harnessing state-of-the-art technologies such as NFT and Augmented Reality.

Currently UNDP is launching an innovation challenge aimed at the development of the OpenOsh platform. OpenOsh innovative digital platform will leverage the power of arts, culture and creativity to serve a community’s interest while driving a broader agenda for change, growth and transformation in a way that also builds character and quality of place. UNDP continues working with the Toktogul administration in assessing tourist destination’s potential and identify growth points for the Toktogul district which can give impetus for inclusive local development.
