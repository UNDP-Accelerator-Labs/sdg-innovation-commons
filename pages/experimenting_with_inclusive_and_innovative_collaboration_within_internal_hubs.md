## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

I) In the designing process of our knowledge-sharing experimentation, we have done an exploratory brainstorming exercise to design our specific hypotheses in collaboration with the development and communication Hub and Integrated programming and knowledge management SIDA project. In this session, we got an insight to focus on building a new set of competencies within the country office colleagues on systems thinking, system transformation, and the portfolio approach which will enhance integration and knowledge sharing that led us to develop a pilot Portfolio Management approach for UNDP Ethiopia. Testing knowledge and learning tools by celebrating failures as a mindset change was also another action suggested that covers both program and operations that promote joint learning and sharing plans across the hubs. 

 

II) Our Embracing failure session with the innovation ecosystem to experiment on “how celebrating failure can be used to accelerate learning and change the mindset” gives us an insight that failure stories on the journey to become a thriving entrepreneur can be a great motivation. These stores showed participants and innovators how they change their failure into learning opportunities and develop bigger and better things.  It was used in our experiment to facilitate a culture of transparency and transform our organization’s culture of taking individuals from a fixed to a growth mindset.  

 

III) The Lab in collaboration with the portfolio specialists and the strategic innovation unit embarked to pilot the portfolio approach with one of the thematic areas that the CO prioritized – gender equality and women empowerment. In designing our intent, we have seen that to enable systemic change that accelerates the empowerment of women and achievement of gender equality through a portfolio we need to start by taking leverage and connecting UNDP’s experiences, capabilities, resources, and relationship 

 

IV) On our desk review research and horizon scanning activity, we learned that in the political sphere, women’s participation in a leadership role is increased at a higher level but still sees a gap in their participation in lower positions of government structures. The other Aha moment we have seen is that many women employed in the informal sector as well they have been impacted differently by disasters (COVID-19, political crises, climate change, etc). This enables us to design our portfolio and contribute to an acceleration of this system-wide development effect by pushing our achievements on making Women more economically empowered, have access to decent livelihoods and income, enhance women’s participation in leadership roles, and enjoy full rights & entitlements free from gender-based discrimination and abuse and make sure Marginalized and most vulnerable women are empowered and become resilient to disasters and shocks 

 

V) In our portfolio sensemaking exercise, we have developed claims and propositions as well as captured insights from six different windows (Need, power, the role of UNDP, trend & signal, resource capabilities, and partnership & relations). This gives us an insight into what our three strategic shifts should look like in our portfolio design 

From survival status and financial exclusion to inclusive finance and enhanced economic opportunities for women. 

From the nominal presentation and low participation of women in governance and leadership space to meaningful participation, representation, and influence of women in leadership and governance structure. 

From absorbing risks and paying safety/security costs of crises to resilient women and communities.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

- Project working as silos but still contributing to the same outcome was one of the challenges that we have seen in our portfolio sensemaking exercise.  

 

- The lack of an easily accessible knowledge-sharing platform is the major barrier even for those who don’t share regularly. In addition, having recognition from peers, and management and making knowledge-sharing part of the work plan were the top picks for what would motivate them to share knowledge in the future.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

- Focused group discussion: To understand how the current projects accelerate their efforts and further induce systems transformation to the selected portfolio thematic area (GEWE) through listening to selected projects that are contributing to gender equality and women empowerment (GEWE) we had set out to gather insight through portfolio sensemaking exercise as a focus group discussion. 

 

- Direct Interview and In-depth interview: To map weak signals and trends, we have reached out and conducted an interview with the selected community members.  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

- Portfolio Sensemaking is used to conduct and build a collective reflection by staff on how the current projects accelerate their efforts and further induce systems transformation to the selected portfolio thematic area (GEWE) through listening to selected projects that are contributing to gender equality and women empowerment (GEWE) from six window perspectives (Need, power, the role of UNDP, trend & signal, resource capabilities, and partnership & relations). 

 

- The Lab team in collaboration with the strategic innovation unit and the Co portfolio specialist has completed the initial steps of the portfolio design process including intent formulation, problem space, and strategic shift through horizon scanning and participatory design.  
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not Applicable 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not Applicable 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not Applicable 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not Applicable 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

- None. since the sensemaking and exploration exercise was focused on the CO knowledge creation and sharing culture. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not Applicable 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

- Bringing unusual partners helps the lab team to generate quick insight in a short period of time in different topics as well-diversified learnings from different angles which we will not be able to get if we are implementing in a previous implementation form. The methods also help us to explore competencies within the country office colleagues on systems thinking and system transformation and the portfolio approach (so that the team can apply these new capabilities for system design and subsequently in other CO initiatives)
