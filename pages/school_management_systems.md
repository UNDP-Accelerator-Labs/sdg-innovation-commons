> Title of the innovation

School management Systems

> Brief description of the innovation

As a nation we should be going digital because technology is the future.
The school management system is a very good way to help us both in Covid and non Covid times to be able to continue learning and working remotely.
The idea of giving work to pupils/students on WhatsApp, having to print it out and parents having to go and submit the work back at the school is just time consuming. The school system provides online tests(very secure), assignment etc..
It’s like having normal school(class) just online.
The biggest positive about this is that it’s local and promoting our technology as a country.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

As a product the idea is not to selling it but use it to provide services based on subscriptions to maintain constant income so that we can help out our fellow youths that we employ as a company.

> Technical Feasibility

It’s a software application already in beta test.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It has a lot of positive impact which will come a long way as a country.
Students don’t get disturbed with the learning school schedule.
Management of the school institutions being digital instead of using paper( which to be honest, we spend a lot of money on paper)
On an environmental perspective we cut down less trees to make paper
