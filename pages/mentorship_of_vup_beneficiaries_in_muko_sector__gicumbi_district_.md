The VUP program could not achieve poverty graduation which was the main goal of the program in the targeted poorest sectors. This raised several questions such as why there was no significant change in the lives of
beneficiaries after years of implementation, what the issues are and what could be done differently to achieve such results? The sector leadership looked into the reasons behind this challenge and realized that some VUP beneficiaries misused the financial assistance they are given under VUP program (Direct Assistance and
Public Works). The sector leadership initiated a mentorship program where a trusted mentor/coach was given to 1 or 2 households that benefits from VUP programs with the responsibility of monitoring the use of the financial
resources received under VUP. The coaches/mentors also advocate for their respective households (HHs) if need arises. So far, 174/593 households in Muko sector are beneficiaries of this mentorship program. This has increased accountability on the side of VUP beneficiaries, improved mutual understanding, friendship and trust among mentors, VUP beneficiaries and the population of Muko Sector in general. 158 mentors were chosen considering their level of education and understanding of Government Programs who went through trainings
to effectively carry out the task. This is on a voluntary basis. Coaches visit their respective HHs once a month or twice a month and coaches meet every three months to evaluate what has been done.
