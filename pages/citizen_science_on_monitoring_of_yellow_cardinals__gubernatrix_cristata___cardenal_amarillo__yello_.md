## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection. 

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis.  

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process.

## Overall goal

Record and geolocate sites where the yellow cardinal (Gubernatrix cristata) appears to identify populations and determine its viability (according to the abundance of individuals in each population) and isolation/connectivity (according to the continuity/discontinuity of records). 

Update the information of sites where remaining populations of yellow cardinals appear (search at historical sites and with current presence of the species). 

Raise public awareness of the conservation issues affecting the species. 
## Specific goals

Assess the viability and connectivity1 among the populations of the species. 

Recommend release sites for yellow cardinals rescued from illegal wildlife trafficking based on updated information on populations. 

Identify priority areas for the yellow cardinal’s conservation. 

Raise public awareness of conservation issues affecting the species through community participatory activities. 

Promote local groups working on the conservation of the species. 
## Description of citizen participation

After the recruitment of census takers posted on the Aves Argentinas’s social media, sites of interest are shared to survey the presence of cardinals. Additionally, citizens suggest sites in their residential regions. Before carrying out a census, census takers receive training in search methodology and useful information. The census compiles information about geolocations, the number of individuals, and, if possible, the sex and maturity stage (adult/juvenile) of recorded cardinals. As an optional activity, citizens are asked to send photos of or data about the environment at observation sites. Data is recorded in spreadsheets that are sent in digital format or through a mobile application that was specifically designed at UBA for yellow cardinal censuses.
