> Title of the innovation

I applied for a student loan to the higher education loans and scholarships board despite having the qualifications and good results I was left out. Schools have opened and the loan is my only way to pursue my long life goals without it I'm nothing. I would like to be considered regarding tuition and accommodation fees at mukuba University as I can not do anything without the help of the government

> Brief description of the innovation

I want to study bachelors of science in Computer science at mukuba University.. I was admitted at the university but I wasn't given the loan.. I am an orphan who's in the custody of my grand mother who sales vegetables as a source of income.
Luckily for me to complete my secondary school I was sponsored by the school management due to the hard work, dedication and commitment to school work. I have no means of paying university tuitions and accommodation fees but in the new government I have hope I will be helped..
