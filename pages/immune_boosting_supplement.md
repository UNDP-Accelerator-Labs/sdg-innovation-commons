> Brief description of the innovation

An immune boosting supplement made from the extracts of a medicinal fungi that has been proven to posses properties highly effective for swift immune boosting, even in cancer patients. The initiative is to grow the fungi which thrives on woody trees on sawdust, hence reducing the land and air pollution caused by sawdust.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I will be selling a unit of the product for k1080 to pharmaceutical companies and health facilities in Lusaka before expanding to other parts of the country and eventually the rest of the continent. The target market being males and females  aged 8 years and older who are either cancer patients, patients in general constantly ill (weak immune system) or individuals who just want to maintain a healthy life and prevent disease infiltration in their body. Selling the units of the product at k1080 will give a 66.7 profit given the cost of production for each product is averagely lower. Production cost is low given that the fungi does not need any special fertilizer to grow. No purchase of the fungi spawn(seeds) will be necessary after the first purchase because I can easily inoculate spawn from the available sample, making the growing process self sustainable. 
The challenge prize will help me in scaling up(getting a piece of land and setting up growing structures i.e. a growing room and an incubation room)  to produce enough supplements that I can supply to the target market. It will also help me market the product through social media, television and other marketing streams reaching my target audience.

> Technical Feasibility

The capsules are made from the powder of fungi extracts. The fungi itself is grown on a sawdust substrate, dehydrated ,ground to powder form and then encapsulated. The current prototype is an example of what the encapsulated fungi powder will look like after production. it was made using a simple encapsulating toolkit.
The implementation plan is to firstly get product certification and approval from the Zambia Medicines Regulatory Authority and then scale up a fungi growing structure (a growing room and an incubation room),market the product , secure supplying contracts with pharmaceutical companies and health facilities and also sign an agreement with a pharmaceutical manufacturing company that will aid in large scale encapsulation, dosage control and packaging.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Due to the corona virus pandemic ,individuals all over the world and in Zambia to be particular have become more aware of health preservation measures. A market research survey I conducted in July of 2021 proved this with 80% of the participants stating they were taking either vitamin supplements or any form of health improving product (fruits, teas etc.) in order to preserve and protect their health. However, many alluded to the fact that these products are often expensive to access.
 There are cancer patients unable to get chemotherapy treatment because their immune systems are weak. There are individuals taking ARV drugs, malaria drugs and other treatments however, the treatment is not effective because their immune systems are weak.
Having grown up seeing my late father exercise medicine with passion and compassion, I believe it is the right of every human being to access health care/products. Therefore, selling my product at k1080 per unit to health facilities and pharmaceutical companies will make it the most effective and affordable immune boosting supplement on the Zambian market.
Apart from that, scaling up will help employ approximately 10 youths on a single plant and eventually a higher number with increase in production. 
Production will also help reduce pollution caused by sawdust given that the sawdust which is either piled up or burnt will be utilized in the growth process.
