Access to good quality, safe water is essential to the health and well-being of communities around the world. However, water quality can vary considerably, and effective tools for real-time monitoring are crucial. In response to this need, an innovative system has been developed that uses sensor technology, WiFi connectivity and cloud services to assess and visualize water quality and provide timely alerts to users.

This is a program for a water quality detector using a home sensor. The program measures water conductivity, calculates the TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) value, and sends the data to ThingSpeak for real-time viewing and monitoring. In addition, it uses the Twilio service to send text messages with the water quality classification according to the ranges established by the World Health Organization (WHO). It also includes functionality to sense water temperature using a DS18B20 sensor.
