INNOVATION THROUGH AGRICULTURE

> Brief description of the innovation

JSTR GROUP
Seeking full use of the educational resources
available to developing communities in the areas of rural education and agricultural training, our group  is concerned with ways in which the
efforts of organizations and institutions concerned with rural development might be improved and expanded. A generalized critical
analysis of different facets of rural education--primary and secondary education; vocational training centers; youth service
(wherein youth are given the opportunity to work in return for food,
clothing, shelter, and a few hours of education and training per
week) ; government-sponsored farm (training) institutes; agricultural
colleges; agricultural education at the universities; adult
education; and teacher training is given. Recommendations include change from a subsistence to a cash economy and increased
agricultural output to the point of exportation; "gentle" innovation;
formulation of a comprehensive rural-development policy aimed at
raising living standards of the rural people through increased and
diversified economic activity; coordination of activities through an
executive governmental council which includes an experienced agricultural educationist and provides academic and advisory support
through a  department of agricultural education; provision
for manpower planning; and improvement of the status and role of
rural teachers, trainers, and extension workers.
