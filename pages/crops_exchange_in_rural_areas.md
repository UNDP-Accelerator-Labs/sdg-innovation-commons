> Descripción de la experiencia

Thousands of farmers in Ecuador have participated in crop exchange to ensure food avalilabity in their communities. This initiative has been organized by FECAOL (Farmers National Federation). Their contribution has been invaluable to stop food price speculation during lockdown, as they transported tons of agricultural products to Guayaquil during complete lockdown to create popular food markets.
