> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

Carlton Cummins, Amrit Chandan 

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

E-mail: info@acceleronenergy.com / carlton@aceleronltd.com

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

IDB Lab 

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Problem: renewable energy batteries are mostly short-term without the option for maintenance or recycling, resulting in battery waste.  Solution: lithium battery packs with circular economy approach - serviceable, upgradable and recyclable. They also store solar power.
