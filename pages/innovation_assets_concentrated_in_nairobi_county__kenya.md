## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Out of more than 200 innovation centers in the country, 46% of these centers were identified Nairobi county alone, pointing to an urgent need to decentralize and increase young people’s access to spaces that advance their development and provide an opportunity to develop and test their ideas.In Kenya, 44 percent of the urban population has access to the internet compared to 17 percent in rural regions. Rural access to electricity stands at 62 percent with urban access at 91 percent. These huge disparities between urban centers and rural areas in terms of access to internet and electricity, digital skills, poverty levels, has led to innovation activities being concentrated in the urban centers.  While Nairobi is a recognized as Africa’s second-best start-up ecosystem after Lagos in terms of labor market, start-up market environment, hub activities and attraction to investment capital, these benefits are unevenly distributed. There’s need for coordinated and focused investment in power supply, internet access, capacity development and robust collaboration between the governments, researchers and the academia to enable upscaling of commercialization of the innovations by private sector. Inevitably, it is necessary to strategically tap and utilize the energy of youth, who are the drivers of Kenya’s innovation ecosystem, into the expansive agricultural technology sector, which attracted the most funding at 53 percent, according to the research conducted.  Worth to note is the fact that only 22 percent of the start-ups are female originated or led. Furthermore, only 32 percent of the successful start-ups belong to women. An enabling environment for education, training, mentorship and funding of women for an inclusive innovation sector will definitely bear great fruit.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The main challenge was breaking through the silos. The Kenyan Innovation Ecosystem is vibrant, rapidly growing and ripe for investment. As such many actors are guarded about information and networks. They operate in silos, choosing to duplicate efforts rather than work together.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

To generate both qualitative and quantitative data. There is limited literature and evidence of innovation progress beyond Nairobi. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The goal of the exercise was to provide evidence on the availability of innovation assets across the country and disaggregate it per county. This is why the methods above were necessary. Systems thinking enabled us to understand which level was critical for us to engage and which actors operated in that level. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The African Center for Technology Studies was our knowledge partner who supported in the literature review, data collection and analysis.  Thunderbird School of Global Management was our academic partner and through a cohort of graduate students, we were able to conduct an initial desktop analysis of the Kenya Innovation Ecosystem. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Association of Countrywide Innovation Hubs was our private sector partner who supported in verifying and validating the data collected and mobilising innovation hubs and innovators to engage in the research. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Konza Technopolis Development Authority was our Government partner and has been since we began our work with Innovators. They supported the mobilisation of government partners and enabled us to validate the findings across Government. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

None of the partners were new as we had worked with them prior in the previous learning cycle. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We engaged UNICEF and WFP during the validation of the findings from the research. We also led a session sharing the results of the study in UN Innovation Network Forum.
