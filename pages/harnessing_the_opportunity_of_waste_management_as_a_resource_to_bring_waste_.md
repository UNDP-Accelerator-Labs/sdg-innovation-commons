Harnessing the opportunity of waste management as a resource to bring waste under control in Mauritania
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Solid waste management is increasingly posing serious challenges in Mauritania and suitable solutions must be considered. The Acc lab considers engaging in the challenge to nurture learning about the issue and examine possible scalable solutions

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Solid waste management is a challenging issue that hampers development in Mauritania. According to some reports (D-Wast 2014), Mauritania produces little more than 500,000 tonnes of waste resulting in substantial environmental and socio-economic impact. A lot of efforts have been done in Mauritania to mitigate the environmental implications of the negative effects of increasing quantities of waste, this comprises banning plastic-related waste. However, the challenges related to waste management remain significant and persist in most urban and rural areas. Hence, sustainable solutions are increasingly required. The waste issue is a real problem in all cities of Mauritania, particularly, in the capital Nouakchott. A study by GIZ on Mauritania has shown that households produce an average of 0.5 kg / day per capita in urban areas and 0.3Kg in rural areas. Waste management in Mauritania is a municipal responsibility, but the communities do not have sufficient financial and human resources to deal with the problem. The city of Nouakchott provides a pickup and waste collection service through a private company for waste management in the city. Generation of medical waste is estimated at 1,206 tons per year. Industrial, agricultural and medical wastes are not supported by the strategy of waste management in the city of Nouakchott. Medical waste is often incinerated on-site in various hospitals. Other wastes (industrial and agricultural) are similar to household waste. No provision is made to organize this sector.

Waste management is the responsibility of the Municipalities. However, they are poorly equipped in technical, human and financial means, this lead to inefficient waste management interventions. The private sector is involved in waste collection in Nouakchott through contracts. In the secondary cities of the country, waste management is governed by the municipality. The private sector is much more present in the recovery and recycling of waste (plastic, scrap…)

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? The Acc Lab is bringing value in several aspects: - Data collection, - Knowledge accumulation process - Spatial Mapping of the distribution of solid waste across differents communities in Mauritania. - Exploring and mapping the distribution of solid waste in the sea, considered a serious problem to the government. - Setting forth strategic collaborations and getting all key partners and actors involved in the challenge. - Accelerating potential solutions Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? All actors involved in this challenge should collaborate their efforts to address the solid waste issue in Mauritania. However, considering the dynamic and unconventional nature of the challenge, innovative solutions are particularly required. The Acc Lab Mauritania, equipped with significant comparative advantage, is the best candidate to lead, explore, map and test tangible and innovative solutions to the problem while setting out strategic partnerships to accelerate the achievement of the different goals.   Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge? Solid waste management is a considerable issue in Mauritania, that affects substantially people’s livelihood, spread diseases, and hamper development. As a result, it is worth investing efforts and resources in this challenge considering the significant positive outcomes.  The Acclab will propose a holistic WM process that takes into consideration all the aspects of the economy. Our learning outcomes will feed into UNDP Mauritania Environmental portfolio which encompasses a huge component of Waste Management. First, actors involved in the challenge will be approached to combine efforts toward tangible solutions: GIZ, SWEEP-NET, MEDD, MDS…etc. secondly, local communities the most affected will be approached to examine the extent to which increasing quantities of waste impact people’s livelihood and localize possible innovative local solutions to deal with the challenge for adoption and replication. It is important to work on this challenge because this will enable us to accumulate knowledge and information about it. As a result, better interventions aimed at preventing and minimizing the impacts of poor waste management in Mauritania are to be considered.  The first priority for AccLab is to explore ways to address the public health imperative, by ensuring that all Mauritanian’s have access to proper waste management services. Comprehensive, reliable, and regular city cleansing and controlled disposal of waste as a foundation of our integrated waste management approach. The second priority for us, will be to explore ways to address in parallel, how to unlock the socio-economic opportunities of waste as resource, by moving waste up the waste management hierarchy away from disposal towards waste prevention, reuse, recycling and recovery.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

1) what causes waste management to become a big problem? 2) How does waste accumulation happen? mapping the spatial distribution of waste. 3) Do humans contribute to worsening waste accumulation? 4) How do affected communities cope with waste management-related issues? Local and endogenous solutions? 5) Who are the actors and partners involved in this challenge? 6) How can we cooperate and collaborate to help? 7) Where can we intervene and what can we do? 8) Can anything be implement efficient waste management procedurs? 9) What are the available possible solutions?did they work? if yes to what extent? if no, why and how to make them work?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

the AccLab is planning to work on spatial data methods and data visualisation to map the spatial distridution of solide waste across different districts in Mauritania. this will enable us to visualize the spatial cluster of the waste and thus set out informed interventions accordingly. Horizons and scanning methods will be considered in order to assess the enviromental as well as the socio-economic impact of the solid waste on vulnerable communities.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Geospatial data (GIS, GPS, etc.), Spatiotemporal data (location & time based data, eg. movement data / traffic data) is lacking at the moment. AccLab will engage in this data collection, analysis, and visualization, then methods based on empirically tested design would be set forth. AccLab will use a collective intelligence approach and adopt it to speed up reflections and possible solutions.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

For the stage of the challenge, Acclab will work with strategic partners in data collection, Knowledge accumulation process, Spatial Mapping of the distribution of solid waste across different communities in Mauritania to inform key policy makers and UNDP CO concerned units for effective waste management in the country. With our partners, we will explore and map the distribution of solid waste in the sea, considered a serious problem to the government which would set forth strategic collaborations and getting all key partners and actors involved in the challenge. In the next stage of the challenge (next learning cycle), we will accelerate potential solutions by testing what works from our learning.
