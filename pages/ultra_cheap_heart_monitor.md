The COVID-19 pandemic has raised the issue of the lack and high cost of patient monitors.
Even in hospitals with ventilators, there are many monitors. Now, if a person is connected to a respirator, a monitor is required, on which will display the following information around the clock - electrocardiogram, level oxygen saturation and blood pressure. In a pandemic, it is unlikely to succeed meet the need for patient monitors, primarily due to medical shortages equipment due to the significant cost of such equipment in the market as well temporary restrictions on the export of medical equipment. Yes, a new patient monitor costs from 25,000 hryvnias (1,000 USD)   and requires additional measuring modules (some more expensive than the monitor itself). The team We offer solutions based on our two developments uECG and oximeter, which allow obtain electrocardiogram and oxygen saturation levels. The idea is 

therefore, to assemble a set of equipment that will perform the functions of a patient monitor and will cost up to 10,000 hryvnias (300 USD).
