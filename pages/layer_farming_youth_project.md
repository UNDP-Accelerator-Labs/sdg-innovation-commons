> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The prospective plan is to start up a youth run initiative that enables us to grow from job seekers to job creaters, that are self driven and reliable the business will involve the rearing of layer chickens, which will be kept 70% for egg laying and about 30% of the total batch to be sold off as point of lay birds in order to raise money for operating expenses for the remaining 70%, the target is to reach a point where the birds cover their own expenses of drugs, feeding, transport, labour through egg sales hence proper management will be key here as the birds will be reared from day old chicks, the target market shall be grocery store owners, restaurants, market places, school cafeterias, lodges, guesthouses &amp; households. 
However, a byproduct of chicken rearing "manure" will be bagged and sold to farmers of the surrounding areas and beyond. 
Although, once the birds are past egg laying stage they shall be sold off for meat to the above named target market.

> Technical Feasibility

The first thing would be to set up a structure that can house the intended number of birds , acquire the recommended number of poultry equipment such as feeders , drinkers, feed, charcoal, drugs and vaccines etc. The use of locally sourced materials would be employed so as to reduce on capital investment,

> Anticipated Social Impact

Eggs are currently selling at more than k50 a tray and k2.5/egg the objectives are to provide more realistic food choices for each other in order to help with numbers of people who can afford to have a meal but at a more reasonable price than what is the current market price by lowering costs of production 
1. Sourcing for feed ingredients 
2. Formulating own feed
3. Selling of poultry byproduct e.g manure
