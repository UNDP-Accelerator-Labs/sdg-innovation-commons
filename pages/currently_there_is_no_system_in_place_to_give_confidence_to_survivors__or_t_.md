## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Women’s CSOs are very active in this field but they have limited capacity and oftentimes old infrastructure that cannot handle a high number of applications for support.  Currently there is no system in place to give confidence to survivors, or those around them, that they will be treated with dignity and will be given the necessary protection and support.  There is not enough or misleading information about the scope of authority and functions of the institutions.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Turkey’s recent withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention is a major step backwards and will make ending VAWG (and others including LGBT+) a distant dream. Women’s organizations as well as progressive groups continue to protest the decision, but so far there is no indication of a national plan to tackle violence.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Although certain data exist in this area, most of it is anecdotal and official data can be misleading as it does not capture any details about survivors’ information needs. Stakeholder discussions provided key insights.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The above methods were necessary to  make sense of the existing system and experiences of women in the justice system. Design outputs must be produced collaboratively hence the reason for using co-creation and participatory design. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Legal Design Turkey is one of the winners in AccLab Turkey’s Social Innovation Challenge which was launched back in December 2020. Their team consists of legal professionals and designers who, under our guidance,  delivered various visual outputs that will be used to improve project outcomes. Several women's organisations, since women's organisations provide direct support to survivors where the state fails, their perspective had to be incorporated into the design products. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Justice and Bar Associations We worked in partnership with the ministry to improve the institutional capacity and women's access to justice. Bar associations provide information and legal services to violence survivors therefore their involvement is necessary to understand and improve certain aspects of the system.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Collaborated with Inclusive and Democratic Governance portfolio in the CO
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?
