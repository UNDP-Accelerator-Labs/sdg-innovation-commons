A donation of uniforms and protective equipment was made to the truck's picker team. The objective was to improve their working conditions and protect them from the adversities that exist in their work.  


Like the modifications made to the truck, the uniforms and protective equipment were chosen based on the needs that the workers externalized that they had.
