> Title of the innovation

Improvement on the education system in zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Zambia education system is poor, in a way that we have a lot of colleges and universities but we don't have where to employee the teachers.in zambia today we have more than 70 thousand teachers who are doing nothing, because there are less number of school across the country. In additional, we have teachers in schools who are old enough to teach but are there occupying the space for a young graduate who is energetic to perform the work. My appeal is that the government should be able to balance the schools with the colleges and universities.the government should be able to take accountability. A teacher acquire only a knowledge on how to teach a learner and not to do business. A teacher only depends on a pupil to survive.
