> Title of the innovation

ZAMBEZI ONLINE VILLAGE

> Brief description of the innovation

Zambezi online village is an online website where anyone who makes cultural arts and crafts in Zambia can advertise and sell their products to both tourists and the world. Through this website people around the globe can make customized orders with local artists.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The main aim of this innovation is to give our local artists and crafts people an audience to the public and expose them to the right customers from the comfort of their homes especially during Covid times which are restricting in many aspects.
This innovation consists of an online shopping website where both buyer and seller can create online accounts. The seller can showcase their products while the buyer can search for various products of interest online.
This website will generate income by charging a calculated commission for every transaction. All payments will be facilitated through the website to avoid summers. If the seller fails to supply the product, money is to be returned to the buyer.
The main target market is tourists as well as people who are not able to travel to but want to acquire souvenirs from Zambian artists. 
The challenge prize will enable me to buy a website domain and pay a professional web developer to design a world class website which can also facilitate payments from all countries. The prize will also enable me to advertise my website to both potential buyers and sellers.

> Technical Feasibility

The entire implementation is done online. For buyers to collect their products, the can either choose between a pick-up from common places e.g. malls, bus stop or a home delivery with which different charges will apply depending on the delivery location.

> Anticipated Social Impact

I believe this project will improve Zambia’s tourism industry by virtual means and also enable local artists and crafts people to be recognized both locally and internationally.
