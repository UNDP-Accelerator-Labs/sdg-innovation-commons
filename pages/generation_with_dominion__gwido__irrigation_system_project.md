> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation is about Water and chemical Management, continuity production regardless of the season and bring the farmers in the province to take agriculture as a formal business.

Farmers will identified through the application via the Neem Tree Agro-Busness website and the android app. After training and mentorship programs with them, the team will provide technical, equipment and input support to identified farmers.

On a maximum 1 hector land shall we install a full solar drip irrigation kit and provide inputs for the crop identified as a strength plus Village chicken supply in promotion of conservative farming.

These farmers will be obliged only to sell to the cooperate as its common market at a standard price.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The project will start with 10 farmers that will begin to replicate in the second year of operation to a minimum double its first number of farmers involved. This project will open avenues for expansion in the involved farmers to commercial levels of operation.

The cooperate will generate its income through the buying and selling of the commodities from the networked local farmers, the quarterly membership fee &amp; from the 5% percentage saving generated from the sales made in the first two years of operation with a local farmer.

This is an attainable innovation.

> Technical Feasibility

The Cooperate has designed a Website and an android app for management purposes e.g. General database, Progress monitoring, Link between the cooperation and the local farmers &amp; the Market. Local farmers, sellers and buyers will access our services via mentioned platforms.
The project will begin with 10 local farmers that will further replicate to more than 100 farmers in the space of 5 operating years. Mufumbwe district is our launching point for this project, 3rd year of operation will launch in Solwezi and Kalumbila district. 6th yr will launch in Mwinilunga, 7th year in Kasempa and 8th yr Manyinga and Kabompo will be networked. However, the entire province will be under our network by the end of 10 years.

> Anticipated Social Impact

- The local farmers will not only increase their income but become a channel for employments to both youths and women. 
- This will create the availability and accessibility of the market in all seasons in regard to the crops of our focus.
- Increase of food production will lead to a joyful and successful social life among the local farmers and the market at large.
