> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

The camp located in Ras Mohamed Nature Reserve in Egypt used a DIY lighting solution that helped guests staying at the camp to have some light at night while dinner is served.

The lighting unit used both repurposed materials like the plastic bottles used to get drinking water to the camp, natural material like sand found everywhere in the reserve to add weight to the unit, and an energy source the rechargeable led lamp. The end result is a lightweight portable lighting unit that can be easily moved around the camp and provide enough lighting to carry out minor tasks.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

Access to light source

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Camps located in the Nature reserve have limited access to resources like electricity as a result the Beduins that run the camps need to find solutions to work around the limitations to make sure they provide their guests with a comfortable stay while still taking care of the environment. Consequently, you would find many DIY versions of many amenities we take for granted in the city. The DIY versions more often than not are sustainable since they are considering the fact that resources are limited.
