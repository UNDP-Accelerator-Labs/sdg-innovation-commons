> Brief description of the innovation

The rationale of this project is creation of safe spaces and worthwhile disability zones. The existence of a Disability safe space in every institution of learning has potential to elicit heated reactions from society. They have power to strengthen the voice and relevance of persons living with disabilities. Safe spaces have recorded a high number of success stories in most developed countries. It seeks to provide emotional security, an interconnectedness of similar values and nurturing/stimulating environment. The Disability Safezone seeks to pilot a haven safe space for persons living with disabilities. It has potential to boost the performance of persons living with disabilities, they provide a break from judgment, unsolicited opinions, they allow people to feel supported and respected. This encompasses group meetings with a mentor who provides training on health, leadership and life skills, as well as discusses issues that affect Young teenage girls who are disabled on issues to do with sexual reproductive health rights, child marriage and adolescent pregnancy, and how they can seek help. The safe space has a simple rule that boosts its long term impact.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Disability SafeZone has an outstanding sustainability plan that is currently ongoing and sets the record. We have an existing sustainability plan called "Food Bank Zambia" were on our first ever venture we received direct support from the Ministry of Livestock and Agriculture, we generate income through venturing in Poultry Farming, Vegetable growing and meet products packaging as a sustainability plan. It has improved already existing businesses in that the market directly benefit by supplying them our products, the local community and Government by heavily supporting the outstay work.
This prize will greatly enlarge our territory as we posses potential to take off, we will use the prize award by accommodating more persons living with disabilities in our programs, improve our training workshops by purchasing computers, purchase permanent land and set up our offices in our district.

> Technical Feasibility

The implementation plan is managed at national and international level by Fountain of Peace and Support Organization and implementation of the project at field level with the head offices being in Shibuyunji district. The process of policy dialogue determines priorities at national level and this generates buy-in for national level action. We are working with an international Organization UNLEASH based in Denmark for it's official launch in Zambia. With the help if the government we intend to work with every Primary school and Secondary schools by forming a first ever Disability SafeZone club were at a young age people kearn the nature of disabilities in the process reduce inequalities that exists. At University level and the community at large form a standard facility were people can freely get information on various disabilities in the process reducing inequalities and injustice practices among persons living with disabilities in Zambia. Ee increase engagement by opening representative organizations of people with disabilities at each level will be involved at all stages of the project's development - at the level of the "project committee", in the development of each core product/action and the development and monitoring of the project. A strategy for how to effectively involve people with disabilities at the planning stage for each action. Each level is responsible for reporting on actions under their responsibility which is consolidated by Donors. This project fits within the overall programme, policy and monitoring structure In this context, the project is subject to all of Fountain of Peace and Supports operational procedures e.g. contracting, procuring, finance control, etc. Fountain of Peace and Support has internal operational oversight and audit procedures which obviate risks such as corruption, a well rounded code of conduct  and mismanagement. Criteria for selecting pilot projects will be developed within the first six months of the project. We take into consideration interest from the country, governance, available infrastructure, human resource capacity, finances available, partner capacity (Government, NGO and social organizations), and the ability for the project to leverage systemic change and increase regional capacity for action. Across the portfolio of activity, attention is given to ensure gender equality, pro poor emphasis and cross disability involvement with a focus on underrepresented groups. Further tools on how to assess the situation and the readiness of countries for policy change will be developed as part of the project. These tools will assist in providing a contextual analysis, building a baseline and identifying stakeholders, and will be employed with countries during national level policy dialogues on the Donor report.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The impact of this innovation and it's evaluation highlights the strong contribution that the programme makes and has greater potential to unravel the momentum created by the 2030 Agenda and create preconditions for accountability on reduced inequalities of persons with disabilities in the Education and Health sector. The impact is measured through increased space for representation of persons with disabilities, stronger cohesion of the movement to speak with one voice, increased evidence to guide and monitor SDG implementation in compliance with the law. The programme has outstanding potential to contributed significantly to enhance the technical and operational capacities of disability activists and OPDs to engage in advancing their rights worldwide.
