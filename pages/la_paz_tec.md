## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Citizens are eager to participate in futures thinking exercises, but it is difficult for them to switch from their current demands to focus on potential needs in the future.
- Cross-sectoral clustering efforts should be prioritized in order to leverage transversal impact opportunities like inclusive digital transformation, women's economic empowerment and youth active participation.
- Portfolio approach is good enough to start engagement with donors, but a specific impact agenda with each donor should be built with the local government to move from interest to commitment.
- To incentivize citizen participation beyond initial brainstorming, sectoral innovation challenges look like a good opportunity to increase citizen's engagement.
- Bi-directional communication within participants in the ecosystem is key to keep them interested and start developing a sense of ownership

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
It has not been published yet

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Although there is great interest on the topic, usually urgent socioeconomic needs get prioritized first, understandably, so innovation, technology, or futures thinking do not get public sector attention beside the specific activities where the topics are discussed

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There was no updated data regarding future expectations, after the pandemic, for the economic growth of the sectors, accelerated by technology and innovation

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We were aiming for collective imagination to bring diverse viewpoints to the initial agenda setting for La Paz Tec
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Since it was a collective exercise, we invited several civil society organizations to participate in the futures thinking exercise 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Similar to above, we invited several academic partners to participate in each of the 8 roundtables so they can provide their perspective

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Several private companies were invited to participate in the following roundtables: tourism, gastronomy, culture, digital economy, commerce, industry, manufacturing & eco-entrepreneurship

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

La Paz Municipal Government
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The interplay was key to get unusual partners excited to be part of a new collective approach

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
