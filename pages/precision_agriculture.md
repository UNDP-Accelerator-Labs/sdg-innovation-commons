> Type of the Solution

Technology &amp; Management Approach

> Affected Sector

Agriculture

> Description of the solution

An approach to farming that uses technology and data to improve decision-making for crop management. It involves gathering information about soil conditions, crop health, and other factors to optimize resource use (water, fertilizer, pesticides) and ultimately increase agricultural productivity, sustainability, and contribute to improved air quality.

> Socio-economic effects

Increased crop yields, reduced environmental impact (water use, pesticide use), improved farm profitability, potential for job creation in data analysis and technology sectors, positive impact on air quality

> Type of Measure

- 1. active measures (direct measures for reduction of air pollution)

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- households/individuals

> Timescale of implementation

- long-term (5 and above)

> Other Notes

Farmers, Agricultural Businesses, Research Institutions can lead the solution. The specific technologies and practices used in precision agriculture can vary depending on the farm size, resources, and crop types. The resources provided from IRRI focus on applications in rice production but the concept is applicable to various crops. Precision agriculture can contribute to improved air quality by reducing emissions and improving soil health.
