# "Tanzania: Accelerator Lab's Innovative Approach to Solid Waste Management"

[[0:00]] Hello, my name is Ghati Horombe from UNDP Tanzania\. I'm the head of solutions mapping for the Accelerator Accelerator Lab programme in Tanzania\.

### [[0:10]] Hi Ghati, nice to see you here\. I just want to ask you and perhaps begin this conversation with the R&D story you want to tell us\. Can you please elaborate a bit on that? What is very amazing story to share you know in the context of R&D\.

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
So as AccLab, we started our R&D journey with since making where we had the discussion or rather you know we convene discussion with our country office environment team to try to explore the entry point for the art club\. And one of the sport that we identified was around solid waste management\. It's an area of opportunity for you know advancing circular economy in the country and this particular area was not invested much by the country office\. So we thought it's worthy backing on it in our R&D journey\.

### [[1:12]] Can you please perhaps tell a bit about tools and methods? What did you use? How was the experience of deploying such, such a practice?

[[principles:Data sharing]]
[[principles:Be open by default]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
All right\. So I'll start responding to that by sharing with you why we embarked on solid waste management\. So for us actually we wanted really to use unusual data sources to try first to understand the solid waste management situation in the country because we believed we need first to understand, you know, how big the challenge is before embarking into different solutions\. So we wanted to experiment the unusual data sources which are not in use in the country because the government rely heavily on the, you know, traditional data sources like from NBS and other government settings\. So for us, we use open data and satellite imageries to map the area\. So we piloted this in one of the one in Monza region, it's called Bongo what to try to test these unusual data sources\. So through that we were able to collect a very useful data sources\. And in the journey, we thought we will only engage with the government and Open Map Tanzania, which is an NGO doing, you know, open mapping to map different sites\. But later on along the journey, we learnt a new skill that was collective intelligence and that actually widened the scope because it allowed us now to engage not only with the technology but again with even community members\. So we trained community members to use the old DK, which again is an open data source, to collect both qualitative and quantitative data to inform the situation\. So finally, we found ourselves having both quantitative data and qualitative data combining informing us and to understand the solid waste management situation in that particular area in the country\.

### [[3:30]] What can you say about the impact of your work? How was that actually perceived to be?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[tools:How might we]]
Wow? So the impact of our work has been very tremendous\. And as we talk about diffusion and catalyze, I can see that has been a very big impact in that angle because at first we didn't know exactly what the impact would be, let's say\. But later on we came to realize that through the data set that we came up with, they were very useful to the innovators and to the government to understand the amount of, you know, waste that is generated and the type of waste that is, you know, collected\. So finally we reached to a point to realize that the huge composition of solid waste in that particular area was plastic and organic waste, which could be very useful to the innovators who are trying to recycle the organic waste, you know, into manure and, and other products and plastic waste into plastic timber and, and other products\. So that's it was a one angle of the impact that we created\. But along sharing the product, the data set through our blogs and within UN, UNDP and other agencies, we were approached by UN WTO, which is a world tourist organization who wanted to experiment the same approach collective intelligence to try to generate data set around the tourist sector in an island called Zanzibar in the country\. So that has been, you know, a very big impact because the government of Zanzibar was very receptive and through the Commission of, you know, tourism in Zanzibar, we are able to generate data that inform the tourist sites that were not explored\. You know, they are not identified and therefore not used\. And so as we speak right now, our blue economy portfolio has picked that evidence and I put a, a, a proposal that was funded by Track\. We received around 1\.5 million to do the project in Zanzibar around circular economy\.

### [[6:06]] What would you do differently if you have to start again? Is there anything that you want to do differently now that you have already had the journey?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Data sharing]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
That's very interesting because talking about how we bring about innovation ecosystem along the journey, I think in data collection, I think it could be more valuable for us to engage more with the innovators who are already practicing, you know, recycling and all these sort of activities in circular economy\. So if we are to be given a another chance, we could have looked even into the police aspect around the issue around solid waste management and how this data could you know influence policy change or create enabling environment for innovators in secular economy\.

### [[7:00]] Thank you\.

Thank you so much\.
