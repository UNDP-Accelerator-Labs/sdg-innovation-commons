There are less than 100 usable toilets in Dhaka - a city of more than 20 million people. In this situation, Bhumijo, a local social enterprise, has come up with a much needed solution. Bhumijo provides facilities that include male toilet, urinal, wash stations, drinking water, separate female facilities and differently abled-friendly toilet with wash stations. Besides these, the facilities also include diaper changing station, ablution and legwashing area. Additional features include provision of shower, laundromat service and refreshments (tea, snacks etc). The facilities are equipped with smart entry, feedback and security system. Video, static and audio advertising spaces are available both inside and outside the facility. Bhumijo believes clean toilet is a human right. No women should be worried about public toilets while out. Public toilets should be clean and usable when needed. The job of providing clean toilet service should be dignified and valued. Bhumijo envisions to end the public toilet crisis all over Bangladesh by 2030.
