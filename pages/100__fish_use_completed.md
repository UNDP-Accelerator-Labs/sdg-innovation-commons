## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. The leather tanning process utilized for fish waste skin while eco-friendly is however time consuming, labour intensive and expensive for the context of Samoa. Several challenges in undertaking this experiment was the sourcing of the right cleaning products, tanning agents and measurement aparatus to ensure the tanning process can be done from beginning to end. Despite AccLab's ability to source alternatives, the overall result of using alternatives affects the quality of the finished leather.

2. Communities can contribute to the success of such an innovation through collective supply of fish waste skin. However, in a country like Samoa, it would take several weeks to build up fish skin supply as most families (including fishing communities) already have avenues of how and where to dispose of fish waste skin i.e. used for fertilizer and animal feed.

3. The private sector plays an integral role in sustaining the fish skin leather innovation through several ways i.e. it can scale operations and import agents and other necessary products for leather processing. However, the challenge would always be on the supply end of the potential business i.e. fish waste skin. The 100% Fish use innovation is not sustainable for local communities for reasons stated above i.e. time consuming, labour intensive and expensive to maintain.

4. In the context of the 100% Fish use experiment, there are no apparent social and cultural benefits in local communities being involved in the innovation process. This process will simply become another chore to be included in the daily routine of local communities with minimal returns initially if there is no significant capital and infrastructure investment to turn this innovation into a viable business. Samoa's food culture also means that almost every part of seafood caught is utilized. This innovation will not contribute any significant benefits towards social and cultural practices etc.

5. The most important lesson to be taken from this initiative is that any waste management initiative, innovation or other will NOT work or be sustainable in the context of Samoa, Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau for the simple fact that the infrastructure to support such initiatives is not present. 

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

There will be no handover process until there is interest either from the community or private sector to take on board this innovation. However, should there be a handover process, Samoa AccLab will be producing a Fish leather manual toolkit in English and Samoa as a knowledge product and will be made available for public access free of charge for interested parties to utilize this innovation as a potential source of income.
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The leather making process is a hands on process. Given the limitations in acquiring tanning agents, dyes, cleaning produts and equipment. The learning process required continuous feedback, discussions, observing while at the same time being taught the practical innovation process. Since Tototo was also here for a limited time, much of the learning exchange was through oratory means and being involved in the tanning process. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Because of the practicality of the innovation introduced.
