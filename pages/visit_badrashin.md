> Description / Mission Statement

Egypt is known abroad for its deserts and artefacts, but Egyptians retain a strong rural identity and over half of the country's citizens live in the countryside. The Visit Badrashin! Project launched in 2018 with the mission of creating off-the-beaten track tour experiences which heed attention to this sizable and important link to Egyptian heritage – the Egyptian countryside and its people, traditional food, crafts, story tellers, landscapes and activities.
