A pilot project for waste classification was carried out in collaboration with the municipality of Río Hondo, Zacapa. The objective was that more than 140 homes in Río Hondo began to classify their waste into "organic“ "inorganic“ and “recyclable”, trying to make it a coordinated work between neighbors, municipality and collectors.   


This Project brings together the learnings of the first qualifying pilot project carried out in zone 5, so it is better designed and covers many things that were not done during the first pilot.
