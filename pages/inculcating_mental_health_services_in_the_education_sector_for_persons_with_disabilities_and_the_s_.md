INCULCATING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND THE SOCALLED NORMAL

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovator provides tools to ensure that learners with disabilities learn on an equal basis with others. the following are tools used in the assessment 
1. developmental assessment
2.  screening tests
3. intelligence quotient
4. adaptive behavior scales

A developmental assessment is an attempt to assess various aspects of the child's functioning, including areas such as cognition, communication, behavior, social interaction, motor and sensory abilities, and adaptive skills.
 Screening is the first step in child find. The first assessment that must be thorough ought to be done at grade one or primary level. Thereafter, re-assessment must be done continuously. The process of assessment is as follows:
Collection: The process of tracing and gathering information from the many sources of background information on a child such as school records, observation, parent intakes, and teacher reports
Analysis: The processing and understanding of patterns in a child’s educational, social, developmental, environmental, medical, and emotional history
Evaluation: The evaluation of a child’s academic, intellectual, psychological, emotional, perceptual, language, cognitive, and medical development in order to determine areas of strength and weakness
Determination: The determination of the presence of a suspected disability and the knowledge of the criteria that constitute each category
Recommendation: The recommendations concerning educational placement and programs that need to be made to the school, teachers, and parents

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The idea can be registered at the patent's office as intellectual property. Once registered and can be used to earn money from anyone who uses it. The target market is learning institutions, health, and psychology clinics. When the institutions use the services will also benefit because of students who will be excelling and will lead to more people being enrolled especially learners with disabilities. It will enable them to be independent living and self-sustenance.
The challenge reward will help grow the idea develop further, marketing it online, advertising and registration. 
The additional value to the environment is on the Social environment which is to improve the lives of learners with disabilities. Their ability to finish school and they will be able to find employment or pursue further studies like their non-disabled counterparts.

> Technical Feasibility

Mine being a social science innovation and not technical innovation, the innovator will ensure that formal and informal assessment reveals students' progress toward intended learning goals. Assessment design considers the what, when, and how of assessment. the innovator is designed as follows:
 screening and identification: to screen children and identify those who may be experiencing delays or learning problems
eligibility and diagnosis: to determine whether a child has a disability and is eligible for special education services, and to diagnose the specific nature of the student's problems or disability
IEP development and placement: to provide detailed information so that an Individualized Education Program (IEP) may be developed and appropriate decisions may be made about the child's educational placement
instructional planning: to develop and plan instruction appropriate to the child's special needs
evaluation: to evaluate student progress
Generally, implementation plans span one to three years and articulate stages of awareness, partial implementation, and full implementation or goal attainment. A key consideration in the implementation process is defining​ indicators of progress

> Anticipated Social Impact

Physical health is as important as mental health for the well-being of persons with disabilities. It has however been neglected as a core business and function for the delivering of quality education. It is in this vein that l would like to propose the innovation of mental health services in schools. Mental health services in schools come with a motive to bridge the gap between learners with disabilities and the learner's so-called normal. It helps the school psychologists to come up with assessment tools and education plans to identify learners with disabilities and do a SWOT analysis to enable them to be placed accordingly.
Mental health strengthens the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcohol by school-going children. 
Parents of learners with disabilities could benefit from these services ensuring their security and knowledge of coping with the condition at hand. As the saying goes, health is wealth. With the differences in human mental strength, we as a people handle and react to things differently. 
school Psychologists and education psychologists are key factors in, especially government schools where they are not considered seriously. I can not say the same thing about private schools.
This innovation will improve the quality of education for learners with disabilities as well as the stakeholders, who in this case are teachers and parents.
