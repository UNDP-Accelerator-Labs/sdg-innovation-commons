Water scarcity is one of Libya’s greatest challenges, threatening its long-term stability, development, and even social cohesion. As one of the most water-stressed nations globally, Libya relies predominantly on non-renewable groundwater resources, with agriculture alone consuming 85% of this precious supply. Excessive reliance on non-renewable groundwater has resulted in groundwater depletion, seawater intrusion, and an acute water shortage, with a projected deficit of 4,200 million cubic meters by 2025. Over the past decade, political instability has further exacerbated these challenges, damaging critical infrastructure and weakening the resilience of key water institutions. The consequences extend beyond development—limited access to water can fuel tensions, disrupt community cohesion, and undermine peace. As such, sustainable water management is not just an environmental priority but a vital component for ensuring long-term stability and social harmony in Libya.Recognizing the urgency, UNDP has partnered with the Government of National Unity (GNU) to establish a committee to develop a National Water Security Strategy (NWSS). This strategy aims to lay the foundation for a sustainable and equitable approach to water governance and resource management, ensuring its efficient use and equitable distribution. The strategy also focuses on mitigating the impacts of climate change, addressing infrastructure deterioration, and strengthening the country’s water resource management institutions in Libya.The team has already completed the inception report for the strategy, marking a key milestone in the formulation process. While a formal launch of the strategy is planned for in October, much of the groundwork is being laid now, involving critical stakeholders and experts in shaping a more sustainable future for Libya’s water resources.Innovation in ActionAlongside this strategic planning, innovation is playing a critical role in addressing Libya’s immediate environmental challenges. Earlier this month, I had the privilege of attending a workshop organized by UNDP Libya’s Accelerator Lab together with the Minister of Local Governance and representatives from Germany and Qatar. The event brought together geologists, hydrologists, technologists, and community stakeholders to explore how advanced tools like remote sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) can be leveraged to monitor the rise in groundwater and the formation of earth fissures in regions such as Zliten and Bi’r al Ghanam.This workshop demonstrated how innovation can bridge the gap between urgent challenges and long-term solutions. The insights gained through these technologies allow for real-time monitoring and early warnings that can help reduce further damage to critical infrastructure. These technologies complement the broader objectives of the NWSS by providing immediate, actionable solutions that can be integrated into national strategies.Turning Challenges into OpportunitiesOne of the key takeaways from the Accelerator Lab workshop was the potential to turn environmental challenges into opportunities for sustainable development. For example, excess groundwater, which currently threatens infrastructure, could be treated and repurposed for agricultural use, enhancing food security in affected regions and relieving pressure on groundwater resources by promoting more efficient and sustainable water use practices.These ideas exemplify the collaborative and forward-thinking approach UNDP is fostering through its work in Libya. We are not just responding to crises but bringing various actors together and exploring how we can turn adversity into opportunities that benefit the people and the planet. By addressing water, agriculture, and sustainable development through an integrated, cross-sectoral approach, we are leveraging the nexus between environmental sustainability, economic resilience, and community well-being.Building Resilience for the FutureUNDP’s National Water Security Project complements the Accelerator Lab’s efforts by focusing on long-term water governance and infrastructure rebuilding. This September marked one year since the devastating Floods that severely damaged water and sanitation systems in Derna. In response, and as part of UNDP’s early recovery efforts, UNDP has conducted a detailed Water Infrastructure Damages Assessment and developed a Recovery Plan, working closely with local authorities to ensure that these systems are rebuilt to withstand future shocks, protecting communities in the affected regions from future water-related crises. Achieving sustainable water management and ensuring the success of recovery efforts in Libya also requires institutional unification. A fragmented governance landscape can hinder effective decision-making and the implementation of cohesive strategies. Bringing together divided institutions under a unified water governance framework is critical to building resilience and ensuring long-term stability

The challenges Libya faces in securing its water future are immense. But with innovation, strategic planning, and collaboration, we believe that a sustainable and resilient water management system is within reach. Together with local stakeholders, national institutions, and our international partners, we are laying the foundation for a water-secure future that benefits all Libyans.
