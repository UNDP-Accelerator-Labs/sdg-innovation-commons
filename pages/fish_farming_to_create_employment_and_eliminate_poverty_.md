Fish Farming To Create Employment and Eliminate Poverty.

> Brief description of the innovation

Fish Farming (Tilapia) is more profitable than any other type of farming. Fish Farming if Tilapia is less costly, simple to manage and more profitable than other forms of farming.
This project is mainly aimed at creating employment and eliminating poverty among the women, youths, students and every citizen at large.
Tilapia are formed in both intensive and extensive aquaculture systems. Most farmers prefer open air earthen ponds, so do I. 
Under my project and it’s farming conditions, females spawn every 17 days. If the water quality and temperatures are manipulated to a favorable environment which I think mine is, market sizes fish can be obtained in 5 to 8 months. 
After this short period of time, a lot of job opportunities are created to help eliminate poverty.
My goal with and after this project is to make the citizens for Zambia including myself earn a living. 
The youths will be part for this job creating project thus they’ll stay away away from drugs and alcohol abuse and all sorts of crime. The women will no longer be beginning in the streets for this will be a call for employment.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My target market are restaurants, butcheries, un-employed youths, jobless citizens and  both local are super markets.
Once I sell my product, I’ll make a good profit that will be able to sponsor me in collage. Me being a student, my fellow students will see this as a call for employment, this project will be open for everyone to make ends meet, others can order my products and supply on their own price to make profit. Female marketeers will order and supply to the streets, youths around the farm/pond area will be employed to work within government the farm and boost the country’s economy.

> Technical Feasibility

My implementation plan is having an easy flow of production on a huge piece of land which I already have, located in sinjela area, chongwe. 
I designed my farm/pond to have:
* Pumps which are mostly used to pumping water in or outside the pond.
* Water Testing Equipments, these are provided in order to help in testing the waters.
* Nets, these gather all the fish together for harvesting.
* Aeration Equipments, these facilitates batter flow of oxygen within the ponds.
* Fish Graders for separating fish according to their individual size.
* Fish Tank Ponds, these are constructed to hold large amounts of fish for harvesting and normally constructed expertly to enable better environment for the fish.
* Feed, for fish to grow healthy.
* Generators, for power supply.
* Water tanks for water supply.
* Borehole if possible for sufficient water supply.
* Medicine Incase there is a disease.
With all these equipments, my designed innovation would be a life changing project for me and my fellow citizens.

Although fish farming does not haven  lot of disadvantages, diseases and unexpected accidents are one of them. That is why I will have this project go under insurance and make sure I have enough medicine for the fish Incase of an unexpected disease.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Tilapia Fish is number 1 fish on the market, it has a high demand. Nutritionists recommend fish and an important nutrition to every age group so my fast production will be able to supply to marketeers on both small and large scale or according to how they want my product. I do believe even those that are unemployed will take this opportunity to start up a business of their own. As restaurants and butcheries etc are my target market, lives of other people will improve and employment opportunities will be high.
Youths around the farm area will have employment as hey will be employed to be part of this successful business grown and that will put something in their pockets are prevent them from getting involved into drug abuse, alcohol abuse, theft and all sorts of crime. 
Restaurant and butchery owners will take this as a call for employment for they will not be in shot of fish supply to their business that would lessen their profit.
