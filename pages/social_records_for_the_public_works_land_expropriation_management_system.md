## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Based on the design and implementation of a module for the Expropriation Management System (S.G.E) of the Ministry of Public Works and Communications, it is proposed that affected families can easily consult information on the status of their file, increasing the trust and transparency in the process. In order to effectively measure and evaluate the progress and success of the Expropriation Management System's social module, both quantitative and qualitative metrics will be used. These metrics are directly related to the key use case of the platform and will be complemented by specific tools and Instruments. 

Can the use of a data platform increase trust towards the public institution in vulnerable families affected by an expropriation process? 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we implement a module to easily access information on the files of the Expropriation Management System of the Ministry of Public Works and Communications, THEN the affected families will increase their trust in those responsible and their perception of transparency of the process. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Measure the number of families/users that successfully consult the files per month. 

Additionally, conduct user satisfaction surveys or interviews with users (affected families and MOPC officials) to assess their satisfaction with the social module. Questions about ease of use, clarity of the information provided, and trust in the system can help measure satisfaction. Include questions about perception of transparency. Ask if the families feel the system provides up-to-date and reliable information, and if it allows them to effectively track their files. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Users of the platform 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Manual data entry: Manually record relevant information, such as the number of visits, conversions and session time, using spreadsheets or other tools. Apply an interview that evaluates the level of trust and perception of transparency in potential users. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

4 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Not proven yet

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

4 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

For the pilot development, the MOPC team received $20,000 in support from IADB and UNDP, enabling them to access the necessary technology and technical support, including an R&amp;D specialist with a focus on user experience (UX). Over two months, the team worked on the development of the Social Census Module, leading to the following lessons learned for similar initiatives: 

Advantages 

Leadership: The technical person responsible for the current system's development is also in charge of implementing the new module, providing fluency and knowledge in the implementation challenges. 

Expertise: The development team consists of technical professionals specialized in web and mobile development. They also have previous experience in census systems used for family surveys. 

Existing Base Tool: The SGE already exists, and MOPC's technicians use the system. 

Challenges 

Enhanced Communication: Establishing dialogue channels for co-creation with other parties involved in the module's development, particularly those related to user experience, is necessary. 

Technological Updates: The SGE uses outdated software, requiring constant adjustments in the process of incorporating the new module.

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Piloting and implementation to ongoing use by the Public Works ministry

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

No

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The lack of clear communication on the part of the technical team of the public institution hinders the progress of other parties involved, such as the user experience. The absence of a dedicated designer within the technical team made it difficult to develop the product. The technology previously used to build the EMS is outdated, which requires constant fixing, and there were many difficulties for the public sector team to meet the schedule of meetings of effective way. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Vulnerable families affected by expropriations 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

The need for a dedicated designer to put into practice the research carried out was identified. This would facilitate fluidity in the conversations between the UX consultant and the development team, ensuring a better implementation of the findings and recommendations. 

 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

It is necessary to prepare a weekly or biweekly monitoring plan by the team in charge of development to maintain a constant rhythm. Concise communication from the technical team should be improved to avoid confusion and delays.
