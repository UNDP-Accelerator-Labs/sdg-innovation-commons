Animal Waste Management . Soukaina Bouba Dalil, a young Cameroonian lady from the Far-North Region targets animal breeders, farmers and households as she produces biogaz. She collects animal waste such as beef dung, poultry manure and pig manure which is put into a biodigester for the production of biogaz.

According to Soukaina, these mobile biodigesters are conceived to ease access for households who cannot afford to construct the static system in their homes. It is also easily accessible for  lighting up animal farms and to keep them warm, particularly poultry
