Foreword

Dr. Ayodele Odusola
Resident Representative,
UNDP South Africa

UNDP Africa’s Strategic Offer (2022 – 2025) anchors its
vision on a promise: to build on the power and
ingenuity of Africa’s communities to innovate toward
their own futures. A step toward tapping home-grown
ingenuity is to explore how informal innovation and
entrepreneurship really work in Africa. We need to
understand what motivates innovators, how their
innovations emerge and spread, how an ecosystem for
innovation and entrepreneurship is structured, and
what policies can be designed to support them.

This research is the first of its kind. In it, the UNDP
Accelerator Labs, in partnership with Utrecht University,
the University of Johannesburg, and the MIT Sloan
School of Management, have conducted the first-ever
survey on informal innovation and entrepreneurship in
South Africa. This work found that 2.5% of South
Africans aged 18 and over —1 million people— have
innovated. This percentage is higher than those
previously observed in China (2.1%) and South Korea
(1.5%). This suggests that informal innovation is not
only widespread in South Africa, but that its innovation
capacity is underestimated.
When informal innovators develop solutions to serve
themselves and their communities, and those
innovations don’t spread, we lose massive opportunities
for solving problems and income generation. But we
can only intervene to support these innovators if we
understand why and how they innovate, what types of
innovations they create, how they spread, what
resources they need, and the policies needed to enable
informal innovation to thrive.

This report will help UNDP Africa advise African
governments on untapped innovation opportunities. It
will also help policymakers at the African Union and
other supporters of innovation to understand what
makes informal innovation ecosystems distinct and use
this knowledge to support informal innovation to uplift
and transform communities.

Key insights from this study

This research is the first statistical representation of informal innovation in South Africa.
It uses methodology comparable to that used in high-income countries such as the US,
UK, Russia, China and South Korea. While data collection methods are comparable, the
higher rate of informal businesses in South Africa make this research both novel in that
it helps us understand informal economy innovation, and cautions direct comparisons,
especially related to the rate of commercialization among innovations.

Informal innovation
One million informal innovators. In the South African economy, many citizens spend their
leisure time developing new products. Amongst citizens aged 18 and older, we estimate
that 2.5% have innovated in the past three years, representing around 1 million
innovators. The fraction of 2.5% is in sync with other countries (usual range is 1.5% to
6.2%), and higher than percentages previously observed in South Korea and China.
Informal innovation is embedded in general do-it-yourself (DIY) behavior in which
citizens use their leisure time to build existing products for themselves (DIY applies to
an estimated 13% of South Africa’s citizens).

Many innovations are children- and education-related. We found that 36% of all reported
informal innovations were meant to help children. This exceeds what has been
observed in other countries. South Africans develop complementary study materials,
games and applications to acquire basic skills including reading and arithmetic, but also
to familiarize the younger generation with engineering principles, to mention only a
few examples. This finding probably reflects the demographic makeup of the country,
with a substantial younger generation and relatively few elderly people.

Innovation frequency is higher in affluent groups. As in other comparable studies, people
are more likely to innovate when they have completed more formal education, have
higher incomes, and live in prosperous areas. These people are also more likely to
share their innovations freely. In contrast, in lower income/education groups (including
township residents) innovators are more likely to innovate out of necessity and seek to
generate income from disseminating their innovations.

Dissemination of informal innovations is relatively high. 33% of the informal innovations in
South Africa are developed in collaboration with other people, which exceeds all other
countries. Innovations also disseminate better: over 50% of the informal innovations
are directly shared with peers, and over 10% are commercialized (in other countries this
is usually 25% and 5%). While diffusion appears higher in South Africa than elsewhere, it
remains a frontier where investments are needed.

There are four types of informal innovators: users, participators, helpers and vendors.
Their innovations are driven by, respectively: personal need to use their innovation,
enjoyment of the innovation process and learning new skills, altruism to help others

5.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

and commercial intentions. South Africa has many innovators that are the ‘helper’ and
‘vendor’ type, explaining the aforementioned favorable dissemination rates.

6.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Informal business ownership
Informal business is more widespread than formal business ownership. We estimate that in
South Africa, 2.5 million citizens (6.2%) run a business that is completely informal:
unregistered, not paying taxes, without keeping financial records, and without a bank
account. Another 5.9% runs a business that is only partially formalized. The number of
(partially) informal businesses exceeds the formal business ownership rate, which is
estimated at 5.3%. This study illuminates business activity that is not visible in
international statistics.

People in low-income groups tend to run informal businesses. Informal business ownership
is more frequent among women, those with lower levels of formal education and
township residents. If informal business ownership in the official statistics is included,
the typically higher frequencies of business ownership amongst well-educated and
high-income groups would diminish.

Informal innovation and business ownership are strongly related. Business owners are
more likely to be informal innovators, and vice versa. Especially in low-income
communities (including townships), informal innovators start informal businesses to
generate income with their innovations. In contrast, for formal business owners, it is
shown that more informal innovations are unrelated to their business and that they
share for free.

Policy implications
Policy intervention is merited to address lack of dissemination incentives and commercial
barriers. As in other countries, many informal innovators in South Africa lack incentives
to disseminate their innovations. This ‘diffusion failure’ merits policy attention: it means
that innovations are not reaching their full potential. Next, the (mostly informal)
businesses that are starting to commercialize informal innovations face challenges
related to down-to-earth growth barriers like finance and infrastructure.

Different innovation policies are merited, to address basic problems. The emergence of
informal innovations and businesses differs from the formal business sector. In the
informal sector, it is everyday problems that matter, such as access to simple
innovation tools, vending places and microfinance – not the more sophisticated
innovation challenges that formal businesses face, such as access to scientific
knowledge, a highly-educated workforce and advanced appropriation schemes.
Examples of policy interventions in the informal sector arena are: public support for
makerspaces to provide access to innovation tools, securing internet access for all and
maintaining a sound physical infrastructure (including access to electricity).

1. Introduction

1.1. Motivation

In contrast to common wisdom, a lot of innovation and business development in society
happens informally: outside the business sector. Individuals in the household sector
innovate at a private cost during their unpaid discretionary time – no one pays them to
do it, and they often do not protect their design with patents. Consequently, their
designs are potentially acquirable by anyone for free. Citizens may innovate for several
reasons: personal need, enjoyment, learning and self-development, helping others, and
commercial reasons (von Hippel, 2017).

Household sector innovation is ‘informal’ as it is unrecorded in official statistics.
Nevertheless, it has been found in many countries, and is clearly present in any
economy (de Jong & von Hippel, 2022). Box 1 gives some examples we encountered
while doing interviews in South Africa.

Box 1. Examples of informal innovations in the South African household sector

Chicken plucker
(manually operated device to
efficiently remove feathers)

Automotive fuse holder
(to organize fuses and easily
see when to order new stock)

Cross-shoulder bags
(fit to purpose from recycled
materials)

Notes: examples of informal innovations encountered in 26 interviews with South African citizens.

Informal innovation contributes to economic development in multiple ways. First,
informal innovation is a source of products with new functionality (Riggs & von Hippel,
1994; Ogawa, 1998) and new industries emerge out of informal innovation activities
(e.g. Shah & Tripsas, 2007). Second, informal innovations sometimes compete with
existing commercial products, when individuals build cheaper versions of existing
products. This reduces overall prices and enhances consumer welfare (Gambardella et
al., 2017). Third, informal innovations sometimes complement existing products (e.g., a
car and a trailer), and hence expand their use value.

Informal innovations are often also useful to other people, but these broader societal
benefits are only reaped when informal innovations diffuse to other people. Most
citizens lack incentives to diffuse what they have built (de Jong et al., 2015). Without
diffusion, each adopter who might benefit from a solution has to make the same
innovation effort – a poor use of resources from a social welfare perspective. In general,

8.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

informal innovations may be shared directly with peers, or be commercialized. In the
case that innovations spread via commercial pathways, this can happen through
formal, existing businesses, but also via startups that only become visible after a lot of
work has been done (Shah & Tripsas, 2007).

There is a lack of studies in developing countries with huge informal sectors
This report delivers the first findings on informal innovation in the household sector on
the African continent. So far, studies of informal innovation have only been done in
highly developed countries (e.g., UK, Netherlands, Japan, Finland, Canada) and
economies that have made significant development progress (e.g., Emirates, China),
but not yet in developing countries. We collected data in South Africa, to explore the
nature of informal innovation, and benchmark with other countries. Additionally, we
investigated how informal innovation is related to new business development and
identified implications for policy making.

The informal sector is dominant in all African countries, and South Africa is no
exception. The share of the informal economy in non-agricultural employment is
estimated to be 74.5% for sub-Saharan countries (Kraemer-Mbula & Wunsch-Vincent,
2016). The informal sector is typically associated with poverty and social exclusion, as it
includes activities performed by people that are marginalized, such as people living in
townships. (In the South African context, the term ‘township’ refers to settlements that
were planned by the apartheid government for black workers to achieve racial
segregation within cities. In post-apartheid South Africa, townships remain
characterized by socio-economic deprivation.)

Innovation in the informal sector clearly deviates from the formal sector: it is non-R&D-
based, very collaborative, revolves around technology adaptation more than invention,
adheres to circular economy principles (minimize resources, reuse, repurpose) and is
heavily constrained (Kraemer-Mbula & Wunsch-Vincent, 2016; Kaplinsky and Kraemer-
Mbula, 2022). Also, informal businesses are widely present in developing countries, as it
is quite normal to encounter companies that are unregistered, are not known to the tax
authorities, do not keep financial records, and do not have a bank account (Williams et
al., 2016). For example, the cross-shoulder bags in Box 1 are commercialized in
businesses that are impossible to detect in public sources.

A related and important issue is that national innovation and
business/entrepreneurship strategies are often still informed by insights from
developed countries, disregarding how much economic activity happens in the informal
sector. To inform policymaking, it is important to integrally study the factors that
enable the development, diffusion and commercialization of informal innovations that
are developed by citizens in the household sector, and we deploy an ecosystems
approach for this purpose.

1.2. Purpose

9.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

We investigated innovation and business development in the informal sector of South
Africa to achieve the following three goals:

1. Explore the nature, processes and diffusion of informal innovation;
2. Explore the nature and characteristics of informal business ownership. In doing
so, we also investigated to what extent informal innovations are related to
informal business development as a pathway towards diffusion;

3. Map the ecosystem for informal innovation and business development and

identify policy implications.

This report summarizes our most important findings: the results of the explorations
described above are given in chapter 2 (informal innovation), 3 (informal business
ownership) and 4 (ecosystem and policy implications). In chapter 5 we conclude. Our
research project included a survey of South African citizens, dozens of in-depth
interviews, and extensive literature and desk-research (including consultations with
experts). For a description of our research methods, we refer to Appendix 1, while our
references list is in Appendix 2.

2. Informal innovation

2.1. General principles
Informal innovations (usually referred to as household innovations) are functionally
novel products, processes, or other applications that consumers develop in their leisure
time without being paid to do so (de Jong & von Hippel, 2022).

Why do individuals in the household sector develop products in their leisure time? Their
motives clearly deviate from businesses. Table 2 provides an overview of how informal
innovation in the household sector differs from the business sector.

Notes: overview based on de Jong & von Hippel (2022).

Citizens mostly innovate for non-commercial reasons
In the business sector, innovations are primarily developed for commercial reasons: to
be sold as a product, to operate more efficiently (process innovations) or to facilitate
the production of products (technological innovations). They eventually benefit from
their innovation efforts when other organizations or people (customers) adopt their
products or services (von Hippel, 2005). For this purpose, businesses develop products
to bring to the market, perform R&D and sometimes license their technologies to other
organizations.

In contrast, individuals in the household sector are usually not commercially motivated.
They develop solutions to personal problems or challenges that otherwise remain
unsolved, or that they cannot afford to buy. Alternatively, citizens may derive benefits
from the innovation process itself, such as enjoyment, learning, or to help others fixing
particular problems (Raasch and von Hippel, 2013). Hence, their innovation behavior
can be self-rewarding and in many cases, does not require (any or broad) adoption by
other people to be deemed successful (von Hippel, 2017). These different motives are
not exclusive, however. As we will report later, some citizens innovate with commercial
purposes in mind.

11.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Informal innovations may look amateurish, but are sometimes very novel
To objective standards, the innovations that citizens develop in their leisure time are
not as professional as business innovations. They typically look amateurish. Citizens
develop rough prototypes that are good enough to solve a personal problem, to
practice with learning new skills, to enjoy the art of tinkering, or to fix a challenge for a
family member. In this context, there is no need for a perfectly designed product.
Examples are cases A and B in Box 2.

C. Sisanda App universe

Notes: examples of informal innovations encountered in 26 interviews with South African citizens.

In contrast, business innovations should be reliable, safe to use, properly designed and
operated smoothly – or no one would buy them. Business innovations demand more
design and engineering: the overall development effort exceeds that of informal
innovations. Businesses have advanced design and engineering skills and are more
capable of developing innovations that meet professional standards (Riggs & von
Hippel, 1994).

What makes informal innovations worthwhile is that citizens sometimes introduce novel
functions that people could not do before (functional novelty, see case A in Box 2), or
they enable performing a function at significantly lower cost (case B). Also, informal
innovations sometimes contribute directly to UNDP’s sustainable development goals
(SDGs). For example, case C in Box 2 is an app developed by a citizen collective to deal
with the shortage of teaching materials in many South African classrooms. The app
employs virtual reality (VR) to demonstrate scientific and biological principles to
students who lack access to physical models. Novel functions are the reason that
informal innovations are often found at the edge of completely new product types and
mark the birth of new industries (Shah & Tripsas, 2007). Informal innovations leverage
citizens’ perfect understanding of their personal needs (Riggs & von Hippel, 1994).

Informal innovation complements business innovation
Von Hippel (2017) explains that informal household innovation and business innovation
complement each other (Figure 1). Informal innovations in the household sector are in
principle freely available to anyone, as citizens barely protect their innovations.
Commercial producers can take advantage by adopting informal innovations (to be
marketed as commercial products) and by helping citizens to prototype innovations for
themselves.

2.2. Informal innovation in South Africa

Informal innovation is common in basically any country
Applying the same survey procedure as we did in South Africa, researchers have
observed that innovation in the household sector is an everyday phenomenon. At first
glance the percentages reported in Table 2 seem modest, but each percentage
represents hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of citizens innovating in their
leisure time.

Notes: benchmark data are reported in de Jong & von Hippel (2022). Reported frequencies represent

In South Africa we find around one million informal innovators
Based on our representative sample of 1,096 citizens in South Africa (see appendix A for
details), we estimate that 2.5% of the citizens aged 18+ developed an informal
innovation in the past three years. Compared to the high income countries that have

14.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

been surveyed before, this percentage may be relatively low, but it is still within the
common range. The explanation is that South Africa has a less educated, and less
prosperous workforce. Education and income usually increase the frequency of
informal innovation, because these are enablers of citizens’ engagement in do-it-
yourself activities for self-expression and in making creative use of their time
(Mulhuijzen & de Jong, 2023). It is noteworthy that South Africa has a higher percentage
compared to high-income countries like China and South Korea.

Nevertheless, 2.5% implies that one million citizens in South Africa are innovators. We
feel that this is a substantial number. It has never been visible before this survey,
because innovation in the household sector is not recorded in official surveys in any
form. We can safely conclude that informal innovation is widespread in South Africa.

Informal innovation is embedded in home production and do-it-yourself
behavior
Innovation by citizens is embedded in a broad range of creative behaviors: related to
do-it-yourself (DIY), tinkering and the generation of online content (de Jong et al., 2021;
Mulhuijzen & de Jong, 2023). In the past two decades, citizens in developed countries
became increasingly empowered to do things themselves, based on the emergence of
the Internet where instructions and tools are shared (e.g., YouTube videos explaining
how things are built, CAD files on Thingiverse ready to be printed), and facilities such as
Fab Labs (Fox, 2014). It is in this context that informal innovations are embedded (Table
3).

We found that around 30% of South Africans modify or improve existing products –
think of activities like home refurbishing and building adds-on to a car. This is generally
known as ‘home production’ (Mulhuijzen & de Jong, 2023). Next, over 13% engaged in
the self-creation of existing products, like building a chair from an online model –
generally known as do-it-yourself behavior. Finally, 2.5% created an application with a
novel function or that was a significant cost-saver; these we consider informal
innovators.

2.3. A closer look at informal innovations

15.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Many innovations are for children and education purposes
As in other countries, informal innovations relate to a range of objects (Table 4). In
South Africa, we observe that many innovations are meant for children (e.g., toys,
games) and in particular, are related to their education. We suspect this is due to the
demographic composition of the country, with many younger citizens. Also, many
parents are eager to have their offspring become as educated as possible, to be able to
cope with (future) economic circumstances. Regardless of whether parents can afford
private schooling, they seem eager to innovate in teaching materials and methods to
support their children.

Notes: percentages based on 210 South African informal innovation cases.

100%

Innovations can also be service-related
Not all innovations are products or physical objects. Citizens collectively set up systems
to avoid the cost of a commercial service, e.g., rotating childcare by working mothers in
a neighborhood. Another example is innovative stokvels: societies to which members
regularly contribute an agreed amount of money for some pre-defined purpose. In our
interviews, we detected examples where citizens collectively saved on groceries by
buying in bulk, or enabled future investments to set up businesses (Box 3)1. Such
innovations were especially found in low-income areas like townships.

Box 3. Behavioral innovations: related to collective saving schemes

been able to develop suitable survey instruments for citizens’ self-services.

17.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Innovators are more often educated, prosperous, young, and business owners
From surveys in other countries, we know that informal innovators have particular
demographic characteristics. For example, in an absolute sense innovators are
generally better educated and have higher incomes (Chen et al., 2020; Mulhuijzen & de
Jong, 2023). Higher levels of education indicate better skills (e.g., design, engineering,
tinkering), while income proxies' access to innovation resources (e.g., tools, materials)
and eagerness for self-expression and personal development – to which innovation is
instrumental. In South Africa, we find that these differences are confirmed (Figure 2).
Given the role of education and income, it is also no surprise that in affluent regions,
the percentage of innovators exceeds the frequency of innovation observed in
townships (3.0% vs 1.6%).

Also, younger citizens (18 to 24 years) are more likely to be innovators (5.8% vs 2.5% on
average), probably reflecting high eagerness to learn and to develop opportunities in
this age category, while buying power is low (increasing the need to build products for
themselves). We also assume that many younger citizens are still students, able to tap
into their school’s tools and infrastructure to develop innovations.

Next, business ownership is related to informal innovation emergence. Especially
informal business owners (those making money with an unregistered business) are
much more likely to have developed a household innovation in the past three years.
Likewise, nascent business owners (those who are starting a business) are more likely
innovators. As we will see later, some innovators start or use informal businesses to
generate income. The reverse is also true: being a business owner indicates proactivity
and taking charge, so business owners are more likely to innovate.

Finally, gender is barely related to informal innovation. Where in high income countries
males were found to be more likely innovators (von Hippel et al., 2011), in more recent
studies the gender difference was not significant. This also applies to South Africa: 2.3%
of all females are estimated to be innovators, while 2.8% of males are innovators. In our
survey this distinction was not significant; females were as likely to innovate in their
leisure time.

Informal innovations are often developed with others
In all countries surveyed to date, the great majority of informal innovators develop their
projects on their own, without the help of others. Perhaps surprisingly, in South Africa
the frequency of collaboration exceeds other countries: around one out of three
innovations is developed with the help of others (Table 5).

Depending on the context, the nature of innovation collaboration differs. In townships,
collaborators are local members of the community, e.g., neighbors, family members
and friends. We learned from our interviews that collaboration at the township level
mostly arises due to lack of access to necessary tools or know-how to make their
creations.

In affluent areas, collaboration is more often with strangers sharing a common interest.
We observed that affluent innovators collaborate through Facebook groups, or online
knowledge-sharing platforms like Thingiverse. Collaboration is not restricted to solving
problems at hand, but also for the joint hedonic experience of exchanging thoughts
with like-minded others.

In affluent areas, innovation tools are more advanced
The tools used by innovators in affluent and township areas are different and illustrate
the difference in spaces of innovation. In affluent areas, where innovators are highly
educated and prosperous, advanced technologies like 3D printing and CAD software
are used. Innovators also consult online sources like global knowledge-sharing
platforms like Thingiverse. In townships, it is more often basic tools like welding and
sewing kits, or even household appliances like scissors and pliers. If there is any online
sourcing for solution ideas, township innovators limit themselves to YouTube videos, or
just ask around in their direct environment. For examples, see Box 4.

2.4. Typology of informal innovators

Innovators can be users, participators, helpers, or vendors
As mentioned in section 2.1, informal innovators can be driven by personal need,
hedonic reasons (enjoyment, learning), and a desire to help others. Beyond this, there
are also innovators with commercial intentions. In other higher income countries,
research indicates that commercially oriented innovators are rare: in Finland for
example it was only 9% (von Hippel, 2017).
Based on cluster analysis, four types of informal innovators can be distinguished in
South Africa, though usually a mix of motives applies: users (around 20% of all informal
innovators), participators (35%), helpers (32%) and vendors (13%). See Table 6.

User innovators are driven by necessity
Users innovate to solve a problem that they face. Users are mostly concerned with
innovations in household items, sports, hobby and entertainment products, and help,
care and medical applications. Examples are shown in Box 5. In interviews in townships
we encountered a female innovator who developed a cooking bag to preserve heat and
save on her energy bill. It was also tailored to carry food across distances. Another
example is a device to quickly remove feathers from a chicken – a time-saver. The
device was manually operated and much cheaper compared to similar electronic
devices.

Notes: examples of informal innovations encountered in 26 interviews with South African citizens.

Participators enjoy the process of innovation and/or learn new skills
This type of innovator enjoys the benefits that come from developing innovations as
such; they just consider innovation a good use of their time, or are eager to have some
practice in order to develop their skills (e.g., furniture construction, Computer Aided
Design (CAD) skills). Participators most often innovate on household items, and
children/education-related products. While there is no strict requirement for them to
personally use the innovation that they are developing, 63% of the participator
innovators end up applying their creation in their personal life. Examples are in Box 6.
In our interviews in affluent areas, one innovator created a device that enabled him to
separate coffee grounds from their container, as he thought it was nice to reduce
pollution. Another created an impressive device to record and process avian patterns –
primarily a hobby and to learn.

23.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Helpers are obviously concerned with others
These innovators volunteer to solve challenges for people in their environment. Table 6
shows that many helpers also enjoy the innovation process, or developing new skills.
Not surprisingly, helpers are dominantly concerned with things related to children and
education. Sometimes they contribute to their community or address a societal
problem. For example, we interviewed a father who volunteered for a project at his
community’s school. He designed a CO2-powered launcher for toy cars, to teach
students about engineering. Another example was the app Safe Home for Everyone. It
was developed by two female students to share knowledge and tools with women and
girls facing gender-based violence (Box 7).

Notes: examples of informal innovations encountered in 26 interviews with South African citizens.

Vendors are commercially oriented, in parallel with other motives
The final type of innovator includes those who seek to generate income with their
innovation. Vendors often innovate transport- and vehicle-related products, and – again
– children- and education-related applications. Yet, their range of innovation objects is
broad. In our township interviews, we encountered residents who developed a stoop
and floor polish from leftover candle wax, enabling easy cleaning in dusty areas.
Another example is a woman developing cross-shoulder bags, initially meant for small-
scale traders in her environment who could use a light bag to carry their money (Box 8).

Commercial motivation is almost never the sole reason to innovate. Most vendors have
other motives in parallel (Table 6). In the case of the stoop polish, the initial motivation
was personal use, but the innovators soon learned that other people in their
community wanted their polish too, so they started producing and selling it.

Notes: examples of informal innovations encountered in 26 interviews with South African citizens.

South Africa has many helpers and vendors
Compared to other countries, the fraction of helpers and vendors is high. For example,
in Finland 11% of the innovators were helpers, and 9% were vendors (von Hippel, 2017)
while in South Africa it is 32% and 13% (Table 6). In contrast, the fraction of users (20%)
and participators (35%) is less than elsewhere (e.g., in Finland it was 37% and 43%).

We can conclude that in South Africa, informal innovators are more concerned with
other people, either to help directly, or indirectly by selling their innovations as
products. Likely, this is an implication of a stronger community culture (ubuntu),
demographic composition (younger population, eager to impact others), and lack of
economic opportunities in the business sector.

Township residents are more often vendors, compared to all South Africans
Looking at demographic variables, we found two characteristics that matter for the
frequency of the four innovator types (Figure 3). In township areas we find a higher
fraction of innovators with commercial intentions, seeking opportunities to generate
(extra) income: 24% vs 13% for all South Africans. Township citizens are more directly
concerned with solutions to problems they experience, or opportunities to make a
living and generate extra income. Innovation linked to income opportunities can
provide fundamental solutions to many challenges facing the poor, including creation
of entrepreneurial avenues, employment and upliftment of standards of living.
Amongst township residents, the fraction of participators is less (24%, vs 35% for all
South Africans). This is reasonable given their difficult economic circumstances.

25.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Figure 3. Distribution of innovative types across living areas and business ownership

Notes: percentages based on 210 informal innovators in South Africa

Another difference we observed is that business owners are more often of the vendor
type. For formal and informal business owners the percentage of vendors is 19% and
21%, respectively. This is explainable, as it makes sense that entrepreneurs have more
commercialization experience and focus. In our interviews we observed that business
owners develop innovations that are unrelated to their existing business, but still, they
may use their business as a vehicle to sell their emergent innovations. Amongst nascent
entrepreneurs with informal innovations the vendor type is even more present: 29%.
Here, we learned from our interviews that some informal innovators are in the process
of starting new businesses to reap benefits from their innovation.

2.5. Dissemination to the benefit of others

Informal innovation has only limited impact if innovations do not become available to
others. Without dissemination, every citizen facing the same problem has to undertake
similar upfront efforts – a poor use of resources from a societal welfare perspective
(von Hippel, 2005; 2017).
In other higher income countries it was repeatedly observed that diffusion of informal
innovation ‘fails’ (de Jong et al., 2015). This is because innovators generally lack
incentives to disseminate what they have done, especially when they are motivated by
personal need or hedonic reasons (while in contrast for helpers and vendors, diffusion
prospects are clearly better).

26.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Shielding off innovations is rare in South Africa
Most informal innovators worldwide have no commercial interests, and as such, no
reason to shield their innovations from other people. In South Africa, we found a similar
pattern, as only one of the 26 people we interviewed had tried to protect his innovation
with a patent. Even when innovators had commercial intentions, they did not engage in
any modalities of knowledge appropriation (e.g., patent, copyright, trademark). In
townships, lack of protection can be partly attributed to cultural proximity and shared
cultural values, which the literature has suggested plays a part in shaping knowledge-
sharing practices (Belete, 2018; Sheikh, 2014). For example, South Africans have cultural
beliefs of ‘ubuntu’ where any idea or item of value is shared with family and members
of a community. We also observed a lack of knowledge on how to protect innovations,
and general beliefs that the created items were not so valuable that protection would
be merited, or simply impossible to protect. In the absence of intellectual property
rights, informal innovations are potentially available for anyone to adopt (von Hippel,
2017).

South African innovations disseminate relatively well
Lack of patent protection does NOT imply that innovations become broadly available.
Dissemination requires an additional effort from the innovator. Researchers have
identified three pathways to disseminate informal innovations (Figure 4).

Figure 4. Dissemination routes of informal innovations

Notes: Kuusisto et al. (2013).

Innovations may disseminate:

▪ Directly to peers: the innovation is revealed to people to copy and use, without

charge.

▪ Commercialize yourself: an innovator may start a new business to commercialize

the product.

▪ Outsource commercialization: a producer adopts the innovation to sell as a

product.

In South Africa, the dissemination of informal innovations is relatively good. In previous
comparable surveys in higher income countries, the share of freely revealed

innovations was usually around 20% (slightly higher in China, with a culture revolving
around strong family ties), while commercial diffusion by existing producers or in
startups was rare. In South Africa, however, 46% of the informal innovations were
reported to be adopted freely by peers (family, friends, neighbors, community
members), while 11% and 12% were disseminated to producers or in startups,
respectively. See Figure 5.

Figure 5. Dissemination of informal innovations, across five countries

Notes: Benchmark data are from de Jong & von Hippel (2022).

Given the differences in the types of innovators we reported previously, the numbers in
Figure 5 are no surprise. South Africa has a larger fraction of helpers, to whom freely
revealing innovations to peers is implicit. The country also has more innovators of the
vendor type willing to generate income, a key route to diffusion.

Helpers and vendors reach broader diffusion, users and participators do not
Given their primary motivation, the four types of innovators differ in their efforts to
disseminate their innovations. Helpers and vendors try hard. To accomplish
dissemination, they also develop their innovations further so that people can adopt
more easily (while users and participators are concerned with solving problems for
themselves, and a rough prototype is enough). This is reflected in the share of
innovations that disseminate: see Table 7.

As Table 7 shows, helpers are inclined to freely reveal their innovations so that their
innovations disseminate directly to peers. In contrast, vendors pursue commercial
pathways more often. Interestingly, helpers’ innovations most often spread to a few
others (e.g., 70% are adopted by at least one person), while vendors reach broader
dissemination (i.e., the highest percentages of innovations that spread to more than
five, or fifty people).
For users and participators, the dissemination rates are less favorable or even poor.
This reflects users’ and participators’ lack of incentives to try. If adoption occurs, it is
usually because other people accidentally observed the creation being used, and
started asking for copies themselves. In the interview examples we already provided,
this is what happened with the chicken plucker and cooking bag (Box 5), as well as the
pod drainer (Box 6).

Dissemination does not differ much across demographic variables
Looking at the dissemination rates of innovations developed by demographic groups,
differences are not significant (Table 8). Male, young and elder citizens reach better
diffusion, but the differences are small.

Interestingly, the kind of innovation object makes a bigger difference for dissemination.
The differences between various innovation objects reflect the kind of innovations that
are developed by users, participators, helpers and vendors, respectively. Household
items diffuse poorly; these are mainly developed by users and participators. In contrast,
transport- and vehicle-related innovations disseminate well across all channels; these
are more often developed by helpers and vendors. As for children- and education-
related innovations, these spread relatively well to peers, but not via commercial
pathways.

A better job can be done at dissemination
While many South African informal innovations do spread, dissemination to improve
general welfare can be improved. Users and participators lack diffusion incentives, and
this calls for specific policy interventions (to be discussed in chapter 4). Likewise,
vendors face specific challenges when trying to generate income in an informal
business. If innovations diffuse, it is mostly within a local community. These challenges
are elaborated upon in the upcoming chapters.

3. Informal business

3.1. Common insights about informality and business

ownership

The informal sector is widespread, and important
The informal sector, also known as off-the-books, undeclared, shadow, cash-in-hand, or
hidden sector, can be defined as the paid production and sale of products and services
that are legitimate in all respects, besides the fact that they are unregistered, and in
principle, invisible to public institutions (Williams & Nadin, 2010).

In high-income countries, the informal sector is relatively small. It is usually associated
with business owners’ tendencies to not play by the rulebook and with semi-illegal
activities like having workers that are partially paid under the table. In lower income
countries, however, the informal sector is often larger and generally accepted. For a
long time, it was believed that the presence of an informal sector is a symptom of a
‘backward’ economy, that is supposed to vanish with economic growth. A more recent
insight is that the informal sector is enduring, expanding, and an important condition
to feed economic growth and development (Charmes, 2009). As we mentioned in our
introduction, in sub-Saharan Africa, the informal sector represents around 74.5% of all
non-agricultural employment and is a large reservoir of ‘hidden’ innovation (Kraemer-
Mbula & Wunsch-Vincent, 2016).

Businesses may have good reasons to be informal
From a European or North American perspective, the existence of informal businesses
is perhaps surprising: any serious business would register itself in the trade register,
open a bank account, apply for a tax number, and maintain its financial records. If not,
potential customers, suppliers and employees are likely to distrust the business, and
avoid it. For this reason, the informal sector in high income economies is mainly
restricted to small-scale transaction-based services like home cleaning, gardening,
installation services, car mechanics, and personal care.

In lower income countries, however, informality is very common. Law enforcement is
weaker and does not provide customers, suppliers and workers the same advantages
as in developed countries. Also, the registration of a business can be burdensome
(Williams et al., 2017). Another reason that informal businesses exist, is that many
entrepreneurs apply risk-reduction strategies by combining employment with their
emerging business first, and only later resign from their jobs to engage in full-fledged
and formalized entrepreneurship (Williams & Nadin, 2010). In fact, in low-income
countries, informal businesses that survive their initial period perform better than
businesses that immediately comply with registration requirements (Williams et al.,
2017).

32.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Businesses vary in their degree of (in)formality
In line with Williams & Nadin (2010) we here define an informal business as one that
participates in the paid production and sale of legitimate products or services that are
unregistered and not visible to public authorities. In layman’s terms, informal
businesses are concerned with producing and selling regular products and services, but
exclude criminal activities like theft, drugs and violence. Informal businesses are the
kind of ventures that emerge from the household sector. Examples are street vendors
and piece workers who (informally) employ others, but also home-based entrepreneurs
using their private living areas to produce and sell goods and services
(Mamayunusovna, 2017).

3.2. Informal business ownership in South Africa

Businesses can differ in their degree of formality; ranging from completely informal, to
partially formal (‘in-between’), to completely formal (Williams et al., 2016). In this
survey, the degree of formality of a business was measured with four indicators:
Is officially registered. An unregistered business is one not registered in the
official trade register. This implies that the business is not visible to authorities
as a legal entity.

▪

▪ Has a bank account. When the business has its own bank account, it becomes

more visible and legitimate in the eyes of outsiders. It leaves a footprint and can
be traced – by authorities for example.

▪ Pays annual taxes. Paying taxes means that the business has a tax number and is
visible to the corresponding authorities. Also, the business has sufficient volume
to be regarded as a business, and not as a hobby project or nascent enterprise.

▪ Keeps financial records. The fourth indicator is whether the business keeps its

financial records. Lack of complete formal accounts prevents the business from
being separated from the other activities of its owners (Williams et al., 2016).

Based on these indicators, we distinguished three types of businesses in our survey:
completely informal, in-between (has some but not all of the four indicators), and
formal. This distinction reflects that some informal businesses remain permanently
invisible, while others are in transition towards formality – in lower income countries,
formalization is not a one-off event, but rather a journey or transition (Williams &
Nadin, 2010). On top of this, to be regarded as a business we required that respondents
generated a monthly income with their business, regardless of its size. Claimed
businesses without income were excluded.

We find 2.5 million informal businesses, and another 2.4 million that are ‘in-
between’
As expected, informal businesses are a very common phenomenon in South Africa
(Table 9). Based on our survey data we estimate that there are 2.5 million informal
businesses in the country, and 2.4 million are in-between or partially formalized. The
frequency of informal and partially formalized businesses is actually higher than the
frequency of formalized business.

In Box 9 we provide examples of the three types of businesses that we encountered in
our interviews. The first example is an informal entrepreneur selling cow head meat,
pap and snacks by the roadside. Cow head meat is a delicacy and is especially valued by
most cultural groups in Southern Africa. The business is not formalized in any way, as
the entrepreneur sees no added value from doing so.

The second case is an ‘in-between’ business that started informally. The entrepreneur
provides tire repair and replacement services to township residents, with mini-bus taxi
drivers as his main target audience. This business is partially formalized to meet
requirements of some customers (formal businesses themselves) that prefer the
services of an organization that is registered.

The third example is a completely formalized business, that we encountered interviewing
a business owner about his informal innovation (the bird feeder in Box 2). This business
is a podcast studio in Johannesburg which serves a range of clientele. This type of
business resembles the kind of businesses encountered in higher income countries.

35.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Informal businesses are easily overlooked – also in the statistics
The existence of informal businesses implies that some populations, that are seen as
lacking in entrepreneurial spirit, are more entrepreneurial than official statistics
suggest (Williams & Nadin, 2010). Obviously, when businesses are unregistered and not
visible to public authorities, it is hard to obtain estimates of their numbers. Informal
businesses are at best partially recorded in official statistics. One example is the Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), the internationally leading source of
entrepreneurship statistics based on annual surveys conducted in dozens of countries.

To illustrate, if we compare our estimates of informal business ownership (Table 9) with
the most recently available GEM report for South Africa (Bowmaker-Falconer &
Harrington, 2020), we find quite different percentages. In 2019, GEM South Africa
reported that 3.7% of the adult population are new business owners (in business for
less than 3.5 years), while 3.5% are established business owners. This sums up to 7.2%
business ownership and is very different from the 17.4% we recorded in our survey.
Acknowledging that both surveys rely on different questions and criteria, this
comparison is only a ballpark estimate. Nevertheless, the frequency of business
ownership seems easily twice the frequency that can be inferred from GEM data.

3.3. A closer look at the types of business ownership

In Table 10 a comparison is made on some key indicators that reflect the diverse nature
of informal, in-between and formal businesses.

Formality increases with size of operations
Informal businesses are typically small. Only 11% of the informal business owners have
employees. Almost all of these employees work without official contracts, or
alternatively, they are family members that joined the business. Informal businesses
generate on average R8,500 per month (USD $455) – to South African standards, a
modest income. Many informal businesses are supplemented with other activities, like
piece jobs, a part-time job elsewhere, or household activities.

In-between businesses are partially formalized – in other words, they fulfill some but
not all of the four criteria (being officially registered, having a bank account, paying
annual taxes, and keeping financial records). We observed in our interviews that
formalization is mainly considered when it becomes ‘advantageous’. Sometimes a
larger customer base can be served when the business is registered, or formalization
enables doing business with the government. The business may also grow to a size
where employees have to be recruited through official contracts, or where suppliers
prefer and can only deliver if there is some standardization. Thirty-seven percent of the
‘in-between’ businesses have employees. Where in high income countries businesses
are formalized at start-up, in South Africa (and probably other low-income countries)
formalization revolves around the growth of the business.

Formal businesses are registered, pay annual taxes, have a bank account and keep their
financial records. These businesses most closely resemble businesses observed in
developed countries. Two out of three have employees; and they employ on average
over 10 staff, mostly with formal contracts. Formal businesses generate a lot more
income for their owners (average R54,200 (USD $2,813) per month, as compared to the
R8,500 (USD $441) generated by informal businesses).

Informal businesses are in consumer markets, serving other businesses comes
with formality
From Table 10 we can also see that informal businesses operate in different markets.
They are mostly active in consumer markets, who can be members of the same
community, or individuals in general. It is rare for informal business to serve other
businesses and/or non-profit organizations. When the degree of formality increases,
businesses are increasingly likely to (also) serve other formal businesses and public
authorities. It could be assumed that entering or serving business-to-business markets
triggers business owners to formalize in order to become legitimate trading partners.

All businesses face barriers, red tape is perceived more by formal businesses
Table 10 also shows that regardless of formalization, South African business owners
perceive growth barriers related to finance, access to customers, resources (e.g.,
electricity, raw materials), infrastructure (e.g., land, vending places) and capital
(machinery, equipment). This is partially due to the peculiarities of the South African
economy. Loadshedding (i.e. scheduled power outages) due to electricity shortages, for
example, is a common problem in the country. Likewise South Africa is geographically

37.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

distant from several higher income countries, which implies that importing advanced
machinery and materials is relatively expensive and burdensome.

When it comes to growth barriers related to public institutions (red tape in taxes,
permits, licenses, and corruption, etc.), then formal businesses experience more
problems, while informal businesses obviously work around many of these by not being
registered. Hence, formalization also comes with the downside of red tape, so informal
businesses must have strong reasons to consider formalization.

Nonetheless, informal business owners are not free from barriers that prevent them
from growth. Previously reported challenges of informal businesses include: limited
access to markets, skills and financial resources, isolation from the broader innovation
system, and limited access to government support (Kraemer-Mbula & Monaco, 2020).
Our survey reveals that some of the usual suspect barriers (customer access, financial
resources, infrastructure) are the most salient.

Informal businesses are more present in low-income groups
The frequency of business ownership varies with citizen’s demographic characteristics,
and likewise for the distribution across informal, in-between and formal businesses. See
Figure 6.

In line with previous studies, we find that informal businesses are relatively important
in under resourced areas and populations (Williams & Nadin, 2010; Williams et al.,
2016). Women were found to start up their enterprises informally and continue to do so
(Williams et al., 2016). Indeed, in our survey females are more likely to be informal
business owners (7.2% vs 5.2% for males) and less likely in formal business (3.7% vs
7.2%).

People with low or average education (i.e., no university degree) are less often business
owners, but if they are, they are inclined to run an informal or in-between business.
Those with a university degree are predominantly running formalized businesses – this
probably reflects the different kind of (B2B) markets in which they are active.

Obviously, income is related to frequency and distribution too. Figure 6 replicates
earlier findings that completely informal businesses are clustered in low-income
populations, while high-income populations tend to have formal businesses (Williams,
2009).

Township residents rarely run formal businesses
In township areas formal business ownership is nearly absent (0.8%, see Figure 6).
Nearly all township businesses are informal or in-between. If we only considered
formalized businesses, townships would barely have entrepreneurs, compared to the
general population. Yet, in line with Williams & Nadin (2010), we find that townships are
more enterprising than generally recognized, and that legitimizing informal
entrepreneurship could be an important means of promoting enterprise and economic
development.

39.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Informal innovators are much more likely informal or in-between business
owners
Last but not least, we find a very strong association between informal innovation and
informal business ownership. In the general population, 6.2% and 5.9% are informal
and in-between business owners. Amongst citizens who have developed informal
innovations, the frequency of informal and in-between entrepreneurship is twice as
high: 14.7% and 11.8%, respectively. The next section explains in detail how innovation
and business ownership connect.

3.4. Relationship between informal innovation and business

ownership

Two sides of a coin: informal innovation and business ownership are mutually
related
In South Africa, informal innovation and business ownership are strongly related. Recall
that in chapter 2, the conclusion is that business owners develop informal innovations
more than average. Vice versa, in the previous section we found that informal
innovators are more likely to run fully or partially informal businesses.
The relationship between informal innovation and business ownership works in both
directions. From our interviews, we can make two important observations:
▪ First, informal innovation leads to the creation of new businesses.
▪ Second, existing business owners are more likely to innovate, from which other

people benefit.

Observation 1: Informal innovation leads to (informal) new business
development
We observed that in South Africa, when citizens engaged in informal innovation, they
were more inclined to start informal businesses compared to non-innovators. This
especially applied to innovators in difficult circumstances, that is, township
interviewees.

These businesses start out as informal. Innovators first explore their environment and
whether there is a commercial interest, then start producing and selling on a small
scale from their own premises. With growing demand, the business expands: it finds
new suppliers, hires uncontracted workers, and involves family members. In the
examples we presented previously, this pattern applied to the cross-shoulder bags and
floor polish (Box 8). Likewise, the creator of the chicken feather remover (Box 1) built a
few copies of his device for people in his environment, charging a small fee.

Only later, when demand grows even further, is the business formalized – as the
business requires more organization and expands its customer base to other areas. In
this context, informality acts as a seedbed for the lower-risk experimentation and start-
up entrepreneurship (Williams, 2009b; Kraemer-Mbula and Wunsch, 2016).

40.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Innovations are sometimes process-related, enabling growth
As a side note, it is observed that informal innovations sometimes also help informal
businesses to grow. Business owners then use their leisure time to develop process
innovations that they apply in their business (examples in Box 9). One interview, with
the owner of a food and cooking stand, was of interest because he had created a stove
that was able to process large volumes of cow head meat, burn a range of materials
including leftover wood and plastic, and was easy to carry. Likewise, in talking to the
owner of a tire changing business, it was revealed he had developed an innovative tool
to quickly remove tires from wheels by using manual force – existing devices were
electrical, costly and not reliable given problems with public electricity supply. These
innovations help the entrepreneurs to grow their businesses, and potentially take a
step closer to formalization.

The link between informal innovation and new business emergence that was observed
in South Africa is not new. Stebbins (2004) recognized that informal businesses are
sometimes spin-offs from the informal entrepreneurs’ employment, but alternatively,
emerge from ‘serious leisure’ by which he meant the pursuit of an amateur, hobby or
volunteer activity that participants find so substantial and interesting that they launch a
business. Likewise, Shah and Tripsas (2007) coined the term ‘user entrepreneurship’ for
individuals who innovated to solve a personal problem, but on second thought started
a business to commercialize their solution after receiving signals from their
environment about its market potential (e.g., community members asking for a copy).

Commercialization is hampered by down-to-earth challenges
Most business owners, when asked about their informal innovations, said they faced
down-to-earth challenges, like lack of access to finance, vending spaces, basic supplies
like electricity and costs required for importing materials or equipment. Also, the red
tape that is expected when a business grows was mentioned. No one complained about
access to scientific knowledge, challenges to collaborating on Research and
Development (R&D) and access to highly educated workers, which are the usual
innovation challenges mentioned in high income countries.

Observation 2: Existing (formal) business owners develop innovations for
general benefit
Another observation is that compared to informal businesses, formal business owners
are more likely to develop innovations that are unrelated to their business.

Our impression from the interviews was that successful formal business owners have
particular personalities and competencies. These make them not only likely innovators,
but also enable them to do a better job at dissemination by freely sharing their
innovations. Formal business owners did not innovate for the sake of their business,
but rather, they spent their leisure time voluntarily creating things for themselves and
others:

▪ Some were eager to stay up to date with recent developments and enjoyed

learning new skills such as CAD design and 3D printing (participator type). They

41.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

preferred to work on hobby projects that were also potentially useful to other
people.

▪ Other business owners faced a personal problem/challenge (user type), or they

volunteered to help people in their environment (helper type). They were
running engineering, IT or design businesses, and they could easily apply their
technical business skills to solve the problem/challenge.

Looking at the examples provided earlier on, the bird feeder (Box 2) was developed by
the owner of a podcast studio who wanted to experiment and practice to learn new
skills. The custom skeletal keyboard (Box 4) was created by an entrepreneur who
needed the device for himself. He already possessed most of the required skills from
his software business. The dragster launcher and platform Safe Home for Everyone
(Box 7) were developed by owners of industrial design and software businesses,
respectively. They voluntarily offered their skills to other people.

Our observation of formal business owners’ inclination to innovate, even when it is
unrelated to their commercial interests, is in line with academic findings that business
owners have a high need for achievement, self-efficacy, innovativeness, stress
tolerance, need for autonomy, and a proactive personality (Rauch et al., 2007).

Business experience is helpful for dissemination
Interestingly, formal business owners did a much better job at disseminating their
informal innovations to others, as did user or participator types. Their business
experience gave them a good sense of how to design and document their creations to
make adoption by other people easy. They also found it honorable if other people
worked with their innovations, giving them a sense of achievement. For example, the
bird feeder and skeletal keyboard were freely revealed on Thingiverse – an online
platform for 3D printed innovations – and downloaded many times. Innovating
business owners had professional experience in catering to the needs of other people,
and were more willing to put effort into free revealing, with better dissemination rates
as a result.

Relationship between business formalization and informal innovation is an
inverted U
Figure 7 summarizes our insights about the relationship between the degree of
business formalization and the frequency of informal innovation. The highest frequency
for informal innovation is observed for informal business owners. As mentioned, their
informal business is sometimes inspired by their innovation, and they are relatively
often of the vendor type. Alternatively, their informal innovation is instrumental for the
continued development of their business. These businesses are often found in low-
income groups, such as in townships.

42.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Figure 7. Relationship between types of business ownership and frequency of informal innovation

For formal business owners, the frequency of innovation is less but still higher than for
non-entrepreneurs, and their innovations are usually unrelated to their business. In a
sense, they resemble informal innovators who are not entrepreneurial, but their
business experience makes them more likely to succeed at solving problems with
innovation, and to accomplish better dissemination. Their businesses are more often
located in affluent areas.

4. Ecosystem and policy

4.1 Priorities for policymaking

Policies should address dissemination incentives and commercialization barriers
From the previous chapters, we called attention to two reasons for policy intervention
in innovation dissemination:

1. Lack of incentives. In total, 55% of the informal innovators in South Africa are of
the user or participator type: they are driven by personal need (to use their
innovation themselves) or hedonic motives (enjoyment, learning). These
innovators lack strong incentives to disseminate their innovations. If diffusion
occurs, it is usually only to people in their immediate environment. This
‘diffusion failure’ implies that other people cannot take advantage of the new
functionalities or cost-saving potential embodied in their innovations. The lack of
incentives justifies policies to facilitate the continued development of informal
innovations and to lower the threshold to freely share innovations.

2. Commercialization barriers. The other 45% of the informal innovators are of the

helper or vendor type; they assist other people in solving their problems or seek
to generate income by commercializing their innovations. Instead of lacking
diffusion, basic startup challenges (e.g., infrastructure, microfinance) hamper
broad commercialization. Commercialization barriers justify policies to improve
basic conditions for early-stage entrepreneurship.

4.2. Ecosystems approach
To develop an integral view of what policies for innovation and entrepreneurship look
like, we use the concept of an ecosystems framework, which have become increasingly
popular in the past decade. We first give a quick overview of the ecosystems literature,
then discuss the ecosystem tailored to informal innovation and business development.

Ecosystems provide an integral framework for innovation policymaking
The ecosystems literature recognizes that innovation and entrepreneurship are the
outcomes of a complex interplay between various factors with mutual relationships. In
the business sector, two dominant ecosystem frameworks are:

1. the national innovation system, defined as all important economic, social, political,
organizational, institutional and other factors, that influence the development,
diffusion and use of innovations (Edquist & Hommen, 1999), and

2. the entrepreneurial ecosystem, defined as a loosely connected complex system of

actors and factors that are governed in such a way to enable productive
entrepreneurship within a particular territory (Stam, 2015).

The ecosystems literature explains the emergence of innovations and/or
entrepreneurship as the outcome of factors like knowledge creation, human capital,
finance, demand factors, infrastructure and markets, access to business resources,
consulting services, leadership, institutions and networks. In practice, a range of
ecosystems frameworks have been proposed that are tailored to specific purposes such

44.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

as innovation and productive entrepreneurship (e.g., Stam & Van de Ven, 2021; Edquist
& Hommen, 1999; Lundvall, 1992). We summarized their insights in Figure 8.

Figure 8. Typical ecosystem for innovation and entrepreneurship in the business sector

Notes: this figure combines common factors in the literature on innovation systems (e.g., Edquist &
Hommen, 1999) and entrepreneurial ecosystems (e.g., Stam & Van de Ven, 2021).

In a nutshell, innovations and entrepreneurship emerge from a system including
facilitators like:

▪ Knowledge creation: The availability of new knowledge, generated by R&D

activities of firms and public institutions.

▪ Education and skill development: The presence of human capital and, more

broadly, the skillset and experience of a population – indicated by the level of
education and investments in on-the-job training.

▪ Consulting services: The provision of services relevant for innovation, e.g.,

technology transfer, commercial information and legal advice.

▪ Demand factors: The potential demand for new products in society or the buying
power that consumers and businesses have. This can be influenced positively by
the creation of standards and public procurement procedures.

▪ Finance: The availability of finance for innovation processes and other activities

▪

that can facilitate the commercialization of knowledge and its adoption.
Infrastructure and markets: All aspects of physical infrastructure (e.g., roads,
railways, airports, internet) and product/market infrastructure (e.g., quality
requirements for new products).

▪ Access to resources: The extent to which businesses have access to physical
resources required for innovation and entrepreneurship, e.g., housing and
materials.

▪ Leadership: The presence of actors that provide guidance for and direction to

innovation and growth-oriented entrepreneurship; these actors can be singular
persons but also organizations or private-public innovation partnerships.

Moreover, institutional factors play an indirect role:

▪ Formal institutions: Rules and regulations in a country that influence innovation
and entrepreneurship processes. For example: intellectual property rights laws
and tax laws.

45.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

▪

Informal institutions: The ‘unwritten rules’ of the game in society, like norms
and values. For example: public appreciation of entrepreneurship as a career
choice.

▪ Networks: The social context of the actors in an ecosystem and the information

▪

flows between them.
Interactions between these factors (and their related actors) allow for
specialization and co-creation of value (Adner and Kapoor, 2010). The synergy
between these factors creates more value than would be generated separately
(Holgersson et al., 2022).

Ecosystem frameworks explain the ratio of policy interventions
Ecosystem frameworks provide an integral overview of factors that matter for
innovation or entrepreneurship at the level of an economy. This explains their
popularity amongst policy makers. In practice, we can identify policy interventions for
each ecosystem factor. Examples for the business sector are given in Table 11.

Current ecosystem frameworks do not fit the informal sector
Existing ecosystem frameworks do not match the informal innovations and informal
businesses that we encountered in South Africa, for few reasons. Unlike businesses,
most informal innovators do not need incentives to engage in innovation. For most of
them, the development of innovations is self-rewarding, or justified to solve a personal
need. Instead, as we mentioned, informal innovators often lack incentives to
disseminate (de Jong et al., 2015). Next, when it comes to commercial dissemination,
their major challenges are issues like access to finance and optimal vending spaces.
Informal innovators do not engage in R&D, nor do they work with business incubators
or participate in public procurement procedures. As existing ecosystem frameworks
barely apply, we developed a new ecosystem tailored to the informal sector.

46.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

4.3. Ecosystem for informal innovation and business
development

Institutions and facilitators differ from business ecosystems
Based on extensive literature research and interviews with experts (appendix A, and
documented in more detail in Mulhuijzen & de Jong, 2022), the ecosystem for informal
innovation and business development includes outcomes, facilitators and institutions:
see Figure 9. The overlap with formal business-oriented ecosystems is only partial.

Figure 9. Ecosystem for informal innovation and business development

Notes: based on Mulhuijzen & de Jong (2022).

The set of facilitators and institutions results in informal innovation. In turn, these
innovations can be freely revealed or commercialized in a business. Free revealing can
also be an intermediary step between innovation and commercialization (Shah &
Tripsas, 2007; Kuusisto et al., 2013).

Individual facilitators: directly associated with innovation and dissemination
success
Some facilitators are at the level of individual citizens or their intimate environment:
human capital and innovation tools.

Innovation tools. People need tools, instruments, machines and devices to accomplish
innovation tasks. This includes basic and advanced tools, ranging from toolboxes with
hammers and scissels to CAD software, 3D printers and milling machines. Tools are first
helpful to develop informal innovations as such. Next, they help innovators to develop
more advanced solutions that are easy to disseminate. In the examples we discussed
earlier on, the fuse holder (Box 1), drone stand (Box 2) and pod drainer (Box 6) could
have been developed ‘quick and dirty’ by carving objects out of wood, or by folding
metal parts. However, by using advanced tools like CAD software and 3D printers,
dissemination became easier, as adopters now only require similar tools, not design
skills. Especially in low-income areas (townships), such tools are missing, at the expense
of dissemination.

Human capital. Central to a society’s ability to develop and spread informal innovation
are people’s competences to innovate and to disseminate. This facilitator first includes
education: level of education matters, as does education in a technical (for innovation)
and commercial discipline (for dissemination) (von Hippel et al., 2011). Second, what
matters is people’s skills in tinkering and design (for innovation) and marketing,
communication and organization (for dissemination). In our interviews, we found that
owners of existing, formal businesses were more likely to innovate and also to freely
reveal. This can be perfectly explained from a human capital perspective: those
interviewees combined innovation and dissemination skills. Hence, relevant indicators
of human capital are the level and type of education, experience in
innovation/technical-related tasks, and experience in entrepreneurship, business and
communication.

Contextual facilitators: create an environment where innovation and
dissemination thrive
Other facilitators are in people’s broader environment: platforms and workshops,
resources and infrastructure, and producers and industry.

Platforms and workshops. Platforms are online knowledge repositories where informal
innovators can find and share innovation-related information that is helpful in
developing or disseminating innovations (Potts et al., 2021). Relevant types are 1. social
media platforms (e.g., YouTube, Facebook) where enthusiasts can meet and share, 2.
innovation platforms (e.g., Thingiverse, Instructables, Youmagine) where innovators
can find CAD files, solutions and ideas and share their own innovations, 3. Sales
platforms (e.g., Shapeways, CreativeMarket, Graphic River), where innovators can offer
their innovations for sale, and 4. Funding platforms (e.g., Kickstarter, the People’s Fund,
Jumpstarter) where innovators can acquire micro-funding to support their informal
business.

Workshops are physical spaces where innovators get access to advanced tools (e.g., 3D
printers, milling machines, laser cutters) and can collaborate. The best known examples
are Makerspaces and FabLabs. These spaces also play a role in commercialization, as
innovators meet like-minded others and obtain dissemination advice and support
(Halbinger, 2018). For people with limited incomes, such as those living in townships,
workshops are generally harder to reach. Instead, the informal community enables
them to lend or hire other people’s tools. Access to workshops can even form the basis
of a small/informal business.

Resources and infrastructure. Citizens have varied access to general resources useful
for innovation and (commercial) dissemination: like houses with sufficient space to
produce products for an informal business, suitable vending places in their
neighborhood, and the availability of (micro)finance. In our township interviews, we
noticed that many informal businesses leverage specific locations where lots of
potential customers pass by. For example, the cow head meat business and the tire
repair service (Box 9) were both located near a taxi rank where many customers (taxi
drivers) were taking a break.

48.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Infrastructure comprises both physical and online facilities. Roads, public transport and
internet access come to mind first, but in South Africa additional infrastructure
elements are lacking that are usually available in high income countries. For example,
there is a shortage of electricity supply, causing many households to be shut off on a
daily basis (known as ‘loadshedding’). Informal businesses also face the challenge of
finding production locations when they grow to the point where they leave the owner’s
house – land must be available, and this can be challenging when the business is
embedded in a particular community (e.g., township).

Producers and industry. As discussed in section 2.1, informal innovation and business
innovation are complementary paradigms (von Hippel, 2017). Formalized businesses
may adopt the innovations that are developed in the household sector. Businesses
develop improved versions, and bring these to the market for general sale (recall Figure
1).

For development and dissemination, it makes a big difference if firms in a country
understand informal innovation and take action to benefit from it. Businesses can
implement various methods to detect and help disseminate informal innovations. They
may: a. organize crowdsourcing competitions to find promising innovation prototypes,
b. provide toolkits to assist citizens in designing solutions for themselves, c.
systematically search informal innovations with market potential by involving so-called
lead users (who are ahead of important market trends and expect to receive substantial
benefits from obtaining a solution), d. scrape the internet for promising designs that
citizens shared online, and/or e. host knowledge-sharing platforms in their domain of
interest (for a detailed discussion, see von Hippel, 2005; 2017). Awareness, and
assistance of citizens with such tools and applications, greatly accelerates innovation
development and dissemination.

Institutional factors: are remotely influential
Institutional factors are the formal and informal rules that organize social, political and
economic relations (North, 1990). Institutional factors are reproduced through routine
actions, often internalized and unconscious, but they shape people’s behaviors in
everyday life. Institutional factors also influence informal innovation and dissemination.

Rules and regulations. Formal institutions are the rules of the game in society as
determined by regulators. These can incentivize or block the development of informal
innovations and their dissemination. For example, in high income countries, one formal
institution that has helped spread informal innovations is the Creative Commons
license, which allows makers to be credited while allowing designs to be shared and
adapted for free (von Hippel, 2005).

In our interviews with South African innovators, intellectual property rights were rarely
used to appropriate value from innovations. Only one out of 26 interviewees had
applied for a patent. When innovators had commercial intentions, they started an
informal business that mainly served people in their immediate environment (e.g., the

49.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

examples shown in Box 8). None of them planned market entry at a scale that would
justify the costs of acquiring and maintaining intellectual property rights. On top of
that, in our township interviews, we learned that many innovators were completely
unfamiliar with patents and trademarks. In contrast, interviewees in affluent areas
repeatedly used Creative Commons licenses to share their innovations online –
indicating that rules and regulations are meaningful but lack of awareness may create
inequities.

Other formal institutions that affect dissemination of innovation are those related to
business registration, dealing with tax authorities and in general, the red tape
associated with formalizing a business in their country. Also, barriers mentioned in our
interviews include high importing fees, red tape for getting specific specialized
equipment into the country, or the geographic remoteness of South Africa.

Norms and values. Informal institutions are the unwritten rules of the game in society.
This encompasses norms and values about (un)desired behavior and practices. For
example, in South Africa, it is well accepted that informal businesses are legitimate
ways of making a living, moreso than in developed countries. In marginalised
communities, social rules often encourage people to reciprocate the support received
as part of a complex network of community support and solidarity (Kraemer-Mbula,
2016). Because of these social norms, it was observed that many informal innovators in
townships freely shared their innovations (if they did not commercialize them).
Examples are the fireless cooking bag (Box 5) and the weeder tool (Box 4).

In affluent areas, some informal innovators are operating in more dispersed
communities, like enthusiasts with similar hobbies they met on the internet. These
communities were governed by norms of openness, providing assistance and giving
credit to the people on whose innovations one builds.

Social capital. Finally, what matters is the social context of the people in the ecosystem,
and the information flows among them. Citizens are embedded in different kinds of
networks – these can be small and large, composed of strong and weak ties, and
individuals can take central positions, leverage contact and more. Some of the social
capital embodied in networks can be instrumental in innovation and dissemination.

For interviewees in affluent areas (well-educated, high-income, prosperous), their
innovation-related social capital was relatively formal and well-defined: for example, the
members of the online knowledge-sharing platform Thingiverse, or in a Facebook
group dedicated to innovating birdwatcher tools (recall Box 6). For people living in
townships, innovation contacts were mainly local, with no clear-cut delimitations. For
example, one township innovator stated that she was part of a group of people who
meet regularly to discuss issues on how they can improve their livelihoods. Such a
community is not directly related to innovation but provides a forum for the free
sharing of ideas and innovations. In addition, such communities provide a ready market
to those with creations that they may want to share.

50.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

Key difference with existing ecosystem frameworks: focus on individuals, not
businesses
The added value of an ecosystem framework for informal innovation (Figure 9) is that it
enables us to simultaneously consider all factors that are important for the
development and dissemination of informal innovations, so that its societal benefits can
be better reaped.

When we compare Figure 9 with Figure 8, the most salient difference is that key
facilitators of informal innovation are concerned with individuals, not businesses. For
example, it is individuals’ competences and access to tools that matter, while factors
such as leadership, access to scientific knowledge, and consulting services matter less,
or not at all. From the perspective of informal innovation, existing businesses represent
just one category of potential recipients of informal innovations (the ‘producers and
industry’ box in Figure 9).

In contrast, classical innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems revolve around the
perspective of commercial businesses and public organizations that develop and
diffuse innovations. In this literature, consumers are important too, but they are
lumped together in the single box of ‘demand’ (see Figure 8). Of course, informal
innovators may start informal businesses, and at some point they can be so successful
that they become formalized and part of the business sector. By that time, the classical
ecosystem depicted in Figure 8 becomes more relevant to the emerging business.

Again, informal innovation and business innovation are two complementary paradigms
(von Hippel, 2017). Figure 1 in chapter 2 showed how both paradigms are related. The
classical ecosystems in Figure 8 are relevant to the bottom arrow of the business
innovation paradigm, while Figure 9 applies to the informal innovation arrow.

4.4. Policy implications

Policy makers should focus on creating practical opportunities for informal
innovators
Informal innovators and their businesses do not benefit from R&D tax credits, public
procurement procedures, venture capital or public-private-partnerships. Their everyday
problems invite practical policies and investments. In Table 12 we offer initial directions,
obtained from a review of the literature (see Mulhuijzen & de Jong, 2022), and inputs
from our expert interviews (appendix A). These directions are certainly not exhaustive.

Policy directions

Expand education in technical and commercial disciplines; expand
opportunities for postgraduate training/lifelong learning; provide low-
threshold facilities to develop skills (also to people without high levels of
education, e.g., YouTube).
Subsidize advanced innovation tools (e.g., CAD software, 3D printers);
invest in and/or subsidize high diffusion of home computers and devices.

Stimulate online platforms (to share and download, sell and buy, ask and

(minor fees or Freemium model2; expand with commercialization
services); facilitate lending equipment; subsidize community members
who can be innovation skills mentors.
Secure/and or subsidize vending places; secure basic infrastructure (e.g.,
electricity) and internet access; stimulate infrastructures for micro-
lending, especially for products ahead of existing demand.
Educate existing firms about informal innovation; stimulate use of
crowdsourcing, toolkits, lead user methods, firm-hosted innovation
communities.

Raise awareness on opportunities for informal innovators to obtain
creative commons licenses; amplify grant permits to use public space for
business; diminish red tape associated with formalizing businesses.
Promote creative citizen behavior (tinkering, DIY) in educational curricula;
promote home-based forms of entrepreneurship; work with different role
models to reach especially marginalized groups.
Facilitate interaction between all actors in the informal innovation
ecosystem through national innovation dialogues, events, and award
ceremonies3

How can these policy recommendations be implemented? Policies for informal
innovation are still in their infancy (von Hippel, 2017; de Jong & von Hippel, 2022). In
South Africa, we found innovative actors who are reaching low income groups and
township innovators that fit the ecosystem framework well. The examples we describe
below are meant as a first step towards a more complete overview – for many
ecosystem factors, no proven policies are available yet. These institutions however,
promise to support informal innovation and dissemination. As such, they should be
engaged in an ecosystem dialogue.

Example 1: Asiye Etafuleni guards and stimulates informal economic spaces
Asiye Etafuleni (AeT) is a non-governmental organization located in Durban, South
Africa (Box 10). Its mission is to “achieve spatial justice and equitable access to
sustainable livelihoods for informal workers in urban public space,” (aet.org.za/). Their
activities include: ensuring that informal economic spaces, such as flea markets and
street-side vending, are integrated in cities’ planning and budgeting priorities, securing
urban environments that support the viability of informal businesses, and creating
vibrant and culturally diverse spaces for the entire city. To accomplish this, AeT provides
expertise and training to public authorities. It collaborates with informal businesses
and professionals to develop inclusive urban spaces that support sustainable
livelihoods.

AeT’s objectives are in line with the need for optimal vending spaces, which emerged in
this research as a part of resources and infrastructure (See framework in Figure 9).
Similar activities would help to implement a policy to move towards acknowledging and
embracing informal business in cities’ public spaces. Our understanding is that AeT is

currently regionally oriented, but their line of thinking fits well with the challenges that
informal innovators with commercial intentions face (especially when they lack
resources) and is worth policy makers’ attention.

Example 2: eKasiLabs provide innovative tools and business incubation services
The eKasiLabs program is initiated by the Innovation Hub, which in turn, is subsidized
by the local Gauteng provincial government (with corresponding geographical reach)
(Box 11). eKasiLabs provides access for informal innovators to workplaces, technical
and non-technical mentoring, prototyping tools, business incubating services and
more.

In the context of our ecosystem framework (Figure 9), eKasiLabs corresponds with the
provision of ‘innovation tools’ and ‘platforms & workshops’. What sets eKasiLabs apart
from many other Makerspaces is that it targets innovators in township areas and offers
business incubation services that are helpful for accomplishing commercial
dissemination. Currently, the kind of programs run by the Innovation Hub are not yet
wellspread throughout the country (South Africa’s Gauteung area) and many rural
areas, similar support is missing. Regardless, the kind of activities that eKasiLabs
implements seem useful to support informal innovation development and commercial
dissemination.

Example 3: IsPani funds for commercial dissemination, sponsored by existing
large firms
The IsPani group is a social enterprise that works as an intermediary between citizens
and existing firms (Box 12). Sponsored by large firms, IsPani provides funding and
microloans to a network of so-called ‘micro-entrepreneurs’ who engage in various
marketing research tasks (e.g., conducting interviews, snapping photos) using a cell
phone app. Their collective insights are used by sponsoring firms. In return,
participants receive micro-funding and learn entrepreneurship skills that they may
deploy to disseminate their own innovations.

The example of IsPani group provides an example of how finance opportunities can
enhance commercial dissemination. IsPani’s activities correspond with the ecosystem
factors ‘resources and infrastructure’ as it can be regarded as basic infrastructure for
microfinance, and with ‘human capital’ as it helps citizens’ to develop skills helpful for
entrepreneurship. Policy makers should learn from such initiatives that enable learning
on the job.

Example 4: Fibrepoynt stimulates internet access for low income areas
Fibrepoynt is a startup in Gauteng area, subsidized by the Technology Innovation
Agency, an entity of South Africa’s Department of Science and Innovation
(www.fibrepoynt.co.za/). Fibrepoynt develops high-speed wireless internet antennas
that should be accessible and affordable to all citizens of South Africa—including
township citizens (Box 13).

The Fibrepoynt initiative corresponds with the ‘resources and infrastructure’ box in our
ecosystems framework. Their mission is particularly challenging given the problems in
South Africa with electricity supply. Nevertheless, policy interventions to stimulate
broad wireless Internet access would contribute to informal innovation development
and dissemination.

5. Conclusions

The informal innovation sector in South Africa is significant in scope and scale.
Challenges associated with supporting informal innovation in the household sector and
subsequent business development differ from those faced by the formal business
sector. This study offers the following findings and recommendations about informal
innovation and informal business :

Informal innovation
Many South Africans innovate in their leisure time. 2.5% of South Africa’s citizens are
innovators: they developed new products or applications in their leisure time during the
past three years. Compared to other countries, the innovation frequency is similar in
order of magnitude (the usual range varies from 1.5% to 6.2%), and is better than
countries like South Korea and China. Compared to most countries the frequency is
slightly lower, which is probably caused by lower education and income levels (both are
well-known antecedents of informal innovation by citizens). Yet, 2.5% still represents
around one million innovating citizens.

Younger people innovate a lot, and innovations are often related to children and
education. Compared to other countries, we find that many citizens 18-24 years-of-age
innovate: 5.8% versus 2.5% nationally. We also found no significant differences between
males and females. Many informal innovations (36%) deal with applications for children
and education. This again deviates from other countries and reflects South Africa’s
population pyramid with many youngsters and few elderly.

Innovations are developed with others and spread relatively well. Unlike high income
countries, South Africans innovate a lot with the help of other people (33%, while
collaboration percentages of 10% to 25% were common in other countries studied so
far). Their innovations spread to other people relatively often: direct and free diffusion
to peers is > 50% , while commercial diffusion is > 10% (in other countries these
percentages are closer to 25% and 5%, respectively).

Motives for informal innovation are diverse: personal need, enjoyment, helping and
commercial. Informal innovators can be users (driven by the necessity to use
innovations themselves), participators (primarily motivated by enjoyment and
opportunities to learn), helpers (developing solutions to help others’ problems) or
vendors (commercializing innovations to generate income). At the bottom-of-the-
pyramid (poor, township residents, low educated) innovators are often users and
vendors. Amongst the affluent, they are often participators and helpers.

Informal Business
Informal business ownership is common. We estimate that 2.5 million citizens run
informal businesses that generate incomes (6.2%). These businesses come on top of
formalized ventures (estimated 5.3% of the population) and businesses that are

57.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

partially formalized (5.9%). Informal businesses – and their innovations – are mostly
undetected in statistics like the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor.
Marginalized groups are more likely to have informal businesses. We find that the
frequency of informal business ownerships is particularly high amongst female, low-
educated and township residents; compared to male, high-educated and people living
in affluent areas. If we were able to include informal business ownership in official
entrepreneurship statistics, the incidence rates of entrepreneurship for deprived
groups would be higher.

Informal businesses face down-to-earth challenges. They are not hampered by access
to scientific knowledge or high-end technology, nor by a lack of competences related to
advanced managerial practices. Their challenges are related to microfinance,
infrastructure (e.g., vending places and electricity), and access to resources, including
basic tools.

Informal businesses only become formalized when it is ‘advantageous’. For example,
formalization occurs when the business grows, the variety of the customer base
expands, the business develops activities for formalized businesses or governments, or
formalization is required to secure key resources (e.g., permits, new locations).

The relationship between informal innovation and business
Informal innovation leads to informal new business development. Informal innovators
are likely to become informal business owners: 14.7% have an informal business, while
amongst all citizens, this is 6.2%. Especially at the bottom of the pyramid, people use
informal ventures to generate (extra) income from their innovations. Informality then
acts as a seedbed for the lower-risk experimentation and start-up entrepreneurship.

Existing formal business owners develop informal innovations for general benefit.
They are likely to develop informal innovations that are unrelated to their business, but
that will help other people. Compared to regular citizens, formal business owners have
good technical, commercial and communication skills. These enable them to effectively
disseminate their informal innovations freely. Prosperous formal business owners
especially appreciate the impact they can make on others by disseminating their
innovations.

Business ownership goes together with informal innovation. The relationship between
the degree of formality of businesses, and the frequency of informal innovation, is an
inverted U. Those without any type of business are least likely to be innovators. Those
with an informal business are highly likely, while citizens who are running formal
businesses are in the middle (less likely innovators than informal business owners, but
more likely to be innovators compared to non-business owners).

Public policy
Policy should address dissemination incentives and commercialization barriers. We
estimate that 55% of informal innovations are developed by South Africans who lack
incentives to disseminate their innovations to the benefit of others (as they innovated

58.Making the Invisible Visible: Informal Innovation in South Africa

to solve a personal problem, have fun, or develop a new skill). Another 45% are
developed by citizens facing barriers especially related to commercialization.

Measures differ from classical innovation policy instruments. The ecosystem in which
informal innovations are developed and disseminated differs from the classical
innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem. What matters is people’s competencies
and access to tools, as well as environmental facilitators like platforms, workshops,
general infrastructure and interactions with commercial businesses. Also, institutional
factors related to rules and regulation, norms and values, and citizen networks play a
role. A different ecosystem comes with different policy interventions.

Policy interventions address individuals more than businesses. A balanced policy mix is
recommended to accommodate the challenges that individuals face when developing
informal innovations and subsequently, businesses. Examples of policy interventions
and initiatives in South Africa that already match with informal innovation are related to
securing business locations, access to basic tooling and micro-finance, to name a few.

Appendix 1: Research methods

Our research included a survey, interviews, literature and desk research. What follows is
a brief description, details are available from the corresponding author on request.

Survey
We surveyed 1,096 South Africans for population estimates of informal innovation and
business ownership. We added a convenience sample of 951 citizens who were likely
innovators and/or business owners, to deepen our insights about both phenomena.

Questionnaire. Topics covered in our survey are summarized in Table 13. Average
response time was 10 minutes (range 4-18 minutes). We applied existing guidelines to
measure informal innovation in the household sector, as has been done in other
countries (e.g., United Kingdom, Finland, Emirates, and China) (de Jong, 2016; de Jong &
von Hippel, 2022).

As for business ownership, our survey leveraged recent insights about the presence of
informal businesses in developing economies (e.g., Williams, 2016; Kraemer-Mbula &
Wunst-Vincent, 2016). We designed our questions to enable a comparison between
formal and informal businesses based on key concepts as mentioned in Table 13.

Sample 1: broad and representative. We collaborated with AskAfrica, a market research
company in Pretoria, South Africa. Two samples of data were collected.
First, computer-assisted telephone surveys (CATI) were done to collect a broad sample
of mature citizens (age 18+). In advance, soft quotas were applied to respondents’
gender, age, education and living area to better assure representativity. AskAfrica
contacted 3,877 citizens drawn from a database with national coverage. Of these, 1,096
participated in the survey (28%) while the other prospects refused, were cancelled
because their quotas were reached, or did not answer after an initial appointment was
made. AskAfrica supplied us with a table including South Africans’ gender, age,
education and income distribution. To obtain best possible population estimators, we
weighted our data to completely represent the distribution of these variables (that are
important antecedents of innovation and business ownership). Table 14 specifies our
broad sample before and after weighing.

Sample 2: likely innovators and business owners. We added a convenience sample of
citizens who were likely to be innovative and/or business owners. This subsample helps
us to expand the number of relevant cases to analyze the characteristics of informal
innovations and businesses. For this purpose, AskAfrica invited a subset of their online
panel of South Africans who regularly engaged in marketing research. Members of this
panel are selective: they are generally younger people, proactive, open to experience,
and up to date with the latest trends. AskAfrica contacted 7,041 of its online panel
members, of whom 951 completed the survey (the others refused, did not meet the
screening criteria (e.g., 18+ years old) or no longer fit with the soft quota that was
applied to avoid overrepresentation of particular groups).

Analysis. Combining both samples, we identified 210 cases of informal innovation –
people developing products or applications in their leisure time, that enabled them to
perform a novel function, and that could not be done with an existing product available
on the market (see de Jong, 2016, for a description for how household innovations are
screened). We also identified 573 respondents who were owners of a business – they
ran a formal or informal business that generated a personal income for them
(businesses that did not generate income were regarded as nascent businesses and
excluded from most of our analyses).

In summary, findings reported in this study are based on 1,096 respondents
(population estimates of the frequency of innovation and business ownership – based
on weighted data), 210 innovations (when we talk about the nature, process and
diffusion of innovation – unweighted data) and 573 business owners (when we report
about informality of businesses and related characteristics – unweighted data).

Interviews
In-depth interviews were done with 26 South Africans to more deeply investigate the
nature, process and diffusion of informal innovation, and how these are related to any
entrepreneurship behaviors. Most interviews were conducted in person, but some were
done online.

Interview script. The interview script is summarized in Table 15. Prior to the interview we
had identified whether an interviewee had developed an informal innovation – by
searching the Internet or by observation.

1. How have you been educated? In general, are you a tinkerer, do-it-yourselfer?

Interviewees. We aimed for a broad variety of the kinds of innovations developed.
Accordingly, we selected interviewees in two extreme environments: townships (i.e.,
innovations developed by the poor and relatively uneducated) and makers (who are
typically well-educated, with high incomes, and living in affluent areas). Township
innovations were mostly found by direct observation and asking for referrals. We
secured 11 interviews in the townships of Orange Farm and Soweto in the
Johannesburg area. Maker innovations were primarily found online, in online
knowledge-sharing platforms like Thingiverse, and on the websites of public and
private makerspaces. Here we secured 15 interviews. An anonymized overview is in
Table 16.

Notes: * interviewees were found online on knowledge-sharing platforms (M) or in townships (T).

Analysis. The average interview time was 70 minutes (range 45-90 minutes). We
immediately processed the interviews into full case reports. Where we had expected
stark contrasts, township and maker innovations appeared to have many things in
common – both followed the innovation process and diffusion patterns that we
describe in this report. We did find that township innovations were developed more
often for personal needs and commercial motives, while maker innovations were
relatively hedonic and built to help other people. Also, in townships, we found a
stronger correlation between informal innovation and informal business ownership.

Literature and desk research
Finally, we took a dive into the academic literature relevant to informal innovation and
business ownership, especially to develop the ecosystem framework presented in this
report. We started with insights from the existing literatures on national innovation
systems, ecosystems for innovation, and entrepreneurial ecosystems. To identify
relevant ecosystem elements, we used insights from the literatures on household
sector innovation, open and user innovation, sustainable/grassroots innovation,
makers and maker entrepreneurship, informal business, do-it-yourself and consumer
tinkering.

To identify policy practices and examples, we also studied a range of policy reports, and
asked the UNDP Accelerator Labs to come up with examples that they have observed in
their countries. A full reference list of our literature and desk research is in Appendix 2.

Finally, we did online interviews with eleven experts in informal innovation, informal
business and/or ecosystems, for feedback on initial versions of the framework
presented in this report (Table 17). This also helped us to identify missing literature and
think through policy implications.
