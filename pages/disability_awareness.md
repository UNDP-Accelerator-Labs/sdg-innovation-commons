> Title of the innovation

DISABILITY AWARENESS

> Brief description of the innovation

Have you ever imagined a society where disabled individuals are considered to be fully equal to the able bodied?. In our society there is so much segregation we can't really point at it but it is there. Hence this idea comes in to educate, enlighten and sensitize our communities about disabilities to reduce misconceptions, discrimination and stigma. In turn empower people living with disabilities in various ways.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Initially this idea' baseline is about awareness. In doing so, it supposed to be shared to a particular radio station with a big coverage e.g (RVC). To facilitate this program we have to partner with organizations like UNICEF, ZAPD, Disability Right Watch (DRW). When this project is funded, Radio Christian Voice will benefit, disabled individuals will benefit too. There are certain infrastructure, equipment, educational and health material which the country has overlooked for so many years. in light of this program, the information will cause a shift in policy making regarding people living with disabilities. 
Therefore, any donations realized shall help a lot of disabled children and adults in our society.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation is based on sensitization and disability awareness. We aim to reach radio stations and thereafter TV stations to enlighten, educate and inform our community about various disabilities. We have observed that lack of information has led to higher levels of discrimination, stigma and misconceptions in our society towards disabled individuals. Hence, media houses, social media and conferences shall help in spreading this new wave of acceptance towards colleagues with disabilities.

> Anticipated Social Impact

If parents to children with disabilities are well informed, their children are mandated to improve at school and social life levels. If our society is well informed about disabilities, the levels of stigma, discrimination, and misconceptions towards people living with disabilities shall reduce. When any finances are realized in this project it shall go a long way in helping individuals with disabilities. 
By doing this, we target the government also in helping to create an inclusive educational environment for people living with disabilities in the mainstream.
