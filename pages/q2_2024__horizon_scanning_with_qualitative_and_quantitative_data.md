## Title
****

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Horizon Scanning from multi channels (stakeholder engagement and open data) and diffusion of Horizon Scanning findings
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that Horizon Scanning is misunderstood by colleagues as pre-prodoc development involving desktop research on specific topic

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Learning from foresight report development, and my involvement as signaller for FTSS, plus wide misconception of horizon scanning as an exercise undertaken during project document development. The research usually through desktop research and limited engagement with stakeholders who are relevant to the pipeline project.

To institutionalize horizon scanning in the MY CO, and correct the above assumptions, for horizon scanning is an ongoing collection of weak signals and trends, we setup a team of interns and guide them to perform intelligence and scan for signals in Malaysia context.

The team also continuously improving the communication of the horizon scanning, from tiktok video to now a web-based digest that can be accessed beyond UNDP intranet/email. We are considering to do podcast as well.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Social media comments, structured interviews, surveys to podcast, tiktok videos to detect signals such growing disparity in education post-pandemic and level of accessibility to health facilities in two districts with most ageing population.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How we can institutionalize horizon scanning system that use multiple sources of data to inform new trends and weak signals, and accessible to CO colleagues and stakeholders?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



signal studio, storytelling, Tiktok video development, data analysis

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Data from telecommunications
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
