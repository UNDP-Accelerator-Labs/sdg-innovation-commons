ii | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

Foreword

Twenty five years ago the first Human
Development Report in 1990 began with
a simple notion: that development is about
enlarging people’s choices — focusing broadly
on the richness of human lives rather than
narrowly on the richness of economies. Work
is a major foundation for both the richness of
economies and the richness of human lives but
has tended to be conceptualized in economic
terms rather than in human development
terms. The 2015 Human Development Report
goes beyond that convention in directly link-
ing work to the richness of human lives.

This Report starts with a fundamental
question — how can work enhance human
development? The Report takes a broad view
of work, going beyond jobs and taking into ac-
count such activities as unpaid care work, vol-
untary work and creative work — all of which
contribute to the richness of human lives.

The Report highlights impressive progress
on human development over the past quarter
century. Today people are living longer, more
children are in school and more people have
access to clean water and basic sanitation. Per
capita income in the world has gone up, and
poverty has gone down, resulting in a better
standard of living for many people. The digital
revolution has connected people across coun-
tries and societies. Work has contributed to
this progress by building people’s capabilities.
Decent work has provided people with a sense
of dignity and an opportunity to engage fully
in society.

Considerable challenges remain, from per-
sistent poverty and grinding inequalities to cli-
mate change and environmental sustainability
in general, and to conflict and instability. These
all create barriers to people fully engaging in
decent work, and as a result huge amounts of
human potential remain untapped. This is of
particular concern for young people, women,
people with disabilities and others who may
be marginalized. The Report argues that if the
potential of all people is harnessed through
appropriate strategies and proper policies, hu-
man progress would be accelerated and human
development deficits would be reduced.

The Report reminds us that there is no au-
tomatic link between work and human devel-
opment. The quality of work is an important
dimension of ensuring that work enhances
human development. Issues such as discrimi-
nation and violence, however, prevent positive
links between work and human development.
Some work is very damaging to human devel-
opment, such as child labour, forced labour
and the labour of trafficked workers, all of
which constitute serious violations of human
rights. In many cases workers in hazardous
conditions face serious risks of abuse, insecuri-
ty and loss of freedom and autonomy.

All these issues are becoming even more
critical to address as the world of work, driven
by globalization and technological revolution,
is undergoing rapid changes. Globalization
has generated gains for some and losses for
others. The digital revolution has created new
opportunities, but has also given rise to new
challenges, such as irregular contracts and
short-term work, which are asymmetrically
distributed between highly skilled and un-
skilled workers.

The Report makes a strong case that women
are disadvantaged in the world of work — in
both paid and unpaid work. In the realm of
paid work, they are engaged in the workforce
less than men, they earn less, their work
tends to be more vulnerable and they are
underrepresented in senior management and
decisionmaking positions. In terms of unpaid
work, they bear a disproportionate share of the
housework and care work.

The Report identifies sustainable work,
which promotes human development while
reducing and eliminating negative side effects
and unintended consequences, as a major
building block of sustainable development.
Such work would expand opportunities for
the present generation without shrinking
those for future ones.

The Report argues that enhancing human
development through work requires policies
and strategies in three broad areas — creating
work opportunities, ensuring workers’ well-be-
ing and developing targeted actions. The first

Foreword | iii

area focuses on national employment strategies
and seizing opportunities in the changing
world of work, while the second area covers
such important issues as guaranteeing workers’
rights and benefits, expanding social protec-
tion and addressing inequalities. Targeted
actions should focus on sustainable work, ad-
dressing imbalances in paid and unpaid work
and interventions for specific groups — for
example, for youth and people with disabil-
ities. Above all, there needs to be an agenda
for action pursuing a New Social Contract, a
Global Deal, and the Decent Work Agenda.

This year’s Report is particularly timely,
following shortly after the UN Sustainable
Development Summit, where the new
Sustainable Development Goals were adopted,
including Goal 8’s explicit emphasis on work:
Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable
economic growth, full and productive employ-
ment, and decent work for all.

In this context there should be serious discus-
sion about the challenges created by the ongoing
changes in the world of work. Opportunities
should be taken to strengthen the links between
work and human development. During the
past 25 years the human development concept,
reports and indices have generated considerable
debate, dialogue and discussions around the
world on development challenges and policy
issues. I expect this year’s report to be no ex-
ception in its capacity to generate dialogue and
debate around the concept of human develop-
ment and strategies to advance it.

The 2015 Human Development Report is the
product of the Human Development Report
Office (HDRO) at the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP).

The findings, analysis and policy recom-
mendations of the Report are those of HDRO
alone and cannot be attributed to UNDP
or to its Executive Board. The UN General
Assembly has officially recognized the Human
Development Report as “an independent in-
tellectual exercise” that has become “an impor-
tant tool for raising awareness about human
development around the world.”

The Report has benefited from a series of
contributions by eminent people and organi-
zations. Particular appreciation is due for the
signed contributions by HE Mr. Benigno S.
Aquino III (President of the Philippines),
Leymah Gbowee (winner of the 2011 Nobel
Peace Prize), HE Ms. Roza Otunbayeva
(former president of Kyrgyzstan), Nohra
Padilla (recipient of the 2013 Goldman
Environmental Prize), Orhan Pamuk (winner
of the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature), Robert
Reich (former United States Secretary of
Labor), Kailash Satyarthi (winner of the 2014
Nobel Peace Prize) and HE Mr. Maithripala
Sirisena (President of Sri Lanka).

Appreciations are also extended for con-
tributions commissioned from the following
authors: Antonio Andreoni, Marizio Atzeni,
Fred Block, David Bloom, Jacques Charmes,
Martha Chen, Diane Coyle, Christopher
Cramer, Peter Evans, Nancy Folbre, Marina
Gorbis, Kenneth Harttgen, Rolph Eric van der
Hoeven, Rizwanul Islam, Patrick Kabanda,
Claudio Montenegro, Nameera Nuzhat, Dani
Rodrik, Jill Rubery, Malcolm Sawyer, Frances
Stewart, Miguel Szekely, and Lanying Zhang.

Discussions with experts in many disciplines
are equally necessary and valuable for the
development of the Report, starting with an
informal sounding round, followed by con-
sultations with a designated advisory panel
for the 2015 Report. The commitment of
time, advice and reviews from the following
individuals are highly valued: Amartya Sen,
Sudhir Anand, Amy Armenia, Martha Chen,

Mignon Duffy, Peter Evans, Nancy Folbre,
Gary Gereffi, Enrico Giovannini, Marina
Gorbis, James Heintz, Jens Lerche, José
Antonio Ocampo, Samir Radwan, Akihiko
Tanaka, Lester Salamon, Frances Stewart and
Ruan Zongze.

The Statistical Advisory Panel plays a critical
role in extending expert advice on methodol-
ogies and data choices related to the calcula-
tion of the Report’s indices. Its members are
Wasmalia Bivar, Martine Durand, Haishan Fu,
Pascual Gerstenfeld, Ifeyinwa Isiekwe, Yemi
Kale, Rafael Diez de Medina, Fiona Robertson
and Michaela Saisana. The composite indices
and other statistical resources in the Report
also rely on the expertise of the leading interna-
tional data providers in their specialized fields.
To ensure accuracy and clarity, the statistical
analysis has also benefitted from discussions
of statistical issues with Gisela Robles Aguilar,
Sabina Alkire, Jacques Charmes, Kenneth
Harttgen, Claudio Montenegro and Yangyang
Shen. I deeply appreciate their contributions.

The Report also benefitted from dialogues
with representatives from national statistical
offices to further refine and update source
data used for the compilation of international-
ly-generated indicators.

The consultations convened during prepa-
ration of the Report relied on the generous
support of many institutions and individuals
who are too numerous to mention here.
Events and consultations were held in Accra,
Boston, Geneva and Singapore (participants
and partners are listed at http://hdr.undp.org/
en/2015-report/consultations).

A Report focusing on work would not
have been possible without extensive consul-
tations and generous investment of time by a
wide range of colleagues at the International
Labour Organization both in Geneva and
New York. Colleagues at the United Nations
Food and Agriculture Organization, United
Nations Children’s Fund, United Nations
Volunteers and UN Women also offered much
valued insights and commentary. Valuable
financial contributions were received from the
Governments of France and Germany.

Overview
Work for human development

Human development is about enlarging human choices — focusing on the richness of human lives rather than simply
the richness of economies (see infographic). Critical to this process is work, which engages people all over the world
in different ways and takes up a major part of their lives. Of the world’s 7.3 billion people, 3.2 billion are in jobs, and
others engage in care work, creative work, voluntary work or other kinds of work or are preparing themselves as future
workers. Some of this work contributes to human development, and some does not. Some work even damages human
development (figure 1).

Work enables people to earn a livelihood and
be economically secure. It is critical for equi-
table economic growth, poverty reduction and
gender equality. It also allows people to fully
participate in society while affording them a
sense of dignity and worth. Work can contrib-
ute to the public good, and work that involves
caring for others builds cohesion and bonds
within families and communities.

Work also strengthens societies. Human
beings working together not only increase ma-
terial well-being, they also accumulate a wide
body of knowledge that is the basis for cultures
and civilizations. And when all this work is
environmentally friendly, the benefits extend
across generations. Ultimately, work unleashes
human potential, human creativity and the
human spirit.

This year’s Human Development Report
explores how work can enhance human
development, given that the world of work
is changing fast and that substantial human
development challenges remain. The Report
takes a broad view of work, including volun-
tary work and creative work, thus going be-
yond jobs. And it examines the link between
work and human development, focusing on
care work as well as paid work and discussing
sustainable work.

The Report also makes the points that the
link between work and human development
is not automatic and that some work, such as
forced labour, can damage human develop-
ment by violating human rights, shattering
human dignity and sacrificing freedom and
autonomy. And without proper policies,
work’s unequal opportunities and rewards can
be divisive, perpetuating inequities in society.

The Report concludes that work can en-
hance human development when policies ex-
pand productive, remunerative and satisfying
work opportunities, enhance workers’ skills
and potential and ensure their rights, safety
and well-being. The Report also pursues an ac-
tion agenda based on a New Social Contract,
a Global Deal and the Decent Work Agenda.

People are the real wealth
of nations, and human
development focuses on
enlarging people’s choices

Twenty-five years ago the first Human
Development Report presented the concept
of human development, a simple notion with
far-reaching implications. For too long, the
world had been preoccupied with material
opulence, pushing people to the periphery.
The human development framework, taking a
people-centred approach, changed the lens for
viewing development needs, bringing the lives
of people to the forefront.

It emphasized that the true aim of develop-
ment is not only to boost incomes, but also
to maximize human choices — by enhancing
human rights, freedoms, capabilities and
opportunities and by enabling people to lead
long, healthy and creative lives (box 1).

The human development concept is com-
plemented with a measure — the Human
Development Index (HDI) — that assesses
human well-being from a broad perspective,
going beyond income (box 2).

With this simple but powerful notion of
people-centred development, nearly two

BOX 1

Human development — a comprehensive approach

Human development is a process of enlarging people’s
choices — as they acquire more capabilities and enjoy
more opportunities to use those capabilities. But hu-
man development is also the objective, so it is both a
process and an outcome. Human development implies
that people must influence the process that shapes their
lives. In all this, economic growth is an important means
to human development, but not the goal.

Human development is development of the people
through building human capabilities, for the people by
improving their lives and by the people through active
participation in the processes that shape their lives. It
is broader than other approaches, such as the human
resource approach, the basic needs approach and the
human welfare approach.

BOX 2

Measuring human development

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite
index focusing on three basic dimensions of human
development: to lead a long and healthy life, mea-
sured by life expectancy at birth; the ability to acquire
knowledge, measured by mean years of schooling
and expected years of schooling; and the ability to
achieve a decent standard of living, measured by
gross national income per capita. The HDI has an up-
per limit of 1.0.

To measure human development more com-
prehensively, the Human Development Report also
presents four other composite indices. The Inequality-
adjusted HDI discounts the HDI according to the ex-
tent of inequality. The Gender Development Index
compares female and male HDI values. The Gender
Inequality Index highlights women’s empowerment.
And the Multidimensional Poverty Index measures
nonincome dimensions of poverty.

Work, not just jobs, contributes
to human progress and
enhances human development

From a human development perspective, the
notion of work is broader and deeper than that
of jobs or employment alone. Jobs provide in-
come and support human dignity, participation
and economic security. But the jobs framework
fails to capture many kinds of work that have
important human development implications
— as with care work, voluntary work and such
creative work as writing or painting.

The link between work and human devel-
opment is synergistic. Work enhances human
development by providing incomes and live-
lihoods, by reducing poverty and by ensuring
equitable growth. Human development — by
enhancing health, knowledge, skills and
awareness — increases human capital and
broadens opportunities and choices (figure 2).

Human devel o p m e n t

The notion of work is
broader and deeper
than that of jobs

Overview | 3

Since 1990 the world has made major strides
in human development. The global HDI value
has increased by more than a quarter and that
of the least developed countries by more than
half. This progress has been fairly steady over
time and across regions. The number of people
living in low human development fell from
3 billion in 1990 to slightly more than 1 billion
in 2014 (see table 8 in Statistical annex).

Today, people are living longer, more chil-
dren are going to school and more people have
access to clean water and basic sanitation. This
progress goes hand in hand with rising incomes,
producing the highest standards of living in hu-
man history. A digital revolution now connects
people across societies and countries. Just as
important, political developments are enabling
more people than ever to live under democratic
regimes. All are important facets of human
development.

Between 1990 and 2015 income poverty in
developing country regions fell by more than
two-thirds. The number of extreme poor people
worldwide fell from 1.9 billion to 836 million.
The child mortality rate fell by more than half,
and under-five deaths fell from 12.7 million to
6 million. More than 2.6 billion people gained
access to an improved source of drinking water,
and 2.1 billion gained access to improved sani-
tation facilities, even as the world’s population
rose from 5.3 billion to 7.3 billion.

Work in various forms by 7.3 billion people
has contributed to this progress. Nearly a bil-
lion people who work in agriculture and more
than 500 million family farms produce more
than 80 percent of the world’s food, improving
nutrition and health. Worldwide, 80 million
workers in health and education have enhanced
human capabilities. More than a billion work-
ers in services have contributed to human
progress. In China and India 23 million jobs
in clean energy are increasing environmental
sustainability.

Work has a societal value that goes beyond
the gains of individual workers. More than
450 million entrepreneurs are contributing to
human innovation and creativity. Some 53 mil-
lion paid domestic workers are addressing the
care needs of people. Care work for children
is preparing them for the future. Work that
involves caring for older people or people with
disabilities is helping them maintain their

capabilities. Work by artists, musicians and
writers is enriching human lives. More than
970 million people who engage in volunteer
activity each year are helping families and
communities, building social networks and
contributing to social cohesion.

Yet human progress has been
uneven, human deprivations
are still widespread and much
human potential remains unused

Human development has been uneven among
regions, across countries and within countries.
In 2014 Latin America and the Caribbean’s
HDI value was 0.748, compared with 0.686
in the Arab States. And the maternal mortality
ratio was only 21 per 100,000 live births in
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development countries, compared with 183 in
South Asia (see table 5 in Statistical annex).

Globally women earn 24 percent less than
men and hold only 25 percent of administra-
tive and managerial positions in the business
world — while 32 percent of businesses have
no women in senior management positions.
Women still hold only 22 percent of seats in
single or lower houses of national parliament.

In Malaysia the richest 10 percent of the
population had 32 percent of national in-
come in 2012, the poorest 10 percent of the
population had only 2 percent. In Moldova
69 percent of urban people have access to safe
drinking water, compared with only 23 per-
cent of rural people.

Added to the uneven human development
achievements are widespread human depriva-
tions. Worldwide 795 million people suffer
from chronic hunger, 11 children under age
5 die every minute and 33 mothers die every
hour. About 37 million people live with HIV
and 11 million with tuberculosis.

More than 660 million people use an un-
improved source of drinking water, 2.4 billion
people use an unimproved sanitation facility
and nearly a billion people resort to open
defecation.

Worldwide 780 million adults and 103 mil-
lion young people (ages 15–24) are illiterate.
In developed countries 160 million people are
functionally illiterate. Globally 250 million

The number of people
living in low human
development fell by

children have not learned basic skills — even
though 130 million of them have spent at least
four years in school.

One critical human deprivation is not using,
misusing or underusing the deep human poten-
tial of people for human development–enhanc-
ing work. In 2015, 204 million people were out
of work, including 74 million young people —
based on formal unemployment data. About
830 million people in the world are working
poor — living on less than $2 a day — and more
than 1.5 billion are in vulnerable employment,
usually lacking decent working conditions and
adequate voice and social security.

Unleashing this potential becomes even
more important when considering the emerg-
ing human development challenges.

Take the rising inequalities in income, wealth
and opportunity. Today around 80 percent of
the world’s people have only 6 percent of the
world’s wealth. The share of the richest 1 per-
cent is likely to be more than 50 percent by
2016. In the world of work, wages lag behind
productivity, and workers’ shares in income
have been falling.

Population growth, driven mostly by South
Asia and increasingly by Sub- Saharan Africa,
will have major implications for human
development — for work opportunities, the
care gap between care needs and care providers
and the provision of social protection. Recent
estimates indicate that there is a global shortage
of 13.6 million care workers, causing extreme
deficits in long-term care services for those
over age 65. Greater longevity, ageing, the
youth bulge and dependency ratios will all have
impacts. In 2050 more than two-thirds of the
world’s population — or 6.2 billion people — are
expected to live in urban areas, stressing the
coping capacities of cities.

Human security is under threat from many
sources. At the end of 2014, 60 million people
had been displaced worldwide. Between 2000
and 2013 the cumulative death tolls from glob-
al and national violent extremism rose more
than fivefold, from 3,361 to 17,958. Violence
against women is one of the most brutal threats
to human development. One in three women
has been subject to physical or sexual violence.
Human development is undermined by mul-
tiple shocks, vulnerabilities and risks — by epi-
demics, by emerging health risks, by economic

and financial crises and by food and energy
insecurities. For example, noncommunicable
(or chronic) diseases are now a global health
risk, killing 38 million people each year, almost
three-quarters of them (28 million) in low- and
middle-income countries. Almost 30 percent
(2.1 billion) of the world’s people are obese,
more than three-fifths of them in developing
country regions.

Around the world communities are becom-
ing more vulnerable to the effects of climate
change, including the loss of biodiversity — the
lifeline of many poor communities. Around
1.3 billion people live on fragile lands. Millions
are affected by natural disasters.

Work can enhance human
development, but some work
damages it — the link between
the two is not automatic

The link between work and human devel-
opment is not automatic. It depends on the
quality of work, the conditions of work, the
societal value of work and so on. Whether peo-
ple have a job is important, as are other issues.
For example: Is work safe? Are people fulfilled
and satisfied by their work? Are there prospects
for advancement? Does employment support
a flexible work–life balance? Are there equal
opportunities for women and men?

The quality of work also includes whether a
job provides dignity and a sense of pride and
whether it facilitates participation and inter-
action. To strengthen the link with human
development, work also has to enhance envi-
ronmental sustainability. Work strengthens its
link with human development when it goes
beyond individual benefits to contribute to
shared social objectives, such as poverty and
inequality reduction, social cohesion, culture
and civilization.

Conversely, the value of work is diminished
and its link with human development becomes
weaker when there is discrimination and vio-
lence at work. The most observable discrimina-
tion is along gender lines — in positions, pay and
treatment. In the United States female financial
specialists’ salaries are only 66 percent of their
male counterparts’. But discrimination also
occurs along lines of race, ethnicity, disability

and sexual orientation. In Latin America the
wage gap between indigenous ethnic groups
and the rest of the population is estimated at
38 percent.

Workplace or occupational violence — in the
form of threats and physical or verbal abuse —
also weakens the work–human development
link. In 2009 some 30 million EU workers
experienced work-related violence, such as
harassment, intimidation, bullying or physical
violence — 10 million in the workplace and
20 million outside it.

The link also weakens in conflict and post-con-
flict situations. Work under such conditions
does not always have a definable content, and
human development may entail simple survival.
Some work in some conditions damages
human development. Many people are in work
that restricts their life choices. Millions work in
abusive and exploitative conditions that violate
their basic human rights and destroy their dig-
nity, such as child labourers, forced labourers
and trafficked workers (figure 3). And millions
of domestic, migrant, sex and hazardous-indus-
try workers face various risks.

population, some 100 million boys and 68 mil-
lion girls. Around half are engaged in hazard-
ous work.

In 2012 about 21 million people worldwide
were in forced labour, trafficked for labour
and sexual exploitation or held in slavery-like
conditions — 14 million were subject to labour
exploitation and 4.5 million to sexual exploita-
tion. Women and girls accounted for a larger
share than men and boys. Forced labour is
thought to generate around $150 billion a year
in illegal profits.

After arms and drug trafficking, human
trafficking is the most lucrative illicit business
worldwide. Between 2007 and 2010 trafficked
victims of 136 nationalities were detected in
118 countries, 55–60 percent of them women.
Trafficking of illegal migrants has recently
surged. Networks of traffickers take money
from desperate migrants who try to cross seas
and land illegally into other countries. In 2014
some 3,500 people, maybe many more, lost
their lives in the Mediterranean Sea when traf-
ficking boats heading towards Europe, mainly
from Libya, capsized or sank.

The world has around 168 million child
labourers, almost 11 percent of the child

of whom are women. With appropriate pro-
tections in place, domestic work can empower
people and help lift their families out of pov-
erty. But abuse is common in paid domestic
work, particularly for female migrant workers.
Sometimes if the legal framework is inadequate
or unenforced, employers use threats and
coercion to pay low or even no wages. They
can force paid domestic workers to work long
hours — up to 18 hours a day without days off.
Working conditions are often poor, with little
food and no access to medical care. Paid do-
mestic workers may also be subject to physical
or sexual abuse.

Mining is one of the most hazardous occu-
pations in many countries. It accounts for only
1 percent of the global workforce (30 million
workers) but is responsible for 8 percent of fatal
accidents at work and for many injuries and dis-
abling diseases, such as pneumoconiosis (black
lung disease).

Globalization and the
technological revolution
are fast changing how we
work and what we do

The context of work is changing, with impli-
cations for human development. Driving the
transformation of work are globalization and
technological revolutions, particularly the
digital revolution. Globalization has fostered
global interdependence, with major impacts
on patterns of trade, investment, growth and
job creation and destruction — as well as on
networks for creative and volunteer work. We
seem to be living through new and accelerated
technological revolutions.

In the past 10 years global trade in goods
and services almost doubled — reaching nearly
$24 trillion in 2014, up from $13 trillion in
2005. The digital components of these flows
have also been increasing.

The speed of adoption and penetration of
digital technologies is mind-boggling. In the
United States it took more than 50 years be-
fore half the population had a telephone. For
cell phones it took only 10 years (figure 4). By
the end of 2015 the planet will have more than
7 billion mobile subscriptions and more than
3 billion Internet users.

Access to the digital revolution is uneven
across regions, sexes, age groups and the urban–
rural divide. In 2015, 81 percent of households
in developed countries had Internet access,
compared with only 34 percent in developing
country regions and 7 percent in the least de-
veloped countries.

Globalization brings workers and businesses
together in global networks through out-
sourcing and global value chains. Companies
relocate or subcontract (or a bit of both) some
functions or noncore activities to other coun-
tries where costs are lower. For example, Apple
employs only 63,000 of the more than 750,000
people around the world who design, sell, man-
ufacture and assemble its products.

Many economic activities are now integrated
in global value chains that span countries, some-
times continents. This integration goes from raw
materials and subcomponents to market access
and after-sales services. Production is mainly of
intermediate goods and services organized in
fragmented and internationally dispersed pro-
duction processes, coordinated by multinational
companies and cutting across industries.

In recent years knowledge has become
central to production. Even in manufacturing
the value of finished goods comes increasingly
from embodied knowledge. In 2012 trade
in knowledge-intensive goods, services and
finance — worth nearly $13 trillion — grew

1.3 times faster than trade in labour-intensive
goods, to account for a larger proportion in
total trade in goods and services.

The digital revolution has produced such
new frontiers of work as the sharing economy
(GrabTaxi), business process outsourcing
(UpWork), crowdworking (Mechanical Turk)
and flexible working. It has also revolutionized
creative work and empowered small producers
and artisans.

Technological advances have not only
transformed work; they are also engines
for new forms of creativity and innovation.
Collaborative teams and visionaries have
turned ideas into tangible goods and services.
Innovations in computers and electronics
were central to this growth: From 1990 to
2012 their share in all new patents more than
doubled, from more than 25 percent to nearly
55 percent.

The digital revolution has also changed vol-
unteering, which can now be done virtually
(online or digitally). UN Volunteers’ online
volunteering system helped 10,887 volunteers
(60 percent of them women) contribute their
skills towards development work in 2014.

Some of the technologies with the highest
potential to change work include cloud tech-
nology, 3D printing, advanced robotics, energy
storage and the automation of knowledge work
— which through intelligent software systems
will transform the organization and productiv-
ity of knowledge work and enable millions to
use intelligent digital assistants.

In the new world of work, workers need to be
more flexible and adaptable — and be ready to
retrain, relocate and renegotiate working con-
ditions. They also need to dedicate more time
to searching for new opportunities.

The people most linked to the new world
of work are millennials — roughly the cohort
born since 1980. This group has come of age
at a time when digital technologies and ad-
vanced information and communication tech-
nologies penetrate all areas of life. They have
also become adults at a time when flexibility,
adaptability and unconventional work are in-
creasingly common.

Many millennials are looking for work that
goes beyond creating profits, hoping to solve
environmental and social problems as part of
their livelihoods.

Social entrepreneurs are also emerging as a
new workforce. They are cause-driven people
committed to addressing social problems, and
they establish nonloss, nondividend companies
(where all profits are reinvested back into the
company) that aim to be financially self-sus-
tainable and to maximize social benefits.

Globalizing work has
generated gains for some
and losses for others

With outsourcing, assembly jobs in developed
countries began moving to export processing
zones as developing countries adopted ex-
port-oriented industrialization. The impact
on job creation in large developing countries
such as China and Mexico, as well as smaller
countries such as Costa Rica, the Dominican
Republic and Sri Lanka, has been substantial
and positive, often boosting local development,
although the quality of the work and enforce-
ment of labour standards have varied.

The global offshoring of service jobs started
to pick up in the 1990s as advances in informa-
tion and communications technology allowed
many support services to be performed offsite.
For example, between 2000 and 2010 the
number of direct jobs in information and com-
munications technology in India jumped from
284,000 to more than 2 million. Services are
also growing in the Russian Federation, Latin
America and Africa, in part matching compa-
nies’ interests in diversifying into different time
zones to enable 24-hour service. But outsourc-
ing to developing countries has not benefitted
all sectors and all workers.

While outsourcing in general seems benefi-
cial to developing country regions, it has con-
sequences for workers in developed countries.
Estimates vary, and the long-term impacts
are less clear than the short-term effects, but
job losses are greater in manufacturing than
services. Short-term job losses due to offshor-
ing have been found to range from 0 in some
countries to almost 55 percent of all job losses
in Portugal.

Today, jobs that involve administrative sup-
port, business and financial operations, and
computer and mathematical tasks are most
likely to be outsourced. In Australia, Canada

We seem to be
living through new
and accelerated
technological
revolutions

8 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

and the United States 20–29 percent of all jobs
have the potential to be offshored, though it is
unlikely that all of them will be. Many jobs in
this estimate are in medium- and high-skilled
service professions that can be carried out at
lower cost abroad as education levels rise and
information and communications technology
infrastructures improve.

So, while there may be immense benefits in
access to new jobs in countries hosting offshore
activities, individuals losing jobs may require
training and new skills for a more competitive
environment. To ease the adjustment, pro-
grammes are needed to help people find new
work, enhance their skills and maintain access
to a basic income. Training can also enhance
the abilities of workers in developing countries
to access the new jobs.

The integration of developing countries in
global value chains has increased opportunities
for paid work and prompted a shift in labour
force participation for women (many find jobs
in the garment industry). In 2013, 453 million
workers (up from 296 million in 1995), in-
cluding 190 million women, were involved in
global value chains.

But such integration does not say much
about the quality of work and whether workers
have expanded their human capabilities. There
are concerns about levels of labour protection
and opportunities for skills upgrading.

The global value chain system generates
winners and losers, within and across countries
and industries. The footloose nature of global
value chains can generate less job security and
put even more pressure on governments and
subcontractors to minimize costs. This in turn
puts pressures on workers’ wages and working
conditions, particularly among the low skilled.
Developing countries also face the risk of
becoming locked into low value-added nodes
of global value chains that limit work oppor-
tunities, skill development and technology
exposure.

The transition to global value chains has
introduced new complexities for workers in de-
veloped and developing countries alike. There
are questions about how much workers gain by
partaking in work contributing to global value
chains versus work outside them. There is some
evidence that productivity is higher in global
value chain–oriented work but that wages are

the same for workers inside and outside global
value chains, raising questions about how the
increases in productivity are shared between
workers and capital.

Market pressures transmitted through global
value chains tend to be absorbed by workers
— whether in wages (driven down by global
competition), in increased informalization
and contractual insecurity (through multiple
subcontracting chains) or in layoffs (during
downturns). Multinational corporations
increasingly rely on a disenfranchised work-
force, using a mix of fixed-term employees,
temporary workers, independent contractors,
project-based workers and outsourced workers
to provide production flexibility and manage
costs. Participation in value chains provides
some with secure, decent jobs and others with
more precarious work (even in the same coun-
try and sector), in a type of “labour dualism.”

Seizing the future in the digital
revolution is not chance or fate —
it is a matter of skill and foresight

The types of work that people do and the
ways they do it are being transformed by new
technologies. This change is not new, but it is
reshaping the link between work and human
development and the types of policies and in-
stitutions needed to foster positive outcomes
for people.

The spread and penetration of digital tech-
nologies are changing the world of work every-
where, but the effects vary across countries.
Some technological changes are cross-cutting,
such as information and communications
technologies and the spread of mobile phones
and other handheld devices. Still, countries
will continue to have divergent production and
employment structures and different uses for
digital technologies, largely reflecting the rela-
tive economic weights of agriculture, industry
and services, as well as the resources invested
in developing people’s capabilities. Labour
markets, the ratio of paid to unpaid work and
the predominant types of workplaces in each
country differ — so the impacts of digital tech-
nologies on work will vary, too.

The digital revolution may be associat-
ed with high-tech industries, but it is also

influencing a whole range of more informal
activities from agriculture to street vending.
Some may be directly related to mobile devic-
es. In Ethiopia farmers use mobile phones to
check coffee prices. In Saudi Arabia farmers
use wireless technology to distribute scarce
irrigated water for wheat cultivation. In some
villages in Bangladesh, female entrepreneurs
use their phones to provide paid services for
neighbours.

Mobile phones now facilitate many aspects
of work through a combination of voice calls,
SMS and mobile applications. There are ben-
efits for many other types of activity — formal
and informal, paid and unpaid — from food
vendors in Cairo to street cleaners in Senegal to
care providers in London.

Internet and mobile phone access empowers
people to harness their creativity and inge-
nuity. Much more is possible, particularly if
inequalities in access between men and wom-
en and rural and urban areas are addressed.
If Internet access in developing countries
were the same as in developed countries,
an estimated $2.2 trillion in GDP could be
generated, with more than 140 million new
jobs — 44 million in Africa and 65 million
in India. Long-term productivity in devel-
oping countries could be boosted by up to
25 percent.

The digital economy has enabled many wom-
en to access work that allows them to apply
their creativity and potential. In 2013 about
1.3 billion women were using the Internet.
Some have moved to e-trading as entrepreneurs,
and some are employed through crowdworking
or e-services. But this new world of work puts a
high premium on workers with skills and qual-
ifications in science and technology, workers
less likely to be women.

Older workers also have new work options,
as they continue to work either because they
enjoy their work or because they cannot af-
ford to retire. Most of the older and younger
workers are in different labour markets (so
there is no direct substitution) and the anxiety
that young people will lose out because older
people are encouraged to work may not be the
case.

Still, there are risks and promises as yet unful-
filled. We may in fact be at an inflexion point,
with both positive and negative impacts. The

technological revolution presents skill-biased
technical change: the idea that the net effect
of new technologies reduces demand for less
skilled workers while increasing demand for
highly skilled ones. By definition, such change
favours people with higher human capital, po-
larizing work opportunities.

At the top will be good jobs for those with
high education and skills. For example, in
the automobile industry those who benefit
will be the engineers who design and test
new vehicles. At the bottom there will still be
low-skill, low-productivity, low-wage service
occupations such as office cleaning. But the
middle areas will see a steady hollowing out
of many jobs in office cubicles and on factory
floors. The biggest losers will thus be workers
with less specialized, routine-work skills (fig-
ure 5).

Many cognitively complex jobs are beyond
the abilities even of people with reasonable
qualifications. Some industries could thus face
skill shortages, so companies willing to pay high
salaries for the best talent will look to the global
market. And besides being polarized nationally,
workforces are being stratified internationally,
with low-skilled workers coming mainly from
national markets and high-skilled workers from
global markets.

Now is the time to be a worker with special
skills and the right education, because these
people can use technology to create and cap-
ture value. But there has never been a worse
time to be a worker with only ordinary skills
and abilities, because computers, robots and
other digital technologies are acquiring these
skills and abilities at an extraordinary speed.

An implied promise of the digital revolution
was that it would increase labour productivity
and thus would lead to higher pay. This does
not seem to have happened on either front:
productivity has not grown at the rates expect-
ed, and few of the gains have translated into
higher wages. In many economies (for example,
the Netherlands) the gap between productivity
and wage growth has widened over the years,
and the situation is even more serious as av-
erage wages mask the fact that as real pay for
most workers stagnated, income for the highest
earners soared.

The technological revolution has been ac-
companied by rising inequality. Workers are

getting a smaller share of total income. Even
people with better education and training who
can work more productively may not receive
commensurate rewards in income, stability or
social recognition.

The declining share of workers’ income can
be seen as part of the slowdown in the growth
of average real wages: As the income shares of
high-skilled labour (and of capital) have been
going up, the share of other labour has been
going down.

The sharp increase in work compensation
to top salary earners has benefited a minority,
whether the top 10 percent, 1 percent or even
0.1 percent. The global elite, the world’s richest
1 percent, had an average wealth of $2.7 mil-
lion per adult in 2014.

Are workers, employers and policymakers
prepared to respond to the challenges of the
emerging world of work? In such a world,
specific technical knowledge quickly becomes
obsolete, and the policies and rules of yester-
day might not serve the challenges of today or
tomorrow.

Imbalances leave women at a
disadvantage in the realm of
work — whether paid or unpaid

In the two worlds of work — unpaid care work
and paid work — there continue to be pro-
nounced imbalances across genders, reflecting
local values, social traditions and historical
gender roles. Care work includes housework,
such as preparing meals for the family, cleaning
the house and gathering water and fuel, as well
as work caring for children, older people and
family members who are sick — over both the
short and long term. Across most countries
in all regions, women work more than men.
Women are estimated to contribute 52 percent
of global work, men 48 percent.

But even if women carry more than half the
burden, they are disadvantaged in both realms
of work — paid as well as unpaid work — in pat-
terns that reinforce each other.

In 2015 the global labour force participation
rate was 50 percent for women but 77 percent
for men. Worldwide in 2015, 72 percent of

working-age (ages 15 and older) men were
employed, compared with only 47 percent of
women. Female participation in the labour
force and employment rates are affected heavily
by economic, social and cultural issues and care
work distributions in the home.

Of the 59 percent of work that is paid, most-
ly outside the home, men’s share is nearly twice
that of women — 38 percent versus 21 percent.
The picture is reversed for unpaid work, mostly
within the home and encompassing a range of
care responsibilities: of the 41 percent of work
that is unpaid, women perform three times
more than men — 31 percent versus 10 percent.
Hence the imbalance — men dominate the
world of paid work, women that of unpaid work.
Unpaid work in the home is indispensable to the
functioning of society and human well-being:
yet when it falls primarily to women, it limits
their choices and opportunities for other activ-
ities that could be more fulfilling to them.

Even when women are in paid work, they
face disadvantages and discrimination. The
evidence of the glass ceiling is just one of
them. Women are underrepresented in senior
business management globally: They hold only
22 percent of senior leadership positions, and
32 percent of businesses do not have any female
senior managers, with regional variations (fig-
ure 6). Occupational segregation has been per-
vasive over time and across levels of economic
prosperity — in both advanced and developing

FIGURE 6

countries men are over-represented in crafts,
trades, plant and machine operations, and man-
agerial and legislative occupations; and women
in mid-skill occupations such as clerks, service
workers and shop and sales workers.

Even when doing similar work, women can
earn less — with the wage gaps generally great-
est for the highest paid professionals. Globally,
women earn 24 percent less than men. In Latin
America top female managers earn on average
only 53 percent of top male managers’ salaries.
Across most regions women are also more like-
ly to be in “vulnerable employment” — working
for themselves or others in informal contexts
where earnings are fragile and protections and
social security are minimal or absent.

Women bear an unequal
share of care work

Women worldwide undertake most of the
unpaid care work, which includes mainly
housework (such as preparing meals, fetching
firewood, collecting water and cleaning) and
care work (such as caring for children, the sick
and older people) in the home and community.
Due to their disproportionate share of care
work, women have less time than men for other
activities, including paid work and education.
This includes less discretionary free time. In a
sample of 62 countries, men devoted on average

12 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

Globally, women
earn 24 percent
less than men

4.5 hours a day to social life and leisure, and
women 3.9 hours. In low human development
countries men spend nearly 30 percent more
time on social life and leisure than women. In
very high human development countries the
difference is 12 percent.

Women are also disproportionately involved
in paid care work. The demand for paid domes-
tic workers has risen. Globally an estimated
53 million people ages 15 and older are in paid
domestic work. Of these, 83 percent are women
— some, migrant workers. And so a global care
work chain has emerged where migrant domes-
tic workers undertake housework and provide
care to children and others in households
abroad. But they often leave their own children
and parents behind in their homeland, creating
a care gap often filled by grandparents, other
relatives or hired local helpers.

Despite the possible abuse in domestic work —
low wages, poor working conditions, no access
to medical care, and physical or sexual abuse —
many workers feel obliged to remain with abu-
sive employers because they need the work.

Despite the importance for human devel-
opment, care work often goes unrecognized.
This is partly because, being unpaid, it is not
reflected in economic indicators such as GDP.
But valuing unpaid care work would highlight
women’s contributions in households and
communities and draw attention to their mate-
rial conditions and well-being, with a possible
implication for policymaking. Among all coun-
tries attempting to measure the value of unpaid
care work, estimates range from 20 percent to
60 percent of GDP. In India unpaid care is es-
timated at 39 percent of GDP, in South Africa
15 percent.

When women have no choice but to give
priority to unpaid work and stay out of the
labour force, they make large sacrifices, perhaps
missing the chance to expand their capabilities
in the workplace. They also lose opportunities
for economic independence.

Addressing imbalances in unpaid
and paid work benefits both
current and future generations

Imbalances in the division of work between
women and men have to be changed. Yes, many

societies are experiencing a generational shift,
particularly in educated middle-class house-
holds, towards greater sharing of care work
between men and women. Yet much remains
to be done, and action needs to happen quickly
to address deep gender inequalities. Long-
standing patterns of inequalities can reinforce
each other, trapping women and girls across
generations in realms of limited choices and
opportunities. Steps are needed along four
policy axes — reducing and sharing the load of
unpaid care work, expanding opportunities for
women in paid work, improving outcomes in
paid work and changing norms.

Time spent in unpaid care work needs to
be reduced overall and shared more equal-
ly. Universal access to clean water, modern
energy services for household needs, quality
public services (including those related to
health and care), workplace arrangements that
accommodate flexible schedules without pe-
nalizing professional advancement and a shift
in mindsets about gender-specific roles and
responsibilities can all contribute to reducing
the load of care work for families and women
in particular.

Legislation and targeted policies can increase
women’s access to paid work. Access to quality
higher education in all fields and proactive
recruitment efforts can reduce barriers, particu-
larly in fields where women are either underrep-
resented or where wage gaps persist.

Policies can also remove barriers to women’s
advancement in the workplace. Measures such
as those related to workplace harassment and
equal pay, mandatory parental leave, equitable
opportunities to expand knowledge and exper-
tise and measures to eliminate the attrition of
human capital and expertise can help improve
women’s outcomes at work.

Paid parental leave is crucial. More equal and
encouraged parental leave can help ensure high
rates of female labour force participation, wage
gap reductions and better work–life balance
for women and men. Many countries now offer
parental leave to be split between mothers and
fathers.

Social norms also need to evolve to reflect
the equal potentials of women and men.
Promoting women to visible positions of
seniority, responsibility and decisionmak-
ing in both public and private spheres and

Overview | 13

encouraging the engagement of men in tradi-
tionally female-dominated professions can help
shift deep-seated views.

Sustainable work is a
major building block for
sustainable development

Sustainable work promotes human develop-
ment while reducing and eliminating negative
side effects and unintended consequences. It is
critical not only for sustaining the planet, but
also for ensuring work for future generations
(figure 7).

For such work to become more common,

three parallel changes are needed:
• Termination (some work will end or be

reduced).

• Transformation (some work will be preserved
through investment in adaptable new tech-
nologies and retraining or skill upgrading).

• Creation (some work will be new).

Some occupations can be expected to loom
larger — railway technicians, for instance,
as countries invest in mass transit systems.
Terminated workers may predominate in
sectors that draw heavily on natural resources
or emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants.
About 50 million people are employed globally
in such sectors (7 million in coal mining, for
example).

In many occupations, how output is pro-
duced also needs to change, as in ship breaking,
by implementing and enforcing standards.

New areas of work include solar photovoltaic
technologies, an important part of many coun-
tries’ renewable energy strategies. Their poten-
tial for human development differs radically
depending on whether they replace grid-based
electricity generated by conventional means,
as in many developed countries, or expand
off-grid energy access, as in many developing
countries. Renewable energy could become
a key vehicle towards achieving Sustainable
Development Goal 7.1 to ensure universal

The Sustainable Development
Goals have key implications
for sustainable work

The Sustainable Development Goal with the
most direct implications for sustainable work
is goal 8 (promote sustained, inclusive and sus-
tainable economic growth, full and productive
employment, and decent work for all), and its
associated targets, which spell out some of the
implications for sustainable work. Target 8.7
is to take immediate and effective measures to
eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery
and human trafficking and secure the prohi-
bition and elimination of the worst forms of
child labour, including the recruitment and
use of child soldiers and by 2025 to end child
labour in all its forms.

Overview | 15

Much of the work
tied to environmental
sustainability will
involve infrastructure
and construction

processes, with all countries taking action in
accordance with their respective capabilities —
implies a specific direction to upgrading skills
and possibly to new areas of work.

A

large number of the Sustainable
Development Goal targets intend to focus on
work that has negative implications for human
development. Target 8.7, if reached, would
improve the lives of 168 million child labour-
ers and 21 million in forced labour. Target
5.2 would assist 4.4 million sexually exploited
women, and target 3.a would affect an estimat-
ed 100 million workers in tobacco. Active poli-
cies and programmes will be needed to support
the people formerly engaged in these kinds of
work.

Other goals and targets involve transform-
ing current modes of work and introducing
new approaches. Goal 2 — ending hunger and
achieving food security and improved nutrition
and promoting sustainable agriculture — has
the potential to transform how the very large
number of people engaged in agriculture carry
out their activities.

Work in some primary industries — such as
farming, fisheries and forestry — engages more
than a billion people worldwide, including
most of those living on less than $1.25 a day.
The sector is responsible for a large proportion
of greenhouse gas emissions, is associated with
unsustainable patterns of water and soil use, is
linked to deforestation and loss of biodiversity
and is especially susceptible to the disruptions
of climate change.

Transforming the way farmers grow and pro-
cess crops is thus crucial. Technologies and farm-
ing methods that can make a difference exist but
need to be adopted faster. For example, about a
third of total food production is lost or wasted,

with cereals accounting for the largest share.
Broad efforts are needed to expand demonstra-
ble, immediate gains — and to create new prod-
ucts for industrial or artisanal manufacture.

Much of the work tied to a move to environ-
mental sustainability (target 9.4) will involve
infrastructure and construction. Energy pro-
jects (goal 7) can drive long- and short-term
jobs, directly and indirectly, when they enable
other industries to grow and flourish. In 2014
renewable energy (excluding large hydropower,
which had roughly 1.5 million direct jobs) em-
ployed an estimated 7.7 million people directly
and indirectly. In renewable energy the field
of solar photovoltaics is the largest employer
worldwide, with 2.5 million jobs.

By strengthening health and education
outcomes, especially among children, the
Sustainable Development Goals can set the
basis for people to acquire the skills to move to
occupations that involve sustainable work.

Enhancing human development
through work needs concrete
policies and an agenda for action

Policy options for enhancing human develop-
ment through work have to be built around
three broad dimensions: creating more work
opportunities to expand work choices, ensur-
ing workers’ well-being to reinforce a positive
link between work and human development
and targeted actions to address the challenges
of specific groups and contexts. An agenda for
action to build momentum for change is also
needed, pursuing a three-pillar approach — a
New Social Contract, a Global Deal and the
Decent Work Agenda (figure 8).

Creating work opportunities requires well formulated
employment plans as well as strategies to seize opportunities in
the changing world of work

Work for human development is about more
than just jobs, but human development is also
about expanding people’s choices and making
sure that opportunities are available. This in-
cludes ensuring that adequate and quality paid
work opportunities are available and accessi-
ble for those who need and want paid work.
National employment strategies are needed
for addressing the complex challenges in
work in many countries. About 27 developing
countries have adopted national employment
strategies, another 18 are doing so and 5 are
revisiting their policies to better respond to
new employment challenges. Major policy
instruments of a national employment strategy
might include:
• Setting an employment target. More than
a dozen countries have employment tar-
gets (including Honduras and Indonesia).
Central banks may pursue dual targeting —
moving beyond a focus primarily on inflation
control to emphasize employment targets.
They may also consider specific monetary
policy instruments (such as credit allocation

mechanisms) for creating more work op-
portunities, as in Chile, Colombia, India,
Malaysia and Singapore.

• Formulating an employment-led growth
strategy. Employment can no longer be con-
sidered to be simply a derivative of economic
growth. Some policy interventions would
entail strengthening links between small and
medium-sized enterprises in need of capital
and large capital-intensive firms to boost
employment, upgrading workers’ skills over
the lifecycle, focusing investments and inputs
on sectors where poor people work (such
as agriculture), removing barriers critical to
employment-led growth (such as removing
biases towards small and medium-sized en-
terprises in access to credit), implementing
solid legal and regulatory frameworks and
addressing the distribution of capital and
labour in public spending to emphasize tech-
nologies that create jobs .

• Moving to financial inclusion. An inclusive fi-
nancial system is essential for structural trans-
formation and work creation. In developing

countries the lack of access to finance is a
major hindrance to enterprise operation
and growth, particularly for women. Policy
options might encompass extending banking
services to disadvantaged and marginalized
groups (as in Ecuador), steering credit to-
wards unserved, remote areas and targeted
sectors (as in Argentina, Malaysia and the
Republic of Korea) and lowering interest
rates and providing credit guarantees and
subsidized credit to small and medium-sized
enterprises and export-oriented sectors.

• Building a supportive macroeconomic frame-
work. Some policy instruments to reduce vol-
atility and create secure jobs include keeping
the real exchange rate stable and competitive,
managing capital accounts prudently, restruc-
turing budgets towards job-creating sectors,
building fiscal space for public spending,
promoting an enabling business environ-
ment, ensuring high-quality infrastructure
and adopting a regulatory framework that
encourages competition, enhances efficiency
and ensures transparency and accountability
for business.

Seizing opportunities in the changing
world of work requires policy actions to help
people thrive in the new work environment.
Individuals can flourish if they are equipped
with skills, knowledge and competencies to
harness new technologies and capitalize on
emerging opportunities. Some of the policy
actions here would require:
• Heading off a race to the bottom. Given the
realized and potential benefits that globali-
zation brings to work, a race to the bottom
— ever lower wages and worsening working
conditions — is not the only outcome. Global
attention to ensuring decent wages, maintain-
ing workers’ safety and protecting their rights
can pre-empt such a race and make business
more sustainable in the long run, as can fair
trade, because work conditions are becoming
increasingly critical in consumers’ minds.
• Providing workers with new skills and ed-
ucation. Higher and specific skills will be
needed for science and engineering jobs and
for many other jobs, as will be an aptitude
for creativity, problem solving and lifelong
learning.

Strategies for ensuring workers’ well-being must focus on
rights, benefits, social protection and inequalities

Guaranteeing the rights and benefits of workers
is at the heart of strengthening the positive link
between work and human development and
weakening the negative connections.

Policies could include:

• Setting legislation and regulation. These
should be on collective bargaining, un-
employment insurance, the minimum wage,
protection of workers’ rights and worker
safety. Steps to ratify and implement the
eight International Labour Organization
conventions on work and to put in place legal
frameworks for enforcement are also needed
(figure 9).

• Ensuring that people with disabilities can
work. Measures can induce employers to
provide an appropriate working environ-
ment. States can make efforts to change
norms and perceptions, enhance the capa-
bilities of people with disabilities, ensure

workplace accessibility and access to ap-
propriate technology and adopt affirmative
action policies.

• Making workers’ rights and safety a cross-bor-
der issue. Measures may include regulatory
frameworks that extend to migrants, sub-
regional remittance clearinghouses and more
support to migrant source countries. These
frameworks may constitute regional or sub-
regional public goods.

• Promoting collective action and trade union-
ism. Given globalization, the technological
revolution and changes in labour markets,
support is needed for emerging forms of
collective action (such as the Self-Employed
Women’s Association in India), innovative
organizations for flexible workers (such as
the Freelancers Union in the United States)
and collective bargaining, including peaceful
protests and demonstrations.

Only 27 percent of the world’s population
is covered by comprehensive social protection,
which means that the security and choices of
many workers is severely limited. Action to
extend social protection should focus on:
• Pursuing well designed, targeted and run
programmes. A basic and modest set of social
security guarantees can be provided for all
citizens through social transfers in cash and
kind. Resources can be mobilized through, for
example, progressive taxes, restructured ex-
penditures and wider contributory schemes.
• Combining social protection with appropriate
work strategies. Programmes would provide
work to poor people while serving as a social
safety net.

• Assuring a living income. This would be a
basic minimum income for all, independent
of the job market, through cash transfers.
Such a policy would help make unpaid work
a more feasible and secure option.

• Tailoring successful social protection pro-
grammes to local contexts. Programmes for
cash transfers or conditional cash transfers

have provided a source of social protection,
particularly in Latin America (such as Bolsa
Família in Brazil and Oportunidades, now
called Prospera, in Mexico) and could be
replicated in other parts of the world.

• Undertaking direct employment guarantee
programmes. Countries have also pursued
employment guarantees. The best known is
the National Rural Employment Guarantee
Scheme in India.

• Targeting interventions for older people. Older
people’s scope for choice in work is limited
by access to pensions. Policy choices include
expanding noncontributory basic social
pensions systems and exploring fully funded
contributory pension systems (as in Chile,
for example).
Because workers are getting a smaller share of
total income and inequalities in opportunities
are still substantial, policy options should focus
on:
• Formulating and implementing pro-poor
growth strategies. This would entail creating
work in sectors where most poor people

Profit sharing with
labour and giving

enterprises may help
cut income inequality

work, improving poor households’ access to
such basic social services as health, educa-
tion, safe water and sanitation and providing
access to such productive resources as inputs,
credit and finance. These actions can also free
up time spent in unpaid care work. Subsidies,
targeted expenditures and pricing mecha-
nisms are other options.

• Providing complementary support. Marketing
facilities, investments in physical infrastruc-
ture (particularly in rural areas), expansion of
extension services and labour-intensive tech-
nologies are conducive to equalizing work
opportunities. The private sector can, with
the right incentives, be encouraged to play a
major role in building and running physical
infrastructures.

• Democratizing education, particularly at
the tertiary level, nationally and globally.
Countries place a high premium on tertiary
education, but access is unequal and can
perpetuate inequalities in work, as seen
within countries (most workers with a ter-
tiary education come from higher income
families) and between countries (countries
with greater increases in tertiary education
are industrial, with already high attainment
in this segment).

• Pursuing profit sharing and employee owner-
ship. Profit sharing with labour and giving
employees shares in enterprises may help cut
income inequality.

• Adopting and enforcing proper distributive
policies. These could include progressive taxes
on income and wealth, regulations to reduce
rent extraction, stricter regulation (particu-
larly of finance) and targeted public spending
on the poor.

• Regulating the financial sector to reduce the re-
gressive effects of cycles. Promoting investments
in the real economy can generate secure jobs,
while increases in financial investment can be
less stable and produce fewer jobs.

• Removing asymmetries between the mobility
of labour and of capital. Labour mobility
does not match capital’s given intrinsic dif-
ferences. As a matter of policy, industrial
countries promote capital mobility but
discourage that of labour. Nonetheless,
regulating capital movements can reduce
macroeconomic instability and middle-
income traps in developing countries,
preventing capital from moving overseas
when wages become too high. Migration
policies can at a minimum reduce the risks
of migration.

Targeted actions are needed for balancing care and paid work,
making work sustainable, addressing youth unemployment,
encouraging creative and voluntary work and providing work in
conflict and post-conflict situations

Addressing imbalances in paid and unpaid work
opportunities between women and men may
benefit from the following policy measures:
• Expanding and strengthening gender-sen-
sitive policies for female wage employment.
Programmes should address skills devel-
opment through education, particularly
in math and science, training that matches
market demands and access to continuing
professional development.

• Actions to increase representation of wom-
en in senior decisionmaking positions.
Representation can be enhanced in public
and private sectors through policies on hu-
man resources, selection and recruitment,

and incentives for retention. The criteria
for moving men and women into senior
positions should be identical. Mentoring and
coaching can empower women in the work-
place, for example, by using successful senior
female managers as role models.

• Specific interventions. Legislative measures are
needed to reduce inequalities between wom-
en and men in harassment in the workplace,
discrimination in hiring, access to finance
and access to technology.

• Focusing on maternal and paternal parental
leave. Rather than pursuing a totally gen-
der-neutral approach, if a bonus is granted
to parents who share parental leave more

20 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

equally, fathers may be induced to make
more use of paternal leave.

• Enlarging care options, including day-care cen-
tres, after-school programmes, senior citizens’
homes and long-term care facilities. Employers
can also offer child-care onsite. Another
alternative is to subsidize care work through
vouchers and tickets.

• Encouraging flexible working arrangements,
including telecommuting. There should be suf-
ficient incentives to return to work after giving
birth. These may encompass reservation of
jobs for women on maternity leave for up to
a year. Women could also be offered benefits
and stimulus (for example, salary increases) to
return to work. Telecommuting and flexible
hours can also allow women and men to ad-
dress imbalances in paid and unpaid work.
• Valuing care work. Efforts would help raise
policy awareness about the value care work
brings to society and could encourage differ-
ent options for rewarding such work.

• Gathering better data on paid and unpaid
work. National statistical systems, using more
female investigators and appropriate samples
and questionnaires, should gather better data
on the distribution of paid and unpaid work.
Targeted measures for sustainable work may
focus on terminating, transforming and creat-
ing work to advance human development and
environmental sustainability. Policy measures
may focus on:

• Adopting different technologies and encour-
aging new investments. This would require
departing from business as usual, pursuing
technology transfer and quickly moving to
more sustainable work.

• Incentivizing individual action and guarding
against inequality. This requires recognizing
and incentivizing the positive externalities
in people’s work — for example, using a social
wage, which goes beyond a private wage to
reward workers when their work is of value
to society (for example, conservation of
forests).

• Managing trade-offs: For example, support-
ing workers who lose their jobs due to an end
of activities in their sector or industry (for
example, mining), implementing standards
(as in the ship-breaking industry), addressing
intergenerational inequality and managing
and facilitating change.
Additionally, a mechanism is needed to
translate the desired global outcomes into
country actions (box 3).

Policy options mentioned earlier, particularly
for education and skills building, are especially
relevant to addressing youth unemployment.
But given the severity of this challenge and
its multidimensional (economic, social and
political) impacts, it also requires targeted
interventions. Exciting work opportunities for
young people should be created so that they
can unbridle their creativity, innovation and

BOX 3

Possible measures at the country level for moving towards sustainable work

•

Identify appropriate technologies and investment
options, including leapfrogging opportunities.
• Set up regulatory and macroeconomic frameworks

to facilitate adoption of sustainable policies.

• Ensure that the population has the appropriate
skills base — combining technical and high-quality
skills with core abilities for learning, employability
and communicating.

• Retrain and upgrade the skills of large numbers of
workers in informal sectors, such as agriculture.
While some workers may be reached through the
market, others will need the help of the public sec-
tor, nongovernmental organizations and others.

These programmes can be a means to support wom-
en and other traditionally disadvantaged groups.
• Manage the adverse impacts of the transition by
offering diversified packages of support and level-
ling the playing field to break the transmission of
intergenerational inequality.

• Continue to build the skill base of the population.
This will require a lifecycle approach that recog-
nizes the cumulative nature of interventions that
lead to learning. Large investments in the number
and quality of health and education workers will be
necessary, underscoring the continuing role of the
public sector in transforming skills.

entrepreneurship in the new world of work.
Methods for doing so include:
• Providing policy support to the sectors and
entities creating new lines of work. Such ini-
tiatives are ongoing, and new opportunities
are being discovered every day, but they need
policy support.

• Investing in skills development, creativity and
problem solving. Special support should be
extended to young women and men in ap-
prenticeships, trade and vocational training,
and on-the-job learning.

• Providing supportive government policies to
help young entrepreneurs. Areas include advi-
sory services for establishing businesses and
initiatives and better instruments and chan-
nels for financing. Recently, crowdsourcing
has emerged as a means of generating funds
for small initiatives.

• Making tertiary learning more widely availa-
ble through the Internet. Massive open online
courses are linking world-renowned academic
institutions and students around the world.
• Using cash transfer programmes to provide em-
ployment for local young people and poor peo-
ple. In India and Uganda these programmes
have provided resources for funding job
searches and for supporting high-quality
training and skills development. They have
also increased access to other sources of cred-
it for entrepreneurship.
Creative work requires an enabling work
environment, including financial support, and
opportunities to collaborate and cross-fertilize
ideas. Some key requirements for creativity and
innovation to thrive are:
• Innovating inclusively. Here, new goods and
services are developed for or by those living
on the lowest incomes or by women, extend-
ing creative opportunities to groups that may
be underrepresented.

• Assuring democratic creativity. Workplaces
and online platforms can be organized in
ways that encourage innovation at all levels.

• Funding experimentation and risk. This
entails solving intractable social and environ-
mental problems that may require founda-
tions and public institutions to take funding
risks on less proven approaches.

• Innovating for the public good. Creativity and
innovation can advance many objectives.
Policies that direct innovation towards the
greater social good, including volunteer
work, can enhance human development.
Voluntary work can be encouraged by tax
rebates, subsidies and public grants to volun-
tary organizations. Public support to create
and protect space for voluntary work can bring
social benefits, particularly during emergencies
like conflicts and natural disasters.

In conflict and post-conflict situations it is
important to focus on productive jobs that
empower people, build agency, provide access
to voice, offer social status and increase respect,
cohesion, trust and people’s willingness to
participate in civil society. Some policy options
are:
• Supporting work in the health system. In many
conflict-afflicted countries the health system
has collapsed, and support for emergency
health services is critical for workers and the
wounded.

• Getting basic social services up and run-
ning. This has social and political benefits.
Communities, nongovernmental organiza-
tions and public–private partnerships can be
the drivers.

• Initiating public works programmes. Even
emergency temporary jobs, cash for work
and the like can provide much needed live-
lihoods and contribute to the building of
critical physical and social infrastructures.
• Formulating and implementing targeted com-
munity-based programmes. Such programmes
can yield multiple benefits, including stabil-
ity. Economic activities can be jumpstarted
by reconnecting people, reconstructing net-
works and helping restore the social fabric.

Beyond the policy options, a broader agenda for action is needed

• Developing a New Social Contract. In the new
world of work participants are less likely to

have long-term ties to a single employer or
to be a member of a trade union than their

forebears. This world of work does not fit
the traditional arrangements for protection.
How does society mobilize funds to cover
a widening population that is not always in
work, reach those working outside the formal
sector, accommodate new labour market en-
trants (especially migrants) and cover those
unable to work? There may be a need for a
New Social Contract in such circumstances
involving dialogue on a much larger scale
than took place during the 20th century.
Denmark is making strides providing secu-
rity alongside reskilling and skills upgrading

Flexicurity in Denmark

The Danish labour market has a lot of what is of-
ten called “flexicurity”: coexistence of flexibility, in
the form of low adjustment costs for employers and
employees, and security, a by-product of Denmark’s
well developed social safety net, ensuring high cov-
erage and replacement rates.

The principal aim of flexicurity is to promote
employment security over job security, meaning
protection focuses on workers rather than their jobs.
Consequently, employers benefit from all the advan-
tages of a flexible labour force while employees can
take comfort in a robust social safety net applied
with active labour market policies.

commitments. Further, true globalization
rests on the idea of sharing — we should share
the responsibility for a “global working life.”
A Global Deal would require mobiliz-
ing all partners — workers, businesses and
governments — around the world, respecting
workers’ rights in practice and being pre-
pared to negotiate agreements at all levels.
This will not require new institutions, merely
reoriented attention in the world’s strong
international forums.

A Global Deal can guide governments in
implementing policies to meet the needs of
their citizens. Without global agreements,
national policies may respond to labour de-
mands at home without accounting for exter-
nalities. This implies that a global–national
compact is also necessary. International
conventions such as the International Labour
Organization Convention Concerning
Decent Work for Domestic Workers, which
entered into force in September 2013, was
a groundbreaking agreement that stands to
establish global standards for the rights of
domestic workers worldwide. This kind of
agreement offers guiding principles to sig-
natories but leaves space for national govern-
ments to implement policies within national
contexts to meet commitments. Motivated
by global actions, national policies create real
change in local communities.

• Implementing the Decent Work Agenda.
The Decent Work Agenda has four pillars
(box 5). The agenda and the human devel-
opment framework are mutually reinforcing.
Decent work enhances human development

• Employment creation and enterprise development.
This requires acknowledging that a principal route
out of poverty is jobs and that the economy needs
to generate opportunities for investment, entrepre-
neurship, job creation and sustainable livelihoods.
• Standards and rights at work. People need repre-
sentation opportunities to participate, to voice their
views in order to obtain rights and to earn respect.
The International Labour Organization’s normative
work is key for compliance and measuring progress.

• Social protection. Basic social protection, such as
health care and retirement security, is a founda-
tion for participating productively in society and the
economy.

• Governance and social dialogue. Social dialogue
among governments, workers and employers can
resolve important economic and social issues, en-
courage good governance, establish sound labour
relations and boost economic and social progress.

Overview | 23

The notion of human
development is
still relevant for
development discourse
—even more so
in today’s world

through each of its pillars. Employment cre-
ation and enterprise development provide
income and livelihoods to people, are cru-
cial instruments for equity, are a means for
participation and facilitate self-esteem and
dignity. Workers’ rights support human de-
velopment by ensuring human rights, human
freedom and labour standards. Social pro-
tection contributes to human development
by ensuring safety nets, protecting people
from risks and vulnerabilities and provid-
ing care work. And social dialogue helps
human development through broad-based

participation, empowerment and social
cohesion.
Conversely, human development contrib-
utes to the four pillars. Expanding capabilities
through human development enhances oppor-
tunities for employment and entrepreneurship.
The participation aspect of human develop-
ment helps enrich social dialogue. Human
development also emphasizes the promotion of
human rights, which boosts workers’ rights and
enhances human security. Given all these inter-
links, implementing the Decent Work Agenda
will help work enhance human development.

The world has changed
dramatically, but the concept of
human development remains as
relevant as ever — if not more so

The world today is very different from the
world in 1990, when the notion of human
development and its measures to assess human
well-being were launched. Since then, the de-
velopment canvas has changed, global growth
centres have shifted, important demographic
transitions have materialized and a fresh wave
of development challenges has emerged.

The global economy is changing. The
influence of emerging economies is rising.
Developed economies’ share of global GDP
(based on purchasing power parity dollars) fell
from 54 percent in 2004 to 43 percent in 2014.
Politically, the desire for freedom and voice has
swept different parts of the world. The digital
revolution has changed the ways we think and
operate. Inequalities have gone up. Human
security has become more fragile. And climate
change is affecting more human lives.

So, is the notion of human development still
relevant for development discourse and as a
measure of human well-being? Yes — even more
so in today’s world.

Even with all the economic and techno-
logical advancements at the world’s disposal,
people do not have equitable benefits from pro-
gress, human capabilities and opportunities do
not always flourish, human security is at stake,
human rights and freedoms are not always pro-
tected, gender inequalities remain a challenge,

and future generations’ choices do not get the
attention they deserve. So the notion of human
development — enlarging choices, emphasizing
a long, healthy and creative life and high-
lighting the need for expanding capabilities
and creating opportunities — assumes a new
importance as a development framework, with
people at the centre of development.

Similarly, as a measure of human well-be-
ing, the human development framework still
provides perhaps the broadest perspective
of human progress, while contributing to
policymaking.

Yet after a quarter of a century, the time has
come to revisit both aspects — the notion and
the measures.

The notion and measures of
human development should be
reviewed to make them more
relevant for today’s challenges
and tomorrow’s world

The conceptual angle of human development
requires a fresh look for dealing with emerging
challenges in a fast-changing world, especially
in dialogue with the new 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development and the Sustainable
Development Goals.

The basic focus should be kept intact. But
issues such as individual and collective choices,
their probable trade-offs in conflicting situ-
ations, hierarchies among such choices and
the balance between choices of present and

24 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

future generations need to be looked after.
Similarly, issues of human development in
relation to shocks and vulnerabilities and the
relationships among human development,
human rights and human security will have to
be revisited.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Develop-
ment and the Sustainable Development Goals
require fresh assessment tools for monitoring
progress — measuring environmental sustaina-
bility and integrating it with overall measures
for human well-being are priorities.

Three other challenges stand out. First, meas-
ures and indicators have to be identified that
allow policy impacts to be more quickly cap-
tured. Second, measures are often inadequate
for assessing human well-being at times of
shocks and crises and should thus be revamped
to fill this need. Third, “quick guidance” policy
measures should be explored.

All these efforts require robust, consistent
and credible data. Taking that into account
and also considering a much more ambitious
international agenda, the High Level Panel on
the Post-2015 Agenda convened by the UN
Secretary-General in 2014 called for a data
revolution. It emphasized the need to monitor
progress. Three issues need highlighting:
• First, huge amounts of real-time data can
provide better information on, say, the
attendance of students at school. Sensors,

satellites and other tools produce real-time
data on people’s activities. These can be har-
nessed to inform policymaking.

• Second, big data holds the promise of pro-
ducing statistics almost instantaneously and
allowing disaggregation to levels of detail
hitherto undreamt of outside population
censuses. Such data are expanding the un-
derstanding of causation in an increasingly
complex world and enabling rapid responses
in some humanitarian situations. But the
data have risks — they could do harm where
privacy and anonymity are not respected.
Still, many researchers are identifying how
this large volume of information — generated
both incidentally and deliberately as billions
of people go about their daily lives — can
support sustainability and provide usable
insights for improving lives.

• Third, it is possible to combine traditional
and new methods of data collection for cen-
suses, ranging from administrative registers
to mobile devices, geospatial information
systems and the Internet. Many countries
have already done this.
In this changed and changing world, with
a new development agenda and new develop-
ment goals, the need for revisiting the notion
and measures of human development is vital.
Next year’s Human Development Report, the
25th in the series, will be devoted to it.

In this changed and

Work and human development —
analytical links

The true aim of development is not only to boost incomes, but also to maximize human choices — by enhancing human
rights, freedoms, capabilities and opportunities and by enabling people to lead long, healthy and creative lives. Critical to
this process is work, central to human existence. Human beings prepare for work as children, engage in work as adults
and expect to retire from work in later life. Through the human lifecycle, quality of life is thus closely bound to the quality
of work.

From an economic perspective, work ena-
bles people to earn a livelihood and achieve
economic security. But from a human devel-
opment perspective, it also allows people to
enhance their capabilities by providing them
with acquired skills and knowledge. Income
from work helps workers achieve a better
standard of living and allows them to have
better access to health and education — critical
ingredients to enhancing capabilities. Work
also provides people with expanded opportu-
nities and choices in their economic and social
lives. It allows workers to participate fully in
society while affording them a sense of dignity
and worth. And work that involves caring for
others builds social cohesion and strengthens
bonds within families and communities. To
contribute to human development, work needs
to be productive, worthwhile and meaningful
— and to unleash human potential, creativity
and spirit.

Work also strengthens societies. By working
together, human beings not only increase ma-
terial well-being, they also accumulate a wide
body of knowledge that serves as the basis for
cultures and civilizations. In addition, work
should make societies fairer by providing
opportunities for poor people to strive for
a better living. When work is environmen-
tally friendly, the benefits extend through
generations. Work thus enhances human
development. Needless to say, by improving
human capabilities, opportunities and choices,
human development also contributes to work.
In short, work and human development are
synergistic and mutually reinforcing (see info-
graphic at the beginning of the chapter).

However, the link between work and human
development is not automatic. Work can be

tiring, boring, repetitive and dangerous. And
just as the right kind of work enhances human
development, so the wrong kind can be deeply
destructive. Around the world millions of
people, many of them still children, are forced
into exploitative labour. Some are trapped in
bonded labour that robs them of their rights
and dignity. Some work in hazardous con-
ditions deprived of labour rights and social
protection, spending their days in drudgery
that stifles their potential (see table A1.1 at the
end of the chapter). And while work should
create fairer societies, it can also be divisive if
vast differences in opportunities and rewards
perpetuate divisions and inequalities.

Work is broader than jobs

The notion of work is broader and deeper than
that of jobs or employment (box 1.1). Jobs
provide income and support human dignity,
participation and economic security. But the
jobs framework is restrictive. It fails to capture
many kinds of work that are more flexible and
open-ended, including care work, voluntary
work and creative expression, such as writing
or painting — all of which are important for
human development. Embracing these other
dimensions requires a broader notion of work
(figure 1.1).

Seen in this way, work is very diverse. It can
be paid or unpaid, formal or informal, and
carried out within households or outside (see
table A1.2 at the end of the chapter). And it
can take place in very different circumstances,
pleasant or unpleasant, offering a wide range
of rights and opportunities, all reflecting
different contexts and levels of development.

BOX 1.1

What is work?

For this report, work is any activity that not only leads
to the production and consumption of goods or ser-
vices, but also goes beyond production for economic
value. Work thus includes activities that may result in
broader human well-being, both for the present and for
the future.

Work involves four sets of people: workers them-
selves; other entities such as employers who provide
complementary inputs; consumers of the goods or
services produced; and the rest of the world, which en-
compasses other people, society and the natural envi-
ronment as well as future generations and the workers’
future selves. Work has both monetary and nonmone-
tary returns, tangible and intangible, with expressed
and unintended consequences.

Consider someone who is cooking. If cooking for
himself, the cost as a producer is the opportunity cost of
his time, which could have been spent doing something
else; the return to him as a consumer is the nutrition
from the meal. No other actors are involved, though
there could be an impact on the environment. Now con-
sider an individual cooking for his family. In this case
the list of consumers grows. The tangible returns now
include family nutrition, combined with the intangible

The quality of work is as important as the
quantity.

Care work (discussed in chapter 4) is funda-
mentally important to human development.
Care work includes housework, such as prepar-
ing meals for the family, cleaning the house and
gathering water and fuel, as well as work caring
for groups who cannot care for themselves —
children, older people and family members who
are sick — over both the short and long term.

Voluntary work has been defined as unpaid
noncompulsory work — that is, the discretionary
free time individuals give without pay to activi-
ties performed either through an organization or
directly for others outside their own household.
Voluntary work is by definition an expression
of free choice, intrinsically enhancing human
development from the individual perspective.

Creative expression contributes new ideas to
society in works of art and cultural products,
functional creations, scientific interventions
and technological innovations. Creative work
is desirable to many individuals because it

feeling of satisfaction along with their approbation — or
feeling of frustration at being expected to perform the
task or to forgo other activities such as earning money,
pursuing education or participating in public life. Work,
from a human development perspective, is about the
degree of freedom individuals have in making choices
about the work they do.

However, if a domestic helper does the cooking, the
situation changes. In this case there is a financial return
to the worker, with the family not only acting as con-
sumers, but also providing the complementary inputs.
This activity may be differently remunerated depending
on whether it is performed by a man or woman, a citizen
or an immigrant. An individual who is coerced into per-
forming the activity or who receives lower returns than
those available to another is being exploited.

This approach to work can also be applied to cre-
ative workers and volunteers. For example, in a restau-
rant a chef may pursue creativity in addition to income
and experience professional satisfaction, self-esteem
and dignity. Similarly, a volunteer at a community
kitchen is not working for money but may be working for
altruistic satisfaction.

affords them the opportunity to be innovative
and self-expressive while striving to earn a liv-
ing. Although creative work can be improvisa-
tional and derivative, it involves originality and
uniqueness.

Work in different stages
of the lifecycle

Periods in a lifecycle are demographically, phys-
ically and culturally dependent and change over
time. There are overlaps between the different
stages, and the stages may vary among indi-
viduals. Work needs to be seen in the context
of a human lifecycle and how it changes in
different stages of that cycle. In many cases it is
not a question of choice; decisions triggered by
cultural expectations or absence of appropriate
support force people to be in different work
situations. Thus early marriage for girls or cuts
in state-provided child care may result in pull-
ing girls out of school — with lifelong effects on

their ability to enter the labour market, earn
a decent income and become economically
empowered. Work is a source of, as well as a re-
sponse to, risk and vulnerability, which people
experience differently over the course of their
lives.

At the prime working age, a worker’s priority
may be maximizing the economic returns of
work over other things — not only to provide
for present needs, but also to save for future
requirements. But under other conditions
people (including older workers and many
young workers) may wish to move to areas of
work where the economic returns are not very
high but where they feel happier and content
in their work. At the same time, young people
may be constrained in their work options.
With youth unemployment rising, options

beyond low-wage, unsecure livelihoods may
be scarce for many. There are similar risks and
vulnerabilities for older workers, particularly in
developing countries, where paid work remains
a necessity in old age but work choices may be
constrained.

People are living longer and healthier lives in
most countries, which expands the productive
potential of older workers. But there are trade-
offs for individuals who may wish to have more
control of their time, for discretionary leisure
or for different types of paid and unpaid work
activities. The right age to make the transition is
probably not the same for every worker, which
complicates policy decisions about increasing
the retirement age.

Strong forces on the work choices of older
people come from national pension policies

work and human
development goes

and programmes. From a global perspective,
workers from countries with low pension cov-
erage tend to stay in the labour market after
age 65, while workers from countries with high
pension coverage tend to retire earlier (figure
1.2). This has clear impacts on how people
make work decisions and has deep human
development implications. People with low
pension coverage or low pensions — a typical
condition in most developing countries — are
forced to remain in paid employment longer.
In contrast, people with access to pensions
with substantial benefits — typical in developed
countries — tend to retire earlier or move to-
wards work that may not maximize economic
returns but may offer other rewards.

In Sri Lanka most workers in the formal
sector retire in their 60s, and a relatively small
fraction are employed part- or full-time. But
casual workers and self-employed workers tend
to keep their full-time jobs for many more
years. Formality is thus a strong determinant of
the length of the working lifetime.1

In a world where life expectancy is increasing
and technology enables an active place in socie-
ty for far longer, many older people are seeking
active engagement in work — sometimes paid,
sometime voluntary. Many countries are re-
sponding with initiatives to keep older people

engaged in work without blocking the oppor-
tunities of others — particularly younger people
(see chapters 3 and 6).

Work enhances human
development

Human development is a process of enlarging
people’s choices, so it is closely bound with
work. The positive relationship between work
and human development goes both ways (fig-
ure 1.3). Human development is affected by
work through many channels, all of which can
be mutually reinforcing:
• Income and livelihood. People work primari-
ly to achieve a decent standard of living. In
market-based economies they generally do so
through wage or self-employment. In more
traditional and subsistence economies they
sustain their livelihoods through specific
cycles of activities. Work can also be a major
factor in ensuring that economic growth is
equitable and poverty-reducing.

• Security. Through work people can build a
secure basis for their lives, enabling them
to make long-term decisions and establish
priorities and choices. They can also sustain
stable households, particularly if they use

their income prudently on food and nutri-
tion for their family, on education and health
for their children, or for savings.

• Women’s empowerment. Women who earn
income from work often achieve greater eco-
nomic autonomy and decisionmaking power
within families, workplaces and communi-
ties. They also gain confidence, security and
flexibility.

• Participation and voice. By interacting with
others through work, people learn to partic-
ipate in collective decisionmaking and gain
a voice. Workers also encounter new ideas
and information and interact with people of
different backgrounds and can engage more
extensively in civic issues.

• Dignity and recognition. Good work is rec-
ognized by co-workers, peers and others and
provides a sense of accomplishment, self-re-
spect and social identity. People have histor-
ically defined and named themselves by their
occupation: Miller in English or Hurudza
(master farmer) in Shona.

• Creativity and innovation. Work unleashes
human creativity and has generated count-
less innovations that have revolutionized
many aspects of human life — as in health,

education, communications and environ-
mental sustainability.
Workers can also benefit from higher human
development, again operating through multiple
channels:
• Health. Healthier workers have longer and
more productive working lives and can ex-
plore more options at home and abroad.

• Knowledge and skills. Better educated and
trained workers can do more diverse work
— and to a higher standard — and be more
creative and innovative.

• Awareness. Workers who can participate
more fully in their communities will be able
to negotiate at work for better conditions
and higher labour standards, which in turn
will make industries more efficient and
competitive.
In the work–human development nexus vol-
unteerism, as well as creativity and innovation,
warrants particular attention.

Volunteerism, by its nature, reflects agency
and the capability to choose. Volunteers ben-
efit from their work, either because they value
altruism or through the personal enrichment
they gain from community involvement.
Volunteer work also tends to have substantial

Volunteerism, by its

The quality of work
is as important
as its quantity

social value. Participation in volunteer activ-
ities can enable people to contribute to their
communities and the public good in ways that
markets or public institutions may not.

Volunteers can be great innovators, forging
the way towards new ways of working and
organizing workers, paid and unpaid. Wangari
Maathai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in
2004, mobilized grassroots movements to
promote sustainable development, democra-
cy, women’s rights and peace. Her legacy has
been influential in preparing the Post-2015
Development Agenda.

Volunteer organizations can create bridges
between political, geographical and cultural re-
alities and can coordinate international efforts
and solidarity to pursue humanitarian causes.
Among others, the International Committee
of the Red Cross, devoted to protecting human
life and health, has been awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize three times: in 1917, 1944 and
1963. Similarly, Médecins Sans Frontières,
which won the prize in 1999, mobilizes doc-
tors and nurses to address health emergencies
around the globe.2 UN Volunteers encourages
the integration of volunteerism into develop-
ment and peace processes in developing coun-
tries, partnering with governments and other
local and international bodies. In all these ways
volunteerism promotes cross-cutting approach-
es for human development.

Creative work is equally important for ex-
panding people’s capabilities and enhancing
their opportunities. There are instrumental
contributions, which result in direct econom-
ic gain, and noninstrumental contributions,
which enhance knowledge and expand social
cohesion. These contributions are not static;
they interact with each other to enlarge human
choices and empower people.3

Creative work is not only self-satisfying
to the worker but can also extend happiness,
pleasure, satisfaction and well-being to others,
making it an important public good. Artwork
from ancient civilizations continues to func-
tion as a foundation for new knowledge.
Works of past musicians continue to inspire
new music. Creative work can build bridges of
social welfare and cohesion. And this welfare
can also extend across international borders,
linked by creativity in cultural tourism, for
example.

Given the centrality of creativity and innova-
tion in the world of work, attention is shifting
to types of workplaces and working conditions
that may be more conducive to innovation
than others. Recognizing that agency is a key
factor in worker engagement and creativity,
some companies have set aside time for workers
to be creative. Since as early as 1948, 3M has
had a 15 percent rule that allows employees to
dedicate almost a full day each week to their
own projects. One outcome of this approach
was the invention of the Post-it.4 More recently,
Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and Apple im-
plemented different versions of a 20 percent
rule for engineers to explore areas of their own
interest to spark creative thinking.5

The link between work
and human development
is not automatic

The foregoing links between work and human
development are not automatic. They are sub-
ject to various conditions, ranging from the
quality of work for individuals to the societal
value of work. The link can vary depending on
the scale of opportunities for workers’ voice
and participation and whether discrimination
or even violence is common at work.

Quality of work

Whether people have jobs is important, but so
are the nature and conditions of their work. For
example: Is work safe? Are people fulfilled and
satisfied by their work? Does their work provide
a secure livelihood? Are there opportunities
for training, social dialogue and progression?
Does employment support a flexible work–life
balance? These are standard questions for what
makes a job a good job. From a human devel-
opment perspective, the quality of work also
depends on whether a job provides dignity
and a sense of pride and whether it facilitates
participation and interaction. Does it present a
platform for voice, and does it respect workers’
rights and human rights more widely?

Of course, what constitutes the quality of
work can vary subjectively by country, personal
circumstances and frame of reference — a reality
that complicates quality of work measurement

34 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

at the global level. Even if a universal definition
of work quality were agreed on, comparable
cross-national datasets would probably be lim-
ited. Despite these challenges, several initiatives
are in place to put forward regionally — and in
some cases, globally — comparable measures of
job quality, including composite indicators that
capture multiple dimensions of work quality
(box 1.2).

While work is generally beneficial for people,
the quality of work can be affected by doing
too much work. A culture of overwork is in-
creasingly common, facilitated by all kinds of
mobile devices that enable constant access to
work. The pressure of a round-the-clock work
culture is particularly acute in highly skilled,
highly paid professional service jobs such as
law, finance, consulting and accounting.6 The
overwork culture can lock gender inequality
in place, because work–family balance is made
more difficult for women, who bear a dispro-
portionate share of care work.

Among Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development countries, the
highest prevalence of overwork — defined as a
work week of 50 hours or more — is in Turkey

(close to 41 percent of the formal workforce),
followed by Mexico (nearly 29 percent).7
Pressure for overwork is also high in some
Asian countries. In Japan the term karoshi
means death from overwork.

Working very long hours can cause death due
to stroke, heart attack, cerebral haemorrhage or
other sudden causes.8 Even from an economic
perspective, overwork is generally counterpro-
ductive, as it undermines labour productivity.
Shorter and flexible working hours may be
beneficial from both a human development
perspective and an economic perspective.

Workers’ satisfaction and happiness

Workers’ satisfaction and happiness are critical
elements in ensuring a stronger link between
work and human development. But the work–
satisfaction–happiness nexus is not simple and
straightforward.

Yes, being out of work reduces happiness. For
example, in the United Kingdom the relation-
ship between unemployment and lower subjec-
tive well-being is well established across a range
of measures, including lower life satisfaction,

BOX 1.2

Measures of quality of work

At the regional level the European Council proposed a
portfolio of 18 statistical indicators in 2011 to measure
job quality, and the European Trade Union Institute devel-
oped the Quality of Jobs Index in 2008.1 Eurofound has
established the European Working Conditions Survey.2 A
dashboard of indicators has been proposed to measure
progress towards the International Labour Organization
decent work agenda.3 Each of these endeavours has
been challenged by intense debates among workers,
employers and governments on conceptualizing employ-
ment quality and agreeing on objectives. There are ques-
tions of different priorities for workers and employers,
as well as whether to focus on individual workers, the
regulatory environment or the nature of jobs.

Existing measures draw attention to the need for
policies to enhance the quality of employment, particu-
larly when trends in employment quality are depicted,
as in the case of the Eurofound reports. Noting that

simple indicators that summarize only a few variables
are typically most successful in conveying information
to policymakers, some entities (such as the United
Nations Economic Commission for Europe) have pro-
posed a global Quality of Employment Indicator, based
on dimensions including income, degree of formal-
ity, participation in social security systems, duration of
contracts and availability of training.4 While composite
measures like this inevitably leave out some dimen-
sions of work quality, they can convey the urgency of
employment-quality issues to policymakers and be used
to advocate for more systematic data collection on el-
ements of work quality. At the same time, additional
steps can be taken — as has been done by the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce through the employment
quality index it has constructed — to identify, assess and
diagnose the causes of poor job quality, which can vary
by national, local and even workplace context.5

Workers’ satisfaction
and happiness are
critical elements in
ensuring a stronger
link between work and
human development

Chapter 1 Work and human development—analytical links | 35

Today, traditional
forms of worker
organizations like trade
unions are weak

lower happiness and increased anxiety.9 In
the United States the nonincome impacts of
unemployment have been estimated to be five
times greater than the income impact.10 The
unhappiness of becoming unemployed is not
something that people adjust to quickly, if at
all. In Germany life satisfaction declines sharply
on losing a job, and there is little evidence of
any improvement among men even after three
or more years of unemployment.11 So un-
employment is miserable, and work is satisfy-
ing. But is it merely having a job or some other
aspect of work that matters in terms of human
happiness (box 1.3)?

Voice and participation

Unions, political parties, women’s groups
and other collective entities have long pro-
vided workers with a means for voice and
participation — critical for value and quality of
work. Through these platforms, workers have
formed shared values and collective interests
and pursued them. This has resulted in real
gains, even in the face of powerful opposition,
as for example, in the 1980s in Brazil when
workers gained better rights and wages and in
South Africa when movements helped legalize
Black trade unions.12 Through such processes,
workers have substantially strengthened the
link between work and human development,
including protections against health hazards

BOX 1.3

at work, higher compensation and social
insurance.

Over recent decades the potential for
strong worker negotiating power has steadily
atrophied — because of globalization, which
pits workers in different countries against each
other; because of technological innovations,
which have atomized the workforce; and be-
cause of new working patterns, which include
more short-term work that blurs the lines
between formal and informal work. It is now
harder for workers to unite for mass action, to
some extent a desired management outcome.
Some employers have deliberately shaped inno-
vation so as to weaken labour power, using new
technologies to monitor workers more closely
and reduce their scope for controlling their
work environment.

Today, traditional forms of worker organiza-
tions like trade unions are weak and represent
fewer members than in the past. Looking at
union members as a percentage of employees,
variations across countries are considerable.
While such membership is quite strong in
Argentina, Kenya and South Africa (more than
30 percent), it is very low in Niger and Uganda
(less than 5 percent).13 But even this measure
may overestimate the real influence of trade un-
ions in the workforce, as a high proportion of
workers in many countries are self-employed or
not in the formal economy and may not be cap-
tured in the measures of union participation.

What brings happiness — having a job or something beyond it?

What do we know about the ways in which work —
beyond having a job — promotes happiness? Some types
of work appear to be associated with happiness more
than others, and the income gained through work is not
the only thing that matters. One study of the relation-
ship between different occupations and life satisfaction
found a wide variation in satisfaction that did not direct-
ly correlate with income, with members of the clergy
the most satisfied, followed closely by chief executives
and senior officials and agricultural managers. The least
satisfied were those working as bar managers, in low-
skill construction jobs or as debt collectors.1

Much remains to be learned about the causes of
happiness at work, although some factors are increas-
ingly well accepted. For example, the relationship with
one’s manager is important. Indeed, trust in the work-
place generally seems to be an important factor. In
Canada a one-third standard-deviation increase in trust
in management did as much for happiness as an income
increase of 31 percent. Job fit — having an opportunity
at work to do what one does best — is also important for
subjective well-being. Better job fit has been associated
with higher life evaluations and better daily experiences
in all seven regions of the world.2

Work has a value for
society as a whole

The weakness or underdevelopment of worker
organizations can be detrimental to human de-
velopment, impeding the functioning of labour
and social institutions as a whole.14

There have been international efforts to sup-
port workers in addressing some of these chal-
lenges. For example, the International Trade
Union Confederation and the International
Domestic Workers Federation are working on
uniting global workers.

Sustainable work

To strengthen the link with human develop-
ment, work has to be sustainable. Sustainable
work is defined as work that promotes human
development while reducing or eliminating
negative externalities that can be experienced
over different geographic and time scales. It is
not only critical for sustaining the planet, but
also for ensuring work for future generations.

Sustainable work is not just about paid work
(as argued in chapter 5); it also encompasses
the often impactful efforts of caregivers, vol-
unteers, artists, advocates and others, which
have positive impacts on human development.
Furthermore, sustainable work concentrates
on activities that can achieve the dual mutual
goal of high sustainability and high human
development.

To forge a stronger link with human devel-
opment, sustainable work has to follow three
pathways, as detailed in chapter 5: the termina-
tion and transformation of some existing forms
of work, and the creation of new forms of work.

Societal value of work

Work strengthens the work–human develop-
ment link when it goes beyond individual ben-
efits and contributes to shared social objectives.
Work that boosts income and lowers poverty re-
duces inequality and can relieve social tension,
while money earned from work can be taxed
to generate resources for human development.
Work that involves caring for older people or
people with disabilities helps maintain their
capabilities and strengthens social cohesion,
while child care builds capacities for future
generations. Workers also establish social and
economic ties and build trust in others and in
institutions, which also builds social cohesion.

Creative work is valuable to a society by con-
tributing to its tradition, culture and heritage.
Similarly, volunteering provides a means to
build social relationships and networks outside
paid employment and can contribute to the
social good. One survey in Australia found that
for 83 percent of volunteers, their contribu-
tions had increased their sense of belonging to
their communities.15

Work thus has a value for society as a whole.
Often individual and societal values of work
converge, as environment-friendly work bene-
fits not only workers, but also other people, in-
cluding future generations. But sometimes they
diverge — for example, the work of poachers
generates income for individuals but is detri-
mental to society.

Discrimination and violence at work

Sometimes, the value of work is diminished
and its links with human development become
weaker because of discrimination and violence
at work. The most observable discrimination
is along gender lines — in positions, pay and
treatment (chapter 4). But discrimination also
occurs on grounds of ethnicity, race, disability
and sexual orientation.

In the United States racial discrimination is
the most frequently reported form of discrim-
ination at work, accounting for 35 percent of
charges presented to the United States Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.16
In the United Kingdom 22 percent of poll
respondents had witnessed racism in the
workplace, and 34 percent of Black people and
29 percent of Asian people reported first-hand
experience of racial or religious discrimination
at work.17 In Hungary 64 percent of migrant
respondents to a survey reported discrimination
when looking for a job, and wages paid to Roma
are lower than the Hungarian minimum wage.18
The consequences of discrimination in
developed countries (where employment is
predominantly formal) are lower labour force
participation, higher unemployment and a
considerable wage gap between marginalized
groups and the rest of the population. Two
layers of discrimination influence these gaps in
outcome: uneven access to a good education
and prejudice when accessing jobs and promo-
tions in the workplace.

Chapter 1 Work and human development—analytical links | 37

Work discrimination
against people
with disabilities is
also common

In developing countries discrimination is of-
ten against indigenous ethnic groups.19 Labour
outcomes of disadvantaged ethnic groups
reflect different forms of inequality, restricted
opportunities and discrimination throughout
the lifecycle. Unlike in developed countries,
labour participation tends to be higher for
these disadvantaged groups because of a high
reliance on self-employment and informality,
which in turn results in high vulnerability and
limited social protection. For example, in Latin
America the wage gap between indigenous
ethnic groups and the rest of the population is
estimated at 38 percent, with more than 10 per-
cent typically remaining unexplained.20

Work discrimination against people with
disabilities is also common. More than 1 bil-
lion people — one person in seven — have some
form of disability.21 Most people with disabil-
ities cannot make full use of their capabilities.
Discrimination starts as early as in school. In
developing countries students with special
needs rarely have access to rehabilitation educa-
tion or training, and later they are less likely to
find work. In both low- and high-income coun-
tries, their employment rates are typically lower
than those of workers without disabilities (ta-
ble 1.1). Access to labour markets is even more
difficult for women with disabilities. Thus in
low-income countries the employment rate for
women with disabilities is about one-third that
of men with disabilities, and in high-income
countries, it is a little more than a half.

Also facing discrimination in the workplace
are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, queer
and intersex people. Only a few countries
have laws to protect them, and those laws are
often poorly enforced. Research in Argentina,
Hungary, South Africa and Thailand finds
that many face discrimination and harassment
in the workplace and that the discrimination

TABLE 1.1

often begins in school. In Thailand discrimina-
tion occurs at all stages in the employment pro-
cess, including education and training, access
to jobs, advancement in opportunities, social
security and partner benefits.22 Participation of
transgendered workers in the workforce is often
limited to a few professions such as beauticians
and entertainers.

Workplace or occupational violence — in the
form of threats and physical or verbal abuse — is
also a concern for many workers. The numbers
are startling. In 2009, 572,000 occurrences
of nonfatal workplace violence — including
various forms of assault — were reported in the
United States, and 521 individuals were victims
of homicide in the workplace.23 Some 80 per-
cent of survey respondents in South Africa
reported that they had suffered from hostil-
ity at work (bullying in all its forms) at some
point.24 In 2009 some 30 million EU workers
experienced work-related violence (such as
harassment, intimidation, bullying or physical
violence) — 10 million in the workplace and
20 million outside the workplace. The violence
takes a direct toll on physical and emotional
health, leading to greater absenteeism.25

Work in conflict and
post-conflict situations

Some 1.5 billion people, or one in four people
on the planet, live in fragile or conflict-afflicted
countries.26 Conflict situations range from high
criminal violence to civil wars to other forms of
internal conflict. Work in these situations and the
work–human development link take on different
dimensions in such exceptional states of emergen-
cy. With increasing degrees of violence, human
priorities change in the sense that survival and
physical integrity of the self and family members
become higher priorities than economic needs.

Violent conflicts
have many complex
effects on work

The links between conflict and work are mu-
tually reinforcing. Work can help with peace
building, and unemployment, when overlap-
ping with other social discontent, can be dest-
abilizing. When people are unemployed, they
may be more susceptible to participation in vio-
lent activities. In extreme cases and in unstable
environments this may boost recruitment by
insurgents, thus increasing the risk of civil war.
Unemployment and the discontent and griev-
ances it stirs — as well as reduced opportunity
cost of violence — may be considerable.

Violent conflicts have many complex effects
on work. Conflicts not only lead to suffering
and death; they also destroy livelihoods. As
a result of violence and looting, people lose
property, land and businesses. They also find
it difficult to work when they are displaced,
especially to neighbouring regions or countries
where natural and other resources are already
scarce. This not only leads to immediate pov-
erty, but also reduces the prospects for recovery
— particularly if the conflict is exacerbated, for
example, by the proliferation of small arms,
cattle raiding and militia activities. When
violent conflict severs major infrastructural ar-
teries, destroys power plants and fuel facilities
and starves industries of foreign exchange for
imported inputs, work in manufacturing, man-
ufacturing-related services, tourism and some
agriculture can decline.

Violent conflict can and often does unleash
mechanisms of “primitive accumulation”:
the use of extra-economic or noneconomic
coercion to wrest assets from their owners or
occupiers (for example, through forced dis-
placement and wartime land accumulation)
and to force people to join wage labour markets
for their survival.

The redistribution of work opportuni-
ties and of workers during conflict is not
restricted to national boundaries. Regional
conflict complexes, as they have been called,
often generate complicated labour markets
and frequently abusive labour relations and
working conditions across borders, helping
create displacement economies. Many refugee
women during the Mozambican war ended up
working as illegal — and cheap — workers on
globally competitive agro-business farms in
South Africa during the late 1980s and early
1990s. Ugandan rural labour markets contain

many people with Congolese or Rwandan
conflict-related origins, and they may expe-
rience discrimination in hiring practices and
treatment.

The effect of conflicts on work varies across
groups. For example, young people may have
fewer opportunities for productive work, leav-
ing them more vulnerable to recruitment by
gangs, rebels or terrorist groups. Even after con-
flicts end, young people are the ex-combatants
most likely to be out of work.

Conflicts can also add to the workload for
women. If men are absent due to fighting,
women face even greater paid and unpaid
work responsibilities at home. But women may
also be actively involved in conflicts. In Sudan
women and girls were on the front lines of the
two north–south civil wars as both combatants
and peace activists.27

Women are crucial in the work of peace
making and conflict prevention, including
peace talks, conflict mediation and all aspects
of post-conflict resolution. This is widely
recognized in the UN Security Council
Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and
Security, adopted in October 2000. The reso-
lution also acknowledges the dramatic impact
violent conflicts have on women and urges
governments to increase the participation of
women in peace and security efforts.28 Actions
to implement the resolution have already been
planned and implemented by some 25 coun-
tries, from Liberia to Norway, from Nepal to
the Philippines.29

Even so, few women have been present
in peace negotiations, amid 39 active con-
flicts over the past 10 years, and only a small
proportion of peace treaties contains direct
references to women (16 percent of 585 peace
treaties).30 And a study of 31 major peace
processes between 1992 and 2011 revealed
that only 9 percent of the peace negotiators
were women.31 Women’s participation in the
peace process is not just a matter of morality
or equality, but one of efficiency. If women
are not part of the peace process globally, half
the world’s potential for building peace is lost.

Building peace, restoring hope: women’s role in nation building

Just like women’s invisible work in the household, women’s work in com-
munity building and conflict resolution, which has significant human devel-
opment implications, often goes unacknowledged.

Women’s peace-making efforts are not a strange phenomenon; they
have been happening since the outbreak of violence and wars at the end
of the cold war. From Bosnia and Herzegovina to Liberia, Burundi to Sierra
Leone, Congo to Uganda women have been mobilizing at the local level to
effect change, including during and after civil wars. In fact, I can unequivo-
cally state that women’s active engagement in ending wars and all types of
violence is critical. The only sad fact is that policymakers at the global and
national levels are too slow to embrace this reality.

My own experience began with the civil war that ravaged Liberia for
almost two decades. There I saw how war can strip a whole society of its
humanity, its deference for life and the respect for the rights and dignity of
persons. How war can tear the fabric of society, break down the norms that
keep in check the terror that comes from man’s ego. There I lived the rule by
man, and all its diabolical manifestations.

It was in this vacuum of order, of rights, of civility that the women of
Liberia stood up to reclaim the soul of our country, of our society. Thousands
of women across Liberia, under the banner of the Liberia Mass Action for
Peace, risked their safety to protest against the war, against the despicable
acts perpetrated in the name of war.

But this story is not unique to Liberia. It reverberates in most war-af-
fected societies. About a year ago, when I had the opportunity to travel to
three provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I saw that the sto-
ry of women mobilizing for peace was the same. I met the same category of
women that were part of the Liberian peace movement — the context is dif-
ferent, but the characters are the same; the virtues, qualities and principles
they bring to their work are the same. The women of these communities are

also stepping up and responding to their sisters’ need for counselling and
humanitarian assistance and their community’s need for peace. Women in
Nigeria are also persistently protesting for the 200 Chibok girls that are still
missing. The stories of women’s struggle for peace, for human rights and
for justice are consistent.

When the wars end, women’s role in recovery and peace building dimin-
ishes. Patriarchy steps in and forgets about the efforts of women. In no time
patriarchy lays the foundation for the next war, for the next institutionalized
violations of the rights of women, children and the vulnerable. This has re-
mained the tragic tale. This is the story that women must begin to tackle — to
insist on a place in the rebuilding of the polity, the economy and the state that
is created after wars. In many communities post-conflict reconstruction fails to
take women’s unique needs and concerns into consideration, leaving women
who had already borne the brunt of these conflicts to further impoverishment.
To address this situation, in many communities women are also mo-
bilizing and forming cooperatives for farming and other enterprises as a
means of providing for them and their wards through their work. This is
fundamental to sustaining human rights, consolidating gains for peace.

The hope for this new agenda in women’s search for human rights and
peace is strong. This is evident from the growing number of women who
are assuming leadership roles in public offices; more women’s voices are
heard against the violations against them and their children thanks to new
platforms made possible through technology.

I strongly believe that it is time for the world and global bodies to rec-
ognize the critical role that women can and are playing in conflict resolution
and community building. While recognition is important, I believe engaging
women’s expertise is also crucial to finding solutions to global conflicts. If
we must reverse the tidal waves of conflict and insecurity globally, I believe
we urgently need all hands on deck to accomplish the task.

Work that damages
human development

Most people work for their livelihoods. They
also work to give their life greater value and
meaning, but not all work achieves this.
Many people are in work that restricts their
life choices. Millions work under abusive and
exploitative conditions that violate their basic
human rights and destroy their dignity, such
as child labourers, forced labourers and traf-
ficked workers (figure 1.4). Such corrosive and

exploitative activities shatter human develop-
ment. And millions of domestic, migrant, sex
and hazardous-industry workers make their
living in ways that are dangerous, also eroding
their well-being.

Child labour

In most societies children help their families
through work in ways that are neither harmful
nor exploitative. But child labour deprives
children of their childhood, their potential and

40 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

their dignity — and can be mentally, physically,
socially or morally harmful. It can also interfere
with education, forcing children to combine
school with excessively long and heavy work or
to leave school early or even to not attend. In
its most pernicious forms children are enslaved,
separated from their families, exposed to se-
rious hazards and illnesses or left to fend for
themselves on the streets of large cities, often at
a very early age.

The world has around 168 million child
labourers, almost 11 percent of the child pop-
ulation, some 100 million boys and 68 million
girls. Around half are engaged in hazardous
work. About 23 percent of child labour in
developing countries occurs in low-income
countries, with the largest numbers in Asia and
the Pacific. The highest prevalence is in Sub-
Saharan Africa, at one child in five.32

But there has been substantial progress,
partly reflecting efforts to ensure that children
attend school. Over 2000–2012 the number
of child labourers fell by 78 million, or almost
a third. Progress was greatest among younger
children and children in hazardous work. The
drop among girls was 40 percent, compared
with 25 percent among boys.33

The 2014 Nobel Peace Laureate Kailash
Satyarthi shares views and perspectives from
his lifelong work on child labour in a special
contribution (signed box).

Forced labour

Forced labour is one of the most detrimen-
tal types of work for human development,
destroying people’s choices and freedoms. It
includes work or services exacted from any
person under the menace of any penalty and
for which that person has not offered himself
or herself voluntarily. Exceptions are work re-
quired by compulsory military service, normal
civic obligations or a conviction in a court of
law, so long as the work or service is under the
supervision and control of a public authority.
Human trafficking broadly refers to recruiting
and transporting people for the purpose of ex-
ploitation.34 This typically involves entrapping
workers and moving them to another country
for sex work, domestic service or exploitative
work in agricultural sweatshops.

In 2012 about 21 million people worldwide
were in forced labour, trafficked for labour and
sexual exploitation or held in slavery-like con-
ditions; 14 million (68 percent) of them were
subject to labour exploitation and 4.5 million
(22 percent) to sexual exploitation. Private in-
dividuals and enterprises exploited 90 percent
of these people.35 Women and girls accounted
for a larger share than men and boys, and adults
accounted for a larger share than children
(figure 1.5). Forced labour is thought to have
generated around $150 billion a year in illegal
profits since 2006.36 The amount of profit is
highest in Asia and the Pacific and lowest in the
Middle East (figure 1.6). However, the profit
per victim is highest in developed economies
($34,800) and lowest in Africa ($3,900).37

The most extreme forced labour is slavery,
still prevalent in some parts of the world. A
more common working relationship close to
slavery is debt bondage. In some parts of the
world in times of scarcity, poor peasants and
indigenous people may accept wage advances
or small loans that steadily accumulate until
they are impossible to pay off, bringing them
into bondage with their landlord or employer.

SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION

Working towards the elimination of child labour

How has the world of child labour changed since you first got involved in
the field? What are some of the positive changes and some of the less
positive ones?

When I started in 1981, there was complete ignorance about this serious
problem. People easily ignored it with a common perception that they are
poor children, and they are working, nothing new in it. The notion of the
rights of children was not institutionalized, not even conceptualized yet.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted in 1989 and rolled
out in 1990.

Along with my colleagues, I raised the issue that they are not sim-
ply poor children and compelled to work, it is denial of their freedom in
childhood, denial of their dignity and their development for the future —
including education and health.

The first reaction was denial, from powerful sections including busi-
ness and governments. They did not want to touch this issue. It was not
well researched or well documented; there were no laws except for old
British laws. I found that the situation was the same in the rest of South
Asia as I started to work in Nepal and Pakistan. Eventually I realized that the
gross ignorance, neglect and denial was a global problem.

And then we moved to a situation of opposition, we approached the ju-
diciary, raised the issue in the media and also challenged business practices
of those who were using child slaves and trafficked children. Then there
was sharp opposition and violent reactions — two colleagues were killed,
and I was attacked several times.

Finally, ordinary people, citizens started to understand the problem,
that this was more than poverty and something that cannot be simplified
and ignored. There was a change in perception in all corners of society —
also the judiciary, which reacted quite positively and proactively in India
and other parts of the world as well. Then the trade unions also started
getting involved.

The perceptional change led to changed practices as well. In the past
15–17 years, child labour is down from 260 million to 168 million. But it
remains a serious problem. There is still a lack of global political will, which
is also reflected at the national level. National laws have been made, and
there is the International Labour Organization convention that was unani-
mously adopted by the international community in 1999. Since then it has
been ratified by 179 countries. Yet, concrete change at the country level is
still wanting, and a serious amount of political will is needed.

How do you see this political will developing? The path that you and your col-
leagues have taken forward in changing perceptions, do you see that continu-
ing to be the mode of engagements with national governments and partners?

the conventional charity work and evolved into critical policy partners and
found more space — for example, in UN discourses. I have been part of this,
involved deeply in two of the largest movements — Global Campaign for
Education and Global March against Child Labour. As far as more political
will is concerned, a more vibrant and dynamic civil society, a more engaged
and strong civil society can act as watchdogs and be critical policy partners
for governments.

The social mobilization is equally important, where the media has a

crucial role.

We also have to address the corporate sector directly, making them
more responsible, making them more accountable for the children. That will
also, in turn, help in creating much more political will. Corporations have
played a role in building political momentum against global warming and
ecological change, resulting in the growth of political will, and the same
can be done for child labour in particular, but also child rights in general.

You have touched on something that is very central to our discussions of how
the world of work is changing — there seems to be a power shift between
the various actors. You mentioned that there are good examples where the
corporate side has taken on issues such as global warming and ecological
changes. Are there similar examples in the field of child labour where cor-
porate endorsement has come in and supported the cause of child rights?

There has definitely been a significant paradigm shift, though we need
more concrete efforts and outcomes from them. For example, we led a
campaign in the mid- and late 1980s in the carpet industry in India, Nepal
and Pakistan. That led to the first ever social certification monitoring and
labelling mechanism in South Asia, known as GoodWeave (earlier known
as Rugmark). This was the first very concrete engagement of the corporate
world along with local producers, civil society organizations, nongovern-
mental organizations, some UN agencies and more importantly, consumer
organizations. This combination has led to remarkable results in the South
Asian carpet industry, with the number of child workers in the industry
down from 1 million to 200,000.

I was also personally engaged in a campaign against trafficking and
slavery in the cocoa industry, in Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire. We are also trying
to engage the corporate world in the garment industry.

Corporate engagement is vital. Ideally, we want to be more positive
and constructive, rather than ban or boycott any products or industries.
Corporate consciousness and the whole notion of corporate responsibil-
ity have to trickle down from the boardroom level to the workshop level,
through the supply chain. We are working on it.

Definitely. One of the biggest things that happened during the past 20–30
years was the emergence of a strong civil society. It has emerged from

That’s very encouraging for us to hear. Now, you have touched on what the
ordinary citizen or a common person can do in order to eradicate this issue.

generating pressure on the industries to ensure that they are much more
responsible and much more accountable.

Child labour is not an isolated problem and cannot be solved in isolation.
It is very directly connected with overall human development and with hu-
man rights. If the rights of human beings, families and communities are
not protected, children are not protected. Similarly, without sustainable and
inclusive development, child labour cannot be eradicated in isolation.

I have been emphasizing for over 30 years that poverty, child labour and
illiteracy form a kind of “vicious triangle.” They are the cause and conse-
quence of each other, and one cannot be solved without solving the others.
While 168 million children are in full-time jobs, millions of adults are job-
less. Many of these adults in developing countries are the very parents of
these child labourers. Children are preferred because they are the cheapest
— or even free, if bonded — labour. They are physically and mentally docile,
they do not form unions or go to court; so no challenge for the employer and
thus perpetuating this vicious cycle.

Child labour is also interconnected with health, education and poverty
eradication issues. I’m working to pose the agenda of the complete eradi-
cation of child labour, slavery and trafficking, as part of the Sustainable
Development Goals.

This is very important as we live in a world where children are not safe.
On the one hand, a lot of growth, a lot of development, a lot of legal pro-
tections are being talked about. On the other hand, the world is becoming
more and more difficult and unsafe, frightening for the children, for reasons
that include terrorism and intolerance. We are not able to assure a safer
future for our children, especially in developing countries. The violence is
increasing.

My strong belief is that violence and human development cannot coex-
ist. We have to put an end to violence to ensure human development. I am
very confident that until and unless we make a safer world for our children,
we cannot protect human rights. Protection of human rights, inclusive de-
velopment for society, as well as getting rid of violence are interconnected
issues, and we have to begin with our children.

People should raise their voices against all kinds of violence against
children. Denial of education is also a violation of children’s rights beside
child labour, child trafficking and the like. Ordinary people can get engaged
in many ways. One is to help in creating, spreading and deepening the
knowledge among their own peers and friends and relatives. Things are
happening around the world against children. Let us spread the knowledge
and create more consciousness and concern. Second, as responsible citi-
zens, one can definitely ask local politicians, parliament members and the
government to give more attention to the cause of children in both develop-
ing and developed countries, with a very strong notion that no problem in
the world is an isolated problem and no problem on the planet could be
solved in isolation. The solutions are interconnected, as are the problems.
Problems can begin in one part of the world, and other parts would suffer.

We have to think globally and after 9/11, and after knowing more about
global warming, one must know that we have to be united as global citizens
in solving the problem of child labour and illiteracy of children. As consum-
ers, one can demand that we buy only those products that are free of child
labour — from toys to sporting goods to aprons to shoes. This will help in

As citizens, as consumers, as someone who is really connected with
the social media, we can use that to raise voices on behalf of children.
Young people, especially those in universities and colleges, can gather in-
formation about child labour, and as responsible young people they can just
push some of the buttons on their smartphones and computers and can help
in raising awareness of the problem of child labour and violence against
children.

With the Sustainable Development Goals in the offing, what would be your
message for the international community, particularly for advancing the
rights of all children?

Even before the Millennium Development Goals, were rolled out, I was very
concerned about their place in the international agenda and organized a
number of meetings in the corridors of the UN. We tried to send a clear
message that we cannot attain many of the goals without ensuring the
abolition of child labour and violence against children — whether education
for all, poverty reduction through reducing unemployment, ecological issues
and health issues (85 million children are in hazardous employment). We
have seen some progress but also failures among these goals.

Now there is a campaign with like-minded organizations and trade

unions asking for:
• Strong language against child labour in the Sustainable Development

Goals, which has been introduced and should be retained.
• Strong language for education, which has also been included.
• Explicit language against child slavery and children in forced la-
bour, which does not exist right now. The number of child slaves did
not go down, in spite of the number of child labourers having gone
down, as I mentioned, from 260 million to 168 million. According to
the International Labour Organization, the number of children in forced
labour or, what we call, child slaves is still stagnant at 5.5 million. My
sense is that there are more.

The international community must realize that if we cannot protect
our children, we cannot protect our development. We have to end violence
against children.

When it comes to implementation, I have also been urging UN agencies
to work in much closer cooperation on children’s issues, because sometimes
we see a compartmentalized approach and compartmentalized reactions,
segmented by the respective agency mandates. One child gets fragmented
into different agencies. We have to be more strongly coordinated and be
more proactive, rather than just reacting to things that happen against
children.

How will your Nobel Peace Prize impact the most marginalized children
in terms of protection from violence, inclusion in education and improving
their health and human development?

My spontaneous reaction to the prize on the day the announcement was
made was that this is the first ever, the biggest ever recognition for the

most marginalized children on the planet. This is a prize for them; it just
went through me. That is why, personally, I feel much more morally respon-
sible now. This is a recognition that “peace” cannot be restored without the
safety of children and the protection of children. The prize has connected
peace and child rights at the highest levels of morality, peace and society.

Within three hours of the prize, the issue got more attention than in
past three decades! Now, we are able to interact and influence the political

debate, a little bit, at the highest level. I have been meeting a number of
prime ministers and presidents and have had very good meeting with the
UN Secretary-General and also with other UN agencies. The whole dis-
course, the whole debate has gone to the highest level, and it cannot be
put aside now. It is at a stage where the government and intergovernmental
agencies have to prioritize children because every single minute matters,
every single child matters, every single childhood matters.

A more recent variant of debt bondage has
arisen through international migration. To pay
for travel and secure work abroad, aspirant mi-
grants may have to borrow large amounts from
agents. The agents and employers can then
manipulate this credit to entrap workers. Other
people may be forced to work as a result of in-
carceration or physical or sexual violence. Thus
bonded work often happens when workers are
given wage advances and are then pushed deep-
er and deeper into debt they cannot pay off.

Trafficked workers

After arms and drug trafficking, human traf-
ficking is the most lucrative illicit business

worldwide. The majority of victims are women,
but men are also affected. For example, men
from Bolivia have been trafficked with their
families to Argentina to work in garment fac-
tories. Deprived of their passports, they have
been locked in factories and forced to work up
to 17 hours a day.38

Trafficking occurs on a large scale, but its
extent is difficult to assess. It can be tricky to
judge whether migration is voluntary or forced
and difficult to extract data specifically on
trafficking from data on other forms of illegal
migration and exploitation. And because the
activity is illegal, victims are unwilling to report
abuse for fear of being deported. There is also
a grey area between trafficking and smuggling.

Between 2007 and 2010 trafficked victims
of 136 nationalities were detected in 118
countries. Some 55–60 percent of the victims
were women.39 Most were trafficked for sexual
exploitation or for working as forced labour.
More than 60 percent of victims in Europe and
Central Asia and more than 50 percent in the
Americas were trafficked for sexual exploita-
tion, nearly half in Africa and the Middle East
and more than 45 percent in South Asia, East
Asia and the Pacific were trafficked for forced
labour (figure 1.7).

Workers at risk

While all workers may find themselves in abu-
sive situations, certain groups are particularly
vulnerable, including illegal migrant workers,
those in domestic service, sex workers and
those in hazardous industries.

of whom are women. With appropriate pro-
tections in place, domestic work can empower
people and help lift families out of poverty.
But exploitation is common in paid domestic
work, particularly for female migrant workers
in developing countries. In people’s homes
exploitation often remains outside the scope of
labour law. Employers use threats and coercion
to pay low or even no wages. They can force
domestic workers to work long hours — up to
18 hours a day without days off — limiting their
movements and potential for social interaction.
Working conditions are often poor, with little
food and no access to medical care. Domestic
workers may also be subject to physical or sex-
ual abuse.42 Even so, many domestic workers
feel obliged to remain with abusive employers
because they need to work to support their
own families.

Source: UNODC 2012.

Sex work

Migrant workers — illegal and legal

Among workers at risk of exploitation are
illegal migrants from other countries. They
often become the prey of human traffickers
and thus go through a risky and sometimes
life-threatening process to reach their destina-
tion. Trafficking of illegal migrants has recently
surged. Networks of traffickers take money
from aspiring migrants who try to cross ille-
gally into other countries. In 2014 some 3,500
people, maybe many more, lost their lives in
the Mediterranean Sea when trafficking boats
heading towards Europe, mainly from Libya,
capsized or sank.40

In many instances, legal migrant workers —
particularly low-skilled and low-paid ones —
are also subjected to rights violations, unsafe
conditions, indignity and even abuse. Some
work long hours for low wages with little time
off. They can be trapped in their workplace if
their employer seizes their passport or other
documents.41

Domestic workers

Paid domestic work is an important means of
income for millions of workers, the majority

According to the UN General Assembly defi-
nition, sex workers include consenting female,
male and transgender adults and young peo-
ple ages 18 and older who receive money or
goods in exchange for sexual services, either
regularly or occasionally.43 Most countries have
laws prohibiting buying, selling or facilitating
sexual services as well as soliciting sex, operat-
ing brothels and living off the earnings of sex
work. Recommendation 200 on HIV and the
World of Work of the International Labour
Organization covers sex workers and recom-
mends that governments recognize sex work
as an occupation, so that it can be regulated to
protect workers and clients.44 Sex work involves
exploitation, abuse, violence and insecurity, all
of which damage human development in terms
of agency and choice.

Legal restrictions on sex work and related
activities displace sex workers to unsafe envi-
ronments, heightening their risk of violence
and sexually transmitted infections, including
HIV. Recent modelling by The Lancet sug-
gests that decriminalizing sex work could avert
33–46 percent of HIV infections in the next
decade across generalized and concentrated
epidemics.45 Evidence from India suggests
that activities led by sex worker collectives
have helped identify 80 percent of trafficked
minors and women in West Bengal, showing

that sex workers can be allies in assisting such
victims.46

Workers in hazardous industries

Mining is one of the most hazardous occupa-
tions in many countries. Although it accounts
for only 1 percent of the global workforce
(30 million workers), it is responsible for
8 percent of fatal accidents at work and for
many injuries and disabling diseases such as
pneumoconiosis (black lung disease).47 Official
statistics probably underestimate the number
of cases, and many miners work in informal
mines, where accident rates are often far higher.
Construction is another hazardous industry.
In developing countries construction workers
face multiple health risks, such as exposure to
dust, and are three to six times more likely than
other workers to die from accidents at work.
This is due in part to a lack of safety measures
or lax enforcement. In many developing coun-
tries construction workers wear no protection.
Similarly, in many instances the booming con-
struction sector relies heavily on rural migrant
workers who earn low wages, an intense pace of
work and long and irregular hours.48

Many dangers are also evident in factories,
and risks seem to have intensified in recent
years due to increased global movements and
aggravated by the global financial crisis. Faced
with intense competitive pressures, firms are
cutting costs in a race to the bottom. The most
unscrupulous bypass safety standards to keep
costs low, which increases the danger to factory

workers — consider, for example, the 2013 Rana
Plaza tragedy in Bangladesh. The government
has since made progress in supervising the
readymade garment and knitwear industry to
guarantee labour rights and reinforce safety
measures, but much remains to be done.

Older workers also face greater risk. They
need more recovery time between shifts,
especially when performing physically or psy-
chologically demanding jobs. For example, in
Europe most fatal work-related accidents hap-
pen in the 55–65 age group.49

Conclusions

Work is critical to human existence and human
development. Work has contributed con-
siderably to impressive human development
achievements over the years, but a large amount
of human potential remains unused — because
people are out of work, engaged in vulnerable
work or working but still in poverty. Many
younger people are out of work, and women
face lower wages and opportunities for paid
work while bearing a disproportionate burden
of unpaid care work. The world is deprived
of their contributions, creativity and innova-
tion. Creating opportunities to put the work
potentials of all people to use could further
accelerate human progress, help overcome the
remaining human development deficits and ad-
dress emerging human development challenges.
These issues are addressed in the following
chapter.

TABLE A1.2

Different types of employment

In 1993 the 15th International Conference of Labour Statisticians adopted the most recent revision to the classification of
employment status.

Paid employment

Self-employment

Nonstandard employment

Paid employment covers jobs where
the incumbents hold explicit (written or
oral) or implicit employment contracts,
which give them a basic remuneration
that does not depend directly on the
revenue of the unit for which they
work (this unit can be a corporation, a
nonprofit institution, a government unit
or a household).

Wage and salaried employees are
employees who hold paid employment
jobs.

Self-employment covers jobs where the
remuneration depends directly on the
profits (or the potential of profits) derived
from the goods and services produced
(where own consumption is considered
to be part of the profits). The incumbents
make the operational decisions affecting
the enterprise or delegate such decisions
while retaining responsibility for the
welfare of the enterprise.

Own-account workers are workers who,
working on their own account or with
one or more business partners, hold the
type of jobs defined as self-employment.

Contributing (unpaid) family workers are
workers who hold a self-employment
job in a market-oriented establishment
operated by a related person living in
the same household who cannot be
regarded as a business partner.

Self-employment comprises a vast
array of types of work with varying
degrees of insecurity, vulnerability
and remuneration. The self-employed
range from highly skilled “freelance”
professionals to unskilled street
vendors to small business owners.

Within the category of self-employed,
the International Labour Organization
has identified own-account workers
and contributing family workers as
vulnerable workers.

Nonstandard employment covers work
arrangements that fall outside the realm
of the standard employment relationship,
understood as work that is full-time,
indefinite and part of a subordinate
but bilateral employment relationship.
Nonstandard forms of employment
include workers in their formal or
informal employment arrangements, as
long as their contractual status covers
one of the four categories included in
the International Labour Organization
definition. More specifically:

Temporary employment covers workers
that are engaged for a specific period
of time, including under fixed-term
or project- or task-based contracts,
as well as seasonal or casual work,
including day labourers.

Contractual arrangements involving
multiple parties, including temporary
agency work, covers the situation in
which worker is deployed and paid by a
private employment agency and service
provider, but the work is performed by
the user firm.

In part-time employment the normal
hours of work are fewer than those of
comparable full-time workers.

Ambiguous employment is when the
respective rights and obligations of
parties concerned are not clear.

Self-employment may include workers who have access to some form of social protection and unemployment insurance
through national programmes and workers whose survival depends solely on their ability to sell their goods and services.
Vulnerable workers—a number of whom are women and children—are more likely than other self-employed people to lack
contractual arrangements, and they often lack economic independence and are vulnerable to household power relations and
economic fluctuations. They frequently lack unemployment insurance, social security and health coverage. As self-employ-
ment and own-account work become increasingly common around the world, better working conditions and social protection
for them have emerged as major concerns.

Human development and work:
progress and challenges

Over the past two decades, the world has made major strides in human development. Today, people are living longer, more
children are going to school and more people have access to clean water and basic sanitation. This progress goes hand
in hand with increasing incomes, leading to the highest standards of living in human history. A digital revolution connects
people across societies and countries. Just as important, political developments enable more people than ever to live under
democratic regimes. All these are important facets of human development.

The activities of 7.3 billion people have con-
tributed to this human progress in various
forms (see infographic at the beginning of the
chapter). Work has helped people achieve a
better standard of living — not only in terms
of income, but also in terms of health and
education, major ingredients for enhancing ca-
pabilities. Work has also provided people with
security, contributed to women’s empower-
ment and enhanced participation in different
spheres of human lives.

However, there are marked differences
in progress among regions, across countries
and within countries. Furthermore, serious
human deprivations remain, and the world
faces persistent inequality, along with climate
change and social, economic and environ-
mental vulnerabilities that could reverse
human advances and constrain wider choices
for everyone.

At the same time, considerable human
potential remains unused. Millions of people
are either out of work or working but still in
poverty. Even though young people account
for around half the global population (and an
even larger share in some regions because of
a youth bulge), millions of young people are
unemployed, depriving the world of their dy-
namism, creativity and innovation. Similarly,
the employment potential of women remains
substantially unused in various parts of the
world.

Overcoming the existing human depriva-
tions and addressing the emerging human
development challenges will require optimal
use of the world’s human potential. Such use
would also accelerate the achievements in hu-
man development to date and impart human
progress with greater resilience.

The scale of human progress
and contributions of work

Progress is evident for many measures of hu-
man development — such as those for health,
education, income, security and participation
— and for such composite indicators as the
Human Development Index (HDI).

Trends on the Human
Development Index

In almost 25 years the world HDI value has
increased by more than 20 percent and that
of the least developed countries by more than
40 percent. Every region of the world has seen
HDI gains. Over time and across all developing
regions, progress has been fairly steady, though
at a slower pace during the last 15 years, with
most having moved up through the human
development classifications (figure 2.1).

These changes are also reflected in the num-
ber of countries in each human development
classification. Between 1990 and 2014 for
156 countries with comparable data covering
98 percent of the world’s population in 2014,
the number of countries in the very high hu-
man development classification rose from 12
to 46, as the population in that group climbed
from 0.5 billion to 1.2 billion. Over the same
period the number of countries in the low hu-
man development classification fell from 62 to
43, as the population in that group fell from
3.2 billion to 1.2 billion (figure 2.2).

Progress on the HDI has been considerable
at the country level. For example, Ethiopia
increased its HDI value by more than half;
Rwanda by nearly half; five countries, includ-
ing Angola and Zambia, by more than a third;

and 23 countries, including Bangladesh, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nepal,
by more than a fifth. It is also encouraging that
the fastest progress was among low human de-
velopment countries.

But it also reminds us that there is no automat-
ic link between income and human development.
Income enters into the HDI but is just one of its
four indicators. Economic growth does not auto-
matically translate into higher human develop-
ment. Equatorial Guinea and Chile have similar
gross national incomes per capita (in purchasing
power parity terms) but different HDI values;
by contrast, Gabon and Indonesia have different
incomes but similar HDI values (figure 2.3).

Improvements in overall HDI value were
also paced by progress in all HDI component
indicators, as well as in many of the non-HDI
dimensions of human development — income
poverty and hunger, health, education, gender
equality, access to basic social services, envi-
ronmental sustainability and participation (see
table A2.1 at the end of the chapter).

Work has contributed to human
development achievements

The various activities of 7.3 billion people have
contributed to human progress. Nearly a billion

people who work in agriculture and more than
500 million family farms, which produce more
than 80 percent of the world’s food, have con-
tributed to better health and nutrition of the
global population.1 Worldwide, the work of
80 million workers in health and education
has helped enhance human capabilities.2 More
than a billion workers in services have contrib-
uted to human progress.3 In China and India
23 million jobs were created in clean energy, al-
lowing workers to contribute to environmental
sustainability.4

Work undertaken for the care of others has
contributed not only to accelerating and pro-
tecting human development for present gen-
erations (for example, through care for older
people and people with disabilities), but also
to creating human capabilities (for example,
through care work for children). Care work
can be paid or unpaid and includes household
activities such as cooking, cleaning and collect-
ing water and fuelwood as well as tending to
children, older people and the sick. When care
work is paid, it is often referred to as domestic
work. The International Labour Organization
estimates that there are at least 53 million paid
adult domestic workers worldwide, 83 percent
of them women, and the number may be rising.
Between 1995 and 2010 the share of domestic
workers in total employment rose from nearly
6 percent to 8 percent in Latin America and the
Caribbean; it also rose in the Middle East and
in Asia and the Pacific.5 This work is critical for
present and future human development.

Work has a societal value that goes beyond
the gains of individual workers. More than
450 million entrepreneurs have contributed
to human innovation and creativity.6 Art con-
tributes to social cohesion and cultural identity
while at times generating income. The global
market for artisan handcrafts alone was worth
an estimated $30 billion in 2011. Handicraft
production and sales account for a substantial
share of GDP in some countries. In Tunisia
300,000 craft workers account for 3.8 percent
of GDP. In Thailand the number of craft work-
ers is estimated at 2 million. And in Colombia
craft production generates an annual income of
roughly $400 million, including some $40 mil-
lion in exports.7 In developing countries the ex-
port of visual art in 2011 was around $9 billion
and that of publishing $8 billion.8

Innovations driven by creative expression
are taking place in many other areas of work,
including health, energy and finance, with the
potential to improve lives. When people are
innovative and creative in their work, they can
advance human progress by making leaps in
health care, education and other areas rather
than limiting advances to small increments. For
example, immunotherapy tries to enhance the
immunity of healthy cells, rather than focusing
on cancer cells, so that a body’s enhanced im-
munity can isolate the cancer cells and destroy
them. This has been hailed as a new pillar in the
war against cancer, particularly for lung cancer,
which kills 354,000 Europeans and 158,000
Americans every year.9 In energy the glass for
buildings and cars has been designed to make
electricity from sunlight. Solar Impulse is an
experiment in solar-powered flight. Automated
wealth managers can offer sound financial ad-
vice for a small fraction of the cost of a real-life
adviser.

More than 970 million people — 62 percent
of them in low- and lower middle-income
countries, 12 percent in upper middle-income
countries and 26 percent in high-income
countries — who engage in volunteer activity
each year have helped families and communi-
ties, improving social cohesion and contrib-
uting to the public good. Around two-thirds
of volunteer work is performed in informal
settings or through community mechanisms,
such as watching a neighbour’s children, house
sitting and the like. The rest is channelled
through organizations, typically nonprofits.
The economic size of the volunteer economy
is estimated as equivalent to 2.4 percent of
global GDP.10 Older people in many countries
also spend a considerable amount of time in
voluntary work. In 2011, 33 percent of people
ages 55–75 in the Netherlands and 30 percent
of people ages 65–74 in the United Kingdom
were involved in volunteering.11

The work of overseas workers and their
remittances have helped advance human
development in both source and destination
countries. Between 1990 and 2013 the number
of international migrants worldwide rose more
than 92 million, to 247 million, with most of
the growth between 2000 and 2010. It is ex-
pected to surpass 250 million in 2015. Of the
143 million in developed countries, 40 percent

were born in a developed country. Around half
of international migrants are women — the pro-
portion is slightly higher (around 52 percent)
and rising in developed countries and lower
(around 43 percent) and falling in developing
countries.12 These people have contributed to
the economic growth and income generation
of destination countries and brought skills,
knowledge and creativity to these economies.

Remittances have been a major source of
foreign exchange reserves for many developing
countries, with considerable macroeconomic
implications. But at the microeconomic level
remittances have been the lifeline of many
households in terms of income, as well as in
terms of resources for better health and edu-
cation. Officially recorded global remittances
totalled $583 billion, or more than four times
the global official development assistance, in
2014 and are projected to reach $586 billion in
2015. Officially recorded remittances to devel-
oping countries are expected to increase from
$436 billion in 2014 to $440 billion in 2015.13
The top recipients in 2014 were India ($70 bil-
lion, or 4 percent of GDP), China ($64 billion,
less than 1 percent), the Philippines ($28 bil-
lion, 10 percent) and Mexico ($25 billion,
2 percent). Remittance flows are even more
important in some Eastern European and
Commonwealth of Independent States coun-
tries: Remittances in Tajikistan were equivalent
to 49 percent of GDP in 2013.14 Migrants also
send remittances through unofficial channels
or carry them when they return to their home
country. Figure 2.4 reveals their importance for
such human development outcomes as poverty
reduction in Kyrgyzstan.

Serious human deprivations,
but considerable human
potential not in use

Despite overall gains in human development,
not everyone has benefited. And serious human
deprivations remain in various areas of human
lives. Furthermore, a huge amount of human
potential is not in use because of widespread
unemployment, particularly among young
people, and because many people are working
but remain impoverished, with limited work
choices. The paid work potential of women

around the world is also not at the optimum
level, with gender-based discrepancies in wages,
job opportunities and career advancement.

Uneven human development
achievements

Striking contrasts in human development
achievements remain across and within regions
and countries. By 2014 all regions except
Sub- Saharan Africa had reached the medium
human development classification. Within
the low human development classification the
HDI value ranges from 0.348 for Niger to
0.548 for Nepal.

National HDI values can mask large differ-
ences within countries, but countries may dis-
aggregate the HDI to unmask the differences
and use the results for proactive policies to
provide more support to less developed areas.
Ethiopia has done so through its 2015 National
Human Development Report (figure 2.5).

Progress is also uneven across various human
development indicators: Between 1990 and
2015 while the global prevalence of extreme
poverty was reduced from 47 percent to

14 percent (a 70 percent reduction), in Sub-
Saharan Africa it was reduced from 57 percent
to only 41 percent (a 28 percent reduction).
Between 2014 and 2016 less than 5 percent
of people in Latin America are estimated to
be malnourished, compared with 16 percent
in South Asia and 23 percent in Sub- Saharan
Africa. In terms of stunting, children from the
poorest quintile of the population are more
than twice as likely to be stunted as those from
the richest quintile.15

In 2015 the child mortality rate was 11
deaths per 1,000 live births for East Asia and 86
for Sub- Saharan Africa. The highest maternal
mortality ratio is in Sub- Saharan Africa (510
deaths per 100,000 live births), followed by
South Asia (190).16 In 2014 women accounted
for more than half the world’s people living
with HIV. And more than 70 percent of the
world’s people living with HIV were in Sub-
Saharan Africa. Nearly 1.4 million newly in-
fected people were also in the region.17 Of the
57 million out-of-school children at the prima-
ry level, 33 million are in Sub- Saharan Africa.
In developing countries children in the poorest
households are four times as likely to be out of
school as those in the richest households.18 In
East Asia and the Pacific, Europe and Central
Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean the
gross secondary enrolment ratio has surpassed
80 percent, but in Sub- Saharan Africa it is less
than 50 percent. Access to safe drinking water
and basic sanitation is uneven between rural
and urban areas around the world. Rural access
has improved, but most progress has been in
urban areas. For example, 96 percent of urban
populations have access to an improved source

BOX 2.1

Uneven access to the digital revolution

In all regions the
Human Development
Index value is lower for
women than for men

of drinking water, compared with 84 percent of
rural populations.19

In all regions the HDI value is lower for
women than for men (table 2.1) — women
fare better in only in 14 countries, including
Barbados, Estonia, Poland and Uruguay.

Even though the digital revolution has con-
tributed substantially to human development
and revolutionized the world of work, as chap-
ter 3 shows, access to the digital revolution re-
mains uneven, constraining the effects it could
have on human lives (box 2.1).

Within countries differences can be consid-
erable across income, age and ethnic groups and
between rural and urban locations. In Malaysia
in 2012 the richest 10 percent of population
had 32 percent of national income, while the
poorest 10 percent had only 2 percent.20 In
Nepal about 10 percent of Hill Brahmans (the
upper caste) lived in income poverty in 2014,

Human development deficits

Apart from uneven achievements in human
development, deficits remain in many dimen-
sions, impairing capabilities, opportunities and
thus human well-being.

Human Development Index shortfall

The HDI is a composite index with an upper
limit of 1.0. In 2014 the average global value
was 0.711, so there was a shortfall of 0.289.
One way of considering HDI progress is to con-
sider how some regions have cut their shortfall.
In East Asia and the Pacific the shortfall was
0.484 in 1990 and 0.290 in 2014, a narrowing
of 0.194 (40 percent) and the steepest reduc-
tion among developing country regions (figure
2.8). In Sub- Saharan Africa the HDI shortfall
was whittled down by only about 20 percent
over the same period. One major challenge for
human development in the coming years is to
reduce the HDI shortfall.

Despite impressive
achievements in
many ways, huge
human potential
remains unused

Multidimensional poverty

The conventional measure of poverty considers
only income: People in extreme poverty live
on less than $1.25 a day. But people can also
be deprived of schooling, be undernourished
or lack access to safe drinking water. This
broader concept of poverty is reflected in the
Multidimensional Poverty Index, a weighted
average of 10 indicators. A person is considered
to be in multidimensional poverty if she or he
is deprived in at least a third of these indicators,
with each indicator having a defined depriva-
tion level.

The Human Development Report has
been reporting Multidimensional Poverty
Index estimates since 2010. This year the
Multidimensional Poverty Index is estimated
for 101 countries (see table 6 in Statistical an-
nex). The estimates suggest that about 1.5 bil-
lion people live in multidimensional poverty.
Table 2.2 lists the five countries with the largest
populations in multidimensional poverty;
however, the countries with the highest pro-
portions of their population in severe poverty
(deprived in more than half the dimensions) are
Niger, South Sudan, Chad, Ethiopia, Burkina
Faso and Somalia, at more than 60 percent, and
Guinea-Bissau and Mali, at more than half.

The Multidimensional Poverty Index usually
represents a national average, which can mask
disparities and large areas of deprivation within
countries. In China an estimated 72 million
people live in multidimensional poverty, but its
prevalence varies greatly across provinces, with

TABLE 2.2

rural areas having a higher prevalence than ur-
ban areas (figure 2.9).

In addition to considering indices of human
development and multidimensional poverty,
it is useful to consider the absolute number of
people who are deprived (figure 2.10).

Huge human potential not in use

Despite impressive achievements in many areas,
huge human potential remains unused. In 2015,
204 million people worldwide — including
74 million young people (ages 15–24) — were
unemployed.24 About 830 million workers in
developing country regions live on less than $2
a day.25 Half of workers and their families in de-
veloping countries live on less than $4 a day.26
The work potential for these people is not fully
used or rewarded.

Two groups whose work potential is not fully
used are women (particularly in the context of
paid work) and younger people. Women are less
likely than men to seek or find paid work and are
less likely to have secure employment or senior
positions when they are employed. Worldwide,
the labour force participation rate (a measure of
those active in the labour market) in 2015 was
around 50 percent among women, compared
with 76 percent among men.27 In the same year
47 percent of working-age (ages 15 and older)
women were employed, compared with 72 per-
cent of men. Nearly 50 percent of employed
women are in vulnerable employment, com-
pared with 44 percent of men.28 Worldwide,
women hold only 18 percent of ministerial

Today more than half
the world’s population
is under age 30

positions, 22 percent of parliamentary seats and
25 percent of administrative and managerial po-
sitions.29 Some 32 percent of businesses do not
have any female senior managers.30 See chapters
4 and 6 for more details on these issues.

Workers are also staying unemployed longer.
Even in the United States, where the recovery
seems to have been stronger, at the end of May
2015 nearly 30 percent of jobseekers were un-
employed for more than six months.31 This is
damaging for workers and for the economy, as
people out of work for a long period lose their
skills and struggle to find jobs at a similar skill
level. Longer term unemployment (12 months
or more) pushes people towards informal
sector, low-level, low-productivity jobs. It also
makes them “discouraged workers” — that is,
people who would like to work but who do not
actively look for work for various reasons.

Global employment growth has slowed to
around 1.4 percent a year since 2011, or far be-
low the average annual growth rate of 1.7 per-
cent during the pre-crisis years (2000–2007).32
Some 61 million fewer people worldwide had
jobs in 2014 than would have been the case
if the pre-crisis trend had continued. And on
current trends, the number of global jobseek-
ers could reach 215 million by 2018, up from
206 million in 2014.33

Vulnerable work

Worldwide, only half of workers were in wage
or salaried employment in 2014, with wide
variations across regions. For countries with
data covering 84 percent of global employment,
26 percent of employed people have a perma-
nent contract, 13 percent a temporary one and
61 percent work without any contract. Part-
time work is widespread. For 86 countries with
data covering 65 percent of global employment,
more than 17 percent of employed people work
part time. Women are more likely to work part
time than men (24 percent versus 12 percent).34
More than 1.5 billion workers worldwide
are in vulnerable employment. Vulnerable
employment accounts for almost 80 percent of
work in low human development countries.35
Most underemployed and underpaid workers
work informally. In most developing country
regions informal work accounts for more than
half of nonagricultural work — the highest

share is in South Asia (82 percent), followed
by Sub- Saharan Africa (66 percent), East
and South-East Asia (65 percent) and Latin
America (51 percent). Some 700 million infor-
mal workers live in extreme poverty. In many
countries informal work accounts for a consid-
erable proportion of national nonagricultural
output — for example, 46 percent in India in
2008. The proportion is also very high in some
West African countries — more than 50 percent
in Benin, Niger and Togo.36

Youth unemployment

Today more than half the world’s population is
under age 30.37 These young people are likely
to be healthier and better educated than their
parents and can take advantage of modern
communications technologies and media that
enable them to engage more fully in global
society. So they have higher work expectations
— but many of them cannot find work.

In 2015, 74 million young people (ages 15-
24) were unemployed.38 The youth-to-adult
unemployment ratio is at a historical peak and
is particularly high in the Arab States as well as
in parts of Southern Europe and Latin America
and the Caribbean.39 For example, the youth
unemployment rate in 2014 was 3.4 times the
adult unemployment rate in Italy, nearly 3 times
higher in Croatia and nearly 2.5 times higher in
the Czech Republic, Portugal and Slovakia. In
absolute terms the youth unemployment rate
in these countries was also high — 53 percent
in Spain, 46 percent in Croatia, 35 percent in
Portugal and 30 percent in Slovakia.40

The youth unemployment rate is highest in
the Arab States, where in many countries of the
region insufficient numbers of jobs are being
created for the increasingly educated workforce
(figure 2.11). For example, between 1995 and
2006 Egypt produced 5 million college grad-
uates but generated only 1.8 million jobs in
skill-intensive service sectors (excluding con-
struction and wholesale and retail trade).41

Youth unemployment is not confined to coun-
tries with a young population. In countries with
an ageing population, such as Greece and Spain,
more than half of economically active young
people are unemployed, a situation worsened
by persistently high school dropout rates. Early
school leavers account for 28 percent of the

population ages 18–24 in Spain, compared with
14 percent across the European Union.42 Young
unskilled workers have a much lower chance of
securing full-time work in the formal economy.

Youth unemployment, exacerbated by the
2008 financial crisis and the global recession,
seems set to continue during the slow post-cri-
sis growth. Between 2012 and 2020 almost
1.1 billion young jobseekers are expected to
enter the job market, many of them in South
Asia and Sub- Saharan Africa.43 There is also
mismatch between skills demanded and skills
available. A mismatch in skills is associated
with a high proportion of young people not
in education, employment or training. One
outcome of this phenomenon is high youth un-
employment, as in Spain, where the youth un-
employment rate was more than 50 percent in
early 2015.44 Developing countries face many
of the same issues but have to employ even
more young people — absorbing not just the
highly skilled and technologically savvy, but
also the growing bulge of young people with
fewer skills, many of whom will need to work
in agriculture and basic services.

For many young workers the only route to
employment in the formal economy is through
temporary work. They are thus more likely to
be laid off, because many countries, particularly
in Europe, prioritize job protection for older
permanent workers. Since the start of the crisis,
numerous countries have seen a steep rise in

the proportion of young people who are nei-
ther employed nor in education or training.45
Indeed, youth workforce participation is de-
creasing everywhere. One consequence of low
participation and high youth unemployment
is limited contributions — or the late start
of contributions — for retirement benefits.
Another is that rising youth unemployment,
particularly of the long-term sort, if left un-
addressed, could leave economies with a lost
generation of workers (box 2.2).

As described in chapter 1, in 2012 some
21 million people worldwide were in forced
labour, 14 million of them in labour exploitation
and 4.5 million in forced sexual exploitation (in-
cluding forced prostitution and forced pornog-
raphy).46 And there were about 168 million child
labourers.47 This human potential is wasted.

BOX 2.2

Impact of long-term youth unemployment

Young people unemployed for long periods will not
only suffer financially, but also start to lose their
skills, reducing their future work potential. And they
lose self-esteem, with impacts on their well-being
and that of their family members. Youth unemploy-
ment can also reduce a country’s economic potential
by underusing people’s capabilities. In addition, it
undermines social cohesion, with the potential for
increases in crime, violence and social unrest, af-
fecting entire communities.

One study of 69 countries found that being with-
out a job translates into negative views about the
effectiveness of democracy, particularly among the
long-term unemployed.1 In North Africa postponing
the transition from youth to adulthood has fuelled
resentment and unrest. In Somalia, where youth un-
employment stands at 67 percent, feelings of being
socially excluded and financially marginalized make
young people more vulnerable to recruitment by
extremist groups.2

are already looming large (such as rising ine-
quality and climate change), some have been
changing rapidly in their extent and nature
(such as human insecurity, shocks and vulnera-
bilities) and some have full implications that are
yet to be captured (such as population growth,
growing urbanization and global epidemics).

Rising inequality

In recent years rising incomes around the world
have been accompanied by rising inequality in
income, wealth and opportunities. Inequality
can be measured by the Gini coefficient, which
is expressed as a value between 0 (everyone has
the same) and 1 (one person has everything).

From 1990 to 2010 on average and taking
into account population size, income inequali-
ty increased 11 percent in developing countries.
A substantial majority of households in devel-
oping countries — more than 75 percent of the
population — live in a society where income is
more unequally distributed than in the 1990s.
Income inequality is also a serious issue in
developed countries. Between the 1990s and
2010 household income inequality increased
9 percent in high-income countries.48 Although
income inequality across households has risen
in many countries, some estimates show that
it has fallen for the world as a whole as the
average incomes of developing and developed
regions have been converging.49

Inequality can be measured by the Inequality-
adjusted HDI. Each component is discounted
according to the extent of inequality in that
component. The Inequality-adjusted HDI val-
ue is 33 percent lower than the HDI value in

TABLE 2.3

Sub- Saharan Africa and more than 25 percent
lower in South Asia and the Arab States (table
2.3). In four countries — the Central African
Republic, Comoros, Namibia and Sierra Leone
— the Inequality-adjusted HDI value is more
than 40 percent lower. In 35 other countries it
is 30–40 percent lower.

There have been sharp increases at the top
of the income distribution. Between 1976 and
2011 the share of total annual income received
by the richest 1 percent of the population
in the United States rose from 9 percent to
20 percent. Similarly, between 1980 and 2007
the share received by the richest 1 percent in
the United Kingdom rose from 7 percent to
13 percent.50 Some developing countries have
similar patterns. In Colombia the richest 1 per-
cent of earners receives 20 percent of national
income, and the situation is similar in South
Africa.51 The increasing income inequalities
in economies have affected labour more and
more, a point made by former United States
Labor Secretary Professor Robert Reich in a
special contribution (signed box).

With regard to global wealth, inequality is
substantial. In fact, a small elite takes a large
share of global wealth. The richest 1 percent
held 48 percent of global wealth in 2014, a
share projected to be more than 50 percent in
2016.52 Around 80 percent of the world’s peo-
ple have just 6 percent of global wealth (figure
2.12). Indeed, just 80 individuals together have
as much wealth as the world’s poorest 3.5 bil-
lion people. Such inequality has become a
serious problem — both for economic efficiency
and for social stability.53

Inequalities extend beyond income. Wide-
spread inequality in opportunities persists,

SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION

Inequality and labour markets

The argument voiced in the late 19th century over alleged “freedom of con-
tract” was that any deal between employees and workers was perfectly fine
if both sides voluntarily agreed to it.

But as we should have learned a century ago, labour markets do not
exist in nature. They are created by human beings. The real question is how
they are organized and for whose benefit.

So workers were worth no more than the wages they could command in
the labour market. And if they toiled 12 hour days in sweatshops for lack of
any better alternative, it was not a problem. They had “voluntarily” agreed
to those conditions.

In the late 19th century they were organized for the benefit of a few at

the top.

But by the middle of the 20th century they were organized for the vast

majority.

It was a time of great wealth for a few and squalor for many. And of
corruption, as the lackeys of robber barons deposited sacks of cash on the
desks of pliant legislators.

During the 30 years after the end of World War II, as the economy
doubled in size, so did the wages of most Americans — accompanied by im-
proved hours and working conditions.

Eventually, after decades of labour strife and political tumult, the
20th century brought an understanding that capitalism requires minimum
standards of decency and fairness — workplace safety, a minimum wage,
maximum hours (and time-and-a-half for overtime) and a ban on child
labour.

We also learned that capitalism needs a fair balance of power between

big corporations and workers.

We achieved that through antitrust laws that reduced the capacity of
giant corporations to impose their will and through labour laws that allowed
workers to organize and bargain collectively.

By the 1950s, when 35 percent of private sector workers in the United
States belonged to a labour union, they were able to negotiate higher wages
and better working conditions than employers would otherwise have volun-
tarily provided.

But now America seems to be heading back to the 19th century.
Corporations are shifting full-time work onto temps, freelancers
and contract workers who fall outside the labour protections established
decades ago.

Meanwhile, the nation’s biggest corporations and Wall Street banks are

larger and more potent than ever.

And labour union membership has shrunk to fewer than 7 percent of

private sector workers.

Yet since around 1980, even though the economy has doubled once again
(the Great Recession notwithstanding), the wages of most Americans have
stagnated. And their benefits and working conditions have deteriorated.

This is not because most Americans are worth less. In fact, worker pro-

ductivity is higher than ever.

It is because big corporations, Wall Street and some enormously wealthy
individuals have gained political power to organize the market in ways that
have enhanced their wealth while leaving most Americans behind.

That includes trade agreements protecting the intellectual property of large
corporations and Wall Street’s financial assets but not American jobs and wages.
Bailouts of big Wall Street banks and their executives and shareholders
when they cannot pay what they owe, but not of homeowners who cannot meet
their mortgage payments.

Bankruptcy protection for big corporations, allowing them to shed their
debts, including labour contracts. But no bankruptcy protection for college gradu-
ates overburdened with student debts.

Antitrust leniency towards a vast swathe of American industry — including
Big Cable (Comcast, AT&T, Time-Warner), Big Tech (Amazon, Google), Big
Pharma, the largest Wall Street banks and giant retailers (Walmart).

But it also includes less tolerance towards labour unions — as workers
trying to form unions are fired with impunity and more states adopt so-called
“right-to-work” laws that undermine unions.

So it is not surprising we are once again hearing that workers are worth

There are also serious inequalities in health.

the richest to die before age 5. Health dispari-
ties are also wide between urban and rural are-
as: In Latin America and the Caribbean child
mortality is a third higher in rural areas than in
urban areas.55

Population growth and structure

Between 2015 and 2050 the world’s population
is projected to rise from 7.3 billion to 9.6 bil-
lion. Most of this growth will be in developing
countries — from 6.0 billion to 8.2 billion. A
substantial part of this is attributable to high
fertility in 15 countries, mostly least developed
countries, in Sub- Saharan Africa. By 2050,
85 percent of the world’s people are project-
ed to live in developing country regions.56
Population growth has major implications for
human development and has a direct impact
on the lives of women and girls — including for
the labour force and jobs, care work and social
protection, which are considered in chapters 4
and 6. Ageing is also a major issue.

One dimension of population growth is the
expansion of a sizeable global middle class,
defined as households with daily expenditure
of $10–$100 per capita (in purchasing power
parity terms).57 That global middle class is ex-
pected to be 4.9 billion — nearly 57 percent of
the global population — in 2030, with 3.2 bil-
lion in Asia and the Pacific, mostly in China
and India. Consumption by the middle class in
the 10 countries with the largest middle-class
population (Brazil, China, France, Germany,
India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Russian
Federation and the United States) is forecast
to be $38 trillion in 2030.58 These shifts will
have major implications for the consumption
patterns and living standards of a large share of
the global population and as a result for envi-
ronmental sustainability and other aspects of
human development.

Thanks to technological advances in medi-
cine, nutrition and sanitation infrastructures,
people in most countries are living longer, with
advances often improving the quantity and
quality of basic social services, particularly in
poor countries. Over the first decade of the
21st century, global life expectancy increased
by more than three years.59 Greater longevity
is a welcome sign of human development, but
it raises new issues for public policies on work,

health care and social security, as well as retire-
ment ages and pensions — issues that are taken
up in chapters 3 and 6.

As a result of greater longevity and declining
fertility, older people now make up an increas-
ing proportion of national populations. This
ageing is reflected in the old-age dependency
ratio: the ratio of the number of people ages 65
and older to the number of people of working
age (ages 15–64). In developing country re-
gions the ratio was about 10 percent in 2015.
It is expected to rise to 47 percent by 2050.60
Although ageing is a global phenomenon,
countries are at different stages depending on
their levels of development and their stage in
the demographic transition (figure 2.13). In
low human development countries the main
driver of a high dependency ratio is a young
population (children under age 15). In very
high human development countries the demo-
graphic pressures of old and young populations
are similar, but the older population will pre-
dominate fairly soon.

Growing urbanization

FIGURE 2.14

The world is experiencing an unprecedented
transition from rural to urban living. In 1950
a third of the world’s population lived in cities,
in 2000, nearly half were city dwellers, and in
2050 more than two-thirds of the world’s pop-
ulation is projected to be living in urban areas
(figure 2.14). This rapid increase will take place
mainly in developing countries. Africa and Asia
— both still less urbanized than other regions —
will have the fastest urban growth rates. Africa’s
urban population is projected to jump from
40 percent today to 56 percent by 2050, and
Asia’s from 48 percent to 64 percent.61

One factor driving rapid urbanization in
developing countries is rural–urban migration
motivated by better employment opportunities
in cities (“pull factors”). The largest rural–urban
migration is in China, where about 275 million
people, or more than a third of the labour force,
are migrant workers from the countryside.62
In many developing countries migration from
rural areas to cities is driven at least partly by
natural disasters (such as floods) and increas-
ing land degradation and desertification that
make agriculture difficult (“push factors”).
For example, many people are migrating from

Urbanization has the potential to improve
the economic well-being of societies. More
than half the world’s people live in cities, but
they generate more than 80 percent of global
GDP.64 In most countries the health of city
dwellers has improved through access to better
education and health care, better living condi-
tions and targeted public health interventions.
Cities hold promises for improving human
well-being.65

Yet urbanization also presents many human
development challenges. It puts pressure on cit-
ies’ infrastructures — such as housing, electric-
ity, drinking water and sanitation — and may
adversely affect residents’ quality of life. Nearly
40 percent of the world’s urban expansion may
be in slums, exacerbating economic disparities
and unsanitary conditions. Almost 700 million
urban slum dwellers lack adequate sanitation,
which, along with the paucity of safe drinking
water, raises the risk of communicable diseases
such as cholera and diarrhoea, particularly
among children.66 And urbanization creates
income and opportunity disparities, not only
between rural and urban areas but also among
socioeconomic groups in cities, boosting social
tensions.67

Human security

Human development is under threat from
many sources. In 2014 the world witnessed
widespread conflicts, violence and human
rights violations that resulted in the massive dis-
placement of people, within and outside their
countries. At the end of 2014 almost 60 mil-
lion people had been displaced worldwide, the
highest level recorded since the Second World
War. If these people were a nation, they would
make up the 24th largest country in the world.
Multiple conflicts took place in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan,
South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic and
Ukraine.68

About a third of the 60 million were refugees
or asylum seekers, and more than 38 million
were displaced within the borders of their
own countries. Based on available evidence,
children accounted for half the global refugee
population, the highest proportion in 10 years.

The increase has been driven principally by the
growing number of Afghan, Somali and Syrian
refugee children.69

Between 2000 and 2013 the worldwide
cumulative death toll from violent extremism
— acts intended to provoke a state of terror in
the general public, a group of people or par-
ticular people — rose from 3,361 to 17,958.70
The Islamic State and associated armed groups
have carried out brutal attacks on civilians
in Iraq, Syria, Turkey and other countries,
including killings, rape and sexual slavery,
torture, forced religious conversion and the
conscription of children. Boko Haram has
kidnapped and attacked civilians in Benin,
Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger, and Al
Shabaab militants have made similar attacks
in Somalia and Kenya. Originating in Uganda
but operating in the Central African Republic,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and
South Sudan, the Lord’s Resistance Army, a
militant cult group, has carried out human
atrocities.

People living with the threat of violence
from violent extremism and conflict not only
lose their freedom, but also have fewer op-
portunities to expand their capabilities. With
basic infrastructures — physical and social
— destroyed, they have fewer opportunities
to earn a livelihood and less access to health
services and schooling. Parents who fear for
the physical and sexual safety of their children
are likely to keep them out of school.71 Taken
together, these conditions increase care respon-
sibilities within the home.

Violent extremism and conflict also erode
collective human development. Intimidation
and violence can demoralize communities and
destroy social structures and political institu-
tions, undermining cohesion and weakening
states. And violence targeted at particular
groups can magnify existing societal cleavages.
Extremist groups regularly attack or threaten
women and sexual, ethnic and religious minor-
ities, often using rape as an expression of power
and brutality.72 These threats are global, and
their effects cut across national borders — not
just because of the flows of refugees, but also
because of uncertainty about when and where
a terrorist attack might occur.

Violent extremist activities and large-scale
conflicts make it difficult for governments

68 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

Violent extremism
and conflict also
erode collective

to provide essential social services such as
basic health care and education. An estimated
30 million children are out of school in con-
flict-affected countries.73 Undereducated youth
with few economic opportunities are then sus-
ceptible to recruitment by extremists, increas-
ingly over the Internet. For example, in Somalia
youth engagement with Al Shabaab is driven by
high unemployment, inadequate education and
weak political participation.74

Women’s empowerment

Women’s empowerment requires female auton-
omy in all areas of life — financial, economic,
political, social and cultural, in and outside
the home. Measures of gender parity are im-
proving, but gender parity may not lead to
real empowerment in countries where overall
development is low.

Improvements in gender equality — the so-
cially constructed relations between men and
women — have also occurred. Women are better
represented in political decisionmaking, and in
the workplace glass ceilings are at least crack-
ing, if not breaking. Stereotyped gender roles
are changing in many societies, as is sharing of
responsibilities within households.

Even so, women are actively disempowered
by mutually reinforcing processes in every
walk of life. They are held back by biases in
social beliefs, norms and cultural values. They
face discrimination in economic, political and
social structures as well as policies, institutions
and strategies. Too often they are constrained
by real and perceived physical insecurity.

Violence against women, including domestic
violence, is evident in all societies, among all
socioeconomic groups and at all levels of edu-
cation. According to a 2013 global review, one
in three women (35 percent) has experienced
physical or sexual intimate partner violence or
non–intimate partner sexual violence.75 But
in some countries that share rises to 70 per-
cent.76 More often than not, the violence goes
unreported to the police. Interviews with
42,000 women across the 28 EU member states
revealed that only 14 percent of women had
reported their most serious incident of intimate
partner violence, and merely 13 percent had
reported their most serious incident of non–in-
timate partner violence.77

Such violence impacts women’s empower-
ment. The full effects on human development
are difficult to measure, but there have been
efforts to quantify some of the costs in finan-
cial terms. In Australia the cost of domestic
and nondomestic violence against women and
children has been estimated at A$14 billion a
year. In Viet Nam domestic violence against
women costs nearly 1.4 percent of GDP in lost
earnings and out-of-pocket spending to treat
health- related violence outcomes, leading to an
overall output loss of 1.8 percent of GDP.78

Shocks, vulnerabilities and risks

For many societies, and particularly for poor
communities, human development is under-
mined by multiple shocks, vulnerabilities and
risks: economic and financial crises, rising food
prices and food insecurities, energy price hikes,
emerging health risks and epidemics. Any of
these can slow, reverse or completely derail
human development, as documented by the
financial and economic crisis of 2008–2009. In
Latin America an additional 3.2 million people
live in poverty over what was expected without
the crisis.79 Globally there were at least 61 mil-
lion fewer jobs in 2014 than expected.80

Emerging health risks

Noncommunicable (or chronic) diseases have
become a global health risk. They kill 38 mil-
lion people a year, almost three-fourths of
them (28 million) in low- and middle-income
countries. Cardiovascular disease accounts
for the most deaths due to noncommunicable
diseases (about 18 million), followed by cancer
(8.2 million), respiratory disease (4 million)
and diabetes (1.5 million).81

Tobacco accounts for around 6 million
deaths a year (including deaths due to second-
hand smoke), a figure projected to increase to
8 million by 2030.82 Two million women and
children — four a minute — die prematurely due
to illness caused by indoor air pollution, pri-
marily from smoke produced while cooking.83

Obesity, though preventable and reversible,
accounts for a growing share of noncommu-
nicable diseases. Over the past 20 years being
overweight or obese has emerged as a world-
wide scourge on health, initially in developed

countries but now in developing countries,
particularly in urban settings (figure 2.15).
Almost 30 percent of the world’s population,
or 2.1 billion people, are overweight or obese,
62 percent of them in developing countries,
with wide variations by region. The number of
overweight children is projected to double by
2030.84

Noncommunicable diseases are not only a
matter of lifestyle, but also strongly related to
poverty and deprivation. Poor people often
have to consume low-priced, low-nutrition,
highly processed foods. So their intake is made
up largely of calories without micronutrients.
The spread of noncommunicable diseases is
inherently linked to social influences.

Leone the number of children under age 5
receiving treatment for malaria declined 39 per-
cent between May and September 2014. Liberia
saw the proportion of women giving birth with
the assistance of a skilled health care provider
tumble from 52 percent in 2013 to only 37 per-
cent between May and August 2014.87

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone felt a total
fiscal impact from Ebola of over $500 million
in 2014, nearly 5 percent of their combined
GDP. In 2015 lost output was estimated to be
more than 12 percent of GDP.88 In addition,
the countries have suffered from reduced agri-
cultural production, possible food insecurity,
lower wages and pauses in investment plans by
external partners.

Epidemics

Climate change

The year 2014 saw a serious outbreak of the
Ebola virus. As of late May 2015 almost 27,000
reported, confirmed, probable and suspected
cases and 11,000 deaths had been accounted
for in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. More
than 5,000 children were infected, and 16,000
children lost one or both parents or their pri-
mary caregiver.85

Closed schools, threats to past health gains
and economic declines are among the many
impacts of the Ebola outbreak. An estimated
5 million children were deprived of education
in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where
schools were closed for months.86 In Sierra

Around the world communities are steadily
becoming more vulnerable to the adverse
effects of climate change, including loss of bi-
odiversity. Most exposed are those who live in
arid zones, on slopes, in areas with poor soils
and in forest ecosystems. Estimates show that
in 2002, these fragile lands supported around
1.3 billion people (double the number 50 years
ago) and have been under increasing pressure.89
Global emissions of carbon dioxide, which has
an impact on climate change, have increased
50 percent since 1990.90

Climate change exacerbates all these vulner-
abilities, fettering the choices of present and

future generations. Impacts are particularly se-
vere on developing countries and their poorest
people, who often live in the most fragile eco-
logical areas and depend directly on the natural
environment for their lives and livelihoods.
Climate change poses an existential threat to
small island developing states.

Water availability will be increasingly affect-
ed by climate change, which in Africa could
expose 250 million people to greater water
stress. In some countries drought could halve
the yields from rainfed agriculture by 2020.91
Across Sub- Saharan Africa and South and East
Asia drought and rainfall variations could lead
to large productivity losses in cultivated food
staples.

The climate changes of recent decades have
probably already affected some health out-
comes. These changes were held responsible
for 2.4 percent of worldwide diarrhoea cases
and 6 percent of malaria cases in a few mid-
dle-income countries in 2000.92 Small changes
against a “noisy” background of other causal
factors are difficult to confirm. But once identi-
fied, cases of causal attribution are strengthened
by similar observations in different population
settings.

The first detectable changes in human health
may be alterations in the geographical range
(latitude and altitude) and seasonality of cer-
tain infectious diseases, including vectorborne
infections such as malaria and dengue fever,
and foodborne infections such as salmonello-
sis, which peak in the warmer months. Warmer
average temperatures combined with increased
climatic variability could alter the pattern of
exposure to thermal extremes, with resultant
health impacts in both summer and winter.

By contrast, the public health consequences
of the disturbance of natural and managed
food-producing ecosystems, rising sea levels
and population displacements due to physical
hazards, land loss, economic disruption and
civil strife may not become evident for several
decades.

Millions of people are also affected by nat-
ural disasters. Between 2003 and 2013 there
were on average 388 natural disasters a year, af-
fecting 216 million people and killing 106,654.
But in 2013 natural disasters were at their
lowest level in 16 years, with 330 disasters that
affected 97 million people and killed 21,610.

The total damage was also less — down from
the 2003–2013 annual average of $157 billion
to $119 billion in 2013 dollars. By number of
deaths, of the 10 most affected countries in
2013, five were low- or lower middle-income.93
Since 2008 an estimated one person every
second has been displaced by a disaster, with
19.3 million people forced to flee their homes
in 2014 alone.94

Human development —
looking forward

The record on human development has been
mixed — quite uneven across regions, among
countries and between groups. While progress
has been impressive on some fronts, considera-
ble deprivations remain, all presenting tremen-
dous challenges to human development. Table
A2.1 at the end of the chapter presents a bal-
ance sheet of human progress and deprivations.
These dynamics must be seen in the context
of a changed world. The world today is very
different from the world in 1990, when the no-
tion of human development and its measures to
assess human well-being were launched. The de-
velopment canvas has changed, global growth
centres have shifted, important demographic
transitions have materialized and a fresh wave
of development challenges has emerged.

The notion of human development needs to
be contextualized to make it a more relevant
analytical foundation for dealing with emerg-
ing challenges in a changing world. Issues of in-
dividual and collective capabilities and choices,
their probable trade-offs in various situations,
the possible hierarchies among such choices,
the intergenerational (for present as well as
future generations) choices and capabilities
(which reflect the notion of sustainability) and
human development in situations of shocks
and vulnerabilities will have to be revisited to
make the current framework more robust and
relevant for the future.

Thinking on some of these issues has already
begun. New notions of human well-being (such
as subjective well-being and happiness) have
been proposed, and alternative options for
measuring it have been constructed (box 2.3).
Even for human development measures, several
innovative approaches have been experimented

with in some national human development
reports (for example, using child mortality as
the indicator for a long and healthy life in cal-
culating the HDI for Madhya Pradesh, India).
The above considerations imply that assess-
ing human well-being in a changed world has
to go beyond what was developed 25 years
ago. The need for exploring new measures
and tools for monitoring and assessing human
well-being has become more pronounced as
the world has been discussing the Post-2015
Development Agenda and the Sustainable
Development Goals, successors to the
Millennium Development Goals. The agenda
and the goals are expected to provide a big push
in overcoming the remaining human develop-
ment gaps and challenges in coming years, but
fresher, innovative and relevant assessment
tools are needed for monitoring. Measuring
environmental sustainability and integrating it
with overall measures for human well-being are
priorities.

Three other challenges need to be addressed.
First, measures and indicators have to be iden-
tified so that the impacts of policy measures
can be quickly captured. Second, available
measures are often inadequate for assessing
human well-being at times of shocks and vul-
nerabilities; measures and indicators that can
forecast and capture the impacts of shocks and
vulnerabilities should be considered. Third,
measures that are agile enough to provide quick
policy guidance have to be explored.

All these measures will require robust,
consistent and credible data. Taking that
into account and also considering a much

more ambitious international agenda like
the Post-2015 Development Agenda and the
Sustainable Development Goals, the High
Level Panel on the Post-2015 Agenda con-
vened by the UN Secretary-General in 2014
called for a data revolution. It emphasized the
need to leave no one behind in the context of
the Post-2015 Development Agenda and to
monitor the progress in achieving the agenda.
Three issues need highlighting:
• First, substantial quantities of real-time data
can provide better information on, say, spikes
in prices of food staples that will dispro-
portionately impact the near-poor. Sensors,
satellites and other tools produce real-time
data on activities and vulnerabilities — for
example, on deforestation, urbanization,
flooding and poverty indexing via images of
tin roofs in Africa.

• Second, “big data” analysis holds the promise
of producing highly relevant information
almost instantaneously to levels hitherto
undreamt of outside population censuses.95
For example, anonymized mobile phone
data can show flows of crowds and be used
in urban planning. Trends in millions of
searches on the Internet and users’ posts on
social media offer insights into people’s opin-
ions and priorities. Big data has the potential
to be harnessed for diverse uses, including
measurement of important indicators, cap-
turing attitudinal trends, monitoring health
epidemics and providing real-time feedback
on the efficacy of policymaking.96

Each day people send 294 billion emails,
upload 100,000 gigabytes97 of data to

To inform the public and broaden debate over the past
15 years or so, several national governments have re-
leased comprehensive reports on national well-being.
Some of the earliest initiatives came from Australia,
Ireland and the United Kingdom. Rather than using com-
posite indicators, as with the HDI, they have generally
involved a collection of individual indicators.

Other countries support subjective measures of
well-being or happiness. For example, Bhutan has a
Gross National Happiness Index. The United Kingdom

has considered talking not just about GDP but about
GWB—general well-being. This would involve generat-
ing a single number that summarizes people’s feelings
about many aspects of well-being. That might avoid the
need to assign weights to components, but it raises
questions of data reliability and makes cross-country
comparisons difficult.

All these approaches of well-being are being used
by a range of actors from government, academia, civil
society and beyond.

Many countries have
combined traditional
and new methods
of data collection

Facebook, generate 230 million tweets and
send and receive 1.3 billion gigabytes of data
over mobile phones. According to some esti-
mates, should current trends continue, there
will be 100 billion times more data in 2035
than there is today.98

Such data are expanding understanding
of causation in an increasingly complex
world and enabling rapid responses in some
humanitarian situations. But such data have
risks — the same data could be used to do
harm where privacy and anonymity are not
fully respected. Notwithstanding the evident
issues related to privacy and security, many
researchers are engaged in identifying how
this large volume of information — generated
both incidentally and deliberately as billions
of people go about their daily lives — can
support sustainability and provide usable
insights for improving lives.

• Third, many countries have combined tradi-
tional and new methods of data collection
for censuses, ranging from administrative
registers to mobile devices, geospatial in-
formation systems and the Internet. Birth
registration coverage has benefited from new
technologies: In Albania, Kosovo, Pakistan
and other countries geo-mapping technol-
ogies have helped collect and visualize birth
registration data.
In this changed and changing world, with
a new development agenda and new devel-
opment goals, human progress will depend
critically on work by humankind. And making
full use of available human potential will be an
important ingredient in overcoming existing
human development deficits and addressing
emerging human development challenges. And
that has to be done in a changing world of work
— the focus of the next chapter.

The changing world of work

Throughout history the nature of work has evolved. Changes in social, economic and political structures have changed the
when and where of work, the what of goods and services produced and the how of organizing work. The effects on human
development have been wide-ranging and complex. Some of the most dramatic changes started in the 18th century with
the industrial revolution in Europe (box 3.1).

Today, work transformations are driven by
globalization and technological revolutions,
particularly the digital revolution — the
shift from mechanical to digital technology.
Workers and employers around the globe are
increasingly linked by complex webs of trade
and migration, while financial assets cross
borders instantly. Over time companies have
restructured and dispersed their production
systems. Taking advantage of lower wages and
other costs, and in some cases operating closer
to emerging markets, they have divided their
activities into multiple units and distributed
them around the globe, locating them in coun-
tries offering not just lower wages, but also the
necessary skills and infrastructure.

A transformative force during the past 30
years, globalization has fostered worldwide
interdependence, with major impacts on pat-
terns of trade, investment, growth, and job cre-
ation and destruction, as well as on networks
of creative and volunteer work. We now seem
to be living through a new and accelerated
technological revolution — or even multiple
revolutions at the same time.

These technological revolutions are chang-
ing wages and productivity in labour markets
and workplaces through new ways of con-
tracting and subcontracting, new conditions
of work and new business and organizational
models. They are influencing the distribu-
tion of labour demand across sectors, with
implications for the processes of structural
transformation. They also influence the
quantity and quality of jobs in some sectors
and enterprises as well as the distribution of
incomes and wealth at all levels. And they
create new opportunities for creativity and
innovation and in some ways bring more
unpaid work into the public sphere. This pace
of change will not slacken — the next 20 years
will see a continuing revolution in work and

workplaces, marked by complexity, uncertain-
ty and volatility.

Against this backdrop a critical question is:
What do all these patterns mean for human
development? And more important: Are
workers, employers and policymakers prepared
to respond to the challenge of the emerging
world of work? In such a world, specific tech-
nical knowledge quickly becomes obsolete,
and the policies and rules of yesterday might
not serve the challenges of today or tomorrow.
National and international businesses, educa-
tion providers and policymakers are compelled
to keep up with these accelerated changes, to
make sense of the trends and to translate them
into sound strategies and rules that can deliver
more work — and work of higher quality — for
present and future generations. Workers face
new types of competition and challenges to
traditional forms of collective organization.

Traditional paths to development seem less
viable today. So seizing the future is not a game
of chance or fate — it is a matter of skill, fore-
sight and understanding.

Structural transformation
of work

During the past century development in
advanced economies followed a path that
was more or less linear. Activity moved from
agriculture to industry to services. The sectoral
distribution of economic activity is reflected
both in value added as a proportion of GDP
and in employment by sector. Today some
trends raise questions about whether such
linearity will persist for other workers and
economies.

First, despite a persistent drop in the con-
tribution of the agricultural sector to the
economy, many workers remain in agriculture,

BOX 3.1

An encapsulated history of work

At one point in human civilization there were farmers
and animal husbandmen. Life was, per Hobbes, “nasty,
brutish and short.” Taxes and other requirements im-
posed by chiefs, landlords or the state were onerous.
Many people were serfs or slaves, devoid of autonomy
and dignity. Save for the lucky few, poverty and injus-
tices were the norm.

Then came the industrial revolution. Men and
women flocked from the countryside to towns to satisfy
factories’ growing demand for labour. The new tech-
nologies in transport, cotton textiles, and iron and steel
delivered steadily rising labour productivity. But for de-
cades few of these benefits trickled to the workers who
worked long hours in stifling conditions, were jammed
into packed housing and saw little rise in earnings.

Eventually capitalism transformed itself, and its
gains began to be shared more widely. This was in part
because wages naturally began to rise as the surplus
of workers from the countryside dried up. But equally
important, workers organized themselves and began to
claim their rights. It was not just their grievances that
gave their demands urgency. The conditions of modern
industrial production also made it more difficult for the
elites to pursue their usual tactics of divide and rule.
Factory work, concentrated in major cities, facilitated
coordination among labourers, mass mobilization and
militant activism.

Fearing revolution, the industrialists compromised.
Political rights and the right to vote were extended to the
working class. And democracy in turn tamed capitalism.
Conditions in the workplace improved as state-mandated
or negotiated arrangements reduced working hours and
increased safety, along with vacations, family health care
and other benefits. Public investment in education and
training made workers more productive and freer to exer-
cise choice. Labour’s share of the enterprise surplus rose.
Factory jobs provided blue-collar work that enabled a
middle-class existence, with all its lifestyle opportunities.

Technological progress fostered industrial capital-
ism but eventually undermined it. Labour productivity
rose much faster in manufacturing industries than in
the rest of the economy. This meant that the same or
higher quantity of steel, cars or electronics could be pro-
duced with far fewer workers. Manufacturing’s share of
total employment began to decline steadily in all the
advanced industrial countries after the Second World
War. Workers moved to service industries — education,
health, entertainment and public administration. Thus
was born the post-industrial economy.

Work became more pleasant for some but not all.
For those with the skills, capital and savvy to prosper in
the post-industrial age, services offered inordinate op-
portunities. Bankers, consultants and engineers earned
much higher wages. Equally important, office work
allowed a degree of freedom and personal autonomy
that factory work had never provided. Hours may have
been long — longer perhaps than in factory work — but
service professionals enjoyed much greater control over
their daily lives and workplace decisions. Teachers,
nurses and waiters were paid not nearly as well, but
they too were released from the humdrum mechanical
drudgery of the shop floor.

However, the post-industrial economy opened a
new chasm between those with good jobs in services —
stable, high-paying and rewarding — and those with bad
jobs — fleeting, low-paying and unsatisfying. Two things
determined the mix between the two types of jobs and
the extent of inequality that the post-industrial transi-
tion produced. First, the greater the education and skill
level of the workforce, the higher the wages in general.
Second, the greater the institutionalization of labour
markets in services (not just manufacturing), the higher
the quality of service jobs in general. So inequality, ex-
clusion and duality became more marked in countries
where skills were poorly distributed, and many services
approximated the textbook ideal of spot markets.

The importance
of agriculture as
a source of work
will remain high

particularly in South Asia and Sub- Saharan
Africa. In other words, although the impor-
tance of agriculture to economies may be
dropping — in 2010 it accounted for only
3.1 percent of GDP — the importance of ag-
riculture to workers, albeit declining, remains
high — in 2010, 33.1 percent of the world’s
labour force worked in agriculture (figure 3.1).1
Second, job growth and economic activity in
industry have been sluggish in recent years.

Global value added in industry declined from
32.8 percent of GDP in 1995 to 26.9 percent in
2010,2 and employment rose only 1.2 percent-
age points.3 Third, the service sector is growing
rapidly, and many people are finding work
there, but the jobs are not all or even primarily
in high-tech advanced services.

Each of these trends has implications for how
policymakers and individuals prepare for the
future of work and for how efforts should be

focused to bolster positive links between work
and human development.

Agriculture

Though now with a smaller proportion of
national output, agriculture is still an impor-
tant source of work, with 1.34 billion people
worldwide working in or seeking work in agri-
culture.4 Most of this work is on family farms.
Some 70–80 percent of the world’s agricultural
land is managed by more than 500 million
family farms whose workers, mostly family,
produce more than 80 percent of the world’s
food.5 Around 43 percent of the agricultural la-
bour force in developing countries are women,
and in parts of Africa and Asia women account
for more than 50 percent of farmers.6

Family farms range from plots of less than 1
hectare (72 percent of family farms) to more
than 50 hectares (1 percent of family farms).7
The largest are often highly mechanized and use
improved seeds and fertilizers as well as agricul-
tural extension services. By contrast, small and
medium-sized farms in developing countries
often have limited access to resources and lower
productivity. Many workers on family farms
supplement their income with off-farm work.

Wages and productivity on these farms are
typically low, working conditions can be unsafe
and hours are unpredictable. Work is often

seasonal: Harvesting and planting demand
long work hours of all family members, in-
cluding children — around 60 percent of child
labourers work in agriculture.8 During some
parts of the year, there may be little work or
income. Given the high number of people who
depend on agriculture for their livelihoods
and the vulnerable conditions many of these
workers face, efforts to improve productivity
and working conditions in agriculture could
have considerable positive impacts on human
development. (Chapters 5 and 6 discuss these
points in detail.)

Industry

In developed and developing economies,
industry — particularly manufacturing —
remains an important source of work, account-
ing for 23.2 percent of global employment.9 But
since 1990, manufacturing as a share of total
employment has declined in many countries,
even in strong exporting countries.10 Between
2000 and 2010 employment in manufacturing
fell 8 percent in Germany and 11 percent in the
Republic of Korea.11

This is partly because manufacturing is
becoming more capital intensive. The use of
robots is on the rise. Every year an additional
200,000 industrial robots come into use. The
automotive industry, a key export industry for

many countries, is a leading purchaser of indus-
trial robots.12

Manufacturing is also more skill intensive,
and digital technology producers are demand-
ing a different set of skills. One study reports
that for a selection of corporations, 10 million
jobs in manufacturing cannot be filled because
people with the right skills are unavailable.13

At the same time, the line between man-
ufacturing and service work has become
increasingly blurred. Manufacturing firms are
now integrated production systems with such
service activities as research, sales and customer
support. In the United States 30–55 percent of
manufacturing jobs are now service activities.14
So, in the future, industry is unlikely to
absorb large numbers of rural workers. In the
past manufacturing provided work for millions
who migrated to cities — as in China. But today
these jobs are harder to find. With pressures
on manufacturing jobs from globalization and
labour-saving technologies, many countries,
particularly in Sub- Saharan Africa, face “pre-
mature deindustrialization,” a phenomenon
where opportunities in industry shrink sooner
and at much lower levels of income than for
early industrializers.15 The implications are
enormous for creating decent jobs for growing
populations and in expanding the opportuni-
ties that people have to maintain a dignified
life.

Services

Since 2002 the leading employment sector
globally has been services, which in 2013
accounted for 46 percent of all jobs.16 The
rise of service work stems from the growth of
knowledge-intensive work such as financial
and business services and technology-inten-
sive sectors, as well as low-skill work such as
food services, care work and construction —
areas crucial to human well-being but where
workers are among the most vulnerable.17 The
global exchange of goods and services and the
logistics in trade have created many new jobs.
Employment in trade and distribution services
has absorbed most workers in the service sector
since 1960, with the highest increases between
1990 and 2010.18

In many respects the service sector masks a
vast array of tasks, skill requirements and work

conditions that influence human development
in different ways. Highly skilled, highly remu-
nerated knowledge workers apply and produce
new technologies that can enhance human pro-
gress, as discussed below. Care workers provide
essential services that enhance human welfare,
but the conditions of their work vary (see chap-
ters 1 and 4). In addition, service work includes
innovative, creative and cultural services (see
chapter 1).

The growing dominance of work in services
calls for policy attention to the sector, which is
likely to continue employing most people. The
aims should be to ensure that essential services
for human development and technological pro-
gress are sustained, to enable workers providing
these services to gain the requisite skills and
to protect service workers against inadequate
wages and exploitative work conditions.

Technological revolution

Today the types of work that people do and the
ways they carry out tasks are being transformed
by new technologies. This is not new, but it is
reshaping the links between work and human
development and the types of policies and in-
stitutions needed to foster positive outcomes
for people’s well-being.

History has witnessed two industrial revolu-
tions, each associated with a general-purpose
technology — a small group of technological
innovations so powerful that they interrupt
and accelerate the normal march of progress.
The first was driven by steam, the second by
electricity. The third revolution is unfolding
now — driven by computers and networks. If
directed towards expanding opportunities and
building capabilities, the current technological
revolution stands to vastly improve people’s
lives. But transformations that are rapid and
widespread — that reshape the fabric of socie-
ties and revolutionize work — can be inherently
disruptive in the short run, however positive in
the long. Some workers will be in a position to
adjust faster and see more positive outcomes
than others.

Some of the technologies with the highest
potential to change the nature of work include:19
• Mobile Internet affects the lives of 3.2 bil-
lion Internet users. There are more than

7.1 billion mobile subscriptions, which are
changing the way people work, innovate,
interact and do business.

• Automation of knowledge work, through
intelligent software systems, is transforming
the organization and productivity of knowl-
edge work and could enable millions to use
intelligent digital assistants.

• Cloud technology has the potential to improve
access to online information technology ser-
vices for businesses and governments at low
costs — and to enable new online products
and services for billions of consumers and
millions of businesses.

• 3D printing is reshaping work because it can
produce anything from industrial prototypes
to human tissue. One of the largest global
networks of 3D printers operates in 110
countries, with 9,000 machines that it rents
out by the hour.20 It enables on-demand pro-
duction and has the potential to affect the
jobs of 320 million manufacturing workers
in the world today — 12 percent of the global
workforce. Disabled workers have also ben-
efited. The world’s first 3D lab for printing
prosthetics is in South Sudan: Project Daniel
was started in 2013 to make prosthetic limbs
for Daniel Omar, a young man who lost both
arms in a bomb explosion. Today the printers
can produce only a narrow range of goods,
but the future could be very different. These
machines could permanently disrupt the pre-
vious model of long runs of identical goods
in factories, opening opportunities for indi-
viduals and smaller companies to participate
in decentralized production. As the capacity
of these machines advances, some expect
that human workers, particularly those who
are less skilled, may suffer in tighter job
markets.21

• Advanced robotics are taking the automation
of manufacturing to new levels. People have
long anticipated that technology using artifi-
cial intelligence would displace the need for
human thought. At higher thought levels,
this has proved difficult. But for less complex
tasks, greater knowledge and skills are being
embedded in individual items of technology.
Previously “dumb” equipment from vacuum
cleaners to weighing scales, fitted with camer-
as, sensors and processors, is becoming more
responsive to human interaction. And pieces

of equipment once confined to military ap-
plications, such as drones, are now appearing
in civilian life. Many of these objects are be-
ing connected to each other, allowing them
to intercommunicate through the “Internet
of things.”

Automation is taking place at a fast rate
(sales of industrial robots are estimated to
have grown 170 percent between 2009 and
2011, despite the financial crisis),22 and the
total number of robots is expected to reach
1.5 million in 2015.23 Robots have helped
make the workplace safer, as some take on
jobs that are too dangerous, such as locating
radiation sources. Robots are also crucial in
efforts to revive or preserve manufacturing
where labour is scarce or expensive. Robots
that carry out routine tasks may cost a com-
pany less than labour — for example, in some
German plants robots doing routine work
costs about €5 an hour over their lifetime
(including maintenance and energy costs),
whereas the cost of a German worker (in-
cluding wages, pensions and health care)
runs to about €40 an hour.24 Furthermore,
robots will soon be able to carry out more
complex tasks as artificial intelligence takes
hold in factories. The potential implications
for jobs are obvious. All these phenomena
have been referred to in recent times as the
fourth industrial revolution (box 3.2).25

• Energy storage will allow maximum use of
solar and wind energy, potentially bringing
access to affordable electricity to the 1.2 bil-
lion people who do not have it. In due time,
energy storage could also make electric cars
more affordable and transform electricity
grids — providing new jobs.
In addition, driverless vehicles, advanced ma-
terials, advanced oil and gas exploration and re-
covery technologies, big data, biotechnologies
and renewable energy technologies all feature
in the technological revolution.

A few characteristics of the current techno-
logical revolution present unique challenges
and opportunities for human development,
as achieved through work. First, the speed of
technological change and penetration is mind
boggling, marked by impressively quick adop-
tion of new technologies (figure 3.2). Just two
years after Apple shipped the first iPad, it sold
67 million units. It took 24 years to sell that

BOX 3.2

The fourth industrial revolution

During the fourth industrial revolution, not only individu-
al machines, but also entire factories become smart and
automated, making the production process more precise
and the products more customized. Digital technologies
will allow products to control their own assembly as
they communicate specific production requirements
(colour, size, material) and steps to machines that can
in turn communicate with each another to control the
speed and flow of assembly lines.

Factories in Germany are leading the way in ex-
periments with smart factories as part of the coun-
try’s Industrie 4.0 vision. The state has allotted over
€200 million for research in academia, business and
government to support the digitalization of traditional
industry.1 Siemens has already built a digitized pilot
factory in Amberg to produce electronics to be used in
other smart factories. Production at the factory is largely
automated — people handle only 25 percent of the work,
while machines and computers manage 75 percent of
the value chain. Human hands touch the product only
at the beginning of the process when a circuit board is
placed on the assembly line. The plant was established

in 1989, and although the size of the plant and the num-
ber of employees (1,200) has not changed, output has
increased eightfold, and production quality is an unprec-
edented 99.9988 percent.2

Smart factories have the potential to use real-time
data to provide high- and consistent-quality customized
products at competitive costs. But what are the implica-
tions for jobs? Many argue that humans will remain rel-
evant, but the value added in manufacturing will come
from the programming and servicing of machines and
computers rather than manual labour. In this scenario
skills and knowledge may become as or even more im-
portant than wages, and the centres of manufacturing
may shift towards countries with an educated labour
force and plenty of capital to invest in smart factories
and sophisticated machines.

The impacts of the fourth industrial revolution
may not be limited to developed countries; in fact, the
effects of robotic sewing machines are expected to
be much wider, including on jobs in developing coun-
tries that traditionally count on low-cost, low-skilled
labour.3

and more than three years to sell that many
iPhones.26 The pace of technology penetration
is illustrated in figure 3.3 for Internet use and
mobile phones. Not only is the change substan-
tial, adoption is widespread and holds promise
to benefit people around the world.

This is because many technologies are in
some sense universal machines that have ap-
plications in almost all sectors, industries and
tasks, sweeping across all areas of production:
manufacturing, services and agriculture. So
agriculture can no longer be considered low-
tech. Workers in all sectors will be challenged
to be more educated, more flexible and more
technologically savvy.

But some argue that recent progress in com-
puting and automation could be less transform-
ative for human development than such past
innovations as electrification, cars and perhaps
even indoor plumbing.27 Previous advances
that enabled people to communicate and travel
quickly over long distances connected the
world and may end up being more important to

society’s advancement than anything to come
in the 21st century.28 But this also depends on
future innovations and how they are applied.
Others note that the pace of technological
development has stalled in fields that have
tended to push the boundaries of knowledge
and expand human progress, including en-
ergy, pharmaceuticals, space exploration and
nanotechnology.29

All emerging technologies are expected to
have massive economic and social impacts.
Technologies that combine with and reinforce
globalization are expected to transform how
people live and work, create new opportunities
and business models, drive growth and change
the geography of comparative advantages for
countries. These forces may also have negative
impacts on work and workers.

Either way, the technological revolution is
unlikely to be business as usual. There are revo-
lutionary elements in this new wave, especially
in a globalized world of production and work.

Will something new affect the future of work?
And if so, what is it?

Globalizing work

Technology is affecting the nature of work by
introducing new ways of communicating, new
products and new demands for skills. New
technologies are also reinforcing and deepen-
ing previous trends in economic globalization,
bringing workers and businesses into a global
network through outsourcing and global value
chains. These processes are reshaping work and
testing national and international policies.

Until recently, workers with specific skills
were associated with particular activities in
different sectors. They competed with other
workers for jobs on a national scale. They
gained skills through their work in particular
sectors and industries, and for the most part
the pace of change in workplace organization

Chapter 3 The changing world of work | 83

In many areas of work
the labour market
is now global

and products was slow enough for them to
adjust.

In many areas of work the labour market is
now global. Multinational corporations have
access to labour around the world, and work-
ers must compete on a global scale for jobs.
Digital technologies heighten the competition
by removing geographical barriers between
workers and work demands — in many cases it
is not even necessary for a company to move
physically or for a worker to migrate. The work
connection can be made through the Internet
or mobile phones. That there is a global labour
surplus makes competition among workers
even fiercer.

Consumer demands have also evolved with
expectations for low-priced consumer goods,
for fresh and new products and for digital ac-
cess to products from around the world. This
has increased competition for companies to
provide cheap, innovative products that cater
to rapidly changing trends, all the more so as
digital technologies allow companies immedi-
ate and constant access to information on con-
sumer habits and interests. A flexible approach
to production and cost cutting, including
labour costs, has been the producer response.
Low labour costs and flexible commitments to
workers allow companies to quickly and effi-
ciently respond to shifts in consumer needs and
in the location of demand.

For workers these trends are aligning to
create a world of work where creativity, skills,
ingenuity and flexibility are critical. But even
for those who are well positioned to compete in
the emerging work system, security is lacking.
Around 26 percent of workers worldwide have
permanent contracts, around 13 percent have
temporary or fixed-term contracts and 61 per-
cent are working without a contract.30 With
just 30 percent of the world’s labour force cov-
ered by unemployment protection, a world of
work that values flexibility may be a challenge
to the stability of worker’s lives.31

Outsourcing

One way companies have responded to increas-
ing market competition and cost pressure is
to relocate some functions to countries with
lower wages or to subcontract some noncore
activities to companies in countries where costs

are lower (or to mix the two approaches). For
example, Apple directly employs only 63,000
of the more than 750,000 people around the
world who design, sell, manufacture and assem-
ble its products.32 In the hotel industry many
employees are not direct employees of the hotel
brand but temporary workers of other compa-
nies that do work in laundry, catering, cleaning
or gardening. In other sectors the goods and
services supply chain has been sliced up and
subcontracted to many different employers.33

One of the biggest consequences of glo-
balization from a work perspective is business
process outsourcing, which has decentralized
business services away from corporate head-
quarters. Business process outsourcing works
through companies — for example, in India it
works through major information technology
enterprises. Such phenomena generate gains for
some and losses for others.

Assembly jobs in developed countries
began moving to export processing zones as
developing countries adopted export-oriented
industrialization. The impact on job creation
in large developing countries such as China
and Mexico, as well as smaller countries such
as Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Sri
Lanka, was considerable and positive, particu-
larly for women, who often worked in garment
factories.34 In many cases outsourcing has pro-
vided a boost to local development, although
the quality of the work and enforcement of
labour standards have varied (box 3.3).

Global offshoring — outsourcing production
or service provision abroad — of service jobs
started to pick up in the 1990s as advances in
information and communications technology
allowed many support services to be performed
offsite. With the burst of the dotcom bubble
in 2001–2002, technology companies further
explored cost-cutting measures involving
relocating noncore activities to lower wage
countries with high technical skills, particularly
India. Between 2000 and 2010 the number of
direct jobs in information and communications
technology in India jumped from 284,000
to 2.26 million.35 In recent years India has
maintained a strong position as an offshoring
destination for service jobs, but offshoring des-
tinations are becoming increasingly diverse.36
Services are growing in the Russian Federation,
Africa and Latin America, in part matching

Bosnia and Herzegovina — local development through outsourcing

As Poland and Slovakia become epicentres of the servic-
es industry in Europe and emerge as leaders of the digi-
tal revolution in Central and Eastern Europe, Bosnia and
Herzegovina is developing into an outsourcing target
for large industrial and automotive corporations. In the
never-ending search for skilled and low-cost labour, the
production of automotive parts is steadily moving from
centres in Germany to the Czech Republic and Slovakia
and farther east towards Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Outsourcing in Bosnia and Herzegovina is still rela-
tively new and limited, but progress is visible through
a decrease in local unemployment and an increase
in entrepreneurship and local start-ups. For example,

opportunities for people in the municipalities of Gorazde
and Zepce have been greatly enhanced by an influx of
investment from Western European automotive corpo-
rations. Local economic transformation bolsters local
human development. A notable result in Gorazde is the
unemployment rate among women, which is much lower
than in the country as a whole. Successful women-owned
businesses employ hundreds of workers, more than
40 percent of them women (above the national average
of 34 percent), many in top managerial positions. These
patterns show promise, reminiscent of Slovakia in the
mid-1990s, when relatively small outsourcing invest-
ments came in, paving the way for bigger inflows later on.

companies’ interests in diversifying into differ-
ent time zones to enable 24-hour service.37

In developed countries offshoring has been
viewed as a cause of job losses, raising fears that
all such jobs will move away. In manufacturing
the process started in the 1960s and 1970s as
production began shifting towards national,
regional and global production networks, the
most modern and pervasive form of industrial
production. However, estimates of the conse-
quences of offshoring for workers in developed
countries vary, and the long-term impacts are
less clear than the short-term ones. Job losses
are greater in manufacturing than in services.
A 1 percent increase in imported intermediate
manufactured goods reduces manufacturing
employment in the importing country an esti-
mated 0.15 percent, and a 1 percent increase
in imported intermediate services reduces ser-
vices employment 0.08 percent.38 Offshoring-
related job losses vary across countries, too,
with short-term losses found to range from
zero in some countries to 0.7 percent of all job
losses in the Netherlands to almost 55 percent
in Portugal.39

Today jobs that involve administrative sup-
port, business and financial operations, and
computer and mathematical tasks are most
likely to be outsourced. In Australia, Canada
and the United States 20–29 percent of jobs
have the potential to be offshored, though it
is unlikely that all of them will be.40 Many of
those jobs are medium- and high-skill service

professions that can be carried out at lower cost
abroad as education levels rise and communi-
cations infrastructures improve in developing
countries.

So, while there may be immense benefits in
access to new jobs in countries hosting offshore
activities, individuals losing jobs, particularly in
developed countries, may require training and
new skills for a more competitive environment.
To ease the adjustment for workers whose
livelihoods are threatened by trade-related job
displacement, programmes are needed to help
people find new work, enhance their skills and
maintain access to a basic income. Likewise,
training can enhance the abilities of workers
in developing countries to access jobs created
through offshoring.

Global value chains

Many economic activities are integrated into
global production networks and global value
chains that span multiple countries and some-
times continents. This integration goes from
provision of raw materials and subcomponents
to market access and after-sales services. Thus
production is performed within complex
and dynamic economic networks made up of
inter- and intra-firm relationships and global
networks, where the relationships are “many-
to-many” rather than “one-to-the-next.”41

With the transition to global value chains,
production is no longer about one company

Chapter 3 The changing world of work | 85

in one industry offshoring a particular activity
to a single destination. It is about intermediate
goods and services organized in fragmented
and internationally dispersed production pro-
cesses that are coordinated by multinational
companies and cut across industries. The
production of any given component or service
is produced by a network of affiliates, con-
tractual partners and arm’s-length suppliers
that are often in developing countries and
operating under a headquarters that is often
in a developed country. There has been a shift
from sector-based globalization to the globali-
zation of stages and tasks of production.42 The
coordination required to make this form of
production work has been facilitated by the
digital revolution and advances in information
and communication technology.

The number of people employed in these
global value chains is high and rising: In 40
countries with data, an estimated one in five
people was working in global value chains
in 2013 — or 453 million people (up from
296 million in 1995), including 190 million
women.43

The integration of developing countries into
global value chains has increased opportunities
for paid work and prompted a shift in labour
force participation for women (many of whom
find jobs in the garment industry). Investments
benefit young people who can learn new skills
that they can use throughout their working
lives. But jobs are needed for women of all ages
and skill levels. There are concerns that many
factories tend to employ only young women
with low skill levels, with fewer opportunities
for older female workers or those with high
skill levels. There are also concerns about levels
of labour protection.

The benefits to workers and economies asso-
ciated with participation in global value chains
are not preordained. Integration in global
value chains affects dimensions of human de-
velopment differently and often in contradic-
tory ways. Such integration does not say much
about the quality of work in globally integrated
factories and whether workers have — or have
not — expanded their human capabilities.

Moreover, the global value chain system
generates winners and losers, within and across
countries and industries. The footloose nature
of global value chains can generate less job

security and put pressure on governments and
subcontractors to minimize costs. This in turn
puts pressure on workers’ wages and working
conditions, particularly among the low-skilled.
Developing countries also face the risk of
becoming locked into low–value added nodes
of global value chains that limit work oppor-
tunities, skills development and technology
exposure.

The transition towards global value chains
has introduced new complexities for workers
in developed and developing countries alike.
There are questions about how much workers
gain by partaking in work that contributes to
global value chains versus work that falls out-
side them. There is some evidence that produc-
tivity is higher in global value chain–oriented
work but that wages are the same for workers
inside and outside global value chains,44 raising
questions about how the increases in produc-
tivity are shared between workers and capital.

Market pressures that are transmitted
through global value chains tend to be ab-
sorbed by workers — whether as wages driven
down by global competition, increased infor-
malization and contractual insecurity brought
about by multiple subcontracting chains (creat-
ing exposure to price volatility that originates
beyond local markets and national boundaries)
or in the form of layoffs during downturns. In
a competitive global economy multinationals
increasingly rely on a disenfranchised work-
force, using a mix of fixed-term employees,
temporary workers, independent contractors,
project-based workers and outsourced workers
to provide production flexibility and manage
costs.45 Participation in value chains provides
some with secure, decent jobs and others
with more precarious work (even in the same
country and sector). Temporary workers often
work alongside those with long-term positions,
creating a type of labour dualism.

Despite the challenges, policy attention co-
ordinated at the national, regional and global
levels can help people flourish in a global work
environment shaped by global value chains. But
this will take far more than business-as-usual
policies or small policy steps. Chapter 6 pro-
vides some examples of the types of policies
that can help workers and countries thrive
when work becomes more flexible and cuts
across national borders.

The digital revolution
is accelerating
globalization and
changing the
world of work

Work in the digital age

The digital revolution deserves attention in its
own right because of the changes it is creating
in the world of work and because of the way
it is accelerating globalization. In recent years
the digital revolution has accelerated the global
production of goods and services, particularly
digital trade (figure 3.4). In 2014 global trade
in goods reached $18.9 trillion and trade in
services $4.9 trillion.46

The knowledge-intensive portion of global
flows increasingly dominates — and is growing
faster than — capital- and labour-intensive flows.
Today knowledge-intensive flows account for
half of global flows, and shares are increasing:
Knowledge-intensive goods flows are growing
at 1.3 times the rate of labour-intensive goods
flows.47 As a result, the digital components of
goods and services flows have also increased
(figure 3.5). Indeed, many goods today, as
demonstrated by the “app economy,” are entire-
ly virtual. Much of the data pass through the
Internet, often on smartphones. Today there
are more than 7 billion mobile subscriptions,
2.3 billion people on smart phones and about
3.2 billion people connected to the Internet.48

everywhere, but the effects vary across countries
according to their own social and development
contexts. Some technological changes are
cross-cutting, such as information and commu-
nication technologies and the spread of mobile
phones and other handheld devices. Still, coun-
tries will continue to have divergent production
and employment structures and different uses
for digital technologies, largely reflecting the
relative economic weights of agriculture, indus-
try and services, as well as the resources invested
in developing people’s capabilities. Labour
markets, the ratio of paid to unpaid work and
the predominant types of workplaces in each
country differ — so the impacts of digital tech-
nologies on work will vary accordingly.

The digital revolution may be associated with
high-tech industries, but it is also influencing
a whole range of more informal activities from
agriculture to street vending. Some may be
directly related to mobile devices. In Ethiopia
farmers use mobile phones to check coffee pric-
es.49 In Saudi Arabia farmers use wireless tech-
nologies to carefully distribute scarce irrigated
water for wheat cultivation.50 In some villages
in Bangladesh female entrepreneurs use their
phones to provide paid services for neighbours.
Many people sell phone cards or sell and repair
mobile phones across developing countries.

Mobile phones now facilitate many aspects
of work through a combination of voice calls,
SMS and mobile applications. Some uses of
mobile phones in agriculture are shown in
figure 3.6. But there are also benefits for many
other types of activities, formal and informal,
paid and unpaid, from food vendors in Cairo
to street cleaners in Senegal to care providers in
London. Mobile phone–based economic activ-
ity is likely to keep expanding rapidly. In Sub-
Saharan Africa unique mobile subscriptions are
predicted to rise from 311 million in 2013 to
504 million in 2020 (figure 3.7).51

Mobile phones and mobile Internet service
offer many new opportunities and advantages
to workers and to economies more generally:
• Access to dynamic price information. In India
farmers and fishers who track weather condi-
tions and compare wholesale prices through
mobile phones increased their profits 8 per-
cent, and better access to information resulted
in a 4 percent drop in prices for consumers.52
Similarly, in Niger the use of mobile phones re-
duced differences in grain prices across markets
within the country by 10 percent.53 Mobile
phones empower workers with information.
• Productivity gains. In countries as diverse as
Malaysia, Mexico and Morocco, small and

medium-sized enterprises with Internet ac-
cess averaged an 11 percent productivity gain
by reducing transaction costs and barriers to
market entry.54

• Job creation. The Internet and mobile technol-
ogies create new jobs directly through demand
for labour from new technology-based enter-
prises and indirectly through demand from
the wider ecosystem of companies created to
support technology-based enterprises. Indirect
jobs include network installation, mainte-
nance providers and providers of skill-based
services such as advertising and accounting.
• Supply chain management. Small businesses
can keep track of supplies and deliveries
and increase efficiency. This can help with
everything from reducing food waste to in-
creasing access to jobs in global value chains.
• Better services. Mobile phones are extending
the reach of agricultural extension services.
In India, Kenya and Uganda farmers can call
or text hotlines to ask for technical agricul-
tural services.55 One application developed
in Kenya is iCow, which helps cattle farmers
maximize breeding potential by tracking
their animals’ fertility cycles.

• Labour market services. Mobile services can
match employees with vacancies. In South

Africa the extension of mobile phone cover-
age is associated with a 15 percent increase
in employment, mostly for women.56 Many
job-matching companies allow jobseekers
to have real-time information on vacancies,
while helping employers extend recruitment
systems to entry-level and low-skill jobs.57
Voice messages are particularly useful for
recruiting jobseekers who have difficulty
reading and writing.

• Mobile banking. Mobile phones can trans-
fer funds and make payments. So garment
workers or fruit vendors working in urban
areas can quickly make transactions and send
money back to rural households. Some of the
most advanced services for mobile money
have been developed in South Asia, as with
bKash in Bangladesh, and in Sub- Saharan
Africa, as with M-Pesa in Kenya.

• Access to finance. Small businesses can use
online services to access finance from in-
terested parties around the world. CARE
International has a system that allows
potential investors to browse the profiles
and small business ideas of people in 10

countries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Individuals can invest as little as $25.58
These are among the myriad advantages of
having Internet and mobile phone access for
workers and economies. Access empowers
people to harness their creativity and ingenuity
through work for productivity- and human
development–enhancing purposes. Much more
is possible, particularly if efforts are made to en-
sure equitable access to the Internet and mobile
phones, especially for women and people in
rural areas. One study estimates that if Internet
access in developing countries were the same as
in developed countries, an estimated $2.2 tril-
lion in GDP and more than 140 million new
jobs — 44 million of them in Africa and 65 mil-
lion of them in India — could be generated.
Long-term productivity in developing coun-
tries could be boosted up to 25 percent.59

output and employment, has the potential to

empower millions with new ways of working
and new jobs. But activities are also moving
beyond employment and jobs in the traditional
sense, and the nature of work as an individual
market-based activity is bound to shift. Artificial
intelligence will most certainly disrupt business
as usual. And in some cases new forms of collab-
oration, sharing and innovation will shift work
towards a more social experience.

New producers

A distinctive feature of the digital economy
is the prospect of zero marginal cost, where
digitized knowledge in data and applications,
once generated, can be reproduced endlessly
at almost no extra cost. Low- or no-cost repro-
duction expands access to the fruits of work
but may create few additional jobs. Twitter had
302 million monthly active users as of March
2015, who created or transmitted information
and news through 500 million Tweets per
day,60 but only 3,900 employees, half of them
engineers.61

A second major feature of the digital econ-
omy that affects whether work translates into
jobs and employment is that some of the goods
and services people consume are produced by
consumers themselves — they have become
“prosumers.” The most direct example is prob-
ably Wikipedia, which has more than 73,000
active voluntary contributors.62 The free online
encyclopaedia competes directly with paid
information services such as Encyclopaedia
Britannica, which in 2012 ceased publication
of its print edition after 244 years.63

Similar movements in work are occurring in
the physical world. New technologies, some of
them mentioned earlier in the chapter, enable
radically new and generally more decentralized
forms of production and consumption. One
example is energy. Households have long been
able to generate their own electricity using
wind turbines, but now with smart grids they
may be able to sell their surplus power to the
grid, gaining financial returns from previously
unpaid work.

Personalized services and goods

Technology has also been transforming mar-
kets as many personal services move online.

Customers can now use the Internet to buy
groceries, order from restaurants, make hotel
and airline bookings and hire help for house-
cleaning or childcare. Online services require
less commitment than employing service
providers full-time and allow customers to use
services occasionally. The online system can
also provide temporary work opportunities for
those who seek extra paid work or women who
want a flexible schedule. Online task service
companies allow people to pay providers to run
errands such as shopping or queuing for theatre
tickets. Online translation services offer clients
the option to employ translators case by case,
some of whom are students looking for flexible
work.

The digital revolution has also revolutionized
creative work and empowered small producers
and artisans. It is possible, through sites such as
eBay and Etsy, for artisans to find buyers look-
ing for specific or niche products. Authors and
artists can self-publish and share their creations
around the world, whether as e-books, music
downloads or video clips. And smartphones
have created a new mass market for small-scale
software designers targeting specific needs.
Online stores sell individual apps that enable
users to do everything from monitor their
health to learn languages to play games. The
resulting app economy has developed at break-
neck speed. One study claims that in 2013 the
app economy provided some form of work for
750,000 people in the United States alone.64

New business services

With the extension of the Internet to house-
holds it has become possible for individuals
to provide business process services from
their homes. This often involves specialized
white-collar skills such as computer program-
ming, copywriting and back-office legal tasks.
These tasks, generally for firms in developed
countries, are carried out by people in such
developing countries as Bangladesh, India and
the Philippines.

Much of this business is mediated by compa-
nies that coordinate freelancers with small and
medium-sized firms that require business ser-
vices. Coordination companies collect a com-
mission from the freelancer, but often charge
no fee to those offering the jobs. Most of this

Technology has also

markets

90 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

Another emerging
trend with the potential
to reshape work is
the sharing economy

work has been done in urban areas, but there
are now efforts to extend the opportunities to
more deprived areas through “impact sourc-
ing”—a form of socially responsible outsourc-
ing that seeks to create jobs for disadvantaged
groups.65 This would create potential for more
rural employment.

The sharing economy

Another emerging trend with the potential
to reshape work is the sharing economy. It is
now possible to match demand and supply
between individual producers and consumers.
Alternatives to taxis allow people to use their
own cars to provide ride services, blurring the
distinction between professional drivers and
those who have a spare seat in their private
car. Technology is also allowing traditional
taxi drivers to work more efficiently finding
customers via online services such as Uber and
GrabTaxi, which operates in several countries
in South-East Asia. The same principle is be-
ing used by auto rickshaw drivers in India via
mGaadi. Other companies allow people to rent
out accommodation in their private homes
(such as Airbnb).

These arrangements enable people to make
better use of capital assets such as cars or homes.
But they can also replace more traditional jobs
if they compete with conventional hotels and
transport services, such as taxi drivers and
hotel staff, who are generally low skilled and
poorly paid. There are also new challenges to
regulating services, ensuring consistent quality
and protecting consumers. In some ways the
professionalization of work is reversing.

Start-ups

Technology has made it easier to start a busi-
ness, an attractive option for young people,
some of whom are leaving fairly prestigious jobs
to do just that. When individuals have iden-
tified a good idea in the course of their work
and want to pursue it on their own, they have
more tools at their disposal to support their en-
trepreneurial efforts. Indeed, a recent estimate
indicates that in countries with 73 percent of
the world’s population, there are 455 million
entrepreneurs today, up from 400 million in
2011.66

These (often young) people see entrepre-
neurship as a viable alternative to traditional
jobs and as a means to pursue their dreams.
Start-ups are taking root in both developed and
developing countries. Asia is embracing them
quite rapidly. Young people see a lot of oppor-
tunities, bolstered by financial technology and
big data.67 Yet start-ups face challenges. Access
to capital is one, ideas that are sustainable
another. In developing countries weaker legal
institutions pose a problem. And long-term
viability is their largest challenge (box 3.4).

Crowdworking

In addition to working as individual contractors
online, employees are also finding work through
more casual channels as crowdworkers. This
work generally involves “human intelligence
tasks,” and pay and work conditions are less
than ideal. Major players in the market include
Clickworker, Cloud Work, Casting Words
and Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. Amazon’s
Mechanical Turk is the largest market, with a
global pool of half a million workers.68 As of
July 2015, there were more than 325,000 hu-
man intelligence tasks available for workers.69

Service requesters are free to withhold
payment if they are dissatisfied with the work
that Mechanical Turk provides. They can also
give a bad rating: A Turker (a worker with
Mechanical Turk) who receives several bad
ratings is barred from similar tasks. There are
attempts to improve the quality of work and
the quality of services, so that the two reinforce
one another (box 3.5).

The knowledge economy

In recent years knowledge has become central
to production. Even in manufacturing, the
value of finished goods increasingly derives
from embodied knowledge. For example, the
price of a top-end smartphone is driven less
by the cost of components and assembly and
more by the high charge for sophisticated de-
sign and engineering.70 In 2012 research and
development, combined with skilled labour,
made up a large share of the value in nearly half
the total trade in knowledge-intensive goods,
services and finance — worth nearly $13 tril-
lion.71 And this proportion is growing steadily

Challenges for start-ups in the Arab States

A 2013 survey of the challenges facing start-ups in the
Arab States that covered more than 700 entrepreneurs,
nearly half in technology (including software develop-
ment and services, e-commerce and online services,
gaming, and telecoms and mobile services) yielded nu-
merous findings.

Most entrepreneurs were male who started their
companies in their late 20s or early 30s, held univer-
sity degrees, had studied or worked abroad and part-
nered with co-founders. The average age of surveyed
entrepreneurs was 32.5, and most companies were less
than five years old. Over 75 percent of the companies
had male founders; only 23 percent of entrepreneurs
were female. Nearly all entrepreneurs surveyed had at
least a bachelor’s degree. In the next one or two years,
70 percent planned to open new offices, either in new
countries or in countries where they already operated.

Many hoped to expand into the United Arab Emirates
(39 percent) and Saudi Arabia (38 percent). In terms of
financing, nearly all entrepreneurs had used their per-
sonal savings or support from family or friends, while
24 percent benefited from angel investment—financial
backing from an affluent individual. A notable share
reported not receiving support from commercial banks.
A quarter of the entrepreneurs indicated that ob-
taining investment was a challenge. A larger pool
of capital, comprising different types and sources of
funding, could improve access to finance. Many com-
panies pointed to challenges in finding partners to help
expansion abroad, as well as general costs and legal
hurdles. Female representation was low in all start-ups.
This lack of inclusion suggests that enabling diversity
in education and gender could help expand the pool of
innovation.

Initiatives to improve crowdworking

CloudFactory engages around 3,000 crowdworkers in
Kenya and Nepal. The company aims to improve its
service by treating its contractors well. Rather than
offer an open marketplace, it handpicks, trains and
supervises its workers. CloudFactory workers need
not spend much time searching for work and gener-
ally earn between $1 and $3 an hour, fairly high for
crowdwork.

MobileWorks, a company with similar principles,
launched its LeadGenius platform in 2010 and now
has several hundred full-time workers in 50 countries.
The company targets disadvantaged and marginalized
groups, from military veterans to refugees. Unlike
most crowdwork companies, it pays by the hour. By
removing the incentive to complete assignments hast-
ily, it aims to ensure high-quality work. MobileWorks
crowdworkers can expect up to 40 hours of work a
week. Pay is almost always above the national mini-
mum wage.

while the proportion is falling for products and
services that are intensive in labour, capital or
resources rather than knowledge. This is in part
because of differences in wages across countries

participating in global value chains and the dis-
tribution of global value chain tasks between
high- and low-wage countries.

Agrarian economies still exist, although in
declining numbers. And industrial activities
persist, although they are being transformed
and replaced by computer-based technologies
and workplaces. The reality is that the growth of
knowledge societies and innovations in business
models are bringing enormous transformations
to work environments and in the skills demand-
ed for many jobs. Work environments are tech-
nology-rich, and a whole new set of occupations
has emerged based on the production, analysis,
distribution and consumption of information.72
The challenge of the skills mismatch in the
knowledge economy is due to the pace of tech-
nological innovation and to the rapid growth
in demand for new and higher skills, which is
are not forthcoming. In a survey of businesses
in eight European countries, 27 percent of po-
tential employers reported that they could not
fill vacancies because applicants lacked the nec-
essary skills.73 Some 45 percent of employers
in Greece and 47 percent in Italy also reported
that their businesses were hampered by a lack of
entry-level skills.74

Today jobs that are growing in developed
countries demand complex interaction skills

92 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

that require deep knowledge, judgement and
experience — more than routine transaction or
production skills. For example, in the European
Union 16 million jobs employing highly qual-
ified people are expected to be added between
2010 and 2020, while jobs employing people
with few or no formal qualifications are expect-
ed to decline by around 12 million.75 Many of
the jobs being created are in nontradeable ser-
vices such as health care, education and public
services, which are also areas that are funda-
mentally human development enhancing.

In developing countries, transitioning into
higher value-added services and manufacturing
is increasing demand for workers with at least a
secondary education and some vocational train-
ing, as well as for highly qualified professionals
and technicians.76 In an extremely dynamic
global market where products and processes
change rapidly, a basic education in literacy and
numeracy as well as fast and efficient continued
learning are critical. Having a core set of capa-
bilities promotes success in many aspects of
life. Cognitive and noncognitive skills (such as
conscientiousness, self-regulation, motivation
and far-sightedness) interact dynamically to
shape the evolution of subsequent capabilities.
Interventions in early childhood have the great-
est impact towards promoting these essential
skills and reflect the investments in human cap-
ital made by parents and children.77 Enriching
the early environments of disadvantaged
children can improve child outcomes and can
positively affect cognitive and noncognitive
skills. Increasingly important are the quality of
education, ability to learn and solve problems,
and e-literacy.78 Most developing countries
have attained near universal primary education,
but secondary education and high-quality edu-
cation are essential foundations for an employ-
able workforce for the future.

The knowledge intensity of work allows firms
to reduce staff in some areas. Firms can now
cut the number of workers engaged in routine
tasks, both manual and cognitive, that are fairly
easy to program and automate. A worker who
welds metal sheets can often be displaced by a
robot, which can do the job faster, more cheap-
ly and more precisely. Similarly, a bookkeeper
who performs cognitive tasks such as perform-
ing calculations can generally be replaced by a
computer programme.

In the past many successful economies
moved from low-margin, labour-intensive
goods to electronic assembly and then on to
higher manufacturing, design and manage-
ment. As described earlier, countries coming
late to the development process face what has
been referred to as “premature deindustriali-
zation” or even “nonindustrialization.”79 They
can no longer look to manufacturing to absorb
their jobless millions, since much of that work
can now be automated.

Flexible working

The digital revolution allows for more flexible
forms of work, enabling people to fit their
livelihoods and work activities around their
lives. Many people whose tasks are computer
based can theoretically work anywhere, in
cafés, trains and especially their homes. Indeed,
some employers pay for home offices. Even
using their own laptops, workers can connect
with their office systems to access emails and
files and communicate with colleagues through
teleconferencing. In 2014, 14 percent of UK
workers spent at least half their working hours
at home.80 Similarly, in the United States in
2012, 64 million people had jobs compatible
with working at home at least 50 percent of the
time.81

Flexibility at work is believed to make work-
ers more productive and less likely to switch
jobs (according to research on policies for a
flexible work–life balance).82 Recent research
from telecommunications firms showed that
flexible work schedules and telework had a
positive effect on performance through knowl-
edge sharing, cross-functional cooperation and
interorganizational involvement.83

But workplace flexibility is usually an option
only for those in formal employment. Workers
in temporary short-term work arrangements,
often paid by the hour, can attend to family
and related needs only by directly losing wages
(although freelancers with higher levels of skills
and earnings are an exception). Workers in de-
veloping countries, many in or on the brink of
poverty, can ill afford any flexibility.

Decentralized workplaces and telework have
pros and cons. Such work arrangements save
commuting time and offer flexible schedules
and greater freedom. But they reduce the

knowledge economy

opportunities for teamwork and social inter-
action and make it harder for employers to
manage workers.

These new ways of working are also reshaping
offices. In a traditional workspace, the allocated
desks might be unoccupied at least half the
time. A popular alternative is hot-desking —
making, say, seven desks available for every 10
staff — freeing space for other activities. When
knowledge workers come to their workplace,
they generally do so to brainstorm, solve prob-
lems and generate ideas — activities that can
best be done in spaces that are cosier, with am-
ple cafés, comfortable seating and quiet spots.

Some employers try to make offices so attrac-
tive that workers do not feel the need to leave.
With kitchens, restaurants, gyms, game rooms
and nap pods, employees can work and rest more
flexibly and efficiently — and interact virtually
with partners and clients across different time
zones. Some law firms in the United Kingdom
have sleeping pods, where late-working lawyers
can rest or occasionally spend the night.

But even when away from the office, escaping
work is difficult. Constant connectivity over
mobile devices has blurred the distinction
between work and leisure and narrowed the
privacy boundaries between public and private
life. Many workers are still connected to their
office while on vacation, so work never stops.
For freelancers and flexible workers, making a
distinction between work and other areas of
life may be particularly challenging because it is
never clear when the next job will arrive. Such
arrangements may appear to foster a better
work–life balance, but they may in fact be un-
conducive to a meaningful and satisfying life.

Creative innovations

Technological advances have not only trans-
formed work — they are engines for new
forms of creativity and innovation. The digital
revolution, and the information and commu-
nications technology systems that support it,
emerged from creative and innovative work.
Collaborative teams and visionaries turned
ideas into tangible goods and services. Digital
technologies are fast and cheap enough to
foster all kinds of new innovations from auto-
generated books to driverless cars to flexible
factory robots.84 This is reflected in the growth

of patents granted over the past decades.
Between 1970 and 2012 the number of patents
(United States and other countries) granted
by the United States Patent and Trademark
Office increased almost fivefold (figure 3.8).85
Innovations in computer and electronics fields
were central to this growth: From 1990 to
2012 their share in all new patents more than
doubled, from 25.6 percent to 54.6 percent.86
Figure 3.9 shows the patents granted in the top
12 granting countries in 2013.87

The digitization of paintings, ceramic works,
sculptures and prints is also expanding access
to works of art. Many major museums have
sweeping digitization projects: Amsterdam’s
Rijksmuseum has digitized 95 percent of its
paintings and ship models, 60 percent of its
sculptures and 50 percent of its ceramics.
The Smithsonian Institution in Washington,
DC, has already captured 2.2 million objects
out of a collection of 138 million, developing
new automated digitization methods such as
conveyor- belt scanners.88

Creativity at work enhances productivity and
increases innovation, but also contributes to
the satisfaction and well-being that people have
with their work. Almost 80 percent of workers
acknowledge some level of creativity (even if
very modest) in their work, according to the

World Values Survey, but the proportion varies
considerably and is linked in particular to level
of education. Only 10 percent of workers with
less than a primary education consider their
work very creative, compared with 34 percent
of those with a college degree.89

In many cases marginal adjustments of
processes can have big cumulative effects on
innovation in the workplace. Take Toyota.
Innovation is an element of every worker’s job,
not a task assigned to selected managers and
leaders. Small ideas accumulate and, by some
figures, Toyota implements 1 million new ideas
a year, most from shop-floor workers, who
suggest, for example, ways to make parts easier
to reach. In a work culture where continuous
improvement is expected, Japanese companies
are estimated to receive 100 times more sugges-
tions from their workers than US companies.90
Taking the notion of creative labour beyond
its traditional boundaries, 2006 Nobel Prize
winner in literature Orhan Pamuk makes a spe-
cial contribution on creative work (signed box).

Virtual volunteerism

Forms of work enabled by the digital revolu-
tion extend beyond paid employment. There
are new opportunities for volunteering, social
activism, political engagement and artistic
expression. Individuals can work together
virtually across borders and time zones to pool
their resources and ingenuity. Online platforms
for interaction, often less hierarchical than tra-
ditional organizations, can allow recognition of
more diverse perspectives.

The digital revolution has changed the nature
of volunteering, opening opportunities for those
who may not have previously volunteered. There
is now virtual (online or digital) volunteering —
using the Internet, offsite from the organization
or the groups of people assisted.

These new forms of volunteering can be par-
ticularly enabling for those with disabilities that
may limit mobility or those who may have only
a few minutes to an hour a day for volunteering.
UN Volunteers’s online volunteering system
helped 10,887 volunteers (60 percent of them
women) contribute their skills to development
work in 2014.91 Virtual volunteers mentor small
business owners, write reports and proposals
and teach online classes. “Micro-volunteers”

help crowdsource through the Internet, SMS
mobile technology and smartphone apps.

After Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines
in early November 2013, about 700 digital
volunteers worked with the International Red
Cross to identify the areas and extent of de-
struction, and the kinds of help and support
needed through OpenStreetMap, which can
provide information to guide actions.92 In the
aftermath of the Gorkha earthquake in Nepal
in April 2015, global networks of volunteers
contributed to disaster maps by identifying
damage locations and pleas for help, drawing
information from social media posts.93 And
Ushahidi, an open-source software company,
supports information collection, mapping and
data visualization linked originally to tracking
conflicts in Kenya.94 Efforts like these help fill
information gaps for responders on the ground
during disasters and other crises.

The modern workforce

In the new world of work, workers need to be
more flexible and adaptable — and prepared
to retrain, relocate and renegotiate work con-
ditions. They also need to dedicate increasing
amounts of time to searching for new opportu-
nities. In addition to constantly thinking about
their current work, they have to think about
their next job.

The millennials

The people most linked to the new world of
work are young adults sometimes referred to
as “millennials” — roughly the cohort born
since 1980. This group has come of age at a
time when digital technologies and advanced
information and communications technology
penetrate all areas of life, and many of them
have had access to these technologies since
childhood, particularly in developed countries.
They have also become adults at a time when
flexibility, adaptability and unconventional
work are increasingly common.

A 2013 survey of 7,800 millennials from 26
countries in North America, Western Europe,
Latin America and East Asia found that millen-
nials anticipated that their working lives would
be flexible and diverse. About 70 percent

SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION

Creative work

There is a charming anecdote about the German mathematician Carl
Friedrich Gauss. According to the version our mathematics teacher in
Istanbul told us, a class of high school students in Germany was mis-
behaving (much like we were), and to punish them, their teacher told
them to add up all of the numbers from one to one hundred. One of the
students — Gauss himself — suddenly realized that the sum of the first
and last number, the second and second-to-last, and so on, was always
101. Noting, too, that there were 50 such pairs within the first hundred
numbers, it took him two minutes to work out the total (5,050) and come
up with his famous formula to find it — saving him hours, possibly even
days of calculations.

To me, this story is not just about mathematics, but about creativity
and “creative labour” of all kinds — artistic and literary, too. Examining this
anecdote can help us to better conceptualize the notion of “creative work”
and to uncover and discuss its links to human development.

To most of us, the connection between creativity and human history is
so clear that it is not even up for debate. Already in the 1960s, history text-
books in Turkey were teaching us that even though political and military tri-
umphs are the most important measures of a civilization’s worth, we should
also consider its artistic, literary and creative achievements.

Though in 1960s Turkey, not all teachers would have appreciated
Gauss’s classroom creativity, for the point of the task assigned to his class
was not to encourage them to be creative or to play around with numbers,
but to punish them by forcing them to spend a given length of time on grind-
ing out the solution. Perhaps this is the very definition of creativity, and its
fundamental complication: that it is always unexpected and surprising.

To get to the heart of the matter, we might take a bold step and define
creativity as a force that reduces the amount of effort required to achieve
something, transforming those rules and traditions that would otherwise
make the process more laborious. Our common sense tells us that cre-
ativity works against rules and regulations, traditions, bureaucracies and
habits. Creative individuals may be involved in literary or artistic pursuits;
they may be working in an advertising agency or on a factory assembly
line; but none of this will change the most obvious feature of the nature
of creativity. In this context, “creative labour” becomes an inherently oxy-
moronic concept.

At the same time there is more to creativity than just something that
reduces the expenditure of time and effort; it also changes the intent behind
that effort. We know, for instance, that the art of photography grew and
spread in tandem with the rise of impressionist painting. This is because
the spread of photography rendered obsolete any form of art whose purpose
was still to mimic nature. Despite resistance from state-sponsored salons
and galleries, bureaucrats, traditionalists and classicists, the impression-
ists’ creativity rapidly transformed the very purpose of art. Artists stopped

painting the world as it was and started looking for ways to present it as it
appeared to the artists’ — to the human — eye.

Another complication is that any line we might try to draw between
creative work and uncreative, ordinary work soon begins to look arbitrary
and unfair. There are many who would argue that the work done at an
advertising firm is less creative than the work of a poet, but is this cor-
rect? Is it fair to say that an artist is more creative than a car designer or
a teacher? The translator of a book is as creative as its author; translators
too have the right to exercise creativity in their work and to be accepted
for this aspect of their humanity. Creative labour allows us to express
our individuality and singularity, and the right to follow this very human
urge is as fundamental as the right to freedom of expression and the ac-
ceptance of our differences. My moral perspective tells me that all kinds
of labour, all types of work, should be creative, or should be intended as
such.

The notion of creative work may be problematic and difficult to concep-
tualize, but this should not deter us from treating creativity as a key measure
of human development and labour. Gauss’s teacher praised him for discov-
ering a formula for the total of all the numbers from 1 to 100 rather than
dutifully adding them up one by one; that is the kind of teacher we would
all want, for we all wish our jobs would let us be as creative as an artist or
a mathematician. Our respect and admiration for highly creative individuals
hints at our desire to release our inner creativity and be innovative in our
work, no matter what that work may be.

The enduring appeal of the story of Gauss’s mathematical creativity
does not simply lie in the usefulness of the formula he discovered. We value
Gauss’s creativity for its own sake. More than just the benefits of human
creativity, ours is a reverence towards humanity itself, its ingenuity and its
powers of imagination, capabilities and potential. On an intellectual if not
a legal level, this understanding of creativity brings to mind the concepts of
freedom of thought and freedom of expression. So when Gauss’s teacher
greets his student’s discovery with enthusiastic approval and — instead of
punishing him for disrupting the class — relays the story to others until it
becomes the stuff of legend, we are delighted. It is a joy similar to what we
feel when we know that our identity, our traditions, our personal stories and
our choices are being treated with respect.

When we assess working conditions and environments, we need to
measure and explore the extent to which there are mechanisms in place
for human creativity to be taken into consideration, appreciated and har-
nessed. Where we work, are our discoveries and our new ideas respected
and applied? Or do we simply replicate existing models and patterns that
have been successfully implemented elsewhere? When we come up with
an original solution at work, is it accepted, and are there mechanisms al-
lowing us to voice it? Or are we expected to stick to pre-established norms

SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION

and methods? If we work in a place where we are routinely expected to
be creative, is it actual creativity that we are being asked for, or simply
to produce hurried imitations of old blueprints? Does our work encourage
us to be unique and original, or is there an understanding that we will be
more successful if we mimic and replicate previously successful models?
Does our workplace view creative individuals as troublemakers, or are they

respected as Gauss was? I think the answers to these questions can be
quantified and measured.

Half a century ago, colonial and post-colonial societies dramatically
worried about imitation, authenticity and originality. Today, we value our
creativity as an essential component of human development and wonder
how we might begin to measure creative labour.

expected to be self-employed at some point.95
Many millennials are also looking for work
beyond creating profits, hoping to help solve
environmental and social problems as part of
their livelihoods. The same survey found that
63 percent had given money to charity, 43 per-
cent were members of, or had volunteered for,
community organizations and 52 percent had
signed petitions. This generation seems particu-
larly keen to take a communal view of work.

Social entrepreneurs

Social businesses are emerging as new areas
of work. These are cause-driven entities de-
signed to address a social problem — nonloss,
non dividend companies (where all profits
are reinvested back into the company) that
aim to be financially self- sustainable, with a
primary goal of maximizing social benefits as
opposed to maximizing profits (though they
are desirable).96

Inspired by a particular cause and by the de-
sire to give something back to society, a number
of successful commercial entrepreneurs in dif-
ferent parts of the world are transitioning from
for-profit ventures to engaging in social change.
A survey of 763 commercial entrepreneurs
in India who experienced a transition from
commercial to social entrepreneurship between
2003 and 2013 and a quantitative analysis of a
final sample of 493 entrepreneurs indicate that
21 percent of the successful entrepreneurs shift-
ed to social change efforts.97 Most are skilled
organization builders, independently wealthy,
often from outside the establishment, some
from the diaspora.

Opportunities for women

Globalization, digital technologies and new
ways of working are also ushering in new no-
tions of men’s and women’s work. The digital
economy has enabled many women to access
work that lets them apply their creativity and
potential. In 2013 about 1.3 billion women
were using the Internet.98 Some have moved
to e-trading as entrepreneurs or are employed
through crowdworking or e-services. Moreover,
women are now more likely to be found in sen-
ior jobs (see chapter 4), but if the glass ceiling
— the invisible barrier to women’s advancement
in the workplace — seems to be cracking, it has
not yet broken. Still, even poor female entre-
preneurs in developing countries can now use
mobile phones to gain access to market infor-
mation and sources of finance. They can also do
so flexibly from home.

One of the earliest examples emerged in
1997 in Bangladesh, when female entrepre-
neurs set up village pay phones. Using mobile
phones leased from Grameen Bank, they could
sell services to other villagers.99 In Andhra
Pradesh, India, women run e-Seva centres that
provide a wide range of online services.100 In
addition to Internet browsing and access to on-
line auctions, customers can use these centres to
pay bills, obtain land and birth certificates, file
complaints and grievances, and gain access to
tele-medicine and tele-agriculture.

This new world of work puts a high premium
on workers with skills and qualifications in sci-
ence and technology, workers historically less
likely to be women. Women are vastly under-
represented in these subjects at the secondary

and tertiary education levels and in the overall
technical workforce.101 Countries looking to
spur innovation will thus need to boost female
participation in technology-oriented education
and jobs. One way is through online education
services such as EdX, a nonprofit online edu-
cation group backed by Harvard University
and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
EdX is working with the Saudi Ministry of
Labour, for example, to develop online classes
for young people and women.102

New horizons for older workers

By 2050 an estimated 2.1 billion people will be
over age 60.103 Older workers can be a vital force
in the economy, particularly in areas where the
size of the labour force is expected to decline as
the population ages (as in Europe and Japan).
Many are continuing to work beyond normal
retirement age, just as many societies face high
youth unemployment. In the United Kingdom
the employment rate among people ages 50–64
rose from 57 percent in 1995 to 69 percent in
2015, and the rate among people ages 65 or
older rose from 5.2 percent to 10.4 percent.104

Older people continue to work because
they enjoy their jobs or because they cannot
afford to retire. Curiosity and interest do not
necessarily diminish with age, and those who
continue to work can improve their well-being
by maintaining social connections that prevent
isolation and loneliness. Work gives older peo-
ple a purpose and a social function. They can
also mentor younger workers, passing on their
insights gained through years of experience.

For the most part, older and younger work-
ers are in different labour-market segments, so
there is no direct substitution. The anxiety that
young people will lose opportunities for work
when older people are encouraged to work has
been termed “the lump of labour fallacy.”105 Yet
retirement can have a cascade effect, opening
space for younger workers.

Promises as yet unfulfilled

The new world of work is creating fresh oppor-
tunities. So far, however, many of the promises
of higher productivity and better jobs have
yet to be met, and some of the downsides are

already evident. The implications of the new
world of work for human development are
promising, but those promises are, for now, not
wholly fulfilled.

Technological revolution —
job gains or losses?

Economists have historically rejected the
argument that an increase in labour produc-
tivity reduces employment in the long run.
The argument would be sound if there were a
finite amount of work, but the view is that new
technology creates new demands for labour.
Indeed, in the two centuries since the industrial
revolution began, workforces have continued
to grow, and productivity and living standards
have risen dramatically.

Some fear job losses through automation.
Indeed, many jobs are already disappearing or
are vulnerable (figure 3.10). Broad swathes of
middle management risk being eliminated.
Rows of desks could become empty, not be-
cause workers are unfit for their purpose, but
because that purpose no longer exists. Some
estimates indicate that by 2025 almost 50 per-
cent of today’s occupations could become
redundant.106 New jobs will require creativity,
intelligence, social skills and the ability to ex-
ploit artificial intelligence.

But others argue that computers are very
far from being able to use creativity, intuition,
persuasion and imaginative problem solving,
and they may never get there. The view is that
certain occupations are insulated from any dis-
placement effect of computerization. Further,
the complementarity between machines and
people is crucial: Most work activities require
a mixture of tasks that must be accomplished
jointly, some to be completed by a computer
and some by a human.107

Either way, technology will leave many peo-
ple behind, and some human skills will be more
valuable than ever. We may be at an inflexion
point, with both positive and negative im-
pacts. The technological revolution represents
“skill-biased technical change”: the idea that
the net effect of new technologies is to decrease
demand for less skilled workers while increas-
ing demand for skilled labour. By definition,
such change favours people with more human
capital, polarizing work opportunities.

The implications of the
new world of work on
human development
are promising—but
these promises are
not yet wholly fulfilled

At the top will be good jobs for those with
the necessary education and skills. For example,
in the automobile industry the engineers who
design and test new vehicles will benefit. At the
bottom there will still be low-skill, low-pro-
ductivity, low-wage service occupations such
as office cleaning. But the middle areas will see
a steady hollowing-out of many jobs in office
cubicles and factory floors. The biggest losers
will thus be workers with less-specialized skills.
Many cognitively complex jobs are beyond the
abilities even of people with reasonable quali-
fications. Some industries could therefore face
skill shortages, so companies willing to pay high
salaries for the best talent will look to a global
market. And besides being polarized nationally,
workforces are being stratified internationally,
with low-skilled workers coming mainly from
national markets and high-skilled workers from
global markets.

There has never been a better time to be a
worker with special skills and the right educa-
tion, because these people can use technology
to create and capture value. But there has never

been a worse time to be a worker with only or-
dinary skills and abilities, because computers,
robots and other digital technologies are
acquiring those skills and abilities at an extraor-
dinary rate. The role of policy in equalizing the
life chances of people to have decent work has
never been more important.

Productivity and wages —
not what was expected

An implied promise of the digital revolution
was that it would increase labour productivity
and thus lead to higher pay. This does not seem
to have happened. Productivity has not grown
at the rates expected, and the gains have not
translated into higher wages for the most part.
Take the United States and the Netherlands as
examples (figure 3.11).108 In the United States
increases in productivity and wages began to
diverge around 1973, and the gap has since
been widening, with productivity gains in man-
ufacturing of almost 75 percent through 2013
and wage increases of less than 10 percent. The

widening gap between productivity and wages
since the middle of the 1970s has also been ob-
served in the Netherlands. In some cases wages
have remained flat. Between 2007 and 2013 real
wages in Japan, Italy and the United Kingdom
went down.109 But these averages mask the fact
that as real pay for most workers stagnated, in-
comes for the highest earners soared.

Although productivity has grown, the growth
rate has not had the exceptional boost expected
with the advent of the digital revolution (figure
3.12). This phenomenon has been termed the
Solow Paradox. Several explanations have been
provided for this paradox — the digital revolu-
tion has been less fundamental, thus resulting in
smaller benefits, which have been further offset
by demographic change and rising inequality;
there is a longer lag involved; or the productiv-
ity boost due to the digital revolution will not
surface in manufacturing but in services, where
economies of scale can be dramatic.

Rising inequality in income shares
— no question on this one

The technological revolution has been ac-
companied by rising inequality. Even people
with better education and training who can
work more productively may not receive
commensurate rewards in income, stability or
social recognition. Workers overall are getting

These figures have raised economic and ethical
questions, related to the productivity of work
and the “value of work,” in particular after some
of those highly paid workers were behind the fi-
nancial collapse in 2008. What has changed so
dramatically in the past 50 years that can justify
a jump in the relative compensation of chief
executive officers? Do they generate such high
value to their respective companies compared
with typical workers?

Chapter 3 The changing world of work | 101

The changing world of
work has considerable
human development
implications—
some positive and
some negative

Higher rewards for higher skilled workers
are contributing to a disproportionate increase
in income and wealth for workers at the top of
the distribution. The world’s richest 1 percent
saw their share of global wealth increase from
44 percent in 2009 to 48 percent in 2014, set to
reach more than 50 percent in 2016. Members
of this global elite had an average wealth of
$2.7 million per adult in 2014.112

For example, in the United States the ratio of
chief executive officer compensation to worker
compensation (including stock options) has
risen steeply: from 20 to 1 in 1965 to 30 to 1 in
1978 to 383 to 1 in 2000 to 296 to 1 in 2013.113
These figures raise fundamental economic and
ethical questions about the value of different
forms of work.

Myriad forces are behind the decline of
labour income, including financialization, glo-
balization, technological change, institutional
issues (such as waning union membership)
and retrenchment of the welfare state.114
Technology is part of these processes, but its
effect is not easily identified.

The prominent role of financial actors is tied
to the expansion of credit and highly mobile
flows. The greater mobility of capital has
provided more investing options to capitalists
(increasing their space for business), boosted
their bargaining power relative to workers (as
financial commitments receive legal priority
over labour commitments) and expanded their
outside options. Based on the Latin American
experience, the macroeconomic volatility led
by financial flows has had a negative effect on
real wages, employment and equality.115

By changing the scale and the way goods
and services are interchanged and produced,
globalization — as with global value chains —
has produced inequalities in income shares.
There is evidence that in these chains, the
contributions (measured in value added) of
capital and of high-skill labour have increased
consistently.116 These trends have implications
for income distribution.

Implications for
human development

As the preceding discussion suggests, the chang-
ing world of work, propelled by globalization

and the digital revolution, has considerable hu-
man development implications — some positive
and some negative. This world has contributed
to new capabilities of and opportunities for
people, creativity and innovation. In many
instances globalization has created new work
opportunities for people, particularly women
(though opportunities for women in some
cases have not reached older women), but it has
also resulted in job losses. Global value chains
have helped younger people learn new skills
that they can use throughout their working
lives, but in many cases the networks have not
created the promised work opportunities for
them.

Participation in value chains has provided
some with secure and decent jobs but others
with precarious jobs. Three out of four people
worldwide do not work with a full-time perma-
nent contract; three out of five workers in wage
or salaried employment are in part-time or
temporary work. Global value chains are thus
associated with economic insecurity. By creat-
ing winners and losers, globalization of work
has had asymmetrical human development
impacts across countries, within countries and
among workers.

Similarly, digitization of work has given
rise to enormous opportunities for some but
has created risks for others. It has made work
much more flexible and opened new frontiers
for creativity. But not everyone has benefited.
Those with the greatest skills and aptitudes
have been able to take advantage of the oppor-
tunities, while those with more routine skills
have seen their jobs extinguished. Digitization
has touched the work of traditional sectors
(such as agriculture), but not to the extent that
it has the modern sector of finance. Knowledge
workers apply and produce new technologies
that can enhance human progress, but the fruits
of the technologies have not been shared by all.
Personalized goods and services benefit
people by providing targeted services, which
save time and have facilitated improved qual-
ity of life. The sharing economy addresses
some environmental concerns and contributes
to community bonding. Flexible work ar-
rangements allow people to spend more time
with families. But at the same time, constant
connectivity over mobile devices blurs the
distinction between work and leisure, between

102 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

connectedness through machines and direct
human interactions and between public and
private space.

Finally, both globalization and digitization
have created inequalities in sharing the fruits
of work. The shares of high-skilled workers and
of capital are going up, while those of other
labour have been going down. The reward to
top earners and their share in income are hard
to rationalize by considering their work or
productivity. Such inequalities have substantial
adverse impacts on human development op-
portunities and outcomes.

Conclusions

The changing world of work will take decades
to fully play out and will lead to sharp changes
in the path of history and human development.

The twists and turns will not always be easy to
navigate.

The market alone is unlikely to guide digital
technologies and systems of global connectivity
in the direction of higher human development.
Public policies and actions, national and glob-
al, are needed now to take better advantage of
these opportunities. And inclusive institutions
are needed to provide incentives and opportu-
nities for innovation and economic activity for
a broad cross-section of society.

Ultimately, the challenge of this changing
world of work is to ensure that a globalizing,
revolutionizing world ensures equitable oppor-
tunities and enhanced human development
for all — women and men, present and future
generations. In that context, issues of balancing
paid and unpaid care work as well as sustainable
work are of paramount importance and as such
are the focus of the next two chapters.

Imbalances in paid and unpaid work

Both paid and unpaid work contribute to the realization of human potential — as preceding chapters have indicated. Indeed,
most individuals need to accommodate both in their daily lives. However, there continue to be pronounced imbalances be-
tween men and women in how this balance is struck and in the degree of freedom available to make choices in this respect.

Both paid and unpaid
work contribute to
the realization of
human potential

In these two domains of work, men’s and
women’s roles are generally very different,
reflecting societal contexts, norms and values,
as well as perceptions, attitudes and historical
gender roles. These lead to markedly different
opportunities and outcomes for human devel-
opment. For example, the total time spent on
work by women tends to exceed that by men:
An analysis of time use surveys representing
69 percent of the world’s adult population
shows that women account for 52 percent of
total hours worked, men 48 percent (figure 4.1;
see also table A4.1 at the end of the chapter).

Of the 59 percent of work that is paid, most-
ly outside the home, men’s share is nearly twice
that of women — 38 percent versus 21 percent.
The picture is reversed for unpaid work, most-
ly within the home and encompassing a range

of care responsibilities: Of the 41 percent of
work that is unpaid, women perform three
times more than men — 31 percent versus
10 percent.

These numbers are only one dimension of
imbalances that persist at many levels. The
1995 Human Development Report observed
that women work more hours than men.1 The
data available at that time indicated gender in-
equalities in representation at decision making
levels in the private and public sectors and in
participation in the labour force and school
enrolment (see infographic at the beginning
of the chapter). As the comparison with cur-
rent data shows, at the global level there is a
perceptible move towards equality on all these
fronts but at different paces: The labour force
participation rate, a measure of those already
employed or actively seeking work, has moved
only a little, while the gains towards parity in
representation at decisionmaking levels have
been much more pronounced, providing an
indication of where constraints may be more
entrenched.

Indeed, although women work more hours
than men, their relatively limited participa-
tion in the labour force is symptomatic of the
imbalanced sharing of care responsibilities
and expectations that serves to circumscribe
options. Expanding women’s opportunities,
choices and freedoms requires a range of ac-
tions that on the one hand remove barriers to
their full and equal participation in the realm
of paid work and on the other hand require
the recognition, reduction and redistribution
of the care burden that they disproportionate-
ly carry.

This general situation is changing in many
regions, if slowly, as attitudes and norms shift
and some positive public policies are pursued.
More women are receiving higher levels of ed-
ucation, and in a globalized work environment
with many new technologies, opportunities

tion in parliaments, in senior government po-
sitions and in senior business management has
improved around the world: The glass ceiling

pearing. At the same time, there is also a move
towards a more equitable sharing of the burden
of unpaid care work between men and women.
Nevertheless, the pace of these changes is slow,
and much remains to be done.

Disparities in the world
of paid work

Even though women carry more than half the
burden of global work, they are disadvantaged
in the world of work — in both paid and unpaid
work. Women are less engaged in waged work,
earn less than men, remain underrepresented in
senior decisionmaking positions, encounter un-
even barriers to entrepreneurship and, in many
countries, are more likely to be in vulnerable
employment.

Women are less engaged
in the workforce

Conventional measures of work and employ-
ment do not take into account the engagement
of individuals in unpaid care work, much of
which takes place in the household: However,
these measures indicate that women are less

likely to be working for pay or even looking for
such work (figure 4.2). Both time use surveys
and macroeconomic indicators such as the la-
bour force participation rate support this point.
The labour force participation rate — the
proportion of the working-age population in
paid employment or looking for such work —
differs for men and women. While a portion of
the difference may be due to an undercounting
of those working only sporadically or in home-
based activities — kinds of employment where
women, especially in the rural areas of devel-
oping countries are over-represented relative to
men2 — this effect is not large enough to com-
pletely account for the divergence. Two trends,
in particular, stand out.

First, the labour force participation rate is
consistently much lower for women than for
men, both globally and by human development
grouping (see figure 4.2). In many regions the
gap has remained constant for decades. In 2015
the participation rate was around 77 percent
for men and around 50 percent for women.3

Second, globally participation rates for wom-
en have fallen slightly in recent years, as have
men’s. The drop in the rate for women is due
mainly to reductions in India (from 35 percent
in 1990 to 27 percent in 2013) and China
(from 73 percent in 1990 to 64 percent in
2013).4 But low and very high human develop-
ment countries have begun to see convergence
in female and male rates, as the former has risen,
while the latter has remained static or declined.

These differences reflect economic, social and
cultural factors that affect men and women dif-
ferently, albeit with variations across countries.
For example, over the ages 15–49 each birth is
estimated to take a woman out of the labour
force by an average of almost two years.5 Falling
fertility rates — observed in almost all regions
— should therefore free up women’s time,
enabling greater participation in the labour
force, provided other constraints are removed
and suitable opportunities exist. Fertility rates
are expected to continue to drop in the coming
decades, gradually moving from the current
global average of about 2.5 births per woman6
to about 2.1 in 2075 and 1.99 in 2100.7

The decline in fertility rates is expected to
increase female labour force participation. In a
sample of 97 countries (covering about 80 per-
cent of the world’s population), it is estimated
that 91 million additional women will join the
labour force due to this effect over 2010–2030.8
Another factor that can contribute to higher
labour force participation by women is im-
provement in their educational attainment,
should opportunities exist (although there can
be temporary declines if women are choosing
higher education over labour market entry).
This factor can be large: In a sample of 97
countries, increased education is estimated
to boost female labour force participation by
nearly 3 percentage points over 2010–2030.9
However, such gains can be hard to realize if
there is disparity in accessing labour market
opportunities, or continuing imbalances in
the sharing of the care burden or the meeting
of social expectations. Issues such as these can
make the transition to paid work more difficult
for women. The declining disparities in edu-
cational attainment between women and men
need to be matched by complementary actions
that will facilitate a commensurate parity in the
labour market.

A similar picture prevails with regard to em-
ployment: In 2015, 72 percent of working-age
(ages 15 and older) men were employed,
compared with only 47 percent of women
(figure 4.3).

Achieving higher engagement in paid work
confers multiple benefits not just to women
but to societies and economies at large. It is well
recognized that a higher female labour force
participation rate boosts economic growth. For

example, raising the rate in Japan from the cur-
rent 66 percent to 80 percent (still 5 percentage
points lower than the male participation rate)
could boost the country’s output 13 percent.10
Annual economic losses due to gender gaps in
effective labour (labour force participation rate
and years of schooling) have been estimated at
$60 billion in Sub- Saharan Africa.11

Women earn less

Even when working for a salary, earnings
between women and men diverge. Globally,
women earn 24 percent less than men.12 The
gap is due partly to the fact that women tend
to be under-represented at higher levels of pay
and in higher paid occupations. But even when
doing similar work, women often earn less —
with the gap generally greatest for the highest
paying professions. In the United States female
financial specialists earn only 66 percent of
what their male counterparts earn. For dentists
the proportion is 74 percent, and for account-
ants 76 percent.13 In Latin America female
top managers average only 53 percent of male
top managers´ salaries, and female scientists
65 percent.14

Wage gaps are not
only an economic issue

Some of the wage gaps can be explained by
differences in education, skill levels and years
of experience — often related to women’s care
responsibilities — but in most cases a large part
remains unexplained (figure 4.4). In Estonia
the wage gap is around 29 percent, but only a
quarter is explained by differences in observable
characteristics such as those related to human
capital or the nature of the occupation — even if
these differences were removed, women would
still earn considerably less. As in many other
countries, in Estonia too the unexplained part
is larger in upper income deciles. In Denmark
and Poland the explained gap is negative, mean-
ing that women should be earning more than
men after taking into account various charac-
teristics.15 One explanation for the unexplained
portion of the wage gap is discrimination —
whether overt or covert — at work.

Wage gaps are not only an economic issue;
they also affect — and are affected by — power
relations. On the one hand, earnings make
for economic independence, a critical factor
towards individual autonomy, voice and agen-
cy in households and the community. On the
other hand, an unequal distribution of care
responsibilities in the household may require
one parent to take time off more frequently
than the other, reducing the former parent’s
current and prospective earnings and perpet-
uating divergences. Equal pay for equal work

FIGURE 4.4

is not just a matter of social justice; it also
holds substantial social value, especially for
empowering women in households and the
community.

The glass ceiling continues to skew
representation across genders

Wage gaps are but one indication of the low-
er representation of women in positions of
leadership and seniority in the private sector.
Globally, women hold only 22 percent of
senior leadership positions, and 32 percent of
businesses have no female senior managers.16
The regional picture is quite varied (figure
4.5), and at the country level representation
of women in senior management positions in
businesses ranges from 8 percent in Japan to
40 percent in the Russian Federation.17 The
picture also varies within industries: Women
hold only 19 percent of senior technology
roles.18 The situation is even starker at the top
of enterprises, with only 9 percent of compa-
nies having a female chief executive officer in
2014. This vertical segregation at work ac-
companies a divide across occupations as well:
Women’s participation varies from 12 percent
in mining and quarrying to 24 percent in
professional services to 41 percent in educa-
tion and social services.19 Such occupational
segregation has been pervasive over time and

across levels of economic prosperity — in both
advanced and developing countries men are
over-represented in crafts, trades, plant and
machine operations, and managerial and leg-
islative occupations, and women in mid-skill
occupations, such as clerks, service workers
and shop and sales workers.

In public service, too — where equal pay for
equal work is easier to realize — positions of
leadership continue to be disproportionately
occupied by men. That women hold about
25 percent or less of senior political and judicial
positions likely influences the gender balance
of laws and regulations and the way they are
implemented (figure 4.6).

FIGURE 4.5

Asymmetric barriers to
entrepreneurship

Women become entrepreneurs for many of the
same reasons as men — to earn livelihoods, sup-
port their families, enrich their careers and gain
a degree of independence.20 For both women
and men the highest rate of early-stage entre-
preneurship (businesses less than 3.5 years old)
is in Africa, followed by Latin America and the
Caribbean (left panel of figure 4.7). However,
in all regions women are less likely than men
to initiate their own enterprises. Particularly
in Latin America and the Caribbean, a dispro-
portionately large number of female-headed

enterprises do not survive to become estab-
lished businesses (right panel of figure 4.7).21

Why are there fewer female entrepreneurs?
Reasons range from limited financial opportu-
nities to unequal use of technology:
• Unequal access to finance. Some 42 percent
of women worldwide did not have a bank
account in 2014, and the proportion was
even higher in developing countries (50 per-
cent). And in 38 countries, including India,
Mexico, Pakistan and Uganda, more than
80 percent of women are unbanked.22 By
contrast, in Japan and the Republic of Korea
more than 90 percent of women have bank
accounts.23

• Legal restrictions and discriminatory prac-
tices. In 22 countries covered by the Global
Entrepreneurship and Development Index,
married women do not enjoy the same legal
rights as married men, and in 8 countries
women do not enjoy the same legal access to
property as men. In a third of these countries
women’s access to public spaces is restricted
through either legal provisions or discrimina-
tory practices.24

• Unequal access to and use of technology.
As of 2013, only 39 percent of women in
India were Internet users, compared with

61 percent of men. In China the percentage
was 44 percent for women and 56 percent for
men, and in Turkey only 44 percent of wom-
en were, compared with 64 percent of men.25
Few women operate businesses in manufac-
turing, transport and advanced technology.26

Uneven presence in vulnerable work

While disparities within formal wage employ-
ment are rife, such work does confer some de-
gree of economic security and contractual and
legal protections for all workers. But working
in the informal sector or being self-employed
(but not an employer) can be marked by low
and variable earnings, poor working condi-
tions, inadequate voice and limited scope for
collective actions, fostering insecurity and
dependence.

One way to measure this is by enumerating
workers in vulnerable employment, classified
by labour statisticians as those working in a
business operated by a family member (con-
tributing family workers), or self-employed but
not engaging any employee to work for them
on a continuous basis (own-account workers).
Another way is by counting workers in the in-
formal sector, who are likely to remain outside

the reach of the protections afforded by other
forms of formal employment.

especially large numbers of women: agriculture
and paid domestic work.

Among countries with data covering
84 percent of the global workforce, more than
48 percent of men and 41 percent of women
are self-employed; in low-income countries the
female rate (90 percent) is higher than the male
rate (83 percent).27 Globally, nearly 50 percent
of employed women are in vulnerable employ-
ment, compared with 44 percent of men. In
low-income countries the percentage is 86 per-
cent for women and 77 percent for men.28

When grouped by human development
categories, women are more likely to be in
vulnerable employment in low and medium
human development countries. Based on the
available data, which have limited coverage in
some cases, a similar situation appears to hold
for geographic regions as well: Women are
more likely to be in vulnerable employment
in most regions (figure 4.8). The exception
is Latin America and the Caribbean, where
there is some parity, with vulnerable em-
ployment accounting for about a third of
the working population for both women and
men.29

Examples of such work can be found in
many sectors, but two stand out as engaging

FIGURE 4.8

Agriculture

In South Asia agriculture, primarily informal,
accounts for almost 62 percent of female
employment but less than 42 percent of male
employment (figure 4.9).

Over and above this, the nature and returns
to work may vary for men and women. For ex-
ample, both men and women may be working
on small landholdings, engaged principally in
subsistence work,30 but, as in Malawi, a greater
proportion of women may be working unpaid
on family farms (figure 4.10).

The share of the agricultural labour force that
is female has either remained static or increased
in all regions over the past 20 years, due to a
number of factors, including the migration
of men seeking better paid opportunities.
Between 1980 and 2010 the female share in the
agricultural labour force rose from 30 percent
to 45 percent in the subregions of Near East
and North Africa. This trend reflects a greater
absolute number of women entering the agri-
cultural labour force as well, implying continu-
ing exposure to vulnerable employment.31

Paid domestic work

With rising household incomes, and increas-
ing numbers of people working outside the
home, the demand for paid domestic workers
has risen. In 2010 an estimated 53 million
people worldwide ages 15 and older were in
domestic work. And 83 percent of them were
women — accounting for 7.5 percent of female

employees.32 Many were migrants, both within
their own countries and across borders.

Domestic work can be a critical source of
income but holds limited potential for devel-
oping into high-quality employment. It encom-
passes different tasks and can engage both men
and women in large numbers. For example,
in 2004/05 India had 4.2 million domestic
workers — 1 percent of total employment

114 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

(table 4.1) — about a quarter of them men.
More than 70 percent were women working
predominantly as housemaids or servants.33
Some were full-time live-in domestic workers
— they might have relatively stable employ-
ment and reasonable living conditions but little
freedom. Others worked part time, living at
home but visiting their employer’s house once
or twice a day. They could thus work in more
than one household, with somewhat greater
choices and exit options.34

The demand for domestic work sustains mi-
gration within countries — such as from rural
to urban areas — or across national borders. For
example, in many Latin American countries
domestic migrant workers are from a neigh-
bouring country — Bolivians in Argentina,
Peruvians in Chile35 — often reflecting lower
travel costs, less restrictive entry requirements
and established networks.

But others travel longer distances, from lower
to higher income countries. Latin Americans
work in the United States, and Ukrainian
care workers find jobs in Italy.36 Workers from
the Philippines or Indonesia may move to
Singapore, where one household in five em-
ploys a domestic worker.37 Some of the biggest
employers of such workers are the countries in
the Gulf Cooperation Council. They employ
about 2.4 million migrants, many of whom are
female domestic workers (table 4.2).38 Between
2001 and 2010 the number of migrant domes-
tic workers dramatically increased.39

While migrant workers who travel to other
countries may obtain jobs and earn more than
they would at home, they can also find them-
selves trapped in abusive and exploitative set-
tings behind closed doors with limited recourse
to assistance. For example, their employer may
withhold hold their passports and wages, not
allowing them to resign their jobs before their
contract ends. Work hours may be inordinately
long, and employees may have limited or no ac-
cess to services to reinforce their rights, becom-
ing victims of exploitation and even physical
and sexual violence.40

Many national workers reject these low-
paid, low-skill and often low-prestige jobs,
even though global demand for domestic work
is rising. For example, in the United States at
least 1.8 million workers are domestic workers
in US homes, and most of them (95 percent)

are female or foreign born.41 Migrant caregiv-
ers often leave their families and children back
home, who themselves need to be cared for, of-
ten by grandparents or other relatives or hired
local helpers, thus resulting in a global care
chain parallel to the global flow of domestic
workers.

Women’s economic empowerment (or at
least co-determination in resource distribu-
tion within the family) is greater when they
are employers, or in waged and salaried work
that is protected through legislation and
services that guarantee their rights. Informal
work, while providing much needed income,
is inherently more exposed to risks and less
likely to be effectively protected through
safeguards such as legislation or organized
collective action.

Central Asia: emerged region, emerging challenges and opportunities for women

The Central Asian women’s movement is approaching its centennial.
Starting with the emancipation of Soviet women in the workforce, driven
partly by the need to stand in for men who were fighting at the World War
II front and partly by the post-war Soviet industrialization, women of Central
Asia operated heavy machinery in the fields, managed power plants and pi-
loted airplanes. They helped develop oil and gas fields and whole industries.
Much has changed since independence in the 1990s. De-industrialization,
unfair privatization of public assets as a result of sharp social stratification,
and high internal and external migration dramatically reduced living stan-
dards. Gradual collapse of social infrastructure and insignificant numbers of
women among new business elites led to the virtual absence of women’s
economic capital and to their vulnerability to poverty and unemployment.

Central Asia, where two-thirds of the population resides in rural areas,
is facing the consequences of climate change, loss of water resources and
land degradation. Drug trafficking from Afghanistan and labour migration
have boosted HIV prevalence in the region. High levels of corruption, low
quality of public services and weak rule of law have led traditional and
religious institutions to try to serve as substitutes for state governance
institutions in rural areas. Outdated patriarchal values such as the superior-
ity of men over women, early marriage, polygamy and the reinstatement
of women’s economic activity at home now compete against the apparent
secular social norms.

These problems and their solutions were discussed at the 2015
National Women’s Forum dedicated to the 90th anniversary of the Women’s
Movement of Kyrgyzstan, the 20th anniversary of the Beijing Platform
and the 15th anniversary of the UN Security Council resolution on the ac-
tive participation of women in conflict resolution and peace building. The
1995 Beijing Conference on the advancement of women and girls provided
Central Asian delegates with both a powerful inspiration and a framework
for national gender policies. Over the past 20 years we have formed national
women’s movements and the institutional mechanisms and national legisla-
tive and policy framework on gender equality.

Today, women make up 70 percent of Kyrgyzstan’s civil society leaders.
We head the country’s most active human rights organizations and strong
media resources, conduct judicial reform, fight corruption and work to im-
prove the quality of public services. We have been at the forefront of all
significant changes in our country, including the country’s transition to a par-
liamentary form of government. Women actively participate in public super-
visory boards at each ministry and at the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative. The country’s microcredit movement, in which women play a
prominent role, has expanded significantly in the past 20 years, helping to
feed the village and the urban poor. However, few women sit on the boards
of directors of public and state companies. Sharp challenges face women
entrepreneurs who wish to expand their businesses. We need business
incubators and commercial and legal training. Instead of giving in to reli-
gious and conservative perspectives, we should strengthen the position of
women in the creative industries and sports. We should build on decades of
progress in which women have realized their aspirations and reached new
heights.

The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have now undergone two
decades of democratic development. While not long, this experience is in-
creasingly embedded in our sociopolitical and historical memory. “Genes of
democracy” have been life-giving agents of change at key historical junc-
tures and are bringing these countries into the group of countries whose
welfare and prosperity is directly related to prospects for gender equality.
I am certain that the countries of Central Asia — having passed through
Soviet emancipation and having achieved 100 percent literacy among
women — will be able to cope with the problems of the transition period,
with emerging and traditional challenges for gender equality. We must in-
vest in women and girls and change gender stereotypes through inclusive,
sustainable and equitable social and economic growth. If our state treats
gender equality as an integral part of national development, we will be able
to successfully modernize by helping all women and girls to achieve their full
potential and aspirations.

Monetary valuation of unpaid care work

The unpaid time that people devote to the care of family,
friends and neighbours clearly contributes to economic
living standards, social well-being and the development
of human capabilities. At the same time it enables indi-
viduals to engage in the various forms of paid work in
the economy. Yet while paid work is assigned a mon-
etary value and features in national aggregates such as
GDP, unpaid work remains largely unmeasured by such
a metric and consequently invisible in discussions of
economic policy.

Things are changing — due at least partly to UN res-
olutions insisting on improving the visibility of women’s
unpaid work — and many countries now administer na-
tionally representative time use surveys asking individu-
als to recall their activities during the previous day. Over
2000–2010 at least 87 such surveys were conducted,
more than over 1900–2000. Estimates of hours worked
in providing various household services provide a ba-
sis for imputing a market value by asking how much it
would cost to procure an equivalent number of hours of
similar services from the market. This is valuation by a
replacement cost — other approaches are possible, but
this one is widely applied. The value of unpaid work
contributions cannot always — or fully — be captured in
market terms, but estimates of its monetary value, like
efforts to estimate the value of unpriced environmental
assets and services, can provide important insights.

Unpaid household work that leads to the production
of goods (such as food for own consumption or collec-
tion of firewood or water necessary for the household) is
considered part of production by the System of National
Accounts, and most estimates of GDP include approxi-
mations of the value of this work. However, unpaid care
work, such as meal preparation, housecleaning, laundry,
water and firewood fetching and care of children, are
explicitly excluded. Although time use surveys do not

capture all forms of care work, they are useful for better
estimating the total number of hours devoted to unrec-
ognized and undervalued forms of work.

Valuation efforts, often inserted into “satellite ac-
counts” that revolve around the conventional estimates,
have gradually been gaining ground in national income
accounting and are illuminating. Across a range of coun-
tries the results show that time devoted to unpaid care
is not optional or idiosyncratic but carefully structured to
meet routine family needs, especially the care needs of
children, older people and those who are disabled or sick.
Among all countries that are attempting to measure
the value of unpaid care work, estimates range from
20 percent to 60 percent of GDP.1 In India unpaid care is
estimated at 39 percent of GDP, in South Africa 15 per-
cent.2 Among Latin American countries the value is es-
timated at 26–34 percent of official GDP for Guatemala
and 32 percent for El Salvador.

In 2008 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development published estimates of household
production in 27 countries using a replacement cost ap-
proach, which highlighted that the value of household
production as a share of GDP varies considerably across
countries. It is above 35 percent in Australia, Japan and
New Zealand and below 20 percent in the Republic of
Korea and Mexico, countries with lower GDP.

A greater acceptance of such valuations can help
direct national policies. For example, in developing
countries women spend a substantial amount of time
tending to basic family needs, and access to clean wa-
ter and modern energy services would greatly improve
their productivity. However, estimates of the payoff to
public investments typically does not take the value
of such nonmarket work into account. Doing so could
change how resources are allocated and projects priori-
tized for implementation.

source of joy and fulfilment for many. Within
the household and community, activities of this
nature include various services related to the
care of oneself and others. Some of this work
is related to the everyday functioning of all
households — cleaning, cooking and fetching
water and firewood. But a substantial portion
relates to the care of others — about 2 billion
children for example.42 Many adults may also
need to be looked after to some degree — older

people (people over age 80 now number
around 120 million43), those living with disa-
bilities (estimated at about a billion44) and the
sick (for example, many of the 37 million living
with HIV/AIDS).45

Such work is indispensable to maintaining
and advancing capabilities and human develop-
ment. It is essential to the functioning of socie-
ties and economies and makes possible much of
the observed kinds of paid work. However, it is

unevenly shared between men and women — it
is predominantly women who undertake much
of this unpaid work (figure 4.11).

There are variations in how unpaid care work
is shared between men and women across coun-
tries and over time. For example, in Argentina
in 2013 an estimated 50 percent of men did
unpaid domestic work, averaging 2.4 hours
a day. For women the figures were 87 percent
and 3.9 hours.46 The same year the proportions
were 30 percent for men and 54 percent for
women in Bogotá, with women taking greater
responsibility for food preparation, cleaning
and maintenance.47 How the burden is shared
has also been evolving — in the United States
women spent more than 240 minutes a day on
housework and men less than 40 minutes in
1965; by 2012 women’s involvement had fallen
to around 140 minutes a day, and men’s had
risen to over 80 minutes. Despite the shift, the
burden is still unequal.48

According to time use surveys in developing
countries, women are typically responsible for
more than 75 percent of the time their house-
hold dedicates to unpaid care. In low-income
households that adds up to many more hours
than in middle- or high-income households,
which generally have better access to basic
services and can afford to hire help or buy

labour-saving technology.49 In Africa alone
women average 200 million hours a day collect-
ing water.50 Even when the burden of this work
is ameliorated, it remains labour intensive and
poses impediments to pursuing other activities
such as education, paid work, participation or
leisure.

Disparities in discretionary free time

Women work more than men, even if a large
part is relatively invisible because it takes place
in unpaid care activities. As a result, women
have less discretionary free time than men do. In
a sample of 62 countries men average 4.5 hours
a day of leisure and social activities, compared
with women’s 3.9 hours.51 The gap is wider at
lower levels of human development: 29 percent
(relative to men) in low human development
countries, compared with 12 percent in very
high human development countries (figure
4.12). In Sub- Saharan Africa women show
both a high labour force participation rate and
a high burden in care work, heavily restricting
their free time — in Tanzania women have less
than two hours of leisure a day.

In Denmark, Germany and New Zealand,
where leisure time is more than five hours a day,
the gap between men and women is very small

contributed to this change, as have evolving
social standards and the increasing engagement
of women in paid work.

Grandparents, if available, often spend time
caring for grandchildren (figure 4.13). In some
cases there may be very little choice. In China,
where parents from rural areas work in urban
areas as migrant workers, grandparents provide
care to 19 million children whose parents are
both away.54 Worldwide, as of 2013, approx-
imately 18 million children under age 18 had
lost one or both parents due to AIDS-related
causes. Many of them are cared for by their
grandparents.55

or nonexistent. These countries have strong
public policies that promote gender equality
and women’s participation in the labour market
as well as facilitative social norms. Although
data are missing for some developing countries,
the gap is 18 percent in Eastern Europe and
Central Asia, 16 percent in the Arab States,

Unpaid care work carries within it an overrid-
ing human and social imperative. However,
such a pressing imperative can also result in
limiting the choices of those who are expected
to provide it. As the need for care evolves and
alternatives such as state-provided services do
not keep up, these expectations and traditional
roles can further circumscribe options, unless
structural shifts take place towards a more
equitable sharing of such work. As illustrative
examples, this section presents three emerging

The sources of caregiving are changing, and
in many households men are taking on more
domestic responsibilities, as with child care.
This is happening even as the total time invest-
ed in the care of children within the family is
growing. For example in the United States
fathers spent on average 55 minutes a day on
child care in 2010–2014, up from about 20
minutes in 1965. In comparison, an American
mother spent about 100 minutes on child care
in 2010–2014, up from about 90 minutes in
1965.53 The increase relative to the 1965 value
was smaller for women (roughly a tenth) than
for men (more than double). Changes in fam-
ily structure and the shift from extended fam-
ilies to more mobile nuclear families have also

challenges — care gaps, health shocks and cli-
mate change.

Care gaps

Different age groups have different care needs,
and as populations age, the nature of the servic-
es needed also changes. Traditionally, the care
needs of infants and children have predominat-
ed, and economic, public, social and cultural
institutions have evolved to meet them. While
institutional arrangements change — for ex-
ample, through the provision of parental leave
or changes in what is expected of men and
women — the broad contours of the kind of
care services needed, how they will be provid-
ed, and money and time commitments are well
understood. As fertility rates fall in most of the
world, the number of children needing care is
likely to decrease, although how the effort is
distributed across the various actors will change
and — hopefully — move to a more equitable
distribution between men and women.

By contrast, as the number of children need-
ing care falls, the care needs of older people will
become increasingly important. The economic
provisioning for this at the aggregate level is
captured to some extent by the economic de-
pendency ratio — the ratio of those ages 65 and
older (not in the labour force) to those ages
15–64 (in the labour force). However, as with
children, a substantial part of what is needed
comes from care provided within families,
which is not captured by conventional eco-
nomic measures.

BOX 4.2

Recent estimates indicate that there is a global
shortage of 13.6 million care workers, causing
extreme deficits in long-term care services for
those over age 65.56 The total need for elder
care increases with the number of older people
and the frequency with which their inability to
perform ordinary activities goes up. Some 110–
190 million people worldwide experience major
difficulties in functioning and need long-term
care in their daily lives.57 These needs can be met
partly through paid care services acquired from
outside the household (either market based or
publicly provided); however, a considerable part
comes from the unpaid care work of household
and family members, provided predominantly
by women. It is here that traditional gender roles
may combine with increasing longevity, shrink-
ing household sizes and limited access to alterna-
tives to lead to a higher and disproportionately
shared burden of care borne by women, restrict-
ing further the choices available in engaging in
other forms of work.

While this is already a concern in several
developed countries — notably Japan, where
26 percent of the population was over age 65
in 2014 and the cost of caring for them is ex-
pected to more than double by 2050,58 in spite
of the availability of alternative mechanisms
(box 4.2) — it is also imminent in others. For in-
stance, in the United Sates the burden of elder
care relative to its value in 2010 rises relatively
slowly — by about a sixth by 2030 and about a
fifth by 2080 (figure 4.14). But in China the
rise is much more rapid — by about two-fifths
by 2030 and doubling by about 2050.59

Japan has developed a system for providing care for
older people through exchanges of “time credits.”
The mutual support networks of Fureai Kippu (“ticket
for a caring relationship”) emerged in urban grass-
roots mutual-help groups such as the Help of Daily
Living Association in Tokyo and the Kobe Life Care
Association.

Under the system people offer care to older people
or disabled people in their own homes for meals or bath-
ing or provide help shopping or preparing food. In return,

the caregivers receive electronic tickets paid into a com-
puterized savings account. They can save these Fureai
Kippu for their own use in the future or transfer them
to someone of their choice, typically a parent or family
member. In some cases they can convert Fureai Kippu
into a cash equivalent.

The system helps older people avoid or postpone
moving to an expensive retirement home. It can also
reduce the time they spend in hospital after a medical
problem. Above all, it improves their quality of life.

There is a global
shortage of about
14 million care workers

Part of the unpaid
work that women do
is related to fetching
water and gathering
fuel and firewood

Regardless of where and when the need will
become apparent, the care of older people is an
increasingly urgent issue. Should conventional
gender roles and a lack of public alternatives
continue to prevail, women may find their
choices to be increasingly constrained.

Health shocks

Care work becomes even more critical during
severe health crises, such as those caused by
HIV/AIDS, avian flu and Ebola. In countries
with weak health services the burden often falls
on caregivers working silently within the home.
In these circumstances people are expected to
sacrifice themselves for their families and com-
munities, even putting their own well-being
at risk. Traditional gender-differentiated roles
then result in a further restriction of options
for women, often greatest for the poor, who can
least afford them.

For example, across Southern Africa unpaid,
voluntary, informal networks of care providers
have emerged as a critical vanguard in the provi-
sion of care to sick people and orphans in crises
such as HIV/AIDS. As public health systems
across the region face a barrage of challenges,
family and community care providers, albeit
with minimal support, fill in a health care gap
left by governments.

The gender dimensions of this are evident. As
seen in the recent Ebola outbreak, women were
especially affected. Confirmed cases are overall
equitably distributed between men and women,
with women’s numbers of cases just slightly
higher. But the gendered dimensions of the
outbreak go beyond infection rates. Evidence
points to women’s expected social role as carers
of the sick for their increased vulnerability to
infection and for greater calls on their time due
to the sickness within the family and school clo-
sures. These responsibilities result in a decreased
participation in economic activity, compounded
further by road and market closures. Finally, in a
vicious cycle, as the economy shrinks and reve-
nues fall, cuts in public spending redistribute
care costs to those who can least afford to pay.60

Climate change

Studies have already demonstrated that part of
the unpaid work that women do is related to

fetching water and gathering fuel and firewood
— close to 2 billion people in developing
countries use traditional biomass fuels as their
primary source of energy.61 A 2003 study high-
lighting examples from Sub- Saharan Africa
noted that women spent more time than men
in these activities, with variations driven by res-
idence in rural or urban areas.62 Other factors
that impact the time spent include infrastruc-
ture and access to services, where household
income is also a factor. Overall, the burden is
likely to be the highest for the poor, especially
in rural areas where access to modern cooking
fuels and improved water resources is especially
weak.

Biodiversity decline and deforestation have
meant that wood — the most widely used solid
fuel — is located farther from the places where
people live. A similar result holds for ground-
water. Meeting these pressing needs means
that women and girls have less time than ever
to take part in alternative activities, paid or
unpaid.

These pressures are likely to be accentuated
by climate change. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change reported in its
2014 assessment that it is virtually certain that
climate change will reduce renewable water
resources substantially in most dry, subtropical
regions, resulting in scarcity of drinking water
and biomass-based fuels.63 Many of these re-
gions lie in Sub- Saharan Africa and other less
developed parts of the world, where women
and girls already spend considerable time each
day in meeting these requirements for their
homes. Should there continue to be a lack of
relevant infrastructure or more equitable shar-
ing between men and women, climate change
will further reduce choices for women.

Towards a rebalancing —
expanding choices,
empowering people

The work that women do — paid and unpaid —
has major human development implications for
themselves and for others. Paid work provides
economic autonomy along with opportunities
for participation and social interaction, as well
as for enhancing skills and capabilities, helping
boost self-esteem and confidence. But unpaid

Chapter 4 Imbalances in paid and unpaid work | 121

care and community work are vital for human
well-being and have both individual and social
value. Unpaid caregivers seldom get to exercise
choice in fulfilling their responsibilities and are
often motivated by cultural, family and societal
constraints. When people undertake care re-
sponsibilities and stay out of the labour force,
they make large sacrifices, perhaps missing
the chance to expand their capabilities in the
workplace. They also often compromise their
economic independence and personal auton-
omy, which can be crucial for them and their
children.

Yet such caregiving makes a major contribu-
tion to human development, particularly by
offering personalized care for family members
— strengthening family bonds and boosting the
physical and mental well-being of other family
members, especially children and older peo-
ple. Mothers who are able to breastfeed their
babies, crucial for children’s health,64 and offer
care for the first 15 months have positive effects
on children’s education performance.65 And
workplaces that provide enabling conditions
and facilities are best able to support such care-
giving benefits. Carework for the community
enhances community well-being and improves
social cohesion.

Growing evidence also shows that daughters
of mothers in paid employment have advantag-
es later in life. A recent study based on a sample
of 50,000 adults in 25 countries concluded that
daughters of working mothers who completed
more years of schooling were more likely to
be employed, especially in a supervisory role,
and to earn a higher income. In the United
States, where daughters of working mothers
earned 23 percent more than daughters of stay-
at-home mothers, some of these effects were
stronger. The careers of sons appear not to be
significantly influenced by having a working
mother, not surprising as generally men are
expected to work, but sons of working mothers
appear to spend more time on child care and
housework.66

An educated and professionally active
mother can inspire and stimulate her children
intellectually and serve as a positive role model
for her children. However, in many countries
public provision for family support services
and facilities has become more difficult due to
cutbacks in public social services, threatening

women’s participation in activity outside the
home.

The questions become: How can society
create an enabling environment where women
can make empowered choices? What would be
needed to translate such choices into an equita-
ble balance between men and women in roles,
responsibilities and outcomes for both paid
and unpaid work?

Such interventions are discussed further in
chapter 6 but need to be made along four axes,
engaging a variety of actors and impacting all
men and women:
• Reducing and sharing the burden of unpaid
care work — including universal access to clean
water, modern energy services for household
needs, quality public services (including
those related to health and care), workplace
arrangements that accommodate flexible
schedules without penalizing professional
advancement and a shift in mindsets about
gender-specific roles and responsibilities.

• Expanding opportunities for women to engage
in paid work — including access to quality
higher education in all fields, proactive re-
cruitment efforts and reducing barriers to
entrepreneurship.

• Improving outcomes at work — including
legislative measures such as those related to
workplace harassment and equal pay, manda-
tory parental leave, equitable opportunities
to expand knowledge and expertise and
measures to eliminate the attrition of human
capital and expertise when engaged in care
work (box 4.3).

• Changing norms — including promoting
women in visible positions of seniority,
responsibility and decisionmaking in both
public and private spheres and encouraging
the engagement of men in traditionally
female- dominated professions.

Conclusions

Beyond economic contribution, paid and un-
paid work has social value with considerable
human development implications.

There have been positive developments in
policies, social norms and attitudes and chang-
ing roles of men and women in various societies
that should lead to a rebalancing in the world

BOX 4.3

Paid parental leave, including mandatory paternity leave

Paid parental leave is one of the most important ben-
efits of flexibility extended to working parents, espe-
cially when mandatory paternity leave policies are
implemented. The correct mix of policies can help
ensure high rates of female labour force participation
and motivated, satisfied workers with a good work–life
balance.

Paid maternity leave benefits are essential for
women to return to work after child bearing. About
85 percent of countries provide at least 12 weeks of
maternity leave. Of 185 countries surveyed by the
International Labour Organization, all but 2 (Papua
New Guinea and the United States) allow mothers to
receive at least some leave — paid for by the state, by
employers or by some combination of both. Though only
a third of countries meet the recommended minimum of
at least 14 weeks off for new mothers, paid at least at
two-thirds their salary and funded publicly, the picture is
broadly good in developed countries and is improving in
developing countries.1

But career breaks due to maternity leave alone have
unintended consequences that may adversely impact
women’s careers. And such consequences are greater
when leave is lengthy. For example, when women return
to work after maternity leave, evidence suggests that
as with other aspects of flexibility, they are penalized
for taking paid maternity leave, particularly when the
leave is generous. Time away from the labour market
may reduce women’s earning power and pension ben-
efits as they miss chances to gain experience and win
promotion. Moving into senior management becomes
particularly hard.

In Germany each year of maternity leave a wom-
an takes lowers her earnings upon resuming work by
6–20 percent. In France each year of absence is esti-
mated to lower earnings by 7 percent.2 The effect is
magnified when lengthy maternity leave is combined
with policies to encourage part-time work, which tempt
more women back into the labour force but keep them
in junior positions. In fact, it has been argued that the
Elternkarenz, which pays parents to stay home for up to
three years in Germany and up to two years in Austria, is
effectively destroying career prospects for women who
use it.3

Despite paid maternity leave, motherhood in the
United Kingdom comes with a pay penalty: 60 percent

of working mothers with children either at nursery or
primary school work part time, as do half those with
older, secondary school–age children. Just 10 percent
of fathers work part time. Women who work part time
average a third less an hour than men who work full
time, and 40 percent of part-time female workers earn
less than the living wage.4

A 1981 child care law in Chile was intended to in-
crease the percentage of women who work, which is
below 50 percent. It requires that companies with 20
or more female workers provide and pay for child care
for women with children under age 2 in a nearby loca-
tion where the women can go to feed them. It eased
the transition back to work and helped children’s de-
velopment, but it also led to a 9–20 percent decline in
women’s starting salaries.5

Policies that effectively define women by their role
as mothers affect workplace outcomes for all women,
not just those who take long leaves. During the paid
absence of a young parent, no employer may hire a
permanent replacement. Since women are more likely
than men to take long parental leaves, employers have
a strong incentive to hire men. Europe’s equal employ-
ment laws make such discrimination illegal, but evi-
dence shows that employers differentiate anyway.6

The issue of paternity leave has received attention
as the role of fathers in childrearing and sharing the care
burden has been emphasized. Many countries now offer
paternity leave. One approach that promotes balance is
parental leave, to be split between mothers and fathers.
Several European countries, as well as Australia and
New Zealand, already have such a system. The down-
side is that because child rearing is traditionally seen as
a mother’s job, fathers tend not to take any leave, unless
it is made mandatory.

In Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland, where
all parental leave is transferrable, only about 3 percent
of fathers use it. Countries are thus pursuing different
approaches to overcome the problem. In Chile, Italy and
Portugal paternal leave is compulsory. Fathers may be
induced to use more paternal leave through such in-
centives as relaxing the gender-neutral approach and
granting a bonus to parents who share parental leave
more equally. For example, through similar measures,
Germany saw the share of fathers taking time off rise
from 3 percent in 2006 to 32 percent in 2013.7

Chapter 4 Imbalances in paid and unpaid work | 123

Overcoming
imbalances in paid and
unpaid work is critical
for sustainable work

of work. Education, social policies and mod-
ernizing societies have played a part.

Yet we are far from the desired results.
Governments can promote measures to foster
enabling conditions for men and women to
make empowered choices through policy, but
government measures can go only part of the

way. The ultimate focus should be on sharing
responsibilities and mutual contributions by
men and women in overcoming imbalances
in paid and unpaid work, critical not only in
a rapidly changing and ageing world but also
for sustainable work — a theme taken up in
chapter 5.

Decreasing sustainability

Moving to sustainable work

The previous chapters have shown how the trends that are transforming the world of work — driven by market forces, but
also encouraged and moderated by public actions and societal transitions — can deliver substantial future gains for human
development. Another great imminent shift for how we live and work is the move towards sustainable development. It
seems to have begun in some countries but is generally piecemeal. At the same time, it comes with a sombre imperative
and urgency: If we collectively fail to make the move in a timely fashion, the thwarted human potential of current and future
generations could prove catastrophic.

The move thus requires a deliberate, planned
departure from business as usual. It calls for
explicit collaboration and coordination across
countries and regions and across public and
private actors. And it brings to the fore some
of the global and intergenerational ramifica-
tions of work.

Setting the context: goals for
sustainable development

The Millennium Development Goals —
anchored in the Millennium Declaration1 of
2000 — set quantified targets to reduce depri-
vations in the basic dimensions of human de-
velopment by 2015. Since 2013 a process has
been under way to help define the post-2015
development agenda and to extend and expand
the work under the Millennium Development
Goals. As part of this process the Member
States of the United Nations formulated, in
late 2014, goals for sustainable development.

Eliminating human deprivations and dis-
parities in human progress is at the heart of
the Sustainable Development Goals, a com-
mitment to improving the living conditions
of and opportunities for every individual in
the world by 2030. Achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals would transform the sta-
tus of human development (box 5.1). Indeed
the efforts of UN Member States to frame and
adopt these goals signal the political intent to
make the collective shift towards accelerating
and sustaining human development.

The Sustainable Development Goals en-

compass three elements:
• They assert the primacy of poverty eradica-
tion within the framework of sustainable
development.

• They are universal, covering all countries

and individuals.

• They set time-bound targets with progress
to be monitored and reported nationally,
regionally and globally.
The Sustainable Development Goals thus
continue to advance the practical realization
of the human development approach: putting
people at the centre of development to enhance
the possibility of fully realizing their potential.

Sustainability in the human
development framework

This universal approach — making develop-
ment matter for all people in the world, now
and in the future — is also at the core of the
human development paradigm. The real foun-
dation of human development is universalism
in acknowledging the life claims of everyone.
The universalism of life claims is the common
thread that binds the demands of human de-
velopment today with the exigencies of devel-
opment tomorrow, especially environmental
preservation and regeneration.

The strongest argument for protecting the
environment, from a human development
perspective, is to guarantee future generations
a diversity and richness of choices similar to
those enjoyed by previous generations. Human
development and sustainability are thus essen-
tial components of the same ethic of the uni-
versalism of life claims.2 This is also consistent
with sustainable development — conventionally
defined by the World Commission on
Environment and Development (1987) as, “de-
velopment that meets the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs.”3

Human development
and sustainability are
essential components
of the same ethic of
the universalism
of life claims

BOX 5.1

The Sustainable Development Goals and human development

One of the principal outcomes of the Rio+20
Conference in 2012 was the agreement by Member
States to develop a set of Sustainable Development
Goals that would transition the world from the
Millennium Development Goals to the post-2015
development agenda. It was decided to establish an
“inclusive and transparent intergovernmental process
on Sustainable Development Goals that is open to
all stakeholders, with a view to developing global
sustainable development goals to be agreed by the
United Nations General Assembly.”1

Accordingly, an intergovernmental Open Working
Group was created and met 13 times over 2013–2014,
receiving inputs and information from academics, civil

society representatives, technical experts and various
entities from the multilateral system.

The group agreed on 17 goals and 169 targets that
constitute the Sustainable Development Goals. Since
January 2015 the UN General Assembly has been discuss-
ing them, leading to their adoption by the heads of states
and governments at the UN Sustainable Development
Summit in September 2015. They address five areas of
critical importance for humanity and the planet.

Simultaneously, a process is under way at the United
Nations Statistical Commission to agree on the statisti-
cal indicators to monitor progress towards the goals and
targets at the global, regional and national levels. The
indicators are expected to be finalized in 2016.

132 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

Simply stated, ensuring sustainability for
human development has three requirements,
which the Sustainable Development Goals seek
to ensure:
• The number and range of life-enhancing
opportunities — at home, at work and in the
community — available to all individuals over
their lifetimes and that of their descendants
does not diminish.

• The capabilities to take advantage of these
opportunities — over all individuals’ lifetimes
and across generations — continue to be
enhanced.

• Social, cultural, political or physical barriers
that may inhibit individuals from accessing
opportunities that best meet their capabilities
— whether due to lack of participation, secu-
rity, empowerment or infrastructure — are
eliminated.
But achieving an equitable and enduring
sharing of the fruits of development, within
and across generations, is not straightforward.
On the one hand, the collective resources avail-
able for making the necessary advances have
never been greater. Global wealth and income
are higher than ever before: Global wealth
increased $20 trillion over 2013, to $263 tril-
lion in 2014, while world GDP reached about
$78 trillion.4 Human ingenuity continues to
generate innovative solutions that build on our
increasing understanding of the world around
us, thus providing grounds for optimism about
enhancing opportunities and capabilities.

On the other hand, human activity, if it con-
tinues along a business-as-usual path, imperils
the continuity of the gains so far, as well as the
potential for advances in the future, both for
ourselves and our descendants. These threats,
driven most immediately by the unsustainable
use of natural resources, as well as by the dif-
ficulty in resolving social barriers, vary both
in scale — from the global to the local — and
in scope. If unchecked or unmitigated, these
threats will also limit the ability to continue to
pursue some forms of work as natural resources
degrade.

At the local level these connections have
been clear for some time, and in many cases
local solutions have been devised. For exam-
ple, traditional societies in many parts of the
world developed systems to sustainably harvest
and use rainwater for agricultural work. Such

systems, managed at the community level, are
the theme of a special contribution made by
His Excellency Maithripala Sirisena, President
of Sri Lanka (signed box).

Other more recent examples abound. In
1962 Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring spotlighted
the harm caused to natural systems and humans
through the overuse of dichlorodiphenyl-
trichloroethane (commonly known as DDT)
as a pesticide in agriculture. Later the adverse
local impacts of indoor and outdoor air pollu-
tion, land degradation, loss of forest cover and
unsustainable patterns of water use, especially
in agriculture, all sparked corrective action in
many parts of the world.

Over time the scope of such measures has
expanded from beyond the immediate com-
munity of producers and consumers to the
provincial and national levels, where costs
and benefits may be more widely dispersed. A
common framework for estimating impacts,
assessing trade-offs and making decisions is
cost–benefit analysis.5 Such analysis can include
estimates of lost employment; however, not all
job losses are equivalent. On the one hand a
large unemployment figure could eventually
have only a minor effect if all the workers are
quickly rehired by another firm or in another
industry. On the other hand a much smaller
total number of jobs lost could be very harmful
if concentrated in a one-factory town or if the
affected workers have few transferable skills
and prospects for future employment.

For an example of a cost–benefit analysis,
take the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
in the United States, which drastically cut
emissions of air pollutants through regulations
affecting many industries such as power plants,
motor vehicles and other dispersed sources
such as dry cleaners and commercial bakeries.
Apart from the associated benefits to the en-
vironment, it is also estimated that millions of
cases of respiratory problems and hundreds of
thousands of serious illnesses and deaths were
averted by 2010. These potentially prevented
13 million lost working days and 3.2 million
lost school days.6

But the average earnings for workers in reg-
ulated sectors fell more than 5 percent in the
three years after the new regulations were en-
acted. Earnings began to recover only five years
after the policy change. The average worker

generations, is not

SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION

Community participation for improving rural livelihoods — lessons from the past

Centuries of irrigated agriculture and rice farming have been embedded in
Sri Lanka’s cultural traditions, enriching the lives of her people in all as-
pects. The relevance of these traditional occupations to the demands of a
modern economy has to be defined now.

Strengthening the national economy for reducing inequality and
eliminating poverty is a key objective of the new government of Sri Lanka.
Improving the productivity of the agriculture sector is one main means of
strengthening the national economy envisaged by the government. Since
ancient times agriculture has received special attention as a means for en-
suring food security and as a source of employment. Despite attempts to
diversify the rural economy, the importance of agriculture as a source of
employment has persisted over time, though in recent decades improving
productivity has been a main objective for the sector.

The agriculture sector is faced with challenges on many fronts.
Development of new technologies for controlling pests and weeds and
improving the productivity of crops to keep abreast of competition is one
challenge. It is connected to overuse, pollution and serious health issues,
reducing labour productivity. Sustainable means of supplying water and
other resources for agriculture is a second challenge. A third is the popula-
tion growth, industrialization and urbanization that have made water and
land more scarce and land less productive. Fourth, the unplanned use of for-
est land for development purposes has dried the groundwater table, reduc-
ing the availability of water for agriculture. Fifth, such developments have
exposed hillsides to acute weather conditions. The topsoils of the slopes
unprotected by trees are washed off. This makes land less arable. The
washed-off soil sediments settle in rivers and irrigation systems. The irriga-
tion system then needs regular maintenance and cleaning; otherwise silt-
ation reduces the capacity of tanks and waterways to store and carry water.
Sixth, changing weather patterns have reduced rainfall and increased the
need for irrigated water.

These issues of maintaining rural agricultural ecosystems for sustain-
ing agriculture have been a challenge for farmers for centuries. But col-
lective action by farmer societies has ensured not only the protection of
agricultural ecosystems, but also the collection and storage of periodic
rainwater for use throughout the year.

Rural farmers in Sri Lanka who commenced their civilization in the dry
zone overcame these challenges through collective action. Ancient farm-
ers knew the importance of protecting the independent natural resource
systems of the villages for sustaining agriculture and maximizing the use

of scarce resources. They worked together to create irrigation systems that
were able to collect periodic or seasonal rainwater and store them in village
tanks to meet the livelihood needs of their communities. There are estimat-
ed to be more than 18,000 village tanks in Sri Lanka. They are strategically
located or constructed to collect rainwater. Moreover, a collection of these
small tanks creates a system of water collection and storage to ensure that
farmers get maximum benefit from periodic or seasonal rains.

Such irrigation systems can be sustained only with proper manage-
ment. First the forests and land in the catchment areas of these tanks
need to be preserved to ensure proper water collection. The canals and
waterways that connect the village tanks have to be removed of silt and
cleaned to ensure proper flow of water. Localized governance of village tank
systems has ensured that they are maintained regularly. Because the farm-
ers who owned and managed the irrigation systems were also the main
beneficiaries of these systems, they had to ensure timely management of
the systems.

The protection of forests in the catchment areas to the village tanks
were also ensured by the farmer societies. These self-governance strate-
gies were both effective and low cost. Most important, farmers had to man-
age these common properties so that the benefits to the community were
maximized rather than accruing to individuals. This need to manage common
properties for the benefit of all brought together farmers to form societies in
rural Sri Lanka. Farmers today benefit from the efforts of their predecessors
who built the village irrigation resource management systems.

The agriculture sector today is different from the one that existed 50
years ago. Today’s farmers are not subsistence farmers. They grow crops
for commercial purposes. Some focus on integrated agricultural produc-
tion enterprises aimed at adding value. As such, directly replicating the
governance structures adopted by village farming societies may not be
totally appropriate in today’s context. But self-governance, knowledge
of environmental resources and their protection as well as solutions for
dealing with resource scarcity are all lessons we can learn from the prac-
tices of village farming communities of the past. Such collective action
may enable rural farmers in Sri Lanka to protect their environment, adapt
to changing weather patterns and improve the productivity of agricultural
practices. Finally, with commercialized business acumen farmers can be-
come bigger contributors to the economy. If they so succeed, our govern-
ment’s key objective of minimizing inequality and eliminating poverty will
bear fruit.

in a regulated sector is estimated to have lost
the equivalent of 20 percent of pre-regulatory
earnings.7 But the precise cost depended on
demographics, industry structure and the
state of the economy,8 and these estimates of
forgone earnings were far below the associated
health benefits that accrued to a wider range
of individuals — even when measured in purely
economic terms.9

Such effects now transcend local, national
or even regional boundaries and affect the
entire planet — winners and losers can be far
removed by geography or time, presenting a
notable challenge to how impacts are managed.
One prominent example is climate change,
associated with a long-term increase in average
temperatures around the world, with changes
in precipitation patterns, with a rise in the
mean sea level and with a higher frequency of
extreme weather events.

The calamitous impacts of climate change on
human development — if not dealt with — have
been put forward in many fora, including the
2011 Human Development Report.10 These in-
clude changes that will greatly affect work and
the conditions under which people — especially
the poor — labour.

For example, in the Lower Mekong Basin in
South-East Asia — occupied by primarily river-
ine and agrarian communities — climate change
will seriously affect the lives and livelihoods of
more than 42 million people. There will be ma-
jor shifts in crop suitability, increased mortality
of livestock, declining aquaculture yields, great-
er heat stress following working in the fields

TABLE 5.1

Greenhouse gas emissions and employment by sector

and higher incidence of various diseases.11 To
adapt to these challenges, people will have to
change how they work and manage risks.

At the global level current estimates indicate
that if greenhouse gas emissions — the immedi-
ate driver of climate change — are unchecked,
global surface temperature increases will be
between 3.7°C and 4.8°C above pre-industrial
levels by 2100.12 To limit this to the agreed-up-
on target of 2˚C requires a (generally accepted)
reduction of 40–70 percent (relative to 2010)
in total emissions by 2050. Such a reduction,
while feasible, would evidently affect the hun-
dreds of millions at work in the sectors that
contribute these emissions (table 5.1).

These sectors tend to be connected to human
development through multiple pathways, and
how the mitigation efforts are undertaken has
important consequences. For example, in de-
veloping countries there is a strong positive as-
sociation between energy consumption and the
Human Development Index (figure 5.1). This is
also supported by abundant empirical evidence
for access to modern energy services, improving
health, reducing poverty, raising living stand-
ards and facilitating positive gender outcomes.

In 2012, 1.3 billion people lacked electricity,
and 2.7 billion relied on traditional biomass
as household fuel.13 Expanding access to elec-
tricity would be an essential part of any pro-
gramme to enhance human development, yet
a business-as-usual approach would be difficult
to reconcile with the global goal for containing
climate change, even if consistent with local
sustainability considerations.

Work and sustainable
development

As earlier chapters have made clear, work can
have unintended consequences that go well
beyond the people directly engaged in it —
extending also to those far removed by geogra-
phy or time. The consequences need not always
be negative — the activities tied to such work
could be changed to maintain human progress
and produce positive benefits for many people
not directly associated with them.

Sustainable work

Most effects of work on environmental sus-
tainability and human development run along
a continuum, encompassing positive and neg-
ative effects (see infographic at the beginning
of the chapter). Work that promotes human
development while reducing or eliminating
negative side effects and unintended conse-
quences is termed “sustainable work.”

Sustainable work (in the top-right square of
the matrix in the infographic) takes place in
developed and developing economies, but it
can differ in scale, in the conditions of work,

in the links to human development and in the
implications for policy. It is similar to “green
jobs,” broadly defined as “any decent job that
contributes to preserving or restoring the
quality of the environment, be it in agriculture,
industry, services or administration,” but differs
in two important ways.14

First, sustainable work need not be under-
taken in the context of earning a living and
therefore encompasses the efforts of volunteers,
artists, advocates and others. Second, it carries an
imperative for advancing human development
by channelling work towards the top-right in
the matrix. For example, retrofitting car engines
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or replacing
traditional biomass-burning cook stoves with
solar cookers are both “green” activities, but the
latter can have greater meaning for human devel-
opment if it frees women and girls from having
to collect firewood and enables them instead to
take part in economic activities or go to school.15
Each country differs on the relative distribu-
tion of work within the matrix. There may also
be trade-offs across the matrix. For example,
volunteers afforesting degraded land that is
lying fallow deliver benefits for sustainabili-
ty and for human development. But if such

Sustainable work

development while
reducing or eliminating
negative side effects
and unintended
consequences

136 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

afforestation is accompanied by lost economic
opportunities from not expanding agriculture
into those areas, the trade-off would need to
be resolved through the expression of a social
preference (say, by demarcating a protected area
to preserve biodiversity) or some alternative
system of generating a livelihood.

For sustainable work to become more widely
prevalent, three developments are needed in
parallel, each requiring specific actions by na-
tional and international policymakers, industry
and other private sector actors, civil society and
individuals:
• Termination. Some existing work will have
to end, and the workers displaced will need
to be accommodated in other occupations
(bottom-left square of the matrix in the
infographic).

• Transformation. Some existing work will need
to be transformed in order to be preserved
through a combination of investment in ad-
aptable new technologies and retraining or
skill upgrading (top-left and bottom-right of
the matrix in the infographic).

• Creation. Some work will be largely novel,
benefiting both sustainability and human de-
velopment, but will emerge from outside the
current set of occupations (top-right square
of the matrix in the infographic).
The move towards sustainable work departs
from the business-as-usual path; it is also driven
by an urgent timeline. Planetary boundaries,
such as those related to greenhouse gas emis-
sions or biosphere integrity, have already been
transgressed, presaging an irreversible shift to a
far less hospitable environment. So there is no
time to lose. And as natural resources essential
for livelihoods and life (such as the quality of
topsoil or water) get depleted or degraded due
to unsustainable use and climate change, the
human development gains of local populations
could be reversed, possibly accompanied by
conflict or mass migrations.

Public policy can stimulate efforts by the
private sector, social institutions, scientific
bodies, advocacy groups, worker associations
and individual leaders. For example, a review of
planned and implemented environmental pol-
icy measures in nine developed and emerging
countries found that appreciable gains in net
employment were possible when complementa-
ry policies and incentives, including tax credits,

subsidies and worker training, were in place.16
Even when a particular area of work is inherent-
ly green and arises spontaneously in response to
market forces, additional efforts are needed to
secure the most gains for human development,
as suggested in a special contribution by Nohra
Padilla, the recipient of the 2013 Goldman
Environmental Prize (signed box).

Some of the issues linked to termination,
transformation and creation are detailed below.
Many sectors are involved (and many exam-
ples are possible), but we highlight those that
impact the lives of hundreds of millions of the
poor and that will be pivotal to accelerating the
pace of human development.

Termination — managing losses

Some occupations can be expected to be pre-
served and even gain importance by moving
to sustainable work. For example, as countries
invest in mass transit systems to manage ur-
banization and commuter traffic, railway tech-
nicians are likely to be in demand. Others will
not be so lucky.

The workers who might find themselves
terminated can be expected to predominate in
sectors that draw heavily on natural resources
or emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants.
About 50 million people are employed glob-
ally in such sectors (7 million in coal mining,
for example). In Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development countries the
“seven most polluting industries account for
over 80 percent of emissions while employing
only about 10 percent of the workforce.”17
China expects to lose more than 800,000
jobs in obsolete power and steel plants over
2005–2020 due to national policies for pollu-
tion abatement and energy efficiency.18 Indeed,
such measures are at least partly responsible for
the declining fortunes of the coal industry —
the market capitalization of the four largest US
coal companies was $1.2 billion in May 2015,
down from $22 billion in 2010.19

Such changes are not new. For example, un-
profitable coal mines were shut down in Poland
in the 1990s. The collapse of the population
of North Atlantic cod led to the closure of the
cod fishing industry in Canada and Norway.

SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION

Recyclers: from waste pickers to global agents of sustainable development

The Millennium Development Goals and the post-2015 Agenda for
Sustainable Development have drawn attention to the world’s 20 million
recyclers. Given the international nature of these platforms, this attention
will likely lead to local and national policies to bring them dignified living
conditions and decent work for them, as well as recognition of the benefits
of the work that they do and resolution of the problems caused by capital-
ism, social injustice and economic inequality.

Many recyclers like us were born and grew up — and some have died
— in the dump sites of developing countries across the globe. Certainly,
none of us 30 years ago would have imagined that our work would be a
source of recognition instead of an object of contempt and rejection. Many
families displaced by conflicts and massive layoffs in factories — including
immigrants and poor people excluded from production systems and from the
benefits of social and human development, with limited opportunities for
decent life and work — were forced to take on this humble work, rummaging
through piles of garbage looking for recyclable waste.

Garbage was paradise for millions of families of “waste pickers,” pro-
viding them with their daily food, blankets with which to cover themselves
and the roofs of the shanties that they carved out for themselves in corners
of the city. Even now, although they collect tonnes of materials that are
recycled to produce new goods consumed by people throughout the world,
regardless of social rank, many of today’s recyclers still find in the trash
much of what they need to survive.

The increasing use of recycling in production activities opened the doors
to a magical world where recyclers discovered the importance of their work
and the need to change their relationships with society and the market.
Recyclers began to demand that society recognize, acknowledge and support
their work. Their first gains were in organization: Cooperatives and associa-
tions were set up to protect their work at the local level and were followed by
the formation of networks for regional, continental and global action. These
organizations have fought for and have achieved policies that promote recy-
cling as a component of public sanitation services and that reallocate public
budgets accordingly. As a consequence of the demands of the recyclers, who
have become increasingly organized and have assumed a role in defining the
rules to protect the environment and human needs, governments in many
countries have developed measures that strengthen recycling.

The numbers on recycling are impressive: millions of tonnes of recycled
materials and new products on the market, millions in profits and savings
for businesses and the public treasury, livelihoods for millions of people,
reduced demand for natural resources and millions of square metres of land
not used for garbage disposal. However, many recyclers are still working
informally and very little money generated reaches the pockets of these
workers, who are at the lowest rung of the recycling chain.

Cooperatives and associations that have successfully shifted from in-
dividual negotiations to collective bargaining for the benefit of the entire
trade have pushed negotiations further, obtaining better market prices and
additional income from services and waste recycling. However, much re-
mains to be done so that more recyclers in the world can, in addition to
gaining a livelihood, provide education opportunities and new prospects for
their children. The children of this new generation of recyclers will be able
to choose, thanks to their parent’s work, between continuing in the family
trade and entering another profession.

Leaders with vision are decisive in promoting policies and processes
that benefit and recognize the Recyclers’ Trade Union and that draw atten-
tion to the value chain in order to strengthen its activity. Organizational,
commercial and business processes around recycling are not easy; they
require transparent and collaborative relationships as well as government
support programmes, policy measures and markets. In sum, they require a
comprehensive system that addresses many pillars that, while difficult to
build, are essential for recyclers to grow and strengthen their role for the
benefit of society as a whole.

The world is entering a new phase, and all societies, through its rep-
resentative institutions such as governments and grassroots organizations,
should take the responsibility of ensuring a path of social progress. This
must be achieved in particular for the millions of people who still do not en-
joy fundamental human rights and minimum living standards. Those without
access to water and basic sanitation services — both of which should be pro-
vided as a public good and not as a private for-profit service — should have
access to a clean environment, to decent work and to dignity. But above all,
we need to work together to overcome poverty, inequality and inequity so
that social development instruments in the world take into consideration the
hopes of millions of families.

and the costs of those measures. In most cases
governments played a major role in managing
the aftermath of the closure, either directly or
indirectly through existing safety nets.

One of the best documented experiences
is Poland, where economic conditions led to
the closure of 37 coal mines and the layoff of
269,000 workers over 16 years. Support meas-
ures included a lump-sum payment equivalent
to several months’ wages — larger if the worker
left voluntarily; a monthly payment for up to

24 months while the worker looked for a job;
and soft loans for setting up an enterprise,
amounting to over $9 billion (not including
debt forgiveness and other measures for the
firms in excess of $5 billion). About 60 percent
of the workers ultimately found new jobs. The
Polish support package rehabilitated a large
majority of workers; however, at a cost of about
$35,000 per worker20 it did not come cheap.

limited geographic or occupational mobility
as well as those in sectors where closures are
unanticipated. As countries move towards sus-
tainable work, special efforts may be needed to
plan for the orderly winding down of activities
in unviable sectors along with a package of
diversified assistance, including training, job
placement, business development, and income
and health support.

Transformation — changing
the nature of work

In many occupations how products are pro-
duced needs to change. For example, many
workers worldwide are employed in work
related to recycling, though the connection
to workers’ human development is not always
straightforward. Ship breaking is a prime ex-
ample in this regard — sustainable work can be
promoted by implementing standards (box 5.2)
Work in agriculture — including farming,
fisheries and forestry — engages more than
a billion people worldwide, including most
of those living on less than $1.25 a day.21 The
sector is responsible for a large proportion
of greenhouse gas emissions and for crossing

the planetary boundaries of the nitrogen and
phosphorous cycles.22 It is associated with
unsustainable patterns of water and soil use.
It is linked to deforestation and loss of biodi-
versity. And it is especially susceptible to the
disruptions of climate change. Its transition to
sustainable work is thus crucial, underscored by
Sustainable Development Goal targets that aim
to sustainably eradicate hunger and poverty
by 2030.

Increasing agricultural production is still crit-
ical, given growing populations and changing
consumption patterns, such as rising per capita
consumption of animal-based proteins. World
demand for agricultural products is expected
to rise 1.1 percent a year through 2050.23 Many
workers continue to be engaged in the agri-
cultural sector, particularly in Asia and Africa
(figure 5.2). However, the three traditional
ways of increasing production — yields, crop-
ping intensity and area under cultivation — may
all face limits. Increasing yields is possible if
water and fertilizer are used more efficiently.
Increasing cropping intensity and the area un-
der cultivation are constrained by the need to
protect forested areas and to manage (already
degraded) soil quality. Matters will only get

BOX 5.2

Transforming ship breaking: promoting sustainable work by implementing standards

Ship breaking is a multibillion-dollar industry in which
large commercial vessels are recycled at the end of
their operational lives, typically at 25–30 years. Rather
than leave them to gradually weather away and release
large volumes of harmful pollutants to the environment,
there is an active business in recycling all fuel, oils,
engine parts and fixtures, followed by the steel hull.
The top five ship-breaking countries are Bangladesh,
China, India, Pakistan and Turkey. The industry provides
a recycling solution to a gigantic problem, generates
thousands of jobs for low-skilled workers (directly and
in ancillary enterprises) and produces large volumes
of steel, which can be especially useful for non-steel-
producing countries.

All of these can be expected to lead to favourable
outcomes for both sustainability and, at one level, for
human development. However, the latter link is more
tenuous: In many countries, environmental and labour

safeguards for the industry are weak or not imple-
mented. Workers toil in physically hazardous conditions
and are exposed to toxic chemicals including asbestos,
polychlorinated biphenyls and a range of heavy metals.
Reports of children being employed are also frequent,
and pollutants released during the process contaminate
the local environment, accumulating to dangerous lev-
els over time.

Regulation and appropriate policy measures can
make the difference. In fact, a UN convention on ship
breaking exists and is supposed to maintain environ-
mental and labour standards.1 However, implementa-
tion is uneven, though a number of studies show that an
appropriate balancing of interests — strengthening the
gains for human development — is possible. Such bal-
ancing would become even more important as the vol-
ume of the industry is set to grow as many more ships
reach the end of their usable lives over the next decade.

Transforming
the way farmers

worse with the precipitation changes associated
with climate change.

Transforming the way farmers grow and
process crops is thus crucial. Technologies and
farming methods exist that can make the dif-
ference, but they need to be adopted faster. For
example, about a third of total food production
is lost or wasted, with cereals making up the
largest portion of wasted food.24 Technologies
exist that can prevent this, including commu-
nity-based mud silos (as in Ghana) and fami-
ly-based storage units and hermetically sealed
bags. Demonstrable, immediate gains are likely
for the individual farmer as well. But adoption
rates in developing countries are low, and ma-
jor efforts are needed to expand them and to
create new products for industrial or artisanal
manufacture.25

Improved crop varieties, resistant to the ef-
fects of climate change, can help — as can better
tilling, agroforestry and water harvesting (to
conserve soil nutrients and promote multiple
cropping), and smarter application of water
and fertilizer (such as microdosing and preci-
sion agriculture). But adopting them is slow
because of financial constraints, cultural and
traditional norms, and limited awareness and
training. These constraints can be alleviated

in particular contexts, through microfinance,
demonstrations by peer farmers26 and cell
phone–based information services.27

Agricultural extension services are now
provided by nongovernmental organizations
and private sector workers as well as the
more traditional government employees. The
number of extension workers varies widely
across countries, with more than 600,000 in
China. Coverage tends to be uneven — with
four extension workers per 1,000 family farms
in Brazil and Ethiopia, but less than one per
1,000 in India.28 Their reach among female
farmers tends to be especially poor — a concern
because women typically have a substantial role
in agriculture in developing countries but have
less access to market information, inputs and fi-
nances. To transform the way farmers cultivate
and process crops, the coverage and quality of
extension services have to increase.

Fertilizer use varies widely, and opportunities
exist for redistribution across regions (map 5.1)
— an occasion for cross-national collaboration.
To curb excessive fertilizer use — limiting subsi-
dies, introducing sustainable labelling schemes
and insuring farmers against unanticipated
losses — global policies need to integrate region-
al, national and even subnational practices.

Global conventions—
where they exist —
need to be translated
into effective actions
by local actors

In turn, global conventions — where they
exist — need to be translated into effective ac-
tions by local actors. Indeed, ship breaking (see
box 5.2) is just one example of global recycling
chains — which now include solar photovoltaic
panels, in addition to cars, smartphones, tablets
and other consumer durables — with many sim-
ilar issues. As we move towards sustainability
along one set of parameters, care must also be
paid to the burgeoning problem of poorly regu-
lated disposal and contamination of land, water
and air with novel and toxic pollutants.

Creation — moving to
new areas of work

Solar photovoltaic technologies, which convert
sunlight to electricity, are an important part of
many countries’ renewable energy strategies.
Their potential impact on human development
differs radically depending on whether they re-
place grid-based electricity (which is generated
by conventional means), as in many developed
countries, or expand off-grid energy access, as in
many developing countries. Solar photovoltaic

142 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

technologies could become a key vehicle for
achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7.1,
to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable
and modern energy services by 2030. Some
countries are thus pursuing renewable energy
sources to meet at least part of their energy
demand (box 5.3).

By providing energy through photovoltaic
technologies, developing countries can improve
human development in several ways. In many
parts of Africa and Asia solar home systems
provide access to electricity in rural areas (table
5.3). Photovoltaic technologies also generate
work for self-employed field assistants with basic
technical and vocational skills who sell and in-
stall systems and provide regular maintenance.
In India results of an industry survey suggested
that off-grid solar photovoltaic technologies sys-
tems generated about 90 direct (involved in the
actual manufacture of solar panels) and indirect
(through employment with dealers, manufacture
of products such as solar lanterns, home-lighting
kits and the like) jobs per megawatt.29

Several countries in South Asia have demon-
strated that such work is a viable option for
women, which allows them to balance work
with family care responsibilities. Renewable
energy also stimulates small enterprises such as
lantern rentals, phone and battery recharging
and so on. And replacing kerosene-based light-
ing reduces carbon dioxide emissions. There are
also reports of children spending longer hours
studying.30 Such positive impacts can be more
widely distributed through skill development and

training (including for those at the higher end of
the value chain), credit for purchases and better
technical capacity for indigenous adaptation and
innovation, as in Bangladesh. Many developing
countries are installing — and therefore gaining
expertise — in this technology (see table 5.3).
Given the large number of people still without ac-
cess to electricity, photovoltaic technologies rep-
resent an opportunity to leapfrog to a state that
advances human development and sustainability
simultaneously — an objective that can be fostered
by the UN global technology transfer mechanism.

Renewable energy
also stimulates
small enterprises

Implementing Tajikistan’s National Programme on Application of Renewable Energy Sources

In Tajikistan the adverse impact of energy use on the
environment has decreased over the past 20 years.
Greenhouse gas emissions have decreased by more
than 10 times as a result of a stimulated decrease in
the use of organic fuels for energy production. The
technologies for using renewable energy sources (solar,
wind, geothermal and certain types of biomass) do not
yet meet technical and economic parameters that could
make their wider use possible (especially in rural areas,
small social sites, for the production of greenhouse
crops and in everyday life), but progress is being made.
All these have implications for job creation.

In 2008 a government resolution led the Tajikistan
Academy of Sciences to establish the Centre for Research
and Use of Renewable Energy Sources. In implementing
the Comprehensive Target Programme for Widespread
Use of Renewable Energy Sources, research was con-
ducted on all types of renewable energy (from small riv-
ers, sun, wind, biomass and the like). This allowed for
the analysis of the technical and economic potential of
renewable resources in the country, including that of job
creation. There are many completed and ongoing projects
regarding the introduction of renewable energy sources
with implications for people’s lives and work.

A large number of
the Sustainable
Development Goals
targets intend to
reduce work that has
negative implications
for human development

Sustainable Development
Goals revisited — what
they imply for work

Many of the Sustainable Development Goals
and targets (see table 3 in the overview) have
implications for sustainable work.31 The most
direct is goal 8 (promote sustained, inclusive
and sustainable economic growth, full and pro-
ductive employment, and decent work for all)
and its associated targets. For example, target
8.7 seeks to take immediate and effective meas-
ures to eradicate forced labour, end modern
slavery and human trafficking, and secure the
prohibition and elimination of the worst forms
of child labour, including recruitment and use
of child soldiers, and by 2025 end child labour
in all its forms.

Target 8.9 — to devise and implement poli-
cies to promote sustainable tourism that creates
jobs and promotes local culture and products
by 2030 — advocates for a particular kind of
(sustainable) work. Target 8.8 — to protect la-
bour rights and promote safe and secure work-
ing environments for all workers, including
migrant workers, in particular female migrants,
and those in precarious employment — aims to
strengthen the human development outcomes
of workers, avoiding a race to the bottom.

Target 3.a — to strengthen the implemen-
tation of the World Health Organization
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control32
in all countries as appropriate — seeks to re-
duce work associated with tobacco production
and distribution while improving the health
of workers. Target 9.4 — to upgrade, by 2030,
infrastructure and retrofit industries to make
them sustainable, with increased resource-use
efficiency and greater adoption of clean and
environmentally sound technologies and
industrial processes, with all countries taking
action in accordance with their respective
capabilities — implies a specific direction to-
wards upgrading skills and possibly towards
new areas of work.

One cross-cutting aspect is voluntary work.
Another is big data. Even as the wide availabili-
ty of new digital technologies and communica-
tion platforms shape a new world of work, they
also generate a massive pool of data to measure
and assess various aspects of work, in turn im-
proving analysis, policymaking and impact.

Supporting these efforts is a broader coali-
tion. As mentioned in chapter 1, the United
Nations has called for a data revolution33 as an
essential part of the post-2015 development
agenda and the Sustainable Development
Goals, with big data expected to be important
(box 5.4).

Big data can indeed complement and en-
hance more conventional methods of data
collection. It can be both timely and more
frequent, and it offers the capacity to measure
at a range of levels of aggregation from the
individual to the global. Yet there are limits on
reach and possibly in the robustness of the re-
lationships inferred between online behaviour
and broader socioeconomic indicators.

Some of these concerns can be addressed
through further studies to establish the broader
external validity of results. But baseline maps
and other representations of the collected data
must be constructed regularly to provide points
of reference for policy action. Processes have to
be in place for using the data systematically.

Terminating, transforming and
creating work through the
Sustainable Development Goals

A large number of the Sustainable Development
Goal targets intend to reduce work that has
negative implications for human development.
Achieving target 8.7 would improve the lives of
168 million child labourers, about 36 million
people in modern slavery34 and 21 million
people in forced labour.35 Target 5.2 would
assist 4.4 million sexually exploited women and
girls,36 while target 3.a would affect an estimated
100 million workers in tobacco — mostly in
Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, the United States
and Zimbabwe.37 In these cases active policies
and programmes will need to support the indi-
viduals formerly engaged in these areas of work.
Other goals and targets involve the trans-
formation of current modes of work and the
introduction of new approaches. Goal 2 — end
hunger, achieve food security and improved
nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
— has the potential to transform how the very
large number of people engaged in agriculture
carry out their activities.

wards environmental sustainability (Target 9.4)

Big data: some applications for work and the Sustainable Development Goals

Online content — listening to individuals
The text of Google searches has been used in the United
States to predict the number of people applying for un-
employment benefits for the first time in a given week.1
This sensitive indicator of the number of people laid off
in a given week is important to policymakers, markets
and others. Traditional methods use information col-
lected administratively and are therefore available only
with a delay.

However, when unemployment is anticipated by in-
dividuals, it is expected that search queries using terms
such as “jobs,” “unemployment office” and “apply for
unemployment” would increase. Using the aggregate
numbers of these searches in real time2 improves the
accuracy of predicting how fast layoffs are taking place
by around 16 percent. Germany and Israel have seen
similar improvements in forecasting accuracy.3

In yet another application, researchers in Ireland
“listened online” to “conversations” in blogs, forums,
websites and user posts on social media over June
2009–June 2011 to depict a qualitative picture that
could complement official employment statistics4 during
the global economic crisis. Some 28,000 online docu-
ments were retrieved, each assigned a mood based on
its content — anxiety, confidence, hostility, uncertainty,
energy or happiness. Several leading and lagging rela-
tionships were found in the data. For example, anxiety
peaked about five months before a spike in unemploy-
ment. Chatter about moving to worse housing situations
increased about eight months after unemployment in-
creased.5 Such studies indicate the potential of using
indicators mined from online information to improve
predictions of large disruptions at work — and to refine
social protection policies.

Mapping — using the data exhaust
Datasets generated by mobile phone use produce maps
of human population while preserving the anonymity of
users. These maps outperform other population map-
ping methods, are often more accurate, can map remote
areas and can be produced and updated frequently and
inexpensively.6 They could also track changes in popu-
lation movements in real time that indicate changes in
livelihoods or coping patterns.7 In Senegal it has been
possible to map seasonal migration activity in 13 liveli-
hood zones.8

Another mapping exercise used the individual digi-
tal fingerprints left by Twitter users in Spain to study
work-related behaviors and indicators at the subna-
tional level. Almost 20 million geolocated tweets from
November 2012 to June 2013 revealed that in commu-
nities where a greater proportion of people worked, a
larger share of daily tweets was sent in the morning
hours (8–11 a.m.) on work days.9 But the ratio of to-
tal Twitter users to the total population tended to be
lower.10

Monitoring — deliberate and active collection
A different kind of impact on work can be expected
when devices and sensors are used to monitor and re-
port on indicators in real time. Since 2008, Beijing resi-
dents have been monitoring local air quality through
home-based sensors, and they have shared and aggre-
gated the information to pressure the municipality to
take action.11 Citizens are, in a sense, collecting new
real-time data. Indeed, as citizen monitoring of this
kind becomes more widespread, the collected data can
be expected to accelerate the move towards sustain-
able work.

will involve infrastructure and construction.
In many developed and emerging economies,
retrofitting for energy efficiency can have a
substantial effect — in Germany it mobilized an
estimated €100 billion over 2006–2013, sup-
porting 300,000 jobs in the building industry.38
And energy projects (goal 7) can drive long-
and short-term jobs, directly and indirectly,
when they enable other industries to grow and

flourish. In 2014 renewable energy (excluding
large hydro) employed an estimated 7.7 million
directly and indirectly.39 Large hydro was esti-
mated to employ roughly 1.5 million direct jobs
in the sector.40 In renewable energy solar photo-
voltaic is the largest employer worldwide with
2.5 million jobs. These data are largely consistent
with the estimates of the employment potential
of renewable energy in 10 countries (map 5.2).

Women are
traditionally
underrepresented
in science and
technology in
many countries

In another example a global comprehensive
plan for clean energy includes an option for a
global climate stabilization programme with an
annual investment of 1.5 percent of GDP for 20
years (two-thirds clean renewable energy, one-
third energy efficiency).41 This huge investment
effort generates correspondingly large savings
in the costs of adapting to climate change and
could reduce carbon dioxide emissions 40 per-
cent. The plan also appears good for economic
development and job creation (table 5.4). The
six countries in table 5.4 would gain 13.5 mil-
lion net jobs, with the 13.5 million jobs lost
in the fossil fuel sector more than offset by

TABLE 5.4

Jobs generated from clean energy

27 million jobs created in clean energy. These
numbers are conditional on a good transition
plan and the capacity of countries to increase
investment in new energies.

In moving to sustainable work, policymakers
need to be aware of existing patterns of dis-
advantage and deprivation and target efforts
accordingly. Women are traditionally under-
represented in science and technology in many
countries and can thus be trapped in a cycle
of skills that do not match market demands,
which can lead to poorer outcomes for them.
Deliberate targeting for solar photovoltaic
technicians or for providing ecotourism facil-
ities, while removing some traditional barriers
such as access to finance, would help. Those
already working at the lower end of green
industries — for example, women are believed
to constitute a large proportion of the estimat-
ed 15–20 million informal waste pickers in
developing countries42 — may need additional
support to fully realize the human develop-
ment potential of their work.

Building skills and capabilities through
the Sustainable Development Goals

By strengthening health and education out-
comes, especially for children, the Sustainable
Development Goals can set the basis for people
acquiring the skills to move to occupations that
involve sustainable work. Target 4.1 — to ensure
all girls and boys complete free, equitable and

Sustainable work is
critical not only for
sustaining the planet,
but also for ensuring
work that enables
human development

by 2030 — will be pivotal in this respect, but
success requires more and better teachers.

While alternative delivery models for ed-
ucation may somewhat modify this estimate
(table 5.5), the 8.4 million additional trained
teachers — 3.3 million in primary education
and 5.1 million in lower secondary education
— needed through 203043 is a lower bound for
the additional workers needed, as the number
of managers, administrators, preschool teachers
and trainers of teachers would grow as well.

Strengthening health outcomes will similarly
require more trained health workers. The cur-
rent stock of physicians, nurses and midwifes
was around 34 million in 2012, only 3.6 per-
cent of whom are in Sub- Saharan Africa, which
has 12 percent of the world population.44

Estimates of the numbers of additional
workers needed can vary. A conservative needs-
based estimate (using a ratio of 3.45 health
professionals per 1,000 people) indicates an
increase of 10.1 million health professionals
by 2030 (37 percent in Sub- Saharan Africa;
table 5.6). However, the actual demand —
estimated in a model incorporating income per
capita growth and ageing as the main drivers
— indicates that the required expansion could
be up to 45 million health professionals at the

global level. This latter model is arguably more
realistic in estimating future demand based on
past trends; however, it indicates that, not-
withstanding the rapid population growth in
Sub- Saharan Africa, the rate of formation of
health professionals in the region would not
be large enough to even meet the conservative
requirement of 3.45 per 1,000. Clearly busi-
ness-as-usual will not produce the required
number of health professionals where they are
most needed.

Recent experience shows that it can be done,
but care is needed to ensure and maintain qual-
ity. Take Ghana: After it adopted a National
Health Insurance Scheme in 2003 to move
the country towards universal healthcare, the
government doubled the number of trained
nurses by 2009, using the human resource allo-
cation quota system and establishing regional
nurse training schools. Malawi, too, has set
goals to fill more positions in healthcare. In
response to a 65 percent vacancy rate, nursing
education institutions increased the annual
intake of student nurses and midwives 22 per-
cent between 2004 and 2010,45 which con-
tributed to successes in health outcomes and
progress towards the associated Millennium
Development Goals.

Conclusions

Sustainable work is critical not only for sustain-
ing the planet, but also for ensuring work that
continues to advance human development for fu-
ture generations. Combining the two, sustainable

work protects choices for the future while re-
taining them for the present. Enhancing human
development through work — both for present
as well as future generations — will require well
thought out and well formulated policy options,
and that is the theme of the concluding chapter.

Enhancing human development
through work

The preceding chapters have analysed various aspects of the work–human development nexus — how work enhances and
damages human development, how unpaid care work and paid work need to be made more equitable and how work needs
to be sustainable in the changing world of work. As a response to these challenges, this chapter is oriented towards actions:
providing policy options and making policy recommendations as to how human development can be enhanced through work.

The challenges in
work—joblessness or
poor-quality work—
face many societies

The chapter groups policy options into
three broad dimensions — strategies for
creating work opportunities, strategies for
ensuring workers’ well-being and strategies
for targeted action — each with a cluster of
policy actions (see infographic at the begin-
ning of the chapter). Beyond the policies,
it also presents an overarching agenda for
action based on three pillars — developing
a New Social Contract, pursuing a Global
Deal and implementing the Decent Work
Agenda.

Strategies for creating
work opportunities

Work for human development is about more
than just jobs. It is also about expanding peo-
ple’s choices and making sure that opportuni-
ties are available. This includes ensuring that
adequate and quality paid work opportunities
are available and accessible for those who
need and want paid work. In a world with
high youth unemployment, financial volatili-
ty and large numbers of working poor, quality
job creation becomes critical. For women,
economic empowerment through paid work
requires jobs to be available. This section fo-
cuses on policies to expand people’s paid work
choices.

Strategies for creating paid work opportu-
nities have a two-pronged cluster of actions:
formulating national employment strategies
to address the challenges in the availability of
quality paid work and enabling people and
countries to seize opportunities in the chang-
ing world of work. The idea is to address this
issue both from the demand as well as the
supply side.

Formulating national employment
strategies to address the
challenges in work

The challenges in work — joblessness or
poor-quality work — face many societies. Given
the enormity of the problem, as discussed in
earlier chapters, it is clear that a piecemeal
approach to promoting work in its various di-
mensions is unlikely to bear fruit. More com-
prehensive national employment strategies are
required, with a basic focus on creating more
and better quality work for women and men.
Such an approach, which places the needs of
people at the core of economic policy, could
be the centrepiece of a country’s national
development strategy (box 6.1). Some policy
choices are as follows.

Setting an employment target

Employment targeting — re-orienting national
monetary and fiscal policies towards gener-
ating employment — merits its own focus — a
fact widely recognized by the international
community.1 That is why the proposed
Sustainable Development Goals have a goal on
productive employment and decent work for
all. Interventions include:
• Adding employment targeting to the na-
tional policy matrix. More than a dozen
countries have employment targets of some
form (for example, creating 80,000 jobs
over 2010–2014 in Honduras and reduc-
ing unemployment from 7.6 percent to
5–6 percent in Indonesia).2 Such national
commitments to work set the stage for job
creation, prompting work initiatives in the
public and private sectors. For example,
providing credit to small and medium-sized

National employment strategies

About 27 developing countries have adopted a national
employment strategy, mostly since the 2008 global
financial crisis. Another 18 are doing so, and 5 are
revisiting their policies to better respond to new em-
ployment challenges. Some have attempted to directly
integrate growth and employment — for example, the
Growth and Employment Strategy in Cameroon and
the Strategy for Accelerated Growth and Employment
Promotion in Togo. Sri Lanka has integrated human
resources and employment strategies in its National
Human Resources and Employment Strategy, which
began in 2014.

The employment–population ratio increased from
63 percent to 65 percent in Cameroon and from 70 per-
cent to 75 percent in Togo after the countries adopted
an employment strategy. Growth in labour productivity
in Cameroon switched from a negative value to a posi-
tive 1.3 percent after five years. In Sri Lanka annual job
growth is 12 percent.

Since the Arab Spring, Jordan and Tunisia have
pursued comprehensive national employment strate-
gies, broadening their focus from youth-centred active
labour market policies to address many other employ-
ment challenges.

enterprises on favourable terms or directing
commercial banks to have quotas to ensure
adequate numbers of loans to sectors (such
as agriculture) where most poor people
work would help create jobs. Similarly,
employment-friendly monetary policies,
fiscal policies such as tax credits to small and
medium-sized enterprises and subsidies for
enterprises set up in less developed areas may
accelerate job creation.

• Pursuing dual targeting by central banks.
Job creation may require expanding central
banks’ traditional focuses from controlling
inflation to generating employment. Inflation
targeting, even if it does have a modest
impact on reducing inflation and inflation
expectations, does not seem to be associated
with substantial improvements in real eco-
nomic growth.3 In fact, inflation targeting in
developing countries has not been found to
have a positive impact on growth.4 Further,
given the critical challenge of joblessness and
the crucial importance of job creation for
poverty reduction and human development,
central banks may pursue dual targeting of
inflation and employment.5

• Considering specific monetary policy instru-
ments to increase investments that grow jobs.
These include policies that increase financial
support to business activities and investments
in the real economy. For example, credit al-
location mechanisms drawing on asset-based
reserve requirements which make it more
expensive for banks to hold reserves, loan

guarantees that reduce the risk of borrowing
for entrepreneurs, support for pooling and
underwriting small loans, use of the discount
window to release funds from central banks
for work-generating investments and capital
management techniques. A study of several
economies (Chile, Colombia, India, Malaysia
and Singapore) found that these techniques
— when supported by complementary fac-
tors such as sound assets, state capacity and
central bank policy independence — can help
create employment.6 These instruments can
also be made gender sensitive. For example,
asset-based reserve requirements could be de-
signed to generate more work for women, and
central banks could give preferential access to
the discount window for financial institutions
investing in or lending to entities that will
generate more and better work for women.

Formulating an employment-led
development strategy

Employment can no longer be considered a
derivative of economic growth. It has been
viewed as such for too long, in a trickle-down
notion that economic growth automatically
leads to job creation.7 But over the years the
world has seen jobless growth, where economic
growth does not go hand in hand with the cre-
ation of new jobs. It is crucial to ensure that the
complementarity between labour and capital
is retained and strengthened in the process of
development.

Job creation may
require expanding
central banks’
traditional focuses from
controlling inflation to
generating employment

152 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

Informal workers
are among the
most vulnerable
and insecure

Some interventions in the context of

employment- led development would entail:
• Removing barriers critical to employment-
led development. For example, small and
medium- sized enterprises often face biases
in market entry and access to credit, and
entrepreneurs may lack access to information
and marketing skills. Women in particular
face barriers in access to capital, technology
and credit. Removing these barriers requires
multiple levels of support to improve the
productivity and income of these enterpris-
es from all types of regulatory regimes and
public and private institutions. In addressing
credit, finance, training and skill develop-
ment, some countries have, for example,
formulated self-employment programmes as
a critical part of their national employment
plans (box 6.2).

• Strengthening links between small and
medium- sized enterprises (typically labour
intensive) and large (typically international)
capital- intensive firms. Such relationships can
help change patterns of growth by shifting
resources to sectors with greater value added
and job creation potential. This can be accom-
plished, for example, through industrial clus-
ters supported by public investment. These
networks can increase access to capital and
technology and promote the transfer of skills.
• Upgrading workers’ skills over the lifecycle.
Success here could lead to a virtuous circle of
employment–growth–employment, helping

BOX 6.2

generate growth and more productive and
better quality jobs while instilling individuals
with more advanced work capabilities.

• Focusing on sectors where the poor live and
work. In particular, a focus on poor people
in rural areas who work in agriculture is
important. Policy measures to protect and
generate jobs in agriculture should aim to
improve productivity without displacing
jobs through intensive cultivation, changed
cropping patterns, integrated input packages,
better marketing and the like.

• Designing and implementing a conducive
legal and regulatory framework to tackle
informal work. Informal workers are among
the most vulnerable and insecure. Regulatory
frameworks for their work are critical from
the perspective of incentives for enhancing
productivity and value added and protection
to reduce insecurity. Such frameworks could
support innovation in the informal sector
through low-cost technology adaptation,
could be sensitive to the gender dimensions
of informal work, could support informal
workers in making their voices heard and
give them recognition as citizens and entre-
preneurs (box 6.3).

• Adjusting the distribution of capital and labour
in public spending to create jobs. Public spend-
ing can support job creation through the
types of technology used and the sectors in
which spending takes place, with an eye to en-
hancing human development — for example,

Self-employment programme of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia

A self-employment programme was an important ele-
ment of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s
first national employment plan, launched in 2007. By
2015, 6,700 people had found secure and sustainable
employment under the programme by creating their
own companies or formalizing existing businesses. Self-
employment opportunities in the country cover a broad
spectrum, including dentistry studios, nursery gardens,
hairdressing, eco-tourism, fashion design and the like.

Over the past eight years the state has invested
more than $33 million in the programme. Some 70 per-
cent of entrepreneurs who received training and equip-
ment through the programme over the past five years

have remained in business — well above the roughly
50 percent global success rate for new companies. In
2014 the programme was responsible for nearly 13 per-
cent of all new private sector jobs and 14 percent of all
new businesses created.

Women started 35 percent of the newly established
businesses, and young entrepreneurs, 30 percent. The
programme is a major achievement and an important
milestone in promoting entrepreneurship and enabling
young people and women to take action and improve
their livelihoods. The programme has also specifically
reached out to help single mothers and victims of do-
mestic violence.

Labour standard to tackle informal economy — a new milestone

Millions of workers are engaged in the informal econo-
my, which is marked by low productivity, denial of work-
ers’ rights, a lack of adequate opportunities for quality
work, insufficient social protection and an absence of
social dialogue. These characteristics are also obsta-
cles to developing sustainable enterprises. Consensus
has been growing among governments, workers and
employers that the sector needs incentives as well as
protection of workers.

The

International Labour Organization recently
adopted new international labour standards — the first

ever standards aimed specifically at tackling the infor-
mal economy — which are expected to help hundreds of
millions of workers and economic units. The standards
can be vital in protecting workers’ fundamental rights,
ensuring opportunities for income security, livelihoods
and entrepreneurship; and promoting the creation, pres-
ervation and sustainability of enterprises and decent
jobs in the informal economy. A huge step forward for
millions of workers, there is now an international frame-
work of guidance to help countries address the issues of
the informal economy.

through spending in health, education and
other social services. When this approach
is taken, the public sector can also have a
demonstration effect, guiding and signalling
to the rest of the economy the availability and
ways of using more labour- intensive versus
capital-intensive technologies.

Moving to financial inclusion

An inclusive financial system is essential for
structural transformation and the creation of
work. More than 2.5 billion people around
the world, roughly half the world’s adults, are
unbanked.8 Women are disproportionately
affected by a lack of access to finance. About
three-quarters of people living on less than $2 a
day do not have a bank account.9 Yet the poorer
a household is, the greater its need for protec-
tion against vulnerability, especially when out
of work.

In developing countries lack of access to
finance is a major hindrance to the operation
and growth of enterprises. Access to finance
was among the top five problems for 77 percent
of businesses surveyed in a sample of develop-
ing countries.10 In Sub- Saharan Africa, South
Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean
more than 30 percent of surveyed firms cited
access to finance as a major constraint.11 Policy
options to expand access to finance, which can
ultimately increase work opportunities, might
encompass:
• Extending banking services to the disadvan-
taged and to marginalized groups including

women. After pro-banking measures were
adopted in Ecuador, the share of the popu-
lation with a bank account increased from
29 percent in 2005 to 83 percent in 2011.12
• Steering credit towards unserved, remote areas
and targeted sectors. In Argentina, Brazil, the
Republic of Korea and Malaysia investment
banks have played a central role in directing
credit to targeted sectors.13

• Lowering interest rates and providing credit
guarantees and subsidized credit to small and
medium-sized enterprises and export-oriented
sectors. These measures can help promote
productivity and employment growth and
can bear fruit quickly. In Rwanda a credit
guarantee scheme enabled the country to
become a major exporter of specialty coffee.14
• Harnessing modern technology to promote fi-
nancial inclusion. M-Pesa in Kenya is a prime
example of how mobile phone technology
can be deployed to reach the unbanked (box
6.4).

Building a supportive macroeconomic
framework

Maintaining macrofinancial stability is a pre-
condition for a successful employment strate-
gy. However, macroeconomic policies should
go beyond ensuring economic stabilization,
which is an important but not sufficient con-
dition to creating work, and ensure that the en-
vironment is also conducive to generating jobs.
Policies in this area need to address exchange
rate management, capital account measures

BOX 6.4

M-Pesa — an innovative approach to financial
inclusion

M-Pesa is a small-value money transfer system that
was launched in Kenya in 2007. Its reach is exten-
sive, offering a large segment of the population ba-
sic financial services. In 2012 the number of active
users reached 15 million, or more than 60 percent
of the country’s adults and roughly 30 percent of
the country’s population. In 2014 there were 81,000
M-Pesa agent outlets in the country, up from 15,000
in 2013.

M-Pesa is used not only for standard money trans-
fers and airtime purchases, but also to pay salaries,
utility and other bills and to buy goods and services
from both online and physical merchants. The transfer
system is used by the government, businesses and
nongovernmental organizations alike. The key drivers
centre on a very supportive regulatory regime, innova-
tive business models and technological advances in
mobile phones. The approach is being replicated in
other countries, as with bKash in Bangladesh.

and government fiscal space. Some options
include:
• Keeping the real exchange rate stable and com-
petitive. Financial volatility can make work
environments and jobs less secure and reduce
investments in the real economy. A stable
exchange rate is an economic fundamental
that can stimulate growth and employment.
There seems to be a consensus that curren-
cy appreciation has a negative impact on
employment by deteriorating international
competitiveness.15

• Assuring prudent capital account manage-
ment. This is important if the exchange
rate policy is to promote job creation, as in
Chile.16 Transparent and widely agreed rules
for capital controls should be pursued to re-
duce the volatility of capital flows in and out
of national economies and thus the volatility
of investments in productive work activities.
• Restructuring budgets to allocate resources to
job-creating sectors, to enhance human ca-
pabilities and to develop infrastructure. This
would entail reviewing existing expenditure
patterns and reallocating resources towards
employment generation (jobs for teachers
and nurses in the social sectors, public works

programmes, operation and maintenance of
physical infrastructure and the like).

• Building fiscal space through comprehensive
tax administration and efficiency in resource
use. Public spending can create jobs, but
fiscal space for public spending requires a
well structured, transparent and efficient
plan and system for taxation and spending.
Establishing sound fiscal measures during
booms and normal periods of growth and
drawing on a dedicated stabilization fund
during recessions are also good options for
supporting public investments. Overcoming
leakages of resources would also enhance the
use efficiency, equivalent to mobilizing new
resources.

• Promoting an enabling business environment.
Given that the private sector is often the
main driver for job creation, an enabling
business environment can be put in place by
removing binding constraints in access to
finance, infrastructure and regulation. Other
elements include providing business incen-
tives through tax relief. Business activities
that create quality work can be encouraged.
For example, by subsidizing inputs for busi-
nesses that set up in less developed areas, that
provide job opportunities to disadvantaged
groups and that use labour-intensive tech-
nologies. Direct transfers to employers in the
form of wage subsidies or reductions in their
taxes may also encourage them to hire more
workers or to maintain existing jobs.

• Ensuring high-quality infrastructure, includ-
ing roads, electricity and telecommunications.
Mobile phones for poor female entrepreneurs
have revolutionized their work and created
more jobs. Expanding telecommunications
and Internet infrastructures, as well as trans-
portation arteries and access to clean energy,
can immensely improve work options for
people in rural areas and expand business
activities and investment.

• Adopting a regulatory framework that en-
courages competition, enhances efficiency and
ensures transparency and accountability for
business. Cutting red tape, battling corrup-
tion, outlawing political use of licences and
permits and accelerating decisionmaking in
the public sector all help develop businesses
and attract domestic and external investment,
frequently boosting the number of jobs.

Sweatshop conditions

Seizing opportunities in the
changing world of work

There is an urgent need for policy attention to
help people thrive in today’s work environment.
From a human development perspective this
requires finding ways to harness new technolo-
gies in order to expand the choices people have
in their work and lives. The changing world of
work can contribute to human development by
creating new and better work and by improving
people’s lot — all the more so if they are equipped
with the skills, knowledge and competencies to
capitalize on emerging opportunities. To be so
equipped, it will take far more than business as
usual or small, incoherent policy steps.

Heading off a race to the bottom

Given the potential (and realized) benefits of
global production, a race to the bottom — ever
lower wages and worsening working conditions
— is not the only possible outcome. This scenar-
io is due mainly to a misplaced emphasis on a
static and narrow interpretation of competi-
tiveness measured by financial costs per unit of
production — a focus that might help compa-
nies’ bottom lines today but is unsustainable in
the long run. Ensuring decent wages, maintain-
ing workers’ safety and protecting their rights
are universal issues that, if tackled, can pre-empt
such a race. Some policy options include:
• Focusing on the conditions in which goods are
produced (beyond the economic aspects of costs
and competitiveness). Working conditions

BOX 6.5

are critical (box 6.5). And when labour is
scarce, businesses that offer better work con-
ditions will attract the most skilled labour.
Consumers are also becoming increasingly
aware of and sensitive to variations in work
conditions, and buying intermediaries
are facing growing pressures for ethical
considerations to become more central, as
illustrated by the global outcries caused by
multiple accidents in the readymade garment
industry in Bangladesh. With this pressure,
major retailers that source their imports from
Bangladeshi factories have initiated remedial
plans to improve work conditions and are
providing (some) financial support to work-
ers.17 Although these initiatives have limita-
tions, they indicate that sweatshop conditions
are not acceptable in global value chains.

• Ensuring fair trade can help forestall the race
to the bottom, as it is a critical consideration in
many consumers’ minds. With consumers ask-
ing more questions about the products they
buy, the single-minded pursuit of cost effi-
ciency is likely to be short sighted and a poor
business strategy. Cambodia’s experience
illustrates the ability of a country to maintain
its export market without compromising the
fairness of its wages and the quality of its
work conditions (box 6.6).

Providing workers with new skills and
education

The requirements of advanced skills and educa-
tion will be pronounced in the future. Higher

Remaining competitive by improving working conditions

Some countries in global value chains that previously
relied on low-wage employment now face labour short-
ages, giving workers more bargaining power. China has
enacted several laws that hold promise for individual
worker rights, enhanced employment security, reduced
informal employment and broader access to social in-
surance. These include the Labour Contract Law (2008),
the Labour Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Law
(2008), the Employment Promotion Law (2008) and the

Social Insurance Law (2011).1 Some have argued that
the passage of these laws would place China’s labour
regulations third among Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development members by strictness.2
In 2013 Viet Nam also passed a new labour code that
could enhance work conditions by regulating working
time, extending maternity leave and providing more
space for collective bargaining and a reformed wage
system.3

BOX 6.6

Cambodia — a success story in the globalized
world of work

On entering readymade garment production for export
in the 1990s, Cambodia was keen to earn a reputation
for maintaining good labour standards, which offered
advantages. In 1999 the government signed an agree-
ment with the United States to adhere to the rights of
workers in return for which the United States agreed
to increase its annual import quota.

Not only did Cambodia benefit directly, but it also
sustained that success after the quota system ended.
In short, low wages and compromises over working
conditions are not essential for maintaining competi-
tiveness in export markets.

and more specific skills will be needed for science
and engineering jobs. Technology increasingly
requires more than basic code skills and demands
aptitudes in creativity, innovation and problem
solving. Manufacturing activities are more skill
intensive as routine activities are automated, and
agriculture increasingly requires education and
training to further boost productivity. Education,
flexibility, adaptability and work-related skills are
vital for workers to secure their livelihoods. This
is the point emphasized in a special contribu-
tion by His Excellency Benigno S. Aquino III,
President of the Philippines (signed box).

The shift from industrial to informa-
tion-based knowledge economies is changing
how we live, think, work and learn, pointing to
four broad categories of skills that may be re-
quired:18 ways of thinking, which include cre-
ativity, innovation, critical thinking, problem
solving, decisionmaking and learning; ways of
working, which refer to communication, col-
laboration and teamwork; tools for working,
most of which are based on new information
and communications technologies and infor-
mation age literacy, including capabilities to
learn and work through digital social networks;
and ways of living in the world, such as a sense
of global and local citizenship, a view towards
life and career development, and a commit-
ment to personal and social responsibility.

Concrete policy measures could focus on:
• Designing and implementing a fit-for-future
learning system. High-quality education

with a curriculum that teaches students how
to learn is an essential aspect of schooling,
and so a learning paradigm shift may be in
order — one that goes beyond the goal of
universal access to schooling towards “access
plus learning” with a focus on improving
learning outcomes rather than just access.19
Learning in a slew of foundational domains
could be prioritized in early childhood,
primary and lower secondary education,
with space for specific skills development in
subsequent years. Emphasis should also be
on educating students in mathematics and
the natural sciences, on teaching them to
write and communicate persuasively and on
giving them opportunities to develop skills in
team cooperation and leadership. Education
systems need to foster talent at all levels.

• Increasing access to tertiary education. In any
society the system of higher education needs
to reach more students, including those from
poorer backgrounds. Therefore, classroom
instruction cannot be divorced from the de-
mands of the labour market. Some students
will benefit from targeted training in indus-
try-specific skills. In developed countries
tertiary education attainment has increased
10 percent since 2000.20 However, given the
necessity for advanced skills, even higher
rates of attainment will be required to meet
future demand.

There are also concerns about a mismatch
between the types of tertiary degrees that are
in demand — science, technology, engineer-
ing and mathematics, in particular — and the
number of people graduating with degrees in
these fields. In the United States only 11 per-
cent of college graduates were in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics
disciplines in 2008, compared with 42 per-
cent in China, 35 percent in the Republic of
Korea and 28 percent in Germany.21 Women
are substantially underrepresented in these
fields, which could perpetuate wage gaps
between men and women.

• Upgrading or reorienting skills. This may
help displaced workers — whose livelihoods
are threatened by the changing world of
work — with training. Such workers can tran-
sition to new jobs at similar or higher wages
after training and with wage subsidies and
temporary income support (among other

SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION

Building skills and protecting workers for inclusive growth

We believe: only inclusive growth can unlock the vast potential of the
Filipino people. This principle has been at the core of our strategy, which is
why we have made massive investments in our people. As a matter of fact,
funding for social services currently takes up the lion’s share of the budget,
at 36.6 percent. In this way, we capacitate Filipinos to take part in growth:
to ensure that their development and work are part of a virtuous cycle that
yields not only individual, but also national success.

This virtuous cycle we speak of is largely dependent on ensuring that
our people have the necessary knowledge and skills to achieve their goals.
For the long-term, we have undertaken basic education reform: Filipino
students will now spend 12 years of basic education in school, allowing
sufficient time for the mastery of a curriculum that is at par with interna-
tional standards. Our flagship poverty reduction program, the Conditional
Cash Transfer Program, also contributes to this goal: For families to receive
cash assistance, the primary requirement is to ensure that children attend
school. Other investments have also been made, most prominently through
our Technical Education and Skills Development Authority, which throughout
our term has equipped 7.8 million graduates from various courses with skills
relevant to different industries.

Throughout all this, we remain cognizant of the need to monitor and re-
spond to trends in employment relevant to our communities. For example, our
Commission on Higher Education has been working continuously to eliminate
substandard and noncompliant programs, all while developing programs in
high-demand and emerging fields. Further proof can be found in the way that
we have addressed challenges — for instance, in helping out-of-school youth
access economic opportunities. The Conditional Cash Transfer Program men-
tioned previously has already done much in this regard. Research conducted
by the Philippine Institute for Development Studies shows that there has
been a decrease in the number of out-of-school youth: from 2.9 million chil-
dren in 2008 to 1.2 million in 2013. That is a staggering 1.7 million decrease.
The Department of Education’s Abot-Alam Program, which translates
to Knowledge Within Reach, aims to reduce this number even further.
Launched in September 2014, this is the first initiative to map out-of-school

youth nationwide and match them with appropriate interventions in edu-
cation, skills training or entrepreneurship. Our Department of Labor and
Employment also helps at-risk youth to be job-ready in terms of acquiring the
required skill sets by employers — that is, life skills, technical and company
internship — through our JobStart Program.

The targeted manner in which we have addressed challenges and creat-
ed opportunities for our youth can likewise be observed in other areas — for
instance, in the informal sector. Domestic workers make up a significant part
of the informal labour force, whether in the Philippines or elsewhere in the
world. The nature of their employment makes it difficult to regulate; even
so, my country has demonstrated extraordinary leadership in this regard.

In 2012 the Philippines became the second country to ratify International
Labour Organization Convention No. 189 on Decent Work for Domestic
Workers — the first international instrument recognizing domestic workers
as having human and employment rights entitled to protection under the
law. Our country has also signed bilateral agreements with the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon for the protection of overseas Filipino
domestic workers.

Here within our own shores, RA 10361, or An Act Instituting Policies for
the Protection and Welfare of Domestic Workers — more commonly known
as the Kasambahay Law — was finally enacted into law under my admin-
istration. Under this law our 1.9 million domestic workers are recognized
as members of the formal sector, with all the appropriate rights, benefits,
training and competency assessments.

These may be just a sampling of the measures we have implemented,
but whether in education, youth employment or domestic work the mes-
sage is clear: inclusivity. We are centred on our people: They are the end-all
and be-all of everything we do. Thus, we will exert every effort to em-
power them, give them the same rights and protections and maximize their
opportunities — regardless of social status, welfare and yes, even the nature
of work. In this way each and every one of our people can see their work as
meaningful, dignified and productive, as a means for their own development
and success.

services). One particular example is the Trade
Adjustment Assistance Programme under
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Differences in the programmes available,
variations in state and local implementation

and the heterogeneity of participants in skills
and experience produced mixed results in
post-training skill gains, reemployment and
wage increases, but having such a programme
in place can help with job transitions.22

158 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

Lifelong learning and training are essential
for upgrading skills and training for new
types of work, and much learning takes place
outside formal education. Workers, includ-
ing those performing low-skilled tasks, must
be prepared to learn and retrain throughout
their working life.

• Using adult education programmes for contin-
ued learning. Northern European countries
are particularly successful at lifelong learning,
with over 60 percent of the adult population
participating in adult education in Denmark,
Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and
Sweden.23 Apprenticeships and industry-tar-
geted training programmes as well as on-the-
job training programmes help prepare young
people for work and enable career shifts later
in life. Both employers and governments may
organize such programmes.

Policies that encourage training by em-
ployers, such as tax credits or preferential
access to government contracts, are also
needed. Women and girls require special
attention, since they are often excluded from
training opportunities for social or cultural
reasons. In the informal sector women need
equal access to information to anticipate the
demands of markets and to understand how
to be strategic in deciding what goods to pro-
duce. They also need access to global markets,
whether through technology or other means.
On-the-ground learning is important, but
training can be scaled up, taking advantage of
communications technology, online learning
platforms and global collaborations. For
example, WeConnect International provides
online learning to a global network of wom-
en-owned businesses in Chinese, English and
Spanish, teaching entrepreneurial, business
and leadership skills.24 The nongovernmental
organization Education for Employment de-
signed a programme with McGraw-Hill and
business leaders in Morocco to help fill skill
gaps in Morocco’s workforce, focusing on the
professional skills needed in banking, retail
and manufacturing.25

Innovating so that all income groups
benefit

It has been suggested that neither workers
nor employers will be the real winners in the

economy of the future. Instead, a third party —
people who can create new products, services
and business models — will prosper immensely.
This view highlights the potential challenge of
delivering an acceptable standard of living for
everyone outside this innovator class.26 It also
underscores the critical importance of a thriving,
innovative business sector. If advances in digital
technology can be harnessed to create new and
better businesses, workers will have a better shot
at sharing the growing prosperity. But if entre-
preneurship declines, new technology will not
guarantee overall social welfare gains, which is
one reason the policy environment should be
conducive for start-ups and social enterprises.
Policy considerations (leaving the skill sets for
future generations aside) include:
• Reinventing work organizations. There has
never been a worse time to be competing
with machines, but there has never been a
better time to be a talented entrepreneur. But
are there enough opportunities for all these
entrepreneurs? Are we running out of inno-
vations? When businesses are based on bits
instead of atoms (a common characteristic
in the digital age), each new product adds to
the set of building blocks open to the next
entrepreneur, instead of depleting the stock
of ideas the way minerals or farmlands are
depleted in the physical world.27 Because
innovation often relies heavily on combining
and recombining previous innovations, the
broader and deeper the pool of accessible
ideas and individuals, the more opportunities
there are for innovation, primarily to leverage
ever-advancing technology and human skills.
innovations.
General-purpose technologies, such as steam
power, electricity and the internal combus-
tion engine, not only got better over time,
but also led to complementary innovations in
the processes, companies and industries that
used them. This led to a cascade of benefits
both broad and deep. Many of the instru-
ments of the current technological revolution
(such as computers) are the general-purpose
technologies of our era, already combined
with networks and labelled information and
communications technology. However, they
have to be tied to complementary innova-
tions that can have broad spillover effects on
more of the population.

The critical issue
is how the human
potential embodied
in migration can be
used for the benefit
of all concerned

Using migration

Economic opportunities induce people to
move to other lands to work and have a better
life. Push factors such as droughts and conflicts
also cause people to migrate. Migrant workers
bring new knowledge, skills, creativity, inno-
vation and experience, making migration mu-
tually beneficial for migrants, who gain access
to work, and receiving countries, which gain
access to skills and experience. Furthermore, for
some countries migrant workers add to a labour
force that is declining because of various demo-
graphic transitions. The critical issue is how the
human potential embodied in migration can
be used for the benefit of all concerned. Some
policy options may be:
• Pursuing well formulated schemes for mi-
grant workers. Such schemes may include
expanding programmes for seasonal workers
in such sectors as agriculture and tourism,
creating secure space for more low-skilled
workers and well targeted programmes to
match skilled workers, including profes-
sionals, with jobs. These could all be devel-
oped in the context of agreements reached
in destination countries through political
processes based on public discussions that
balance different interests, local priorities
and demands, and discussions involving
source countries, employers and trade un-
ions. Essential in all of these processes is in-
creasing the security, protection and rights
of migrant workers.

• Undertaking actions in source countries.
Source countries can undertake skill devel-
opment and training initiatives for aspiring
migrant workers, pursuing orientation pro-
grammes to educate migrants on the laws,
rules and culture in destination countries and
their rights and obligations.

• Improving the global management of mi-
gration. The existing Global Forum on
Migration and Development, with more
than 150 participating countries, provides a
good platform for addressing the challenge of
migration through common responses. The
importance of such a platform becomes even
more critical when the world faces a crisis
like the current one in Europe. Using such a
forum as a basis, the global management of
migration can be improved through relevant

reforms that increase the security and op-
portunities for migrants during the process
of migration and while working in receiving
countries.

Strategies for ensuring
workers’ well-being

Work should enhance human development,
but as previous chapters have shown, this link is
not always automatic. The choices individuals
have regarding work are also subject to myriad
influences, and the quality of work varies. The
previous section discussed ways to increase
work opportunities. These policies can be com-
plemented by policies that improve workers’
well-being and expand the choices people have
in the types of work they undertake — paid or
unpaid.

Workers’ well-being encompasses workers’
rights and benefits. On the rights side, workers’
safety, voice and participation are crucial. On
the benefits side, income and social protection
are of prime importance. Workers’ well-being is
linked to the quality of their work as well as the
quality of their lives.

Guaranteeing workers’
rights and benefits

Workers’ rights are also human rights.
Guaranteeing these rights thus has intrinsic as
well as instrumental value. On the one hand
ensuring workers’ rights provides people with
protection and safety, while on the other it
can help ensure that they maintain a fair share
of income, security, creative opportunity,
social interaction and other work-related
benefits.

Guaranteeing the rights and benefits of
workers is at the heart of strengthening the
positive links between work and human de-
velopment and weakening the negative links.
Positive links ensure that workers’ rights and
benefits go beyond good wages and include an
environment where workers are more produc-
tive, safe and empowered. Weakening negative
links is about guaranteeing workers’ rights and
benefits and eliminating exploitation, abuse,
unsafe work environments and the destruction
of dignity.

From the top — setting legislation and
regulation

FIGURE 6.1

Legislation and regulation are critical for the
protection of millions of workers around the
world who are engaged in activities that dam-
age human development or who are involved
in high-risk work, as described in chapter 1.
Policy options can take various forms:
• Having well designed unemployment and wage
policies. Unemployment insurance and mini-
mum wages protect workers and empower
them with economic security. The two need
to be strengthened in many cases. In 2013
just over 30 percent of the world’s labour
force was legally covered by unemployment
benefits (cash periodic), up from 18 percent
in the 1990s.28 And the minimum wage was
58 percent of the average wage in South Asia
and only 18 percent in Sub- Saharan Africa.29
Two policy options in this regard are worth
considering: increasing the minimum wage
and complementing it with tax credits so that
a living income can be provided to the work-
ing poor.30 Such policies need not discourage
investment because, contrary to conventional
belief, the evidence does not confirm that la-
bour regulations are a primary constraint to
job creation.31

• Protecting workers’ rights and ensuring their
safety. There are already guiding agreements
in place to help improve work safety and
security. Namely, the eight fundamental con-
ventions on freedom of association, forced
labour, discrimination, child labour and
domestic workers, which together constitute
the Charter of Workers’ Rights (see figure
9 in the overview and table A6.1 at the end
of the chapter). But they need to be pursued
and enforced by countries, with the following
aims:
• Ratifying and implementing the eight
conventions and reporting on pro-
gress of implementation. More than
170 countries have ratified the Equal
Remuneration Convention of 1951 and
the Discrimination (Employment and
Occupation) Convention of 1958, but
some have not (figure 6.1). By 2014,
65 countries had laws prohibiting dis-
crimination in employment based on
sexual orientation in at least part of their

needed, the global community should
increase efforts for technical and financial
assistance.

• Putting in legal frameworks and strength-
ening legislation to enhance and protect
workers’ rights and to remove all kinds of
abuse (box 6.7). Workers’ rights, security,
safety and working conditions may be part
of such a framework. Globally, the same
general labour law that covers other work-
ers covers only 10 percent of paid domestic
workers (figure 6.3).

Ensuring that people with disabilities can
work

People with disabilities are just differently abled
to do things. Indeed, if proper investments are
made in accessibility and flexibility, people
with disabilities can contribute considerably to
work. The workplace could become an equal-
izing field for people with disabilities if the
approach of employers was to change from one
of charity and assistance to one of investment.33
Some policy options include:
• Providing an environment that is conducive
to the productivity of people with disabilities.

Protecting the rights of sex workers

Protecting the rights of sex workers, ensuring their
health and safety and protecting them against violence
are basic policy priorities. In addition, bringing sex work
into the framework of labour law allows for the same
control and monitoring that other works are subjected
to for forced labour.

In 2003 New Zealand adopted the Prostitution
Reform Act, which has effectively decriminalized sex
work in the country and introduced protections for the

health and safety of sex workers and their clients. The
act ensured sex workers’ access to the legal system,
empowering negotiations with and choices of clients,
and relationships with police and health professionals
have also improved. Evidence from the country suggests
that support of sex workers enables them to organize
and improve their ability to advocate and lobby on be-
half of their community and to improve working condi-
tions and workers’ safety.1

sustaining work are difficult due to negative
perceptions, cultural norms, transport prob-
lems, accessibility to resources and prem-
ises, and the like. Changes in information
flows and infrastructures can enable people
with disabilities to access work and enable
employers to take advantage of a wealth of
human ingenuity.

• Encouraging behavioural shifts in favour
of people with disabilities. Changing social
norms and perceptions to accept that people
with disabilities are differently abled and to
give them a fair chance in work is fundamen-
tal. This will have to be supplemented with

legal frameworks that discourages discrimi-
nation against people with disabilities.

• Enhancing capabilities and opportunities.
These can be done through skill and voca-
tional training for people with disabilities,
increasing access to productive resources
such as finance for self-employment, and by
providing information through appropriate
mobile devices.

• Ensuring accessibility. Appropriate measure-
ment must be taken to improve transporta-
tion to and from work and to improve access
to premises and disability-friendly office
space, workplaces and equipment.

• Adopting appropriate technology. Technology
can enhance the abilities of people with dis-
abilities. Nevertheless, in many low-income
countries only 5–15 percent of the people
who require assistive devices and technolo-
gies have access to them.34

• Pursuing affirmative action. Ensuring that
jobs are available for people with disabilities
will require targeted interventions. In this
regard, affirmative action (for example, the
use of quotas) reserves jobs for people with
disabilities and provides an opportunity for
the rest of society to observe their capabil-
ities and achievements, which may have a
positive impact on changing social norms,
biases and attitudes towards people with
disabilities.

• Using big data, but with caution. Collecting
and mobilizing data to monitor employment
trends of people with disabilities can help
inform policymaking. Big data has the poten-
tial to uncover discrimination in the labour
market and, in doing so, trigger corrective
policies. However, there are some risks. For
example, the use of algorithms that recom-
mend candidates to employers (based on
historical interest or performance indicators,
plus all other information available) might
reproduce existing biases and prejudices on
gender, race and social class (which can be
inferred from social network information),

thereby introducing a liability for belonging
to historically disadvantaged groups.

Making workers’ rights and safety a
cross-border issue

Cross-border action is fundamental in a glo-
balized world where both work and workers
move beyond borders. Measures may include:
• Building a solid regulatory framework, based
on global labour conventions, to facilitate
the transborder movement of workers and
help them reap the benefits of their work.
For example, for migrant workers, such a
framework may streamline the migration
of workers through legal means and ensure
the efficient transfer of remittances, helping
make effective use of these resources. It may
also establish concrete guidelines and rules
for working conditions, such as the work-
ing hours, pay and safety of these migrant
workers, including those in paid domestic
work. Such frameworks are often negotiated
bilaterally, but a multicountry or subregional
approach would establish some agreed-on
guidelines and binding rules. If properly
formulated, such frameworks can be effective
regional or subregional public goods.

Such frameworks can be extended to cover
economic migrants, who are undertaking
all kinds of risks (for example, trying to

Africa to Europe and from South Asia to
South-East Asia. As mobility increases and
people continue to take risks, provisions can
be made (such as prioritizing safety or intro-
ducing national quotas for migrants) in these
frameworks.

• Developing subregional remittance clearing-
houses and remittance banks that have links
with labour-sending countries. Such insti-
tutions can ensure efficient and low-cost
transfers of resources and the security of the
migrant workers’ hard-earned money.

• Offering more support in source countries to
educate migrant domestic workers about their
rights and offering assistance in cases of abuse
and exploitation. In destination countries
governments should implement formal
contracts and labour protection laws for
migrant domestic workers. They should also
ease visa restrictions for family members and
facilitate the integration of migrant children
in national education systems to prevent the
unnecessary separation of families.

From the bottom — promoting collective
action and trade unionism

Collective action has strengthened the links
between work and human development,
including increases in compensation and so-
cial insurance and protection against health
hazards at work. Collective action has been

BOX 6.8

vital to forming shared values and worker soli-
darity, which enhances the agency and voice of
individuals.

Globalization, the technological revolution
and changes in labour markets are creating new
ways of working, and it is clear that in this new
and complex context policy alternatives for
promoting collective action may need to be
considered, such as:
• Reforms for collective action. Governance
reforms that reaffirm labour standards, al-
low workers to bargain collectively and give
all stakeholders — workers, managers and
shareholders — a say in executive pay deci-
sions can enhance worker voice and improve
labour remuneration.

• Emerging forms of collective action. Different
types of work require different types of
workers’ organizations. Informal worker
bodies such as the Self-Employed Women’s
Association of India, transnational worker
organizations such as the International
Trade Union Confederation and bodies to
protect immigrant workers and domestic
workers such as the International Domestic
Workers’ Federation are a few of the existing
institutions (box 6.8). But many workers re-
main without voice and influence, and there
is much space for innovation in collective
organizations that reflect the challenges and
environments of the modern worker.

• Innovative collective action for flexible workers.
Actions and institutions are needed to pro-
tect workers’ rights and interests for those

The Self-Employed Women’s Association — the world’s largest trade union of informal workers

The Self-Employed Women’s Association has nearly
2 million members, all working poor women, from
multiple trades and occupations and from all religious
and caste groups, in 10 states of India. It is also one of
the most influential organizations of informal workers
worldwide, having influenced policies, norms and prac-
tices at all levels.

It stresses self-reliance — individual and collective
— and promotes organization around four sources of
security: work, income, food and social security. It is
primarily a trade union but engages in a wide range
of interventions, including leadership development,

collective bargaining, policy advocacy, financial services
(savings, loans and insurance), social services, housing
and basic infrastructure services, and training and ca-
pacity building.

The association seeks to expand the voice of its
members through representation at different levels
by building their capacity and creating opportunities
for them to participate in local councils; in municipal,
state and national planning bodies; in tripartite boards;
in minimum wage and other advisory boards; in sector-
specific business associations; and in local, state and
national labour federations.

Today, only
27 percent of the
world’s population
is covered by a
comprehensive social
protection system

who work in the “gig economy” — crowd
workers and others. Take, the Freelancers
Union, which has 250,000 independent
contractors. In the United States there are
53 million freelancers, 40 percent of the
country’s workforce. About a tenth of the
freelance population is temporary, working
for one employer on a contract.35 Although
geographically dispersed, crowd workers are
establishing digital versions of mutual and
workplace solidarity.

• Social movements through protest and demon-
strations. One form of worker agency can
be observed through the rising number of
social movements around the world, many
of which are motivated by appeals for jobs,
better labour conditions and higher wages.
Unless employment and the needs of work-
ers become policy priorities, prolonged and
unsustainable periods of social unrest may
become the reality in many countries.

• New information and communications tech-
nology. Technology can be used for mobi-
lizing workers, allowing those with access
to social networks to communicate and
organize with others, wherever they are. This
can mobilize support for workers and raise
public awareness about working conditions,
in particular publicizing individual cases and
monitoring the activities of corporations.
The Clean Clothes Campaign is one example
of coalitions of local nongovernmental or-
ganizations and workers using the Internet.36
• Stronger state action. Tripartite consultations
among governments, employers and workers
have long characterized the regulation of
work, but the balance in recent years has
shifted towards dialogue between workers
and employers with less state intervention.
Given the decline of worker agency and
increased social unrest, a greater state role is
needed in tripartite arrangements.
Promotion of collective action through exist-
ing institutions (such as trade unions) as well
as exploration of alternative institutional mech-
anisms are needed not only to secure workers’
rights, voice and participation, but also for
broader societal goals such as social cohesion,
stability and development. If such mechanisms
are absent or if existing institutions lose their
strength, workers’ well-being may decline, or
political agitations may occur with adverse

effects on societies. A study using panel data
for 100 developed and developing countries for
1985–2002 shows that collective labour rights
(as measured by the collective labour rights
index) are linked to lower income inequality.37
Therefore, in the interest of the broader health
of society, all stakeholders should work towards
strengthening institutions that uphold workers’
well-being.

Extending social protection

Social protection is a more comprehensive con-
cept than social security, social assistance or a
social safety net — it combines all three systems
and is critical for increasing workers’ well-being
and enhancing the choices people have in their
work lives. Today, only 27 percent of the world’s
population is covered by a comprehensive social
protection system. In other words 73 percent,
about 5.2 billion people, do not have access to
comprehensive social protection.38 Most mid-
dle-income and some lower income countries
have expanded their systems in recent years,
although some of these advances are not fully
legislated or do not have secured funding. In
developed countries, despite growing demands
for social protection in recent years, the 2008
financial crisis brought widespread tightening
of social protection in its wake. For example,
older people now get smaller pensions in at
least 14 European countries.39

Moving towards greater social protection

Some policy options to expand social protec-
tion and enhance the links between work and
human development include:
• Pursuing well designed, appropriately targeted
and well implemented social protection pro-
grammes. A basic and modest set of social
security guarantees through social transfers
in cash and in kind can reasonably be pro-
vided for all citizens. The cost of setting
such a floor with universal pension, basic
health care, child benefits and employment
schemes would range from about 4 percent
of GDP in India to 11 percent of GDP in
Burkina Faso.40 Resources can be mobilized
by adopting progressive taxes, restructuring
expenditures, removing subsidies and ex-
tending contributory schemes by capturing

Social protection
measures, when
combined with labour
market policies,
facilitate job creation

more of the working population in the for-
mal sector.

• Combining social protection with appropriate
work strategies. Programmes would provide
work to poor people while serving as a
social safety net. Even though social pro-
tection may present disincentives for paid
work, the consensus seems to be that social
protection measures in themselves do not
necessarily cause unemployment to increase
— and they can, especially when combined
with labour market policies, facilitate job
creation. Creating work, reducing poverty
and protecting people against shocks is an
ideal outcome, as exemplified in the Rural
Employment Opportunities for Public
Assets in Bangladesh (box 6.9). Linking so-
cial protection (particularly unemployment
benefits) to training and job search assistance
also helps unemployed workers reintegrate
into the labour force.

Two types of actions are thus in order:
compensatory measures in social protection
and corrective measures in the labour market.
Improving other labour market conditions
for workers, participation and salary (includ-
ing gaps for disadvantaged groups such as
young and female workers) is vital for shap-
ing future social protection systems.

• Providing a living income. A living income
would provide a basic minimum income
for all (a citizen’s income), independent of
the job market. The idea of a living income

BOX 6.9

becomes more relevant in the current chang-
ing world of work, as automation may put
many workers out of jobs, because of the
changing nature of jobs and because many
jobs may be at risk of disappearing (up to
50 percent of existing jobs may be at risk in
the next 20 years).41 A way forward, and one
that would increase the ability of individuals
to concentrate their time in forms of unpaid
work that can be human development en-
hancing, would be to provide all citizens with
an unconditional tax credit, which could be
built up as the rewards from paid work fall.
Two objections may be raised with regard to
the notion of a living income — societies are
too poor to afford it and it would be a dis-
incentive to work. The first objection is not
true for advanced economies, and the second
one is irrelevant because the objective is not
to enhance the incentive for paid work, but
to enable people to live without paid work.
• Tailoring successful social protection pro-
grammes to local contexts. Programmes for
cash transfers or conditional cash transfers
have provided effective social protection,
particularly in Latin America (for example,
Bolsa Família in Brazil and Oportunidades,
now called Prospera, in Mexico), and many
have been replicated in other parts of the
world (Sub- Saharan Africa). These pro-
grammes provide income support for poor
families and build human capabilities by
increasing funds for schooling and health

Rural Employment Opportunities for Public Assets in Bangladesh

Poverty affects millions of Bangladeshis, mostly in
rural areas and households headed by women. Rural
Employment Opportunities for Public Assets — a project
supporting female-headed households — was launched
in six food-insecure districts, with the support of Union
Parishads, the lowest level of local government.

The project provided two years of employment for
destitute women and employment for casual labourers
during a lean period, offering them a safety net. Women
also undertook training on social and legal issues, gen-
der equality, human rights, primary health care, nutrition
and income generation. Between 2008 and 2012, 25,000
women were employed for two years, and 500,000 work

days for casual workers were created. More than 11,000
women received training.

From 2009 to 2012, 12,000 kilometres of vital rural
eastern roads were repaired by women in crew groups
in maintenance and post-flood repairs. Out of an indi-
vidual daily wage of Taka 100 (around US$1.25), each
woman makes a mandatory saving of Taka 30. During
2010 and 2011 each woman earned Taka 51,100 in cash
and saved Taka 21,900, deposited in a local savings
bank account under the project. In addition each woman
received Taka 5,200 as an end of project bonus, to leave
the project with total savings of Taka 27,100.

care for children. Conditional cash transfers
in different forms have also been useful in
addressing crisis-related labour market risks,
as with Nicaragua’s coffee price crisis.

• Undertaking direct employment guarantee
programmes. Instead of cash transfers or con-
ditional cash transfers, countries have also
pursued employment guarantees. Jefes de
Hogar in Argentina and the regional Karnali
Employment Programme in Nepal are exam-
ples,42 though the best known is the National
Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in
India (box 6.10).

Targeting interventions for older people

Strengthening social protection for older
people — particularly to provide the choice of
retirement or cutting back on paid work — must
be a priority. Policy choices include:
• Expanding noncontributory basic social pen-
sions systems. Between 1990 and 2011 the
number of countries adopting noncontribu-
tory basic and targeted pension systems more
than doubled — from 10 to 21 for basic sys-
tems and from 20 to 46 for targeted ones.43
Noncontributory regimes to minimize
poverty for older people are only a first step:
Programmes have to be well financed and en-
dowed with regulations and institutions that
enable efficient resource management.

• Exploring fully funded contributory pension
systems. This modality — where pensions

BOX 6.10

draw on previous savings — has re-emerged
in recent times. In 2011, 34 developing
countries had such programmes, up from
5 in 1990, following the first programme
launched in Chile in 1981.44 After two dec-
ades challenges emerged in Chile, and the
country introduced a comprehensive reform
based on a new “solidarity pillar” (box 6.11).
A few countries (Argentina and Bolivia) have
also made radical changes in their systems.45
• Financing social pensions for older people.
Such financing can be achieved through
more contributions to pension systems and
substantial improvements in the systems at
reasonable cost, both of which are realistic.
For example, in Latin America a noncon-
tributory system equal to 10 percent of GDP
per capita (eliminating poverty among older
people), plus subsidies to supplement the
contributory pillar, would cost an estimated
1.4–2.5 percent of GDP.46

Addressing inequalities

In the changing world of work, sustained hu-
man progress requires structural challenges,
such as inequalities, to be tackled. As seen in
chapter 3, workers are getting a smaller share
of total income globally, while the proportion
of returns to capital has risen sharply. There
are also substantial inequalities in opportuni-
ties, as highlighted in chapter 1. Work seems
to encompass myriad inequalities that may

National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in India — a milestone

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guaran-
tee Act was mandated in 2005 to implement an ambitious,
demand-driven employment-creation programme to bene-
fit the rural poor through projects that improve agricultural
productivity and alleviate land degradation. It guarantees
rural households 100 days of unskilled manual work.

As the programme began to revamp prior employ-
ment programmes, evaluations have found that job cre-
ation accelerated from less than 1 billion working days
among 20 million households in the act’s first year of
operation, 2006/2007, to 2.5 billion among 50 million
households in 2010/2011. A simulation estimated that
GDP would increase 0.02–0.03 percent, that labour

income would rise about 700 million rupees and that
the welfare of the poorest households (as measured
by Slutski-adjusted consumption relative to initial con-
sumption) would increase up to 8 percent. People be-
longing to Scheduled Tribes or Scheduled Castes would
also benefit.

Yet in evaluations, the programme’s impacts are
found to be asymmetrical between urban and rural
dwellers, men and women, better-off and privileged
population groups and more educated versus less edu-
cated groups. Its size has no precedent nationally or in-
ternationally, posing important design and management
challenges.

Chile’s reforms to the reform: more solidarity, more contributions

In 1981 Chile pioneered fully funded contributory pen-
sion systems. But after two decades some problems
became evident from the beneficiary side — too few
contributors, a low level and density of contributions
and wide gender imbalances. In response, the govern-
ment adopted a comprehensive reform in 2008.

Some of the main points of the new architec-
ture were a universal basic pension for those without
substantial contributions (in time) and without large
enough accumulation of resources at age 65 (extended
to people with disabilities); a social security solidar-
ity contribution that complements pension savings
for those contributing to the system (for older people
and people with disabilities); mandatory contributions
from self-employed workers (to be completed by 2018),

enforced through the tax system; stronger mechanisms
for complementary voluntary savings; and subsidies to
pension contributions from young workers (to incentiv-
ize early participation in the system) and to young work-
ers’ employers (to incentivize hiring of young workers),
targeting workers ages 18–35 with low salaries.

In 2009 an entitlement for women was added, to
compensate for disparities in the labour market: Every
woman will receive a bond for each child she has,
deposited in her pension account, equivalent to 18
months of contributions based on the minimum wage.
The public cost of the reformed system was estimated
at 2.5 percent of GDP a year. In 2015 an International
Presidential Commission presented an assessment of
the system and proposals to address its weaknesses.

be exacerbated without policy interventions.
Widening inequalities are a threat to human
development because they result in disparities
in capabilities and choices.

Inequalities in outcome and opportunities
could be reduced by focusing on the following:
• Formulating and implementing pro-poor
employment strategies. A key problem is that
inequality reproduces itself; it is thus impor-
tant that employment strategies be pro-poor.
Options include the creation of work in
sectors where most poor people work; better
access for poor households to such basic so-
cial services as health, education, safe water
and sanitation; and access to such produc-
tive resources as inputs, credit and finance.
Subsidies, targeted expenditures and pricing
mechanisms can also be considered.

• Providing complementary support. This
would come through marketing facilities,
investments in physical infrastructure (par-
ticularly in rural areas, such as feeder roads),
extension services and labour-intensive
technologies. With the right incentives, the
private sector can be induced to play a major
role in building and running physical infra-
structure. For example, in Brazil a $65 billion
infrastructure package (about 3.5 percent of
GDP) used concessions to the private sector
to build 7,000 kilometres of highways, rail-
ways and ports, among other things.47 Such

investments will immediately create work for
low-skilled workers, with effects on poverty
and inequality.

• Regulating the financial sector to reduce the
regressive effects of cycles. For example, increas-
es in physical investment produce sustained
development for firms and workers, while
increases in financial investment may be
less stable and less likely to generate jobs. A
more stable macroeconomic environment
can favour a “productivist” rather than a
“financier ist” allocation of wealth-promoting
investments in the real economy and create
jobs.48

• Removing asymmetries between the mobility of
labour and of capital. Labour mobility does
not match that of capital, given intrinsic
differences, but also as a matter of policy:
Industrial countries promote capital mobility
but discourage labour mobility. Nonetheless,
regulating capital movement can reduce
macroeconomic instability and middle-in-
come traps in developing countries, as capital
moves overseas when wages become too
high. Migration policies discussed earlier in
the chapter can at a minimum reduce the
risks of migration.
Inequality also has a political dimension.
Addressing inequality implies that existing
shares of the fruits of development need to be
rebalanced. Resistance from those who benefit

in income shares

from the current pattern of distribution is in-
evitable. But allowing inequality to grow could
threaten the status quo of the system itself.
Therefore, some forms of democratization,
sharing and distributive policies in terms of
transfers have to be pursued.
• Democratizing education, particularly at
the tertiary level, nationally and globally.
Countries place a high premium on tertiary
education, which is not always evenly distrib-
uted among populations.49 This is apparent
within countries (as most workers with a
tertiary education come from higher income
families) and between countries (as the
countries with greater levels and increases in
tertiary education are industrial). In a world
that demands skills for work, inequalities in
tertiary education can reinforce inequalities
in access to work and the related social and
economic benefits. Montenegrins understand
the need for equal access to tertiary education
and support policies as such (box 6.12).

• Pursuing profit sharing and employee owner-
ship. Profit sharing with labour and granting
employees part ownership of enterprises may
reduce inequality in income shares. Apart
from reducing inequality, these programmes,
combined with increased training and job
security, may raise productivity and bene-
fit workers.50 Even so, profit sharing is the

How Montenegrins value tertiary education

The density of universities in Montenegro has be-
come comparable to or even higher than other coun-
tries in the region. Results of a 2011 United Nations
Development Programme survey of citizens confirmed
that Montenegrins highly value the completion of higher
education. When asked, “In your opinion, what type of
education would be the most appropriate for your child/
grandchild?”, about 60 percent of respondents consid-
ered higher education the most appropriate and 32 per-
cent postgraduate and doctoral programmes.

The government emphasizes higher education in de-
veloping human capital. The overall budget for the sector
has increased, and education strategies based on the
premise of equal rights and the rights of students are
being implemented. The fundamental goal of these mea-
sures is to ensure that the education system contributes

exception and not the rule. In the European
Union fewer than 30 percent of companies
have profit sharing, and fewer than 10 percent
of workers own their own company’s stocks.51
• Adopting and enforcing distributive policies.
These could include progressive taxes on in-
come and wealth, regulations to reduce rent
extraction, stricter regulation (particularly of
finance) and targeted public spending on the
poor. In many countries (Senegal, for exam-
ple) school lunch plans have helped deal with
hunger and nutrition of children from poorer
households and reduced some disparities in
health outcomes.52 Cash transfer programmes
to poorer households (in South Africa, for
example) have helped poorer households.53
Conditional cash transfer programs have had
a considerable positive impact on poverty and
inequality (box 6.13). In developed countries
better regulation of the financial sector would
help narrow income inequality.
A 15-step agenda has been suggested to
reduce inequality, some steps of which are cap-
tured in box 6.14.

Bolsa Família— Brazil’s conditional cash transfer programme

Bolsa Família is one of the world’s largest cash trans-
fer programmes, administering benefits to 13.8 million
households. It covered 26 percent of the population
across all its municipalities in 2012 with a budget of
$10.75 billion — 0.53 percent of GDP — in 2013. It is fully
financed from general government revenues through the
social security budget.1

The programme’s main goals are to reduce poverty,
promote food security, break down the intergenera-
tional cycle of poverty through human capital accumula-
tion and increase access to public services, especially
health, education and social assistance. Women are the
programme recipients and are responsible for comply-
ing with the conditions: regular visits to health clinics,
attendance of pregnant or breastfeeding women in
scheduled prenatal and postnatal visits, attendance at
educational activities on health and nutrition, full vacci-
nation of children under age 7 and routine health check-
ups and growth monitoring.

Since the programme launched, 5 million Brazilians
have exited extreme poverty, and by 2009 the pro-
gramme had reduced the poverty rate by an estimated
8 percentage points.2 The programme is credited with
increasing enrolment 5.5 percentage points in grades
1–4 and 6.5 percentage points in grades 5–8, though
its effect on dropout rates has not been as good. Over
2001–2009 Brazil’s mean years of schooling rose from
6.8 to 8.3, while the Gini index of years of schooling fell
from 0.347 to 0.288.3

Despite initial concerns that cash transfers to poor
households could risk a decline in their labour supply
and employment rate, the experience has been more
encouraging. Bolsa Família has enabled an increase in
the employment rate of the economically active popula-
tion, a reduction of inactivity and informality rates, an
increase in the proportion of workers contributing to so-
cial security and an increase in the average hourly wage
for the primary occupation.4

Suggested measures for reducing inequalities

• Government should be more concerned with mo-

nopolies and competition policy.

• Trade unions should be bolstered to represent

workers’ interests.

• Government should provide public sector jobs at
minimum wage to those who want them, in areas
such as meals-on-wheels, care for older people,
child care and the like.
In addition to a minimum wage, there should be
a framework to restrain pay at the highest levels.
Some companies have voluntarily decreed that
executive pay should be capped at 65 or 75 times
the average pay in the firm.

•

• Personal income taxes should be made more pro-
gressive, with a maximum rate of 65 percent.
• Every child should get a “child benefit” payment,

to help keep them out of poverty.

and workers’ well-being. Specific issue-based
areas (such as sustainable work), specific groups
(such as young people) and particular situations
(such as conflict or post-conflict conditions)

require special policy attention to enhance links
between work and human development. Some
of these issues (such as youth employment)
may benefit from general policy actions (such
as national employment strategies), but given
the specific nature of some challenges, targeted
actions are also required.

Reducing gender divides at work

Gender divides at work — both paid and unpaid
— are a manifestation of longstanding patterns
of inequities. They can reinforce each other,
trapping women and girls across generations
in realms of limited choices and opportunities.
Any re-balancing of work needs a coherent
and simultaneous effort across many different
dimensions. Policies that expand opportuni-
ties for women to engage in paid work, that
enhance outcomes at work, that balance care
work within households and that change
gender norms regarding work can help reduce
work-related gender inequalities. Policies could
move in the following directions:
• Expanding and strengthening gender-sen-
sitive policies for female wage employment.

Such strategies include improving access to
higher education, particularly in math and
sciences, for women to enhance skills, along
with training that matches market demands.
This could be accompanied by access to con-
tinuing professional development. Figure
6.4 shows a shallow U-shaped relationship
for women between mean years of schooling
and labour force participation. With few
years of schooling, participation rates are
high, likely because poor women with low
education have to work to earn a living. It
goes down as schooling years increase, but
ultimately picks up with further increases in
schooling.

• Specific interventions. Women can face har-
assment in the workplace and discrimination
in hiring and compensation, access to finance
and access to technology. Legislative meas-
ures are needed to reduce these inequalities
in opportunity and to ensure that women
and men receive equal pay for equal work.
Proactive recruitment policies that encour-
age hiring female candidates in jobs, as well
as programmes that reduce barriers to credit,
finance and training, can increase oppor-
tunities in paid work. Reducing barriers to
entrepreneurship can increase self-employ-
ment options. Regulations against workplace
harassment are also imperative for workplace
equality.

• Focusing on both maternal and paternal pa-
rental leave. Much can be achieved to balance
the distribution of unpaid care work and to
reduce wage gaps in paid work when fathers
are included in generous parental leave
policies — and even more when they have
incentives to make use of them (box 6.15).
• Enlarging care options, including day-care
centres, after-school programmes, senior
citizens’ homes and long-term care facilities.
Employers can also offer child care onsite.
Another alternative is to subsidize care work
through instruments such as vouchers and
tickets (box 6.16). The public provisioning
of early childhood education can reduce care
responsibilities as well as improve education
and work outcomes later in the lifecycle.54
Governments can require employers to of-
fer leave for long-term care, as in Germany,
where since 2015, employees have been able
to take 10 days of leave to care for acutely
ill family members, paid for by the social
security system. If a family member needs
longer term care, the employee can take more
leave or reduce his or her working hours for
up to six months. During that time he or she
can obtain interest-free credit subsidized by
the government. In some cases of hardship
the debt can be cancelled. If the employee
needs even more leave, he or she can reduce
working time to 15 hours a week for up to

Positive parental leave systems

For 40 years Sweden has had gender-neutral paren-
tal leave policies. Each parent can take at least two
months of paid leave. Initially, few men made use
of it, so they have been offered an incentive since
2002. If both parents take two months, the fam-
ily gets one extra month of paid leave — an equal-
ity bonus. Now, 90 percent of Swedish fathers take
paternity leave. They thus carry a greater proportion
of childcare work and engage more in child-raising
long after their paternity leave has ended. Perhaps

not coincidentally, Sweden has one of the narrowest
wage gaps in the world and one of the highest scores
for female happiness.1

Similarly, a study on the parental insurance plan in
Quebec, Canada, showed that the share of Québécois
fathers taking paternity leave increased from about
10 percent in 2001 to more than 80 percent in 2010 and
that fathers who took advantage of the leave devoted
23 percent more of their time to household chores —
even one to three years after their leave ended.2

Cash for care work

Governments can assist households by offering cash
payments. Since the mid-1990s the Netherlands has
had cash-for-care schemes. The benefits are based on
a needs and income assessment, but the average is
around €14,500 per person a year. There are few restric-
tions on how it can be used. Administrative costs are
low, and evaluations have indicated that the cash is
used effectively. Households consider the benefits ad-
equate, and the scheme has proved popular.

Israel has a similar scheme. In 2008 the government
introduced a pilot programme and in 2010 expanded it
to cover 15 percent of the country. To be eligible for the

cash benefit, an individual must receive medium- or
high-intensity care by a caregiver who is not a family
member. However, uptake is low and varies according to
age, income and benefit level. Recipients are satisfied
with the cash scheme but appear to benefit less than
those receiving in-kind benefits.

In France beneficiaries can pay for long-term care
services or directly hire a caregiver using the Chèque
emploi services universel programme. They can then
seek reimbursement from an accredited national orga-
nization. This system has the advantages of being trans-
parent and of optimizing public expenditure.

two years, while retaining the right to return
to the activities and hours covered.55

• Pursuing proactive measures for increased
representation of women in senior decision-
making positions. Proactive measures in hu-
man resource policies, gender requirements
in selection and recruitment, and incentive
mechanisms for retention could enhance
women’s representation in the public and
private sectors. Policy priority should also
consolidate progress on breaking the glass
ceiling. There should be identical criteria
for men and women for moving people into
senior management positions, and it should
be free of sex bias and based on equal pay

for equal work. Women’s representation
can be increased through affirmative action
measures. For example, introducing quotas
for women on corporate boards, an initiative
increasingly seen in the European Union.56
Such efforts are even more effective when ac-
companied by policies that increase retention
rates. Mentoring, coaching and sponsoring
can empower women in the workplace — for
example, by using successful senior female
managers as role models and as sponsors.57
All these approaches can help change norms
and promote women to positions of sen-
iority, responsibility and decisionmaking.
A complementary approach for changing

norms is to encourage the engagement of
men in professions that have traditionally
been dominated by women.

• Encouraging flexible working arrangements,
including telecommuting. There should be
sufficient incentives for women to return
to work after giving birth. These may en-
compass the reservation of jobs for women
on maternity leave for up to a year. Women
could also be offered salary increases to
return to work. Flexible work arrangements
such as telecommuting or flexible hours can
also allow women and men to balance paid
and unpaid work.

• Improving public services and infrastructures
to reduce care work burdens. Much time is
spent in care work collecting water and
fuel, cooking and performing other such
tasks. Improved access to clean water and
sanitation, energy services and public infra-
structures, including for transportation, can
greatly reduce the care work burden for fami-
lies, making more time for paid work.

• Valuing unpaid care work. Such a valuation
is not just cosmetic; it helps raise policy
awareness, with implications for explor-
ing options for remunerating such work.
Valuation could also prompt the redistribu-
tion of care work between women and men.
Various statistical methods (as described in

box 4.1 in chapter 4) can be used. But better
methods for data collection will be needed
as well.

• Gathering better data on paid and unpaid
work. National statistical systems, using more
female investigators and appropriate samples
and questionnaires, can gather better data
on unpaid work. With data, policies can be
pursued that help balance paid and unpaid
work — Norway has done it very successfully
(box 6.17).

Moving towards sustainable work

It is possible to terminate, transform and create
work in ways that will advance both human
development and environmental sustainability.
However, for this to occur coherence is needed
in policies and actions across global, national
and subnational levels, which can ensure that
the most appropriate combination of skills,
technologies, investments, regulations and so-
cial interventions are put into place.

There is a crisis in sustainability locally and
globally, but there is also an opportunity for
work to help move humanity to a more endur-
ing and sustainable human development path.
However, the timeframe within which key
steps must be undertaken is tight, with delays
making adverse impacts more likely.

BOX 6.17

Gender policies in Norway

Between 1970 and 2010 strong gender policies in Norway
helped increase women’s paid work and reduce their un-
paid work. The government had already introduced paid
maternity leave in 1956 but reformed the policy in 1993
to allow 49 weeks of fully paid parental leave for moth-
ers and fathers. A series of legislative changes gradually
increased the number of weeks of parental leave that are
available only to the father, under the “paternal quota.” A
quota of four weeks was introduced in 1993 and extended
(in stages) to 10 by 2009. This stimulated a huge increase
in the share of fathers taking at least eight weeks of
leave, from 8 percent in 1996 to 41 percent in 2010.1

Another important landmark was the 1979 Gender
Equality Act. This prohibited any form of gender-based
discrimination at the workplace, related to pregnancy,

birth or leave entitlements. It also stipulated that all
public bodies should aim for gender equality when ap-
pointing members for councils, boards and committees.
Between 2004 and 2006 rules were introduced govern-
ing the gender balance on the boards of publicly and pri-
vately owned public limited companies. In 2007 Norway
implemented a legal entitlement to early child care, paid
for partly by parents but with a maximum contribution of
€300 per month. According to the 2014 World Economic
Forum Global Gender Gap report, women’s wages come
closest to men’s in Norway and Singapore — but wom-
en’s wages are still only 80 percent of men’s.2 These
policies have helped mitigate work–family trade-offs.
They have also enlarged women’s freedom of choice on
family size and helped boost the birth rate.

Moving towards
sustainable work
will require various
transformations

Developing capabilities and skills

Moving towards sustainable work, as described
in chapter 5, will require various transforma-
tions, including what is produced, how it is
produced and where it is produced. A par-
ticularly important transformation is in the
skill sets required for these shifts (for example,
producing solar energy technicians in Nepal).
• Identifying current and future skill needs. Skill
needs reflect both the current and anticipat-
ed needs of societies required, for example,
to adopt more efficient and cleaner technol-
ogies in the immediate future, as well as the
skills to support continuing innovation that
will maintain the movement of work towards
sustainability. Global data on current skill
levels are not readily available, but their dis-
tribution is believed to be markedly uneven
and may not correspond to those needed for
sustainable work.

• Developing skills to make transitions to sus-
tainable work. These would include tech-
nical and scientific skills that will enable
the development, adaptation, installation
and maintenance of sustainable solutions
as well as literacy, numeracy, employability
and entrepreneurship, enabling workers to
learn and adopt new ways of working; and
communication, training and education for
all workers, facilitating the learning process.

BOX 6.18

Social sector policies must therefore incor-
porate this understanding of the dynamics of
skill formation over the lifecycle and of the
importance of education in children’s early
years for overcoming inequalities and pro-
ducing marketable skills for the workforce.
Private sector initiatives can also help (box
6.18).

• Ensuring coherence and timeliness. In de-
veloping skills for facilitating the move to
sustainable work, there should be coherence
and timeliness in the transition of skills
mentioned above. Unless such measures are
effective, the transition to sustainable work
will face considerable practical, social and
political hurdles.

Adopting different technologies and new
investments

Adopting different technologies and new in-
vestments has to be contextualized in country
situations. For example, poor countries, with
weak infrastructures, low capabilities and
inadequate resources for investments, will
need support from the global community (for
example, to increase technology transfer). But
indigenous knowledge on many low-cost adap-
tive technologies exists, and many alternative
technologies are in the public domain. South–

Turkey’s private sector initiative on overcoming skills mismatch at the local level

The Bursa Chamber of Commerce and Industry Education
Foundation is a private sector–led and –owned initia-
tive in Bursa, one of the most industrially advanced and
trade-oriented cities in Turkey. Since 2009 the founda-
tion has contributed to overcoming skills mismatches at
the local level. It operates as a nonprofit vocational and
technical training centre, with the mutually reinforcing
goals of providing skilled human resources to industry
and increasing employability of marginalized groups,
particularly unemployed young people. The Bursa
Chamber of Commerce and Industry is the owner of the
foundation and funds all the activities of the training
centre.

The overall goals of the initiative, along with the
course and trainee selection process, take into account

the skills needs of local sectors and insights from pri-
vate sector leaders and industrialists in Bursa. Almost
all the training and services offered are free. Private
sector leadership, ownership and engagement have
enabled the foundation to deliver market-relevant voca-
tional and technical skills for disadvantaged people and
to help direct them towards employment. The founda-
tion has close and continuous ties to local industrialists,
which allows for state-of-the-art training modalities and
facilitates job placement for the trainees. It has the fa-
cilities and infrastructure to train more than 3,000 young
people a year in a wide variety of areas, from textiles
and mechatronics to automotive metals and hardware.
The employment rate for successful trainees stands at
80 percent.

Some of the
solutions to advance
sustainability will come
from recognizing the
positive externalities
in people’s work

experiments can help countries that are in need
by spreading new ideas, scaling up implementa-
tion and encouraging replication.
• Departing from business as usual. Several
alternative technologies are already in the
public domain, such as climate-resistant
crop varieties developed by public research
institutions. Some are part of local indige-
nous knowledge systems (low-cost housing
materials) or have been developed by practi-
tioners and nongovernmental organizations
(efficient cook stoves). In these cases the
predominant challenges are identifying the
technologies, adapting them to local contexts
(if necessary) and scaling up their use.

• Pursuing technology transfer. As with renew-
able energy generation (hydro, solar and
wind), adoption may depend on technology
transfer, matched by greater investment. The
average annual growth rate of renewable en-
ergy (including hydro, solar and wind) over
2010–2012 was 4 percent — too slow to reach
the targets of Sustainable Energy for All by
2030. The annual growth rate should speed
up to around 7.5 percent, and current annual
investments of around $400 billion would
need to triple to achieve 2030’s targets.58
• Leapfrogging to more sustainable work. If in-
vestments are made in the most advanced and
appropriate technologies, many countries
may be able to leapfrog to more sustainable
work — attaining and securing major gains in
human development. While several sources
of investment may be available — domestic
resources, foreign direct investment, mul-
tilateral development banks — appropriate
arrangements may also be needed for trans-
ferring technology through licensing or other
arrangements.

International precedents exist for such
transfers: Article 66.2 of the World Trade
Organization’s Agreement on Trade-Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(1994) explicitly provides for an agreed-on
mechanism to facilitate technology transfer
to less developed countries.59 In practice,
the Montreal Protocol on substances that
deplete the ozone layer (1989), the Clean
Development Mechanism of the Kyoto
Protocol (1997) and the technology mech-
anism of the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (2012) have

all, to a greater or lesser extent, facilitated
technology transfer. (The Rio + 20 outcome
document recommended a “technology facil-
itation mechanism,” which is also included in
the Sustainable Development Goals.)

Incentivizing individual action, managing
trade-offs and guarding against inequalities

Some of the solutions to advance sustainability
will come from recognizing the positive exter-
nalities in people’s work and incentivizing such
actions (box 6.19). Others will require appro-
priate regulatory and macroeconomic policies
to nudge actors in the right direction.
• Pursue public policies for managing trade-offs.
Some workers will lose their jobs due to an
end of activities in their industry or sector.
Analysis of 21 country case studies identi-
fied the industries likely to expand under
sustainability efforts — renewable energy,
green buildings and retrofitting, transport,
recycling, and waste and water management
— and the industries likely to contract or
substantially change, including agriculture
and forestry, fisheries, extractive industries
and fossil fuel generation, emission-intensive
manufacturing, automotive production,
shipbuilding and cement making.60

Another trade-off example comes from
Sub- Saharan Africa, where rural poverty
is widespread and much of the labour
force lives in rural areas. Increasing farm
productivity there has the potential to
drive greater economic growth and poverty
reduction, accelerating food security and
human development. For example, since
2000 rural poverty in Ghana has fallen
sharply, enabling it to become the first
country in the region to meet Millennium
Development Goal 1. Progress was driven
in part by expanding the area under cocoa
cultivation on labour-intensive smallholder
farms.61 But expansion and extensive culti-
vation have increased environmental stress.
Trade-offs between the different and some-
times competing goals of sustainability
and employment have to be reconciled to
support sustainable work.

• Implementing standards. On promoting sus-
tainable work, box 5.2 in chapter 5 discusses
how implementing standards, regulation

Chapter 6 Enhancing human development through work | 175

A social wage
compensates the
effort by the worker in
terms of the value of
that effort to society

BOX 6.19

The “social wage” of work

Helping conserve the environment or otherwise promote
sustainability delivers benefits to society, and to future
generations, that go far beyond the immediate benefit
to the individual. This is a characteristic of several other
forms of work as well, including some care work. The
social value of these goods and services may diverge
from their private (market) value — and will be under-
provided in free market conditions.

This is especially relevant when the number or
quality of workers engaged in the socially beneficial ac-
tivity is inadequate to deliver the socially optimal level
of the good or service. This can happen, for example,
with a highly qualified worker who has a high reserva-
tion wage in an alternative occupation: however, the
low market valuation of the more socially useful product
restricts the amount he or she can be paid, and conse-
quent low wages reduce the number or quality of people
engaged in the activity.

This may — paradoxically — help attract highly
qualified individuals who are volunteers (or part volun-
teers, accepting wages that are below what the private
market would offer them) and are willing to work with-
out pay because they believe strongly in the outcomes.
Their commitment and abilities are important in correct-
ing undersupply, as well as in motivating and raising
public awareness so that ultimately the political system
can take corrective action.

One approach could be to offer a social wage — a
wage that compensates the effort by the worker in terms
of the value of that effort to society. Incentives that cor-
respond to this already exist in some areas, like hazard
pay or a temporary promotion to public sector workers in
conflict situations or dealing with an epidemic. A similar
justification could be made for properly targeted subsi-
dies or other incentives to promote, for example, more
publicly available research on sustainability.

and appropriate policy measures can make a
difference in the context of the ship-break-
ing industry. It also rightly emphasizes the
difficulties in implementing such standards,
which are nonetheless imperative for quality
sustainable work.

• Addressing intergenerational inequalities.
The people most able to develop better
remunerated skills for sustainable work are
those who have the time and resources to
access quality education and nutrition — the
children of those at the upper end of the
income and wealth distributions. Should
the differential in earnings of these individ-
uals (relative to lower skilled workers) be
wide enough, their children in turn would
be more likely to grasp the opportunity to
develop more highly remunerated skills.
Policies must level a playing field that is
getting steeper over time, so that inequality
in human development is not perpetuated
across generations.

• Manage and facilitate change. Because mov-
ing to sustainable work will lead to jobs being
lost, transformed (the majority) and created,
public policies will be crucial in managing
and facilitating change. Multiple stakehold-
ers will have to work collaboratively — and

globally. And a mechanism is needed to
translate the desired global outcomes into
country actions (box 6.20).

Undertaking group-specific
interventions

For some groups and situations, focused policy
interventions will be needed because overall
policy interventions may not adequately ad-
dress specific challenges. Youth unemployment,
older workers, work in conflict or post-conflict
situations, and creative and voluntary work
are some of the cases that may require special
attention.

Youth unemployment

Earlier policy options, particularly for the
changing world of work, relate to education
and skills to prepare people for the future.
These policies are especially relevant for ad-
dressing youth unemployment. But given the
frequent severity of this challenge and its multi-
dimensional (economic, social and political)
impacts, it also needs targeted interventions.
Exciting work opportunities for young people
should be created so that they can unbridle

BOX 6.20

Possible measures at the country level for moving towards sustainable work

•

Identifying appropriate technologies and invest-
ment options, including leapfrogging opportunities.
• Setting up regulatory and macroeconomic frame-
works to facilitate adoption of sustainable policies.
• Ensuring that the population has the appropriate
skills base — combining technical and high-quality
skills with core abilities for learning, employability
and communicating.

• Retraining and skills upgrading of large numbers
of workers in informal sectors, such as agriculture.
While some workers may be reached through the
market, others will need the help of the public sector,
nongovernmental organizations and others. These

opportunities can be a means to support women and
other traditionally disadvantaged groups.

• Managing the adverse impacts of the transition
through diversified packages of support and keep-
ing the playing field level for breaking the transmis-
sion of intergenerational inequality.

• Continuing to build the skill base of the population.
This will require a lifecycle approach that recog-
nizes the cumulative nature of interventions that
lead to learning. Large investments in the number
and quality of health and education workers will be
necessary, underscoring the continuing role of the
public sector in transforming skills.

their creativity, innovation and entrepreneur-
ship in the new world of work.
• Providing policy support to the sectors and en-
tities that are creating new lines of work. Such
initiatives are ongoing, and new opportuni-
ties are being discovered every day, but they
need policy support.

• Investing in skills development, creativity and
problem solving. Special support should be
extended to young women and men in ap-
prenticeships, trade and vocational training,
and on-the-job learning.

• Providing supportive government policies to
help young entrepreneurs. Areas include advi-
sory services for establishing businesses and
initiatives, as well as better instruments and
channels for financing. For example, in de-
veloping countries microfinance can provide
small-scale community financing for youth;
in more developed economies, particularly in
information technology, venture capital can
support start-ups and larger initiatives. More
recently, crowdsourcing has emerged as an op-
tion to generate funds for small initiatives.62
• Making tertiary learning more widely avail-
able through the Internet. Massive open
online courses are gaining followers among
world-renowned academic institutions and
among students. These Internet-driven
advances are important to accelerate higher
education, but interpersonal contacts as well
as group work and problem solving are still
necessary for gainful learning.

• Using cash transfer programmes to provide em-
ployment for local young people and poor peo-
ple. In India and Uganda these programmes
have provided resources for funding job
searches and for supporting high-quality
training and skills development.63 They have
also increased access to other sources of cred-
it for entrepreneurship.

Older workers

Older people may want to continue working
for two reasons: They want to remain active
and engaged with their work or they cannot
afford to retire. Older workers who leave paid
employment can devote more time to care
and volunteer work. They can thus contribute
to society while maintaining a sense of social
inclusion. In countries affected by HIV/AIDS,
grandparents have served as foster parents to
children orphaned by the disease.64 Older rel-
atives can also care for children whose parents
have migrated for work. Nearly half the world’s
population will not receive a pension, and
for the rest the pension may be inadequate.65
Unless other family members support them,
they must continue working, frequently in the
informal sector.

Countries have identified older workers as
assets and are making efforts to retain them,
sometimes by removing laws on compulsory
retirement or by increasing the pension age, as
in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and

the United Kingdom.66 This enables people to
work longer and cuts the cost of pensions, but
it may remove the choice for older people as
to when to retire. Older workers benefit from
greater access to part-time jobs and from more
flexible work arrangements that allow them to
ease into retirement. One option for flexibility
is self-employment: Google has pledged to help
first-time entrepreneurs over age 50.67

Work in conflict and post-conflict
situations

It is important in conflict and post-conflict
situations to focus on productive jobs that em-
power people, build agency, increase voice, of-
fer social status and increase respect, cohesion,
trust and people’s willingness to participate in
civil society. Such jobs can create economic and
social ties and have the potential to build in-
centives to work across boundaries and resolve
conflict. Some policy options are:
• Creating new forms of work that emerge with
the rise of conflict-specific needs. For example,
during combat, care for combatants (such as
cooking), health care for the wounded and
reconstruction may be extremely useful.

• Supporting work in the health system may
cover many goals. In many conflict-afflicted
countries the health system has collapsed,
converting health services into a life-threat-
ening challenge for helpers and the wounded.
In this setting, international aid becomes
indispensable, but local volunteers contrib-
ute substantially to providing crucial health
services and saving lives.

• Getting basic social services up and running.
Economic considerations apart, this has
social and political benefits. Communities,
nongovernmental organizations and public–
private partnerships can be the drivers.

• Initiating public works programmes. Even
emergency temporary jobs, cash for work
and the like can provide much needed live-
lihoods and contribute to the building of
critical physical and social infrastructures.
• Formulating and implementing targeted com-
munity-based programmes. Such programmes
can yield multiple benefits, including stabil-
ity. Economic activities can be jumpstarted
by reconnecting people, reconstructing net-
works and helping restore the social fabric.

Creative and voluntary work

Creative work requires an enabling work en-
vironment, including financial support, and
opportunities to collaborate and cross-fertilize
ideas. This context is familiar in human devel-
opment as a prerequisite for expanding human
capabilities, including the capacity to be crea-
tive and contribute to the common good. Some
key requirements for creativity and innovation
to thrive are:
• Innovating inclusively. Here, new goods and
services are developed for or by those living
on the lowest incomes or by women, extend-
ing creative opportunities to groups that may
be underrepresented.

• Assuring democratic creativity. Workplaces
and online platforms can be organized in
ways that encourage innovation at all levels.
• Funding experimentation and risk. This
entails solving intractable social and en-
vironmental problems that may require
foundations and public institutions to take
funding risks on less proven approaches — for
example, by supporting more basic research
programmes. This may help innovators and
creative workers patent their innovations.
• Innovating for the public good. Creativity and
innovation can advance many objectives.
Policies that direct innovation towards the
greater social good, including volunteer
work, can enhance human development.
• Encouraging voluntary work. This can also
be done through various policy instruments.
For example, fiscal policy instruments such
as tax rebates, subsidies and public grants
can help voluntary organizations and their
work. At the political level public support
to create and protect space for voluntary
work can bring social benefits, particularly
during emergencies like conflicts and natural
disasters.

An agenda for action—
three pillars

In addition to the policy options outlined in
the three previous sections, a broader agenda
for action, one that addresses the shifting
global context of work, with three pillars may

development: a New Social Contract, a Global
Deal and the Decent Work Agenda.

This is not an easy agenda. It will require po-
litical commitment, endorsement from the po-
litical process and support from top leadership.
Some of the issues in the proposed action agenda
are already part of the Post-2015 Development
Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals
(such as the Decent Work Agenda); others have
received political support but have not been
adopted (such as a new Global Deal). So there is
a momentum that needs to be galvanized. Some
agenda actions (such as a New Social Contract)
will require broad-based social dialogue at both
the global and country levels.

Given the changing nature of the world with
never-before-seen implications for work and
human development, it is imperative that a seri-
ous dialogue start on these issues. In that spirit,
the Report proposes the following agenda for
action.

Developing a New Social Contract

During the 20th century social contracts among
the state, employers and employees evolved in the
industrial, service and public sectors, primarily
in developed countries. This occurred more nar-
rowly, and later, in developing countries, mostly
in the formal and public sectors. Schematically,
social contracts suggested arrangements whereby
the state provided macroeconomic and mone-
tary stability, development of the labour force
through education and training (and quite a
bit through military service) and legislation of
labour rights, in return for negotiated contracts
between employers and employees, often union-
ized, and labour market stability. As part of the
implicit contract the state could levy corporate
and personal taxes and additional labour charges
to fund, initially, education services and some
pensions and emergency health care. As societies
prospered, services and social protection systems
expanded further.

Social contracts served increasing segments
of populations in developed countries and
formal and public sector workers in developing
countries as they decolonized. After the Second
World War, when societies sought to rebuild
and implement policies of “never again,” educa-
tion and social programmes (particularly social
protection with unemployment insurance),

disability and old age pensions all expanded.
Work opportunities also moved rapidly away
from agriculture to urban centres in the for-
mal economy. And in more recent years paid
maternity leave and support for those at risk of
marginalization also became part of the social
protection system in many countries. Some
systems also came to include the self-employed
or those working in small businesses, often in
the service industry.

In the new rapidly evolving world of work,
participants are less likely to have long-term
ties to a single employer or to be a member of
a trade union. They may engage in crowdwork
or freelance work for multiple employers and
contractors. The traditional model that resulted
in many of the social protection systems in place
today is coming under strain as the world of
work has become globalized, less organized and
unionized, and more atomized. It does not fit
the traditional arrangements for protection, and
many freelancers are responsible for their own
pensions and health care. How then does society
fairly mobilize funds to cover a widening pop-
ulation that is not always in work, reach those
working outside the formal sector, accommodate
new labour market entrants (especially migrants)
and cover those unable to find paid work?

Already there have been some initiatives,
as with the Freelancers Union in the United
States.68 In Denmark security alongside re-
skilling and skills upgrading is provided in an
increasingly flexible job market (box 6.21). But
much more dialogue needs to take place at a
much larger scale or countries risk losing the
ground that was gained throughout the 20th
century in terms of protecting workers and en-
suring social welfare. It is time to open dialogue
for a New Social Contract that addresses the
challenges of the world of work today.

Pursuing a Global Deal

In an era of global production, national policies
and social contracts may face additional diffi-
culties. What works at home may not work in a
competitive global environment. Further, true
globalization rests on the ideas of sharing — we
should share the task of finally taking responsi-
bility for a “global working life.”

Such moves to a Global Deal would require,

Flexicurity in Denmark

The Danish labour market has a lot of what is of-
ten called “flexicurity”: coexistence of flexibility, in
the form of low adjustment costs for employers and
employees, and security, which is a by-product of
Denmark’s developed social safety net, ensuring high
coverage and replacement rates.

The principal aim of flexicurity is to promote em-
ployment security over job security, meaning workers
are protected, rather than their jobs. Consequently,
employers benefit from all the advantages of a flex-
ible labour force while employees can take comfort in
a robust safety social net applied with active labour
market policies.

charters of workers’ rights, mobilizing all
partners — workers, businesses and governments
— around the world, respecting workers’ rights
in practice and being prepared to negotiate
agreements at all levels. This will not require
new institutions, merely reoriented tasks and
agendas in the strong international forums that
the world already has.

A Global Deal can guide governments in
implementing policies to meet the needs of
their citizens. Without global agreements, na-
tional policies may respond to labour demands
at home without accounting for externalities.
This implies that a global–national compact is
also necessary. International conventions such
as the International Labour Organization

Four pillars of the Decent Work Agenda

Convention Concerning Decent Work for
Domestic Workers, which entered into force
in September 2013, was a ground-breaking
agreement that stands to establish global
standards for the rights of paid domestic
workers worldwide. This kind of agreement
offers guiding principles to signatories but
leaves space for national governments to im-
plement policies that fit in different national
contexts to meet commitments, motivated
by global actions, but creating real change in
local communities.

Implementing the Decent Work Agenda

The Decent Work Agenda refers to productive
work for women and men in conditions of free-
dom, equity, security and human dignity. It in-
volves opportunities for work that is productive
and delivers a fair income; provides security in
the workplace and social protection for work-
ers and their families; offers prospects for per-
sonal development and social integration; gives
people the freedom to express their concerns,
to organize and to participate in decisions that
affect their lives; and guarantees equal oppor-
tunities and equal treatment for all.69 The four
pillars of the agenda are in box 6.22.

The Decent Work Agenda and the hu-
man development framework are mutually
reinforcing. Decent work enhances human
development through each of its pillars.
Employment creation and enterprise develop-
ment provide income and livelihoods to peo-
ple, crucial instruments for equity, and means

• Employment creation and enterprise development.
This requires acknowledging that a principal route
out of poverty is jobs and that the economy needs
to generate opportunities for investment, entrepre-
neurship, job creation and sustainable livelihoods.
• Standards and rights at work. People need rep-
resentation opportunities to participate, to voice
their views in order to obtain rights, and to earn
respect. The International Labour Organization’s
normative work is key for compliance and measur-
ing progress.

• Social protection. Fewer than 10 percent of people
in the poorest countries have adequate social se-
curity protection. Basic social protection, such as
health care and retirement security, is a founda-
tion for participating productively in society and the
economy.

• Governance and social dialogue. Social dialogue
among governments, workers and employers can
resolve important economic and social issues, en-
courage good governance, establish sound labour
relations and boost economic and social progress.

for participation while facilitating self-esteem
and dignity. Workers’ rights help human
development by upholding human rights,
human freedom and labour standards. Social
protection contributes to human develop-
ment by ensuring safety nets and protecting
people from risks and vulnerabilities. And
social dialogue helps support human devel-
opment through broad-based participation,
empowerment and social cohesion.

Human development also contributes to
the four pillars. Expanding human capabili-
ties through human development enhances
opportunities for employment and entrepre-
neurship. The participation aspect of human
development helps enrich social dialogue.
Human development also emphasizes the pro-
motion of human rights, which boosts work-
ers’ rights and enhances human security. Given
all these interlinks, implementing the Decent

Work Agenda will help work enhance human
development.

Conclusions

The world community has just agreed to a
post-2015 development agenda and a set of
Sustainable Development Goals. The agenda is
global in scope, but its adaptation to national
contexts and its implementation are likely to
differ among countries. A unifying principle is
likely to be “leave no one behind.”

It is in this context of new global commit-
ments and change that this report shows how
human creativity, ingenuity, innovation and
work can expand choices, enhance well-being
and ensure freedom for every human being
in an equitable and sustainable way — so that
human progress, indeed, leaves no one behind.

Implementing the
Decent Work Agenda
will help work enhance
human development

DEFINITIONS

C087: Freedom of Association and Protection of
the Right to Organise Convention, 1948: Says that
workers and employers have the right to establish
and join organizations of their own choosing without
previous authorization, that workers’ and employers’
organizations have the right to establish and join
federations and confederations and that any such
organization, federation or confederation has the
right to affiliate with international organizations of
workers and employers.

relinquish trade union membership for employment,
or dismissal because of union membership or
participation in union activities and protects
workers’ and employers’ organizations from
interference by each other, in particular the
establishment of workers’ organizations under the
domination of employers or employers’ organizations
or the support of workers’ organizations by financial
or other means in order to place such organizations
under the control of employers or employers’
organizations. The convention also enshrines the
right to collective bargaining.

C029: Forced Labour Convention, 1930: Prohibits
all forms of forced or compulsory labour—defined as
work or service that is exacted from any person under
the menace of penalty and for which the person has
not offered himself or herself voluntarily. Exceptions
are provided for work required by compulsory military
service, normal civic obligations, as a consequence
of a conviction in a court of law (provided that the
work or service in question is carried out under the
supervision and control of a public authority and that
the person carrying it out is not hired to or placed
at the disposal of private individuals, companies or
associations), in cases of emergency and for minor
communal services performed by the members of a
community in the direct interest of the community.

C098: Right to Organise and Collective
Bargaining Convention, 1949: Protects
workers from anti-union discrimination, including
requirements that a worker not join a union or

C105: Abolition of Forced Labour Convention,
1957: Prohibits forced or compulsory labour as a
means of political coercion or education or as a
punishment for holding or expressing political views

or views ideologically opposed to the established
political, social or economic system; as a method
of mobilizing and using labour for purposes of
economic development; as a means of labour
discipline; as a punishment for having participated in
strikes and as a means of racial, social, national or
religious discrimination.

C100: Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951:
Ensures the principle of equal remuneration for
men and women for work of equal value, with
“remuneration” broadly defined to include the
ordinary, basic or minimum wage or salary and any
additional direct or indirect payment (in cash or in
kind) from the employer.

C111: Discrimination (Employment and
Occupation) Convention, 1958: Requires ratifying
states to declare and pursue a national policy
designed to promote equality of opportunity and
treatment in respect of employment and occupation,
with a view to eliminating any discrimination in these
fields, including discrimination in access to vocational
training, access to employment and to particular
occupations, and terms and conditions of employment.
Discrimination is defined as any distinction, exclusion
or preference based on race, colour, sex, religion,
political opinion, national extraction or social origin
that nullifies or impairs equality of opportunity or
treatment in employment or occupation.

C138: Minimum Age Convention, 1973: Sets the
general minimum age for admission to employment

or work at 15 years (13 for light work) and the
minimum age for hazardous work at 18 (16 under
certain strict conditions), with provisions for initially
setting the general minimum age at 14 (12 for light
work) where the economy and education facilities
are insufficiently developed.

C182: Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention,
1999: Requires ratifying states to eliminate the
worst forms of child labour (with child defined as a
person under age 18), including all forms of slavery
or practices similar to slavery, such as the sale and
trafficking of children, debt bondage and serfdom
and forced or compulsory labour, including forced
or compulsory recruitment of children for use in
armed conflict; child prostitution and pornography;
using children for illicit activities, in particular for
the production and trafficking of drugs; and work
that is likely to harm the health, safety or morals
of children. The convention also requires ratifying
states to provide the necessary and appropriate
direct assistance for the removal of children
from the worst forms of child labour and for their
rehabilitation and social integration and to ensure
access to free basic education and, wherever
possible and appropriate, vocational training for
children removed from the worst forms of child
labour.

27 The International Labour Organization

defines the labour force par-
ticipation rate as the proportion of
a country’s working-age population
that engages actively in the labour
market, either by working or looking
for work. Depending on the structure
of surveys, participation among
certain groups of workers may be
underestimated — particularly the
number of employed people who work
only a few hours in the reference peri-
od, are in unpaid employment or work
near or in their home. The number of
women tends to be underestimated
to a larger extent than the number of
men. See ILO (2015e) for more exten-
sive definition and discussion.

study estimates that global inequality

has fallen — from a Gini coefficient
of 0.69 in 2003 to 0.65 in 2013. For
the global distribution of household
incomes, the dominant forces are not
changes in the distribution of income
within countries, but changes in the
relative average incomes of countries,
weighted by population. Thus the
extraordinary growth of China and, to
less extent, India — which together
account for almost 40 percent of the
world’s population — largely explain
the decline in global household
inequality.

95 “Big data” is a comprehensive

concept that describes large and
complex amounts of information. In
contrast to traditional data, big data
is characterized by the 5 V’s (volume,

velocity, variety, veracity and value). It
is enormous in volume — on the order
of zettabytes and brontobytes in a
single dataset. Big data is also gener-
ated with high velocity (that is, the
speed with which data must be stored
and analyzed) and with large variety.
Additionally, big data is unstructured
and often takes qualitative informa-
tion into account as well. The fifth V,
value, accounts for the potential of
big data to be used for development.

calculation based on ILO 2014c.
FAO 2015. The Food and Agriculture
Organization figures for the economi-
cally active population in agriculture
are higher than the International
Labour Organization figures on those
employed in agriculture because the
Food and Agriculture Organization de-
fines the economically active popula-
tion in agriculture (agricultural labour
force) as the part of the economically
active population engaged in or seek-
ing work in agriculture, hunting, fish-
ing or forestry, while the International
Labour Organization definition for
“employment by sector, agriculture”
includes only employees (wage and
salary earners) and excludes the
self-employed and contributing family
members. The employment share of
the agricultural sector estimated by
the International Labour Organization
is lower than that estimated by the
Food and Agriculture Organization.

data on flexible work are derived from

a range of sources, including case
studies, econometric secondary data
analyses, meta-analyses and primary
research using dedicated surveys that
elicit manager or employee views
of the costs or benefits of work–life
balance policies. Determining con-
clusive results therefore — whether
in terms of coverage, quality, diverse
indicators, methodology or relevance,
along with the interpretation and
generalizability of findings — remains
a challenge for this area of research.

This is purely the impact of higher
female education on female labor force
participation and does not account for
the impacts of education on fertility.

Furthermore, increasing male education
can have an offsetting effect on female
labor force participation. The effect of
male education is about –2 percentage
points. Bloom and McKenna 2015.

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015Work for Human Development

Readers guide

The 16 statistical tables in this annex as well as the statistical
tables following chapters 2, 4 and 6 provide an overview of key
aspects of human development. The first seven tables contain
the family of composite human development indices and their
components estimated by the Human Development Report
Office (HDRO). The remaining tables present a broader set of
indicators related to human development.

Unless otherwise specified in the notes, tables use data avail-
able to the HDRO as of 15 April 2015. All indices and indica-
tors, along with technical notes on the calculation of composite
indices and additional source information, are available online
at http://hdr.undp.org/en/data.

Countries and territories are ranked by 2014 Human Devel-
opment Index (HDI) value. Robustness and reliability analysis
has shown that for most countries the differences in HDI are
not statistically significant at the fourth decimal place.1 For
this reason countries with the same HDI value at three decimal
places are listed with tied ranks.

Sources and definitions

Unless otherwise noted, the HDRO uses data from interna-
tional data agencies with the mandate, resources and expertise
to collect national data on specific indicators.

Definitions of indicators and sources for original data com-
ponents are given at the end of each table, with full source
details in Statistical references.

Gross national income per capita in
purchasing power parity terms

In comparing standards of living based on income across coun-
tries, the income component of the HDI uses gross national
income (GNI) per capita converted into purchasing power par-
ity (PPP) terms to eliminate differences in national price levels.
The International Comparison Programme (ICP) survey is
the world’s largest statistical initiative that produces interna-
tionally comparable price levels, economic aggregates in real
terms and PPP estimates. Estimates from ICP surveys conduct-
ed in 2011 and covering 190 countries were used to compute
the 2014 HDI values.

Methodology updates

The 2015 Report retains all the composite indices from the
family of human development indices—the HDI, the Ine-
quality-adjusted Human Development Index, the Gender
Development Index, the Gender Inequality Index and the Mul-
tidimensional Poverty Index. The methodology used to com-
pute these indices is the same as one used in the 2014 Report.
For details see Technical notes 1–5 at http://hdr.undp.org.

Comparisons over time and across editions
of the Report

Because national and international agencies continually
improve their data series, the data—including the HDI values
and ranks—presented in this Report are not comparable to
those published in earlier editions. For HDI comparability
across years and countries, see table 2, which presents trends
using consistent data.

Discrepancies between national and
international estimates

National and international data can differ because interna-
tional agencies harmonize national data using a consistent
methodology and occasionally produce estimates of missing
data to allow comparability across countries. In other cases
international agencies might not have access to the most recent
national data. When HDRO becomes aware of discrepancies,
it brings them to the attention of national and international
data authorities.

Country groupings and aggregates

The tables present weighted aggregates for several country
groupings. In general, an aggregate is shown only when data
are available for at least half the countries and represent at least
two-thirds of the population in that classification. Aggregates
for each classification cover only the countries for which data
are available.

Human development classification

Statistical acknowledgements

HDI classifications are based on HDI fixed cut-off points,
which are derived from the quartiles of distributions of com-
ponent indicators. The cut-off points are HDI of less than 0.550
for low human development, 0.550–0.699 for medium human
development, 0.700–0.799 for high human development and
0.800 or greater for very high human development.

Regional groupings

Regional groupings are based on United Nations Development
Programme regional classifications. Least Developed Countries
and Small Island Developing States are defined according to
UN classifications (see www.unohrlls.org).

Developing countries

Aggregates are provided for the group of countries classified as
developing countries.

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development

Aggregates are presented for the 34 members of the Organi-
sation of Economic Co-operation and Development, 31 of
which are developed countries and 3 of which are developing
countries. Aggregates refer to all countries from the group for
which data are available.

Country note

Data for China do not include Hong Kong Special Administra-
tive Region of China, Macao Special Administrative Region of
China or Taiwan Province of China.

Symbols

A dash between two years, as in 2005–2014, indicates that the
data are from the most recent year available during the period
specified. A slash between years, as in 2005/2014, indicates
average for the years shown. Growth rates are usually average
annual rates of growth between the first and last years of the
period shown.

The Report’s composite indices and other statistical resources
draw on a wide variety of the most respected international
data providers in their specialized fields. HDRO is particularly
grateful to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Dis-
asters; Economic Commission for Latin America and the Car-
ibbean; Eurostat; Food and Agriculture Organization; Gallup;
ICF Macro; Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre; Inter-
national Labour Organization; International Monetary Fund;
International Telecommunication Union; Inter-Parliamentary
Union; Luxembourg Income Study; Organisation for Econom-
ic Co-operation and Development; United Nations Children’s
Fund; United Nations Conference on Trade and Development;
United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs;
United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West
Asia; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization Institute for Statistics; Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime; United Nations World Tourism
Organization; World Bank; and World Health Organization.
The international education database maintained by Robert
Barro (Harvard University) and Jong-Wha Lee (Korea Univer-
sity) was another invaluable source for the calculation of the
Report’s indices.

Statistical tables

The first seven tables relate to the five composite human devel-
opment indices and their components.

Since the 2010 Human Development Report, four composite
human development indices—the HDI, the Inequality-ad-
justed Human Development Index, the Gender Inequality
Index and the Multidimensional Poverty Index—have been
calculated. Last year’s Report introduced the Gender Develop-
ment Index, which compares the HDI calculated separately for
women and men and is included again in this year’s Report.

The remaining tables present a broader set of human devel-
opment–related indicators and provide a more comprehensive
picture of a country’s human development. Three of these tables
are presented as annexes to chapters 2, 4 and 6.

Table 1, Human Development Index and its components,
ranks countries by 2014 HDI value and details the values of
the three HDI components: longevity, education (with two
indicators) and income. The table also presents the difference
in rankings by HDI and GNI.

Table 2, Human Development Index trends, 1990–2014,
provides a time series of HDI values allowing 2014 HDI values
to be compared with those for previous years. The table uses the

most recently revised historical data available in 2015 and the
same methodology applied to compute the 2014 HDI. Along
with historical HDI values, the table includes the change in
HDI rank over the last five years and the average annual HDI
growth rates across four different time intervals, 1990–2000,
2000–2010, 2010–2014 and 1990–2014.

Table 3, Inequality-adjusted Human Development
Index, contains two related measures of inequality—the IHDI
and the loss in HDI due to inequality. The IHDI looks beyond
the average achievements of a country in health, education
and income to show how these achievements are distributed
among its residents. The IHDI can be interpreted as the level
of human development when inequality is accounted for. The
relative difference between the IHDI and HDI is the loss due to
inequality in distribution of the HDI within the country. The
table also presents the coefficient of human inequality, which
is an unweighted average of inequalities in three dimensions.
In addition, the table shows each country’s difference in rank
on the HDI and the IHDI. A negative value means that taking
inequality into account lowers a country’s rank in the HDI
distribution. The table also presents three standard measures
of income inequality: the ratio of the top and the bottom quin-
tiles; the Palma ratio, which is the ratio of income of the top
10 percent and the bottom 40 percent; and the Gini coefficient.
Table 4, Gender Development Index, measures disparities
in HDI by gender. The table contains HDI values estimated
separately for women and men; the ratio of which is the GDI.
The closer the ratio to 1, the smaller the gap between women
and men. Values for the three HDI components—longevity,
education (with two indicators) and income—are also pre-
sented by gender. The table also includes country groupings by
absolute deviation from gender parity in HDI values.

Table 5, Gender Inequality Index, presents a composite
measure of gender inequality using three dimensions: reproduc-
tive health, empowerment and the labour market. Reproductive
health is measured by two indicators: the maternal mortality
ratio and the adolescent birth rate. Empowerment is measured
by the share of parliamentary seats held by women and the share
of population with at least some secondary education. And
labour market is measured by participation in the labour force.
A low Gender Inequality Index value indicates low inequality
between women and men, and vice-versa.

Table 6, Multidimensional Poverty Index: developing
countries, captures the multiple deprivations that people face
in their education, health and living standards. The MPI shows
both the incidence of nonincome multidimensional poverty (a
headcount of those in multidimensional poverty) and its inten-
sity (the relative number of deprivations poor people experience
at the same time). Based on intensity thresholds, people are clas-
sified as near multidimensional poverty, multidimensionally

poor or in severe poverty, respectively. The contributions of dep-
rivations in each dimension to overall poverty are also included.
The table also presents measures of income poverty—popula-
tion living on less than PPP $1.25 per day and population living
below the national poverty line. This year’s Multidimensional
Poverty Index estimations use the revised methodology that
was introduced in the 2014 Report. The revised methodology
includes some modifications to the original set of 10 indicators:
height-for-age replaces weight-for-age for children under age 5
because stunting is a better indicator of chronic malnutrition,
a child death is considered a health deprivation only if it
happened in the five years prior to the survey, the minimum
threshold for education deprivation was raised from five years
of schooling to six to reflect the standard definition of primary
schooling used in the Millennium Development Goals and in
international measures of functional literacy and the indicators
for household assets were expanded to better reflect rural as
well as urban households.

Table 7, Multidimensional Poverty Index: changes over
time, presents estimates of Multidimensional Poverty Index
values and its components for two or more time points for
countries for which consistent data were available in 2015.
Estimation is based on the revised methodology introduced in
the 2014 Report.

Table 8, Population trends, contains major population
indicators, including total population, median age, depend-
ency ratios and total fertility rates, which can help assess the
burden of support that falls on the labour force in a country.
Deviations from the natural sex ratio at birth have implications
for population replacement levels, suggest possible future social
and economic problems and may indicate gender bias.

Table 9, Health outcomes, presents indicators of infant
health (percentage of infants who are exclusively breastfed for
the first six months of life, percentage of infants who lack immu-
nization for DTP and measles, and infant mortality rate), child
health (child mortality rate and percentage of children under
age 5 who are stunted) and adult health (adult mortality rates
by gender, deaths due to malaria and tuberculosis, HIV preva-
lence and life expectancy at age 60). Two indicators of quality of
health care are also included: number of physicians per 10,000
people and public health expenditure as a share of GDP.

Table 10, Education achievements, presents standard
education indicators along with indicators of education qual-
ity, including average test scores on reading, mathematics and
science for 15-year-old students. The table provides indicators
of educational attainment—adult and youth literacy rates and
the share of the adult population with at least some secondary
education. Gross enrolment ratios at each level of education are
complemented by primary school dropout rates. The table also
includes two indicators of education quality—primary school

HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015Work for Human Development
teachers trained to teach and the pupil–teacher ratio—as well
as an indicator on public expenditure on education as a share
of GDP.

Table 11, National income and composition of resourc-
es, covers several macroeconomic indicators such as gross
domestic product (GDP), gross fixed capital formation and
taxes on income, profit and capital gain as percentage of total
tax revenue. Gross fixed capital formation is a rough indicator
of national income that is invested rather than consumed. In
times of economic uncertainty or recession, gross fixed capital
formation typically declines. General government final con-
sumption expenditure (presented as a share of GDP and as
average annual growth) and research and development expend-
iture are indicators of public spending. In addition, the table
presents three indicators of debt—domestic credit provided by
the banking sector, external debt stock and total debt service,
all measured as a percentage of GDP or gross national income
(GNI). The consumer price index is a measure of inflation; two
indicators related to the price of food are presented as well—the
price level index and the price volatility index.

Table 12, Environmental sustainability, covers environ-
mental vulnerability and effects of environmental threats. The
table shows the proportion of fossil fuels and renewable energy
sources in the primary energy supply, levels and annual growth
of carbon dioxide emissions per capita and measures of ecosys-
tem and natural resources preservation (natural resource deple-
tion as a percentage of GNI, forest area and change in forest area
and fresh water withdrawals). The table contains the under-five
mortality rates due to outdoor and indoor air pollution and to
unsafe water, unimproved sanitation or poor hygiene. The table
also presents an indicator of the direct impacts of natural dis-
asters (average annual population affected per million people).

Table 13, Work and employment, contains indicators on
three components: employment, unemployment and labour
productivity. Two key indicators related to employment are
highlighted: the employment to population ratio and the labour
force participation rate. The table also reports employment in
agriculture and services and the change since 1990. Also present-
ed is the percentage of the labour force with tertiary education,
which is associated with the high-skilled labour force. The table
brings together indicators related to vulnerable employment and
different forms of unemployment. And labour productivity is
accounted for by output per worker and hours worked per week.
Table 14, Human security, reflects the extent to which
the population is secure. The table begins with the percentage
of registered births, followed by the number of refugees by
country of origin and number of internally displaced persons.
It shows the size of the homeless population due to natural dis-
asters, orphaned children population and prison population.
Indicators on homicide and suicide (by gender) are provided.

206 | HUMAN DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2015

And the table includes the depth of food deficit and an indica-
tor on violence against women.

Table 15, International integration, provides indicators of
several aspects of globalization. International trade is measured
as share of GDP. Financial flows are represented by net inflows
of foreign direct investment and private capital, official devel-
opment assistance and inflows of remittances. Human mobility
is captured by the net migration rate, the stock of immigrants,
the net number of tertiary students from abroad (expressed as a
percentage of total tertiary enrolment in that country) and the
number of international inbound tourists. International com-
munication is represented by the share of the population that
uses the Internet, the number of mobile phone subscriptions
per 100 people and the percentage change in mobile phone
subscriptions between 2009 and 2014.

Table 16, Supplementary indicators: perceptions of
well-being, includes indicators that reflect individuals’ opin-
ions and self-perceptions of relevant dimensions of human
development—quality of education, quality of health care,
standard of living and labour market, personal safety and
overall satisfaction with freedom of choice and life. The table
also contains indicators reflecting perceptions of government
policies on preservation of the environment and overall trust
in the national government and judicial system.

Chapter 1 annex table, Work with exploitation, risks and
insecurities, brings together indicators of work that represents
risk to human development—child labour, domestic workers
and working poor. The table also presents recent counts of
occupational injuries. Three indicators—unemployment bene-
fits, paid maternity leave and old age pension—indicate security
stemming from employment.

Chapter 4 annex table, Time use, compiles data from more
than 100 time use surveys conducted over the last 25 years with
information on the time women and men spend daily on major
activities—paid and unpaid work, learning, social life and lei-
sure, personal care and maintenance, and other (unaccounted)
activities.

Chapter 6 annex table, Status of fundamental rights con-
ventions, shows when countries ratified key labour rights con-
ventions. The eight selected conventions cover four key groups
of rights and freedoms: freedom of association and collective
bargaining, elimination of forced and compulsory labour,
elimination of discrimination in respect of employment, and
occupation and abolition of child labour.

q Based on data from United Nations Children’s

Fund (UNICEF) Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys
for 2005–2014.

r Based on cross-country regression.

s The 2013 HDI value published in the 2014 Human
Development Report was based on miscalculated
GNI per capita in 2011 PPP dollars, as published
in the World Bank (2014). A more realistic
value, based on the model developed by HDRO
and verified and accepted by Cuba’s National
Statistics Office, is $7,222. The corresponding
2013 HDI value is 0.759 and the rank is 69th.

i Calculated as the average of mean years of

schooling for Austria and Switzerland.

DEFINITIONS

Human Development Index (HDI): A composite
index measuring average achievement in three basic
dimensions of human development—a long and
healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of
living. See Technical note 1 at http://hdr.undp.org/en
for details on how the HDI is calculated.

Life expectancy at birth: Number of years a
newborn infant could expect to live if prevailing
patterns of age-specific mortality rates at the time of
birth stay the same throughout the infant’s life.

Expected years of schooling: Number of years
of schooling that a child of school entrance age
can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of
age-specific enrolment rates persist throughout the
child’s life.

Mean years of schooling: Average number of
years of education received by people ages 25 and

older, converted from education attainment levels
using official durations of each level.

Gross national income (GNI) per capita:
Aggregate income of an economy generated by
its production and its ownership of factors of
production, less the incomes paid for the use of
factors of production owned by the rest of the world,
converted to international dollars using PPP rates,
divided by midyear population.

DEFINITIONS

Human Development Index (HDI): A composite
index measuring average achievement in three basic

dimensions of human development—a long and
healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of
living. See Technical note 1 (http://hdr.undp.org/en)
for details on how the HDI is calculated.

Average annual HDI growth: A smoothed
annualized growth of the HDI in a given period,
calculated as the annual compound growth rate.

MAIN DATA SOURCES

Column 8: Calculated based on data in column 6.

Columns 1–7: HDRO calculations based on
data from UNDESA (2015), UNESCO Institute for
Statistics (2015), United Nations Statistics Division
(2015), World Bank (2015a), Barro and Lee (2014)
and IMF (2015).

Column 9: Calculated based on HDI data from HDRO
and data in column 7.

Columns 10–13: Calculated based on data in
columns 1, 2, 3 and 7.

NOTES

a See http://hdr.undp.org for the list of surveys used

to estimate inequalities.

b Based on countries for which the Inequality-

adjusted Human Development Index is calculated.

c Calculated from the 2010–2015 period life tables

from UNDESA (2013a).

d Data refer to 2014 or the most recent year available.

e Data refer to the most recent year available during

the period specified.

DEFINITIONS

Human Development Index (HDI): A composite
index measuring average achievement in three basic
dimensions of human development—a long and
healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of
living. See Technical note 1 at http://hdr.undp.org for
details on how the HDI is calculated.

Inequality‑adjusted HDI (IHDI): HDI value adjusted
for inequalities in the three basic dimensions of
human development. See Technical note 2 at http://
hdr.undp.org for details on how the IHDI is calculated.

Overall loss: Percentage difference between the
IHDI and the HDI.

Difference from HDI rank: Difference in ranks on
the IHDI and the HDI, calculated only for countries for
which the IHDI is calculated.

Coefficient of human inequality: Average inequality
in three basic dimensions of human development. See
Technical note 2 at http://hdr.undp.org.

Quintile ratio: Ratio of the average income of the
richest 20% of the population to the average income
of the poorest 20% of the population.

Column 4: Calculated based on data in column 2 and
recalculated HDI ranks for countries for which the
IHDI is calculated.

Inequality in life expectancy: Inequality in
distribution of expected length of life based on
data from life tables estimated using the Atkinson
inequality index.

Inequality‑adjusted life expectancy index: The
HDI life expectancy index adjusted for inequality in
distribution of expected length of life based on data
from life tables listed in Main data sources.

Inequality in education: Inequality in distribution
of years of schooling based on data from household
surveys estimated using the Atkinson inequality index.

Inequality‑adjusted education index: The HDI
education index adjusted for inequality in distribution
of years of schooling based on data from household
surveys listed in Main data sources.

Inequality in income: Inequality in income
distribution based on data from household surveys
estimated using the Atkinson inequality index.

Inequality‑adjusted income index: The HDI
income index adjusted for inequality in income
distribution based on data from household surveys
listed in Main data sources.

Palma ratio: Ratio of the richest 10% of the population’s
share of gross national income (GNI) divided by the
poorest 40%’s share. It is based on the work of Palma
(2011), who found that middle class incomes almost
always account for about half of GNI and that the other
half is split between the richest 10% and poorest 40%,
though their shares vary considerably across countries.

Column 5: Calculated as the arithmetic mean of the
values in columns 6, 8 and 10 using the methodology
described in Technical note 2 (available at http://
hdr.undp.org).

Column 6: Calculated based on abridged life tables
from UNDESA (2013a).

Gini coefficient: Measure of the deviation of
the distribution of income among individuals or
households within a country from a perfectly equal
distribution. A value of 0 represents absolute
equality, a value of 100 absolute inequality.

MAIN DATA SOURCES

Column 1: HDRO calculations based on data from
UNDESA (2015), UNESCO Institute for Statistics
(2015), United Nations Statistics Division (2015), World
Bank (2015a), Barro and Lee (2014) and IMF (2015).

Column 2: Calculated as the geometric mean of the
values in columns 7, 9 and 11 using the methodology
described in Technical note 2 (available at http://hdr.
undp.org).

Column 3: Calculated based on data in columns 1 and 2.

Column 7: Calculated based on data in column 6 and
the life expectancy index.

Columns 8 and 10: Calculated based on data from
the Luxembourg Income Study database, Eurostat’s
European Union Statistics on Income and Living
Conditions, the World Bank’s International Income
Distribution Database, United Nations Children’s Fund
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and ICF Macro
Demographic and Health Surveys using the methodology
in Technical note 2 (available at http://hdr.undp.org).

Column 9: Calculated based on data in column 8 and
the unadjusted education index.

Column 11: Calculated based on data in column 10
and the unadjusted income index.

Columns 12 and 13: HDRO calculations based on
data from World Bank (2015b).

Column 14: World Bank (2015b).

NOTES

a Because disaggregated income data are not
available, data are crudely estimated. See
Definitions and Technical note 3 at http://
hdr.undp.org for details on how the Gender
Development Index is calculated.

b Countries are divided into five groups by absolute

deviation from gender parity in HDI values.

c Data refer to 2014 or the most recent year

available.

d Calculated by the Singapore Ministry of

Education.

e HDRO updates based on data on educational

attainment from UNESCO Institute for Statistics
(2015) and methodology from Barro and Lee
(2014).

f For the purpose of calculating the male HDI value,
estimated gross national income per capita is
capped at $75,000.

g Based on data from UNESCO Institute for

Statistics (2011).

h Based on data on school life expectancy from the

UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2013).

i HDRO calculations based on data from recent

United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Multiple
Indicator Cluster Surveys.

j Based on the estimate of educational attainment
distribution from UNESCO Institute for Statistics
(2015).

k HDRO calculations based on data from the

2011 population census from Samoa Bureau of
Statistics (2013).

l HDRO estimate based on data from the country’s
most recent ICF Macro Demographic and Health
Survey.

DEFINITIONS

Gender Development Index: Ratio of female to
male HDI values. See Technical note 3 at http://hdr.
undp.org for details on how the Gender Development
Index is calculated.

Gender Development Index groups: Countries
are divided into five groups by absolute deviation
from gender parity in HDI values. Group 1 comprises
countries with high equality in HDI achievements
between women and men (absolute deviation of
less than 2.5 percent); group 2 comprises countries
with medium to high equality in HDI achievements
between women and men (absolute deviation of
2.5–5 percent); group 3 comprises countries with
medium equality in HDI achievements between
women and men (absolute deviation of 5–7.5

percent); group 4 comprises countries with medium
to low equality in HDI achievements between women
and men (absolute deviation of 7.5–10 percent); and
group 5 comprises countries with low equality in HDI
achievements between women and men (absolute
deviation from gender parity of more than 10 percent).

Human Development Index (HDI): A composite
index measuring average achievement in three basic
dimensions of human development—a long and
healthy life, knowledge and a decent standard of
living. See Technical note 1 at http://hdr.undp.org for
details on how the HDI is calculated.

Life expectancy at birth: Number of years a
newborn infant could expect to live if prevailing
patterns of age-specific mortality rates at the time of
birth stay the same throughout the infant’s life.

Expected years of schooling: Number of years
of schooling that a child of school entrance age
can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of
age-specific enrolment rates persist throughout the
child’s life.

Mean years of schooling: Average number of
years of education received by people ages 25 and
older, converted from educational attainment levels
using official durations of each level.

Estimated gross national income per capita:
derived from the ratio of female to male wages, female
and male shares of economically active population
and GNI (in 2011 purchasing power parity terms). See
Technical note 3 at http://hdr.undp.org for details.

data from the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics.

g For the purpose of calculating the Gender
Inequality Index value, 0.1% was used.

h Refers to 2013.

Gender Inequality Index: A composite measure
reflecting inequality in achievement between women
and men in three dimensions: reproductive health,
empowerment and the labour market. See Technical
note 4 at http://hdr.undp.org/en for details on how
the Gender Inequality Index is calculated.

Maternal mortality ratio: Number of deaths
due to pregnancy-related causes per 100,000 live
births.

Share of seats in national parliament: Proportion
of seats held by women in the national parliament
expressed as percentage of total seats. For countries
with bicameral legislative systems, the share of
seats is calculated based on both houses.

Population with at least some secondary
education: Percentage of the population ages 25
and older who have reached (but not necessarily
completed) a secondary level of education.

Labour force participation rate: Proportion of
a country’s working-age population (ages 15 and
older) that engages in the labour market, either by
working or actively looking for work, expressed as a
percentage of the working-age population.

MAIN DATA SOURCES

authorities. National estimates are based on
population-weighted subgroup estimates from
household surveys.

Surveys, M indicates data from Multiple Indicator
Cluster Surveys and N indicates data from
national surveys (see http://hdr.undp.org for the
list of national surveys).

b Not all indicators were available for all countries,

so caution should be used in cross-country
comparisons. Where an indicator is missing,
weights of available indicators are adjusted to
total 100%. See Technical note 5 at http://hdr.
undp.org for details.

c The HDRO specifications refer to somewhat
modified definitions of deprivations in some
indicators compared to the 2010 specifications.
See Technical note 5 for details.

d Based on a methodology from Alkire and Santos

(2010).

e Data refer to the most recent year available

during the period specified.

h Missing indicator on child mortality.

i Missing indicator on type of floor.

j Missing indicator on cooking fuel.

k Missing indicator on electricity.

l Missing indicator on school attendance.

DEFINITIONS

Multidimensional Poverty Index: Percentage
of the population that is multidimensionally poor
adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations.
See Technical note 5 for details on how the
Multidimensional Poverty Index is calculated.

Population near multidimensional poverty:
Percentage of the population at risk of suffering
multiple deprivations—that is, those with a
deprivation score of 20–33 percent.

Population in severe multidimensional
poverty: Percentage of the population in severe
multidimensional poverty—that is, those with a
deprivation score of 50 percent or more.

Contribution of deprivation to overall poverty:
Percentage of the Multidimensional Poverty Index
attributed to deprivations in each dimension.

Multidimensional poverty headcount: Percentage
of the population with a weighted deprivation
score of at least 33 percent. It is also expressed in
thousands of the population in the survey year.

Population below national poverty line:
Percentage of the population living below the
national poverty line, which is the poverty
line deemed appropriate for a country by its

Population below PPP $1.25 a day: Percentage of
the population living below the international poverty
line $1.25 (in purchasing power parity terms) a day.

MAIN DATA SOURCES

Column 1: Refers to the year and the survey whose
data were used to calculate the values in columns
2–10.

Columns 2–3 and 6–12: HDRO calculations
based on data on household deprivations in
education, health and living standards from various
household surveys listed in column 1 using revised
methodology described in Technical note 5.

Columns 4 and 5: Alkire and Robles (2015).

Columns 13 and 14: World Bank (2015a).

a D indicates data from Demographic and Health

Surveys, M indicates data from Multiple Indicator
Cluster Surveys and N indicates data from
national surveys (see http://hdr.undp.org for the
list of national surveys).

b Not all indicators were available for all countries,

so caution should be used in cross-country
comparisons. Where an indicator is missing,
weights of available indicators are adjusted to
total 100%. See Technical note 5 at http://hdr.
undp.org for details.

c The HDRO specifications refer to somewhat
modified definitions of deprivations in some
indicators compared to the 2010 specifications.
See Technical note 5 for details.

d Missing indicator on child mortality.

e The estimates based on national household
surveys that refer to different years are not
necessarily comparable. Caution should be used
in comparing estimates over time.

f Missing indicators on nutrition.

g Missing indicator on type of floor.

h Missing indicator on cooking fuel.

i Refers to only part of the country (nine provinces).

j Missing indicator on electricity.

k Missing indicator on school attendance.

DEFINITIONS

adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations.
See Technical note 5 for details on how the
Multidimensional Poverty Index is calculated.

Multidimensional poverty headcount: Population
with a weighted deprivation score of at least
33 percent.

Intensity of deprivation of multidimensional
poverty: Average percentage of deprivation
experienced by people in multidimensional poverty.

Population near multidimensional poverty:
Percentage of the population at risk of suffering
multiple deprivations—that is, those with a
deprivation score of 20–33 percent.

Multidimensional Poverty Index: Percentage
of the population that is multidimensionally poor

Population in severe multidimensional
poverty: Percentage of the population in severe

multidimensional poverty—that is, those with a
deprivation score of 50 percent or more.

Contribution of deprivation in dimension
to overall poverty: Percentage of the
Multidimensional Poverty Index attributed to
deprivation in each dimension.

MAIN DATA SOURCES

Column 1: Refers to the year and the survey whose
data were used to calculate the values in columns
2–10.

Columns 2–10: HDRO calculations based on data
on household deprivations in education, health and
living standards from various household surveys
listed in column 1 using the revised methodology
described in Technical note 5.

NOTES

a Because data are based on national definitions
of what constitutes a city or metropolitan area,
cross-country comparison should be made with
caution.

b The natural sex ratio at birth is commonly

assumed and empirically confirmed to be 1.05
male births to 1 female birth.

j

Includes Agalega, Rodrigues and Saint Brandon

k Includes Kosovo.

l

Includes Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

m Includes Nagorno-Karabakh.

n Includes Transnistria.

o Includes East Jerusalem.

p Includes Zanzibar.

c Projections based on medium-fertility variant.

T From original data source.

Total population: De facto population in a country,
area or region as of 1 July.

Population average annual growth: Average
annual exponential growth rate for the period
specified.

Urban population: De facto population living in
areas classified as urban according to the criteria
used by each country or area as of 1 July.

Population under age 5: De facto population in a
country, area or region under age 5 as of 1 July.

Population ages 15–64: De facto population in a
country, area or region ages 15–64 as of 1 July.

Population ages 65 and older: De facto
population in a country, area or region ages 65 and
older as of 1 July.

Median age: Age that divides the population
distribution into two equal parts—that is, 50 percent
of the population is above that age and 50 percent
is below it.

Young age dependency ratio: Ratio of the
population ages 0–14 to the population ages 15–64,

expressed as the number of dependants per 100
people of working age (ages 15–64).

Old age dependency ratio: Ratio of the population
ages 65 and older to the population ages 15–64,
expressed as the number of dependants per 100
people of working age (ages 15–64).

Total fertility rate: Number of children that would
be born to a woman if she were to live to the end
of her child-bearing years and bear children at each
age in accordance with prevailing age-specific
fertility rates.

Sex ratio at birth: Number of male births per
female birth.

NOTES
a Data refer to 2012 or the most recent year available.
b Data refer to the most recent year available

during the period specified.

c Includes nuclear energy.
d Less than 0.5.
e Refers to 2010.
f Refers to 2011.

DEFINITIONS

Fossil fuels: Percentage of total energy supply that
comes from natural resources formed from biomass in
the geological past (such as coal, oil and natural gas).

Renewable energy sources: Percentage of
total energy supply that comes from constantly
replenished natural processes, including solar,
wind, biomass, geothermal, hydropower and ocean
resources, and some waste. Excludes nuclear
energy, unless otherwise noted.

Electricfication rate: People with access to
electricity, expressed as a percentage of the total
population. It includes electricity sold commercially

(both on grid and off grid) and self-generated
electricity but excludes unauthorized connections.

Carbon dioxide emissions per capita: Human-
originated carbon dioxide emissions stemming
from the burning of fossil fuels, gas flaring and the
production of cement, divided by midyear population.
Includes carbon dioxide emitted by forest biomass
through depletion of forest areas.

Natural resource depletion: Monetary expression
of energy, mineral and forest depletion, expressed as
a percentage of gross national income (GNI).

Forest area: Land spanning more than 0.5 hectare
with trees taller than 5 metres and a canopy cover
of more than 10 percent or trees able to reach these
thresholds in situ. Excludes land predominantly
under agricultural or urban land use, tree stands in
agricultural production systems (for example, in fruit
plantations and agroforestry systems) and trees in
urban parks and gardens. Areas under reforestation
that have not yet reached but are expected to reach
a canopy cover of 10 percent and a tree height of
5 meters are included, as are temporarily unstocked
areas resulting from human intervention or natural
causes that are expected to regenerate.

Fresh water withdrawals: Total fresh water
withdrawn, expressed as a percentage of total
renewable water resources.

Deaths of children under age 5 due to outdoor
air pollution: Deaths of children under age 5 due
to respiratory infections and diseases, lung cancer
and selected cardiovascular diseases attributable to
outdoor air pollution.

Deaths of children under age 5 due to indoor
air pollution: Deaths of children of age under 5 due
to acute respiratory infections attributable to indoor
smoke from solid fuels.

Deaths of children under age 5 due to poor
water, sanitation or hygiene: Deaths of children
under age 5 due to diarrhoea attributable to unsafe
water, unimproved sanitation or poor hygiene.

immediate assistance during a period of emergency
as a result of a natural disaster, including displaced,
evacuated, homeless and injured people, expressed
per million people.

MAIN DATA SOURCES

Columns 1, 3–5, 7 and 8: World Bank (2015a).

Column 2: HDRO calculations based on data
on total primary energy supply from World Bank
(2015a).

Column 6: HDRO calculations based on data on
carbon dioxide emissions per capita from World
Bank (2015a).

Column 9: HDRO calculations based on data on
forest and total land area from World Bank (2015a).

Population living on degraded land: Percentage
of the population living on severely or very severely
degraded land. Land degradation estimates consider
biomass, soil health, water quantity and biodiversity.

Column 10: FAO (2015b). .

Columns 11–13: WHO (2015).

Column 14: FAO (2011).

Population affected by natural disasters:
Average annual number of people requiring

Column 15: CRED EM-DAT (2015) and UNDESA
(2013a).

NOTES

a Data refer to people recognized as refugees
under the 1951 UN Convention, the 1967 UN
Protocol and the 1969 Organization of African
Unity Convention. In the absence of government
figures, the Office of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) has estimated the refugee
population in many industrialized countries
based on 10 years of individual asylum-seeker
recognition.

b For more detailed comments on the estimates,

see www.internal-displacement.org.

c Data refer to the most recent year available

during the period specified.

d Refers to intimate partner violence only.

e Includes forms of emotional violence.

f For more detailed country notes, see www.
prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison_
population_rate.

g Refers to urban areas only.

h HDRO calculations based on data from ICPS (2014).

i Data differ from the standard definition or refer to

only part of a country.

j Data were updated on 6 October 2014 and
supersede data published in UNODC (2014).

k Refers to 1990.

DEFINITIONS

Exports and imports: The sum of exports and
imports of goods and services, expressed as a
percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). It is
a basic indicator of openness to foreign trade and
economic integration and indicates the dependence
of domestic producers on foreign demand (exports)
and of domestic consumers and producers on foreign
supply (imports), relative to the country’s economic
size (GDP).

Foreign direct investment, net inflows: Sum of
equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-
term capital and short-term capital, expressed as a
percentage of GDP.

Private capital flows: Net foreign direct
investment and portfolio investment, expressed as a
percentage of GDP.

Net official development assistance received:
Disbursements of loans made on concessional
terms (net of repayments of principal) and grants by
official agencies to promote economic development
and welfare in countries and territories on the
Development Assistance Committee list of aid

recipients, expressed as a percentage of the
recipient country’s GNI.

Remittances, inflows: Earnings and material
resources transferred by international migrants or
refugees to recipients in their country of origin or
countries in which the migrant formerly resided.

International inbound tourists: Arrivals of
nonresident visitors (overnight visitors, tourists,
same-day visitors and excursionists) at national
borders.

Internet users: People with access to the
worldwide network.

Net migration rate: Ratio of the difference
between the number of in-migrants and out-migrants
from a country to the average population, expressed
per 1,000 people.

Stock of immigrants: Ratio of the stock of
immigrants into a country, expressed as a percentage
of the country’s population. The definition of immigrant
varies across countries but generally includes the stock
of foreign-born people, the stock of foreign people
(according to citizenship) or a combination of the two.

International student mobility: Total number of
tertiary students from abroad (inbound students)
studying in a given country minus the number
of students at the same level of education from
that country studying abroad (outbound students),
expressed as a percentage of total tertiary
enrolment in that country.

Mobile phone subscriptions: Number of
subscriptions for the mobile phone service expressed
per 100 people.
