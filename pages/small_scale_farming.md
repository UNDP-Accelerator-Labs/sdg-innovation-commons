Am a scale farmer. Who is a seasonal farmer as I have no water on the farm. I also do some poultry farming and want to venture in piggery and build a small community school for the community children in Chongwe as am a teacher by profession and children are my passion. This year I want try soya farming as maize is Abit costly on fertilizer. Thank you

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Empowering people and the community at large. The school will enhance education while farming will bring about employment for the youth who are just spending most time in bars drinking and bringing about petty theft in the community. If am offered the prize I will drill a borehole to farm throughout the year and build my small school as well my piggery business.

My farm if not far from the main road hence transportation of commodities wouldn't be so much of a problem. I have a small car to easy transportation as well. I will be personally go into my school and educate the teachers on the importance and implantation of Early Childhood education.
