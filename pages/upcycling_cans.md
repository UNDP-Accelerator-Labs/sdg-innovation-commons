> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

I met Sabado in Mercadu Bandim, the biggest informal market in Bissau, as she was collecting old cans we started a conversation. Sabado collects the cans from the general waste laying around on the street. When she has collected enough cans she is heating them up and remoulds them into pots that she sells on the market.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

There is a need for job opportunities in Guinea-Bissau. Sabado creates her own job opportunity as she takes cans that people have thrown on the ground and process them into something valuable that she can sell so economically sustain herself and her family, an interesting example of up-cykling. At the same time she takes an action agains the lacking waste management system in Bissau, contributing to a cleaner environment.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Up-cykling has potential for women employment in Bissau.
