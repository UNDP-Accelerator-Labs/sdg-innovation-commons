## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1-  One of the main insights generated through the work of the AccLab with public institutions is that the use of innovative methodologies led to the Government of Iraq welcoming the UNDP  to induce structural change and ensure their buy-in.  2- One of the insights generated from developing the first of its kind “Business Development Manual'' incorporation with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research , GIZ and various partners in Iraq is that innovation is lacking within the Iraqi students mentality and the main reason for this limited innovation mindset is the lack of business innovative methodologies within the Iraqi education system. For this, the AccLab worked to embed innovation within Iraqi youth mentality as part of the formal education system in order to prepare them to be creative in the job market 3- One of the insights generated from Mapping Signals of Change within the Higher Education System in Iraq is that there is a lack of the use of innovative and digitalization tools within the Iraqi higher educational professionals which is impacting the students' learning. For this, the AccLab in Iraq worked with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research to produce Blended Learning Teaching Methods Curriculum that incorporates blended learning into designing and writing of the new teaching methods to build capacities and empower higher education professionals in 35 Iraqi public universities.  4- Through sensing and exploring the public innovation centers in Iraq, specifically Business Incubation Centers within the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, innovation centers need to use innovative methods to develop ideas of participants. For this the UNDP-AccLab worked with  Business Incubation Centers  to test the possibility of embedding Design Thinking in the ideation stage to support ideating for innovative local solutions.  5- One of the main insights generated through the work of the UNDP-AccLab with the local community is that there is a lack of connection and coherence within the ecosystem nationally and locally. For this, the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq started working to support connections within the ecosystem and establish a unified platform to connect the ecosystem and shed light on entrepreneurs and service providers that exist in the Mosul City and establish the Mosul entrepreneurial ecosystem platform, named Startup Bus.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

One of the main bottlenecks is the lack of a culture of building partnerships and working collaboratively within the system. The stakeholders within the ecosystem work individually and establish their own projects and programs. There is a need to establish a partnership culture within the ecosystem to ensure collaborative work. There is a lack of publicly sharing knowledge and insights within the ecosystem to learn from each others’ successes and failures. The amount of published sources about the ecosystem is minimal and there is a need to encourage the various stakeholders to speak out loud about their work, learning, and insights.  The legal framework for registering startups is complicated and lengthy in Iraq, hence this drives startups away from registration and is leading to a growing informal sector within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Startups operating within the informal sector are missing valuable partnership opportunities with various partners and forgoing valuable investment opportunities.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

 The use of various innovations in data types (Sensor and Sensor Network Data, Systems Mapping, and Collective Intelligence) led to the Government of Iraq welcoming the UNDP-Accelerator Lab to induce structural change to the higher education system in Iraq.  Sensor and Sensor Network Data: The UNDP-AccLab used Mapping Signals of Change approach, and Sensor and Sensor Network Data to explore events amid the COVID-19 pandemic within the higher education system in Iraq this led to mapping a strong positive signal, online learning and qualify its  implications for systematic impact.   System Mapping: Next the UNDP-AccLab in Iraq  mapped the higher education system in Iraq to understand synergies and find and analyze potential problems through issue-mapping, this happened in two stages during 2020 and 2021. Stage one of exploration during 2020 enabled us to understand the system through engaging all partners to analyse the interplay between the different issues and identify the critical points for intervention. Second stage was collecting and analyzing 19 Teaching Methods Curriculums from different Iraqi universities.  This was further enriched by performing qualitative interviews with nine various stakeholders, ranging from education professionals to students within the Iraqi learning ecosystem. The process allowed us to sense and explore attitudes and perceptions among key stakeholders, specifically about the capabilities, opportunities, and motivations to engage with blended learning.   Collective Intelligence : in the aim of  transforming our understanding into future-proof education solutions, the UNDP-AccLab us generated collective intelligence to explore how to embed online learning into the education system and drive change.  The innovative way to collect data led to designing, testing and producing The Blended Learning Teaching Methods Curriculum that will be used to support the education system in Iraq move to digitalization.  The use of various innovations in data types (Citizen Generated Data, Social Network Data , and Social Media Data ) led to establishing the first of its kind Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Platform, Business Bus, to support the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the newly liberated city of  Mosul.   Citizen Generated Data: the Acclab worked with Mosul Space Organization to gather the key-players of the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Mosul city from entrepreneurs, innovators, programmers, service providers, makerspaces, activists from local NGOs, and private sector representatives in one place in order to collect data about their needs and feeds it into creating the features of the platform to support the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Mosul city.  Social Network Data: The AccLab through its local partner  Mosul Space Organization utilized the social networks that exist in Mosul in order to identify the potential use of the platform and highlight the main objectives of the platform. Social Media Data: AccLab and Mosul Space Organization utilized the social media to collect 434 service providers and ecosystem enablers inside mosul city. These service providers and enablers will be added to the platform as main inputs. The various methods of data collection revealed that there is lack of synthesis between efforts in the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Mosul City,  there are many ideation and incubation programmes that support youth in the newly liberated areas, but there is less programmes focus on building networks and connections between them, there is lack of support in the field of market research in the newly liberated areas. For that the lab worked with Mosul Space organization to scale one of their local solutions called “Startups Bus Platform” to overcome the above context and to generate a new set of data to understand the current situation and design a market fit local solution. The use of various innovations in data type Google Analytic led to generating insights into the geographical distribution of COVID-19 in Iraq.  The UNDP Acclab team in Iraq used Google Analytics for the Corona in Iraq platform. The objective was to follow up and observe the user's behavior and journey within the platform, and to know which modules are most used by site visitors, as well as identifying the geographical spread of COVID19 .  The use of Perception Surveys led to supporting the UNDP-AccLab in collecting data about its endeavors within UNDP and with public partners and generating valuable insights.  During the Acclab work with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in Iraq, specifically from the Business Incubators centers, the team conducted a survey with 25 trainers to collect their opinions, notes, and suggestions about the possibility of including one of the local solutions in the ministry's programs. This survey launched after the Innovative methodologies testing workshop and resulted in three levels of interventions that could help to inject behavioral change to the entrepreneurs joining the training programs in the Business Incubation Centers, specifically to enrich the ideation stage. The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq performed a Collective Exercise on Mapping Signals of Change within the UNDP-CO in Iraq, after the exercise the AccLab launched a survey to collect data on the usefulness of Mapping Signals of Change methodology and to evaluate the usefulness of this methodology within the UNDP CO. This led to generating valuable insights regarding the emerging trends in 2021 as well as supporting UNDP-CO in Iraq in working to support the positive signals and prevent the harmful ones. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The UNDP AccLab and UNDP- YLP  in Iraq trained the YLP trainers form the YSOs  on how to design innovative and needs responsive training material using Design thinking, Systems thinking and Future Thinking the result led to an innovative design of YLP 7, by and for, local youth services organizations. More specifically, the UNDP-accLab in Iraq used Future Thinking methodology with the Community service Organizations (CSOs) and Youth service Organizations (YSOs) that are part of the UNDP-Youth Leadership Program.  The AccLab used this methodology to support the CSOs and YSOs in developing their  organizational skills and capabilities as well as support them in imagining the future of such projects and programs.  This package of innovative methodologies supported the YSOs to ideate three different innovative ideas that focused on the YLP itself through working together,  and also, they were ready to support the Iraqi young people and entrepreneurs to develop their ideas and projects.  In 2021, the UNDP Accelerator Lab Iraq mapped more than 50 local solutions in a portfolio approach to tackle the Youth and Unemployment Challenges in Iraq. The lab worked on the translation of ethnographic and field research findings into learning and action for the Accelerator Lab activities. Specifically, the lab tried to be an active participant in the local events, competitions, hackathons, and various activities by other local and international key-players in the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Iraq. The lab participation was as mentors in events, trainers, judges, facilitators, or even as observers to map the solutions and know the local market. The RBAS, UNDP Recovery Solution and Human Mobility in Crisis Bureau, For Tomorrow platform, and other UNDP projects showed their interest in Iraq’s local solutions and as a result most of them got funds and others got technical support to scale them up on another level. The behavioral insights methodology was used with the Business Incubator Centers in the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in order to study ways to influence the behavior of entrepreneurs participating in Incubation Center training coming up with innovative business ideas. The UNDP Acclab used User Journey Mapping, TEST Module, and BIT Card to identify the specific barriers.  One of the barriers discovered is that the training structure within the centers don’t include specific sections on developing ideas, and  focus mainly on the business plan. For this, the UNDP AccLab designed the local solution that depends on using Human Centered Approach  and Future Thinking and tested them  with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.  The UNDP AccLab in Iraq worked on Startup bus Platform with Mosul Space Organization,  Its prototype is being developed by using Participatory Design Approach. The UNDP Accelerator Lab conducted one workshop and three prototyping sessions with more than 20 Iraqi youth from several stakeholders, sectors, and beneficiaries. Using this approach led to developing a prototype that speaks to the needs of the local community and that is human-centered to their experiences.      The UNDP-AccLab in Iraq used the Mapping Signals of Change approach within the UNDP CO Office in Iraq through starting the “Mapping Signals of Change Collaborative Exercise” . It is an initiative targeted to further incorporate the use of innovative methods in the work of UNDP Iraq Office. The UNDP Iraq Country Office has been in the front lines of introducing projects and programs that meet society needs and accelerate development. In order to add another innovative layer to UNDP Iraq Country Office to structure programs that meet both current and future needs of the Iraqi community; the UNDP-Acc Lab in Iraq incorporated Mapping Signals of Change to support the implementation process of CPD document, programs, projects, activities of UNDP Iraq Country Office. The two months exercise led to identifying major signals post COVID-19 and some of the signals were taken by the UNDP CO to work on them.
