> Brief description of the innovation

AUTOMATIC WATER CONTROLLER
This is a control circuit that has been built to manage, protect and control the supply of water. This can be mounted onto a power supply and incorporated with a submersible pump or booster pump.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Water is a resource that is a a necessity to every sector of an economy, every office, industry, house hold, learning premises, health premises etc are all reliant on water. This proves the viability of this control system. On a daily basis boreholes are being sank on a large scale, not only boreholes but also this Controller can also be used in the industry on just any motor based machines

> Technical Feasibility

This Automatic Water Controller is assembled in a box 250mm X 300mm X 200mm. Incorporated in the control box are; miniature circuit breaker (MCB), contactor, overload, on button, off button, on indicator light, off indicator light and over load trip light. These are assembled together to for a circuit called Direct On Line circuit (DOL).
 This principle offers a smooth transition of any motor from zero speed to maximum speeds. There exist a prototype of this controller. But its not automated as the Automatic Water Controller

> Anticipated Social Impact

The advantages of this circuit are that
-Once installed, this controller will operate itself thereby doing the job a human figure should be doing to switch on and off the water system. Which is forgetful sometimes people may forget to switch on water and this may result in a water interruption. The case is similar when one forgets to switch of when water is full in the tank or when its not needed, it may result in an overflow of water or spillages including damaging of pumps and motor
- It will protect the pump or connected motor from surge and over loads thus prolonging lifespan
- It is time saving as it operates itself
- Facilitates a constant supply of water. No interruption are expected once installed
