> Title of the innovation

KiP Agrotech

> Brief description of the innovation

The main objective of the Project is providing Local Small scales Farmers with information a d cheap genuine machinary.
This machinary will help increase productivity at the lowest possible rates, for example: access to small affordable equipment like Maize Shellers (motorized).
This project aims at importing such equipment from abroad resold to local farmers at affordable prices and payment plans.
This innovative movement will have to create and organize seminars for the local farmers and other interested participants from the community. These siminars will provide exposure on how to maintain their machinary, how to light up their properties, how to setup DIY projects, technology and how it can help them improve and expand their business' produce and out puts.
In simple terms we can improve the levels of production.
Other possible products are Egg incubators, toothpick machine and maybe in near future match stick products, water irrigation, etc.
These DIY projects will in the long run in turn increase revenue and jobs in the community.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

To generate income for our group depends entirely on the sell of Imported Agro Equipment to small scale farmers at Fair reasonable prices as well as organize local workshops that will target entrepreneurs and local farmers and teach on how to run their business at minimum costs and maximum profit.
Other than that We shall stock small moving Agro related retail and wholesale products, hand tractors, solar energy solutions, seeds, livestock and it's birelated products.
This is project is very achievable as long as management is firm and focus on how to implement tasks. This is where the challenge will be every helpful to us, as this is project needs a handful logistics protocols that call for funds.
A grant to this project will be highly appreciated by us and our future youthful employees and employers.
In as much as this is a profit aligned form of business, we like to emphasize that our main goal is to provide locals employment and employment creation.
The idea is to PASS ON THE OPPORTUNITY to the next person willing to build the community.
This is the only way we can empower ourselves.

> Technical Feasibility

KiProjects looks to provide and educate the community at large with diverse innovations and projects especially among the youths.
For this Particular idea we interested in Agro related import and export.
We dream of a time when Zambian local small scale farmers may to feed SADC but first we have to work. 
We have to level up our quality to compete with the international traders. 
We shall import easy to use affordable &amp; credible products from established international businesses. 
As for the Prototype, we don't have any of these products at hand but are readily available as soon as we have enough capital, we shall import a number of diverse products and make them readily available for the locals. 
Not all equipment or product are for sale, other equipment will be meant for our group to use for small returns so as to sustain the business. 
Let's say we import machinery to make toothpicks and sell them  with the youths we shall work together. We would have killed  several birds with half a stone. 
PS: we don't support animal cruelty. 
Our group of youths will have both the skill and job. 
We want innovative, youthful, progressive communities with jobs.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This project indirectly impacts the Youths mental stress health and financial status.
Many youths have nothing to do others keep going through bad circumstances because they have no job or skill or money to get educated. 
If we run an assembly point for machinery that we are importing today, tomorrow our youths will have many skills to learn and exploy and implement it in their own backyard.
We want a community that will sit, eat and share ideas for the younger generation to come.
This way we shall pass on the opportunity to next of kin faster. Education is key.
This movement is going to better save the small farmers with world class equipment and knowledge. With tsthey maybe able to compete with international and local commercial farmers.
This alone can help the Zambian market send a strong message out there.
