## Title

Rural Economic Inclusion
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to ensure sustainability of the rural e-commerce system by empowering communities with necessary skills, resources and networks.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In response to COVID-19 in 2020, UNDP with UNCDF piloted a e-commerce system in rural areas to help rural producers access wider market and re-gain loss revenues due to movement control order. The Malaysian Government have initiated many initiatives on digital economy and internet connectivity over the past few years, targeting rural communities. However, the progress is often slow and met with lack of interest and resources by the community in adopting a digital way of trading. Digital infrastructure and literacy are main drivers that are impeding the participation of rural communities, along with technophobia and lack of trust with the current digital systems. As a result, the inequality in accessing economic opportunities, in education, health, information and governance are evident and exacerbated by COVID-19.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

Despite the promise of the digital economy, poor connectivity remains a challenge on the ground, especially in rural areas. The urban-rural divide in internet use is significant, 71% of the urban population uses the internet compared to 55% in rural areas. In rural states such as Kelantan and Terengganu, only 31% and 36% of business establishments have internet connections.

Conversation with our community partners and local representatives have demonstrated the challenge for rural communities to sell produces in their usual physical markets and struggles to purchase essentials due to depleting savings. Newspapers have highlighted the challenges of communities accessing the nearest banks and information in receiving social assistance and grants for business recovery. This was further verified by a feasibility study conducted with over 500 households in the villages.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

There are current livelihood projects under the Orang Asal Micro Grant Facility projects to support rural communities. However, the initiatives that are led by CSOs are in need of support in adopting latest technology, in understanding the market needs, social media marketing, prodcuts diversification and understanding the current value chain and enablers of a rural e-commerce ecosystem. AccLab brings in expertise from various private sector and sister agencies to test out suitable technological idea eg. e-commerce platforms with low internet connectivity, supported mapping of value chain to identify key challenges and enablers, use behavioral insights to improve media engagement, encourage co-creation, bottom up approaches that creates community ownership and facilitates sustainable private sector partnership beyond one-off CSR.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Sustainable rural e-commerce made possible. Learn from our experience in leveraging local capacity and value chain for rural community to build back better in social and economic aspects from the effects of COVID-19.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we ensure sustainability of the rural e-commerce model?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

1. Community (Asset) Mapping allowed us to mobilize resources immediately and in a sustainable manner under Movement Control Order. It also creates ownership from community. 2. Co-creation allowed us to tailor solutions to local customer and prodcuers' needs, interest and capacity with lower risk of failure and allow for grassroot solutions. 3. Pilot allowed us to test out a system and new value chain and elarn fast from it to be scaled up and expanded to other communities. 4. Participatory design allowed for capacity buidling of local coordinators and producers (especially women) to maximize their talent, skills and experiences and create more ownership and sustainability of the system. 5. Collective intelligence allowed for multiple stakeholders from private sectors and locals to contribute solutions that can be tested out in the pilot and offered capacity building in different areas eg. delivery, e-commerce management, graphic design, marketing, photography etc.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Data on the challenges, opportunities and the alternative value chain system for rural communities in adopting the digital economy. Data on how women entrepreneurs and producers can play a key part in the value chain and the challenges they experience is also new data that are lacking in general for rural communities.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

1. The Economic Development Unit from Federal and State will benefit from growing the pilot as they understand the challenges and solutions that work for rural communities, both in social protection and economic recovery aspects. This will help them implement their digital economy blueprint better as well. 2. Sabah state government and Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation can grow this rural e-commerce model to other communities by providing the right incentives and motivation for communities to adopt digital eocnomy and use a bottom-up, co-creation approach. 3. Ministry of Women and Family and Community Development will alos benefit from how women entrepreneurs in rural community can be empowered and the support required for them to thrive. 4. Private sectors and embassies have so far reached out to us to support in growing the initiative further in relation to women, youth and economic empowerment for the furthest left behind. 5. Ministry of communication and multimedia and Telco are able to learn from how internet connectivity, infrastructure should be set up, maintained and provided in a way that will benefit the rural community while penertrating new markets.
