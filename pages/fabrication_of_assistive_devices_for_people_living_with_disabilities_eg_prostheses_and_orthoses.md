> Brief description of the innovation

This is an Ortho-Prosthesis used by patients who have Femoral Focal Deficiency Deformity.This assistive device is one of the many Prostheses I custom make with the specifications of the patient.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This noble innovation will generate a lot of income because it helps people living with disabilities to be independent and be productive in life. Infections, Trauma,Snake bites and other disease cause unforeseen amputations and people disparately need these devices.

> Technical Feasibility

This noble innovation will generate a lot of income because it helps people living with disabilities to be independent and be productive in life. Infections, Trauma,Snake bites and other disease cause unforeseen amputations and people disparately need these devices.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Lives of Amputees and people with deformities like scoliosis can be improved because it will remove the dependence to other people to help carry them (Amputees )when need be.In short these people will be independent and be productive in their lives
