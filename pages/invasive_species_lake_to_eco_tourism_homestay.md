To sustain the biodiversity and natural resources for livelihood, local communities have put in close to 15 years continuous effort to fight invasive plants (Salvinia - the yellowish plants in the pic) from taking over their lake. Various methods and innovations were unearthed along the way, from waterweed harvesters, chemical application, to biocontrol (moth, grasshopper, tiny weevil) . Miso Walai Homestay and Campsites were also build to promote ecotourism that generates income for the community. River cruise, wildlife watch and tree planting activities are among other relaxing nature activities tourists get to enjoy.
