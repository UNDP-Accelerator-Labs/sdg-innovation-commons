The community of Bureta on the island of Ovalau hosted the launch of the "Fiji-Korea Agrivoltaic" program.  This project aims to overcome barriers of financing, technical capacity, and limited availability of land by supporting an innovative technology that combines photovoltaic power generation and agricultural production. A key feature of this initiative is the way it will provide technical assistance to strengthen the capacity of local communities while also establishing a climate project financing facility within FDB.
