The Sugar Beans Commercial Production Project

> Brief description of the innovation

Project Summary:
The Nac- City Empire Enterprise envisions launching and implementing a sugar beans production project which will include a few supplementary enterprises packaged to fit with a sustainable (conservation farming practices) farming system. The sugar beans will be the main farm product and supported by supplementary products from both crops and livestock enterprises. Suitable crops will be carefully selected with the help of the Ministry of Agriculture for a well scheduled rotation practice. The products of the rotational crops will, apart from preserving the soil, be sold to add up to the proceeds of the beans. Secondly small livestock such as chickens, goats and pigs will be reared on the farm firstly for manure and consumption, and secondly for sale to add up to the total farm income.
Besides the profits that will be earned from all the farm enterprises, the farm will also provide employment for both professionally qualified and unqualified youths (male or female but out of school) as technical staff as well as general workers in the various enterprises. Gender, Child and Human rights awareness and application will be a cross cutting issue which will be included in all programs and activities

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Approach/ Strategy:
The project seeks to establish long lasting formal and informal employment opportunities for youths and women. The project will be carefully planned to follow a logical step by step approach to build a strong foundation that will ensure sustainability. The planning process will include all key stake holders to ensure that they are all kept abreast of the vision and the strategy to achieve it. Key stakeholders will include government line ministries, the civil society, the potential markets, the communities in the locality of the project, competitor sand the potential employees (college and university representatives for students and lecturers. As a guide to the process as a guide to the process, the following key milestone will be used of indicators of achievement:-
Stakeholder mapping exercise: This exercise will be conducted to basically gain a deeper understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and potential threats of the stakeholders as listed above.
Common Understanding (CUM) &amp; Planning Meeting: The mapping exercise at this point will have revealed the relevant stakeholders and these will participate in the CUM meeting. In the CUM meeting, the stake holders will be, through a highly participatory approach, made to:- 
Understand the vision, the goal and the time frame of the project.
Suggest a logical and viable path to achieving the vision and the goal of the project
Identify the key and feasible activities that will ensure the achievement of the vision and the goal. 
Identify the key resources that will be required for the success of the project at each phase.
Plan the timing of the activities.
Determine and attach estimated costs to each activity (budgeting) for each phase of the project.
Identify the potential markets and marketing strategies and proceeds from the sales of the products.
Draft a risk plan/ register for the project.
Share the activities basing on their strengths and opportunities.
From all the above discussions, a sustainability plan will be drawn.
Come up with a logical framework which will be used to monitor the projects progression process.
Form a mixed monitoring team.
Finally the company will upon funding start coordinating the implementation process of the project. However, the budget for the start-up capital will be given upon request.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Target Areas &amp; Social Benefits:
The project intends to be situated in region II or III rainfall areas (Copper belt, Central, Muchinga, Northern and Luapula Provinces). These areas have a medium to high rainfall ranges. This rainfall pattern will help in reducing pressure on the natural or man-made water sources for production because rainfall water can also be harvested for use in the dry season. It is in these areas where beans is easily grown and huge tracts of virgin and fertile soils still lie untempered with.
The primary beneficiaries of the project are the company itself, the employees, the surrounding communities and the Zambian citizens in general. The secondary beneficiaries targeted are populations beyond the Zambian boundaries. The benefits will be three fold vis a vis formal employment for youths; informal employment for traders especially women; high protein food for consumers.
