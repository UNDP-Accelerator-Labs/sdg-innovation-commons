> Brief description of the innovation

This charcoal stove reduces charcoal consumption. it is referred to as a stove due to its ability to perform all functions of an electric stove.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation helps tackle climate change by reducing on charcoal consumption. The target market is the ordinary household.

> Technical Feasibility

the innovation is easy to manufacture with a pre-existing prototype. the current customer base shows satisfaction with the product.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation can create employment among youths. Most current households have maintained the use of traditional braziers for meal preparation. The ordinary brazier consumes charcoal at a high rate and gives no control to the end user in terms of cooking conditions. With this innovation, the end-user is capable if controlling heat output, bake, cook, grill, smoke and other functions including simmering of food. The reduced charcoal consumption also saves money for the end user and can last for two years and more.
