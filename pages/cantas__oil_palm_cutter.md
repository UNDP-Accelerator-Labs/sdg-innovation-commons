The Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) has developed a motorised cutter popularly known as CantasTM for harvesting fresh fruit bunches (FFB) at less than 4.5m in height. CantasTM is a hand-held cutter powered by a 1.3hp petrol engine. Trials carried out on CantasTM revealed that the productivity of the machine was 560 to 750 bunches per day (equivalent to 9.50 to 12.6 t day-1 at a bunch weight of 17kg). The productivity very much depends on the cropping level, the topography of the estate and the operator's skills.
