> Title of the innovation

Bookkeeper Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Bookkeeper Zambia is a widely adopted, frequently used SME Point of Sale solution that integrates with the Zambia Revenue Tax Invoice Management System. Bookkeeper Zambia bridges the information gap between issued invoices and declared tax invoices by SMEs thereby harmonizing relations between ZRA and SME taxpayers and encourages voluntary tax compliance by SMEs.

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) has implemented the Tax Invoice Management System (TIMS) through the Electronic Fiscal Devices (EFD) which makes it mandatory for taxpayers registered for Value Added Tax (VAT), Tourism Levy and Insurance Premium Levy to procure, install and use an EFD to capture all business transactions. The legal provision for this requirement is Section 42A of
the Value Added Tax Act CAP 331 of the Laws of Zambia. As Bookkeeper Zambia we are offering EFD device rentals to make it affordable for SMEs to comply with the new law. Our revenue model is built on device rentals and software subscriptions. We are targeting MSMEs and SMEs that are registered for Turn Over Tax which is the next band of taxpayers that ZRA is scheduled to bring on board the TIMS. MSMEs and SMEs comprise the largest taxpayer bracket in terms of quantity with over 1 million registered SMEs in 2019 (ZRA). Prize money shall be used to procure smart hand-held point of sale devices from China, we already have a fully working software.

> Technical Feasibility

Bookkeeper Zambia has been built off an existing source code, Bookkeeper app developed in India. Bookkeeper Zambia app has been modified in order to meet with local tax laws under Tax Act Cap 331 which requires that all accounting software packages send tax invoice information in real-time to the ZRA Tax Invoice Management System. We currently have an android and windows version of the app which have been deployed to a handful of early adopters based on the Copperbelt. We plan on deploying more devices on monthly rentals and hire-purchase to a wider network of SMEs spread across the country beginning in January 2022 as we anticipate that ZRA will further extend Cap 331 to include taxpayers registered for Turn Over Tax.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Bookkeeper Zambia will help SMEs manage their cash-flows wisely whilst voluntarily complying with local taxes, thereby increasing the tax base for ZRA as well ensuring business success for local SMEs.
