Mastercard, ygap Pacific Islands & Fintech Pacific partnered with the Australian government and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through the #DFATbpp - digital payment platform Dua Pay was piloted with women market vendors in Vuda, Lautoka in Fiji. The payment solution was in action where SMEs like BLISS FIJI Candle Maker and Marama Niu had accepted card and smartphone payments for their products - candles, lipsticks, ice creams, and coconut products. The aforementioned businesses were among the first cohort of women-owned businesses to trial the new payment platform (a system designed specifically to meet the needs of women-led small businesses). Dua Pay offers business owners an easily accessible, convenient, simple, and secure way to accept payments by smart phone, or credit and debit card, so they don't miss out on cashless customers.
