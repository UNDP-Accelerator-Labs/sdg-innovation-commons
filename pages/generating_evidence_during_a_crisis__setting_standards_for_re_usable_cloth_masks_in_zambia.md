> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Following the outbreak of the coronavirus (SARS-02 or COVID-19) disease, there has been an increased need for wearing masks as a key intervention in the spread of the disease. The basic principle in wearing the masks is to prevent transmission of the virus through droplets released during the normal respiratory process, laughing, coughing, or sneezing. Clothing material is commonly used to make a homemade mask. The properties of fabrics are intended to meet a variety of requirements for the primary purposes that they are manufactured for. The porosity or fabric mesh of the fabric is one key characteristic of interest in assessing the suitability of the fabric used as a face mask. It will partly determine the ability of the cloth to prevent particles of a specific size to pass through. The typical parameters used to assess the performance of materials used in facemask are the filtration efficiency and breathability.

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

The main objective of the tests was to assess the suitability of fabrics for use in making facemasks.  The specific objectives of the tests were as follows: (a)  To assess the extent to which the selected clothing materials are able to prevent particles of a specified size passing through the fabric.  (b)  Determine the ease with which air is able to pass through the fabric materials (c)   To assess the effect of washing and heat treatment (ironing) on (a) and (b).

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We wanted to learn if we could develop a standard for cloth masks using local materials by assessing the performance of 7 commonly used materials in facemask production against the following parameters: filtration efficiency and breathability, in comparison the standard surgical mask.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the efficacy of local fabrics are tested in comparsion to sugical masks then a standard can be dveeloped to guide the production of effective cloth masks as an alternative to surgical masks

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely
- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The testing procedures used were non – standard procedures adapted to provide sufficient data to inform on the filtration efficiency and breathability of the masks. Experiments were carried out on 7 selected materials purchased from local shops. Charcoal as a visual standard was also sourced from a commercial outlet.   Testing for filtration efficiency (Particle retention) A predetermined amount of powder comprising 38-micron particles was measured and placed on a 30 cm x 30 cm cloth test sample. The material and the powder were placed on the receiving pot of the sieving apparatus and shaken for 20 minutes at room temperature and pressure and 80% humidity. The amount of powder that passed through the fabric was measured to quantify the amount that had been retained on the cloth. Three samples of each material were tested and the average values determined. Air permeation – pressure drop measures An experimental setup was constructed that would enable the determination of the change in air pressure after the air had passed through the material at 1 bar. Circular pieces of material measuring 30 cm were cut from each of the fabrics. The sample material was placed on the sample hold on the test device, the pressure was allowed to equilibrate at 1 bar and the change in pressure after the air has gone through the material recorded.     Fabric Integrity/reusability   The integrity of the fabric material following washing as a means of disinfection will evaluate by subjecting the fabric material to mechanical hand washing using common detergents and alcohol-based solutions. The effect of heat will also be evaluated. The fabric materials after the different treatments will be assessed to determine particle retention and breathability Single Layer Vs Double Layer   The fabrics were subjected to testing around the same parameters for single and double layering of the fabrics. Materials Tested 1.     Java Wax Chitenge Material 2.     Cotton 200 tread count 3.     Egyptian cotton 4.     Cotton180 thread count 5.     Wax Poly Cotton Chitenge Material 6.     Wax Cotton Chitenge Material 7.      Telela Chitenge material

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

Seven different fabric materials were evaluated to determine the extent to which particles that are 38 microns can be prevented from passing through. The results presented, therefore, allow comparison of the relative effectiveness of the materials in stopping the passage of particles of the specified size. Modelled against the droplet of about 38 and more microns, the fabrics evaluated can provide a barrier that reduces the risk of transmission of respiratory infections. When the fabrics were examined as two layers, the performance is greatly enhanced (threshold of 50% and more) compared to one layer. It should, however, be noted that pre-conditioning and post-treatment such as washing may affect the characteristics of the fabrics as manifested in the Java fabric. The breathability provides information on the comfort the user may experience with the mask. Fabrics with large pressure drops (ability to resist air passing through) will generally need the wearer to put in more effort in breathing, especially for a tight-fitting mask. The great effort in breathing out could lead to negative pressure resulting in leakages and ultimate danger of the wearer releasing droplets into the air hence posing a danger for increased infection. A material with a pressure drops that is closer to the reference material is more likely to give better breathing comfort. Notwithstanding these investigations, it is advisable that the intended use of fabric not originally meant for breathing system filters as stipulated under ISO 23328-1:2003 (en) conditions to qualify filters must be used with other guidelines. This will ensure increased safety and reduced risk of transmission of viral particles in any of the droplet sizes.

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The following recommendations are made in line with the results obtained from the study. 

(1) It is recommended that facemask be made of cotton materials that are of 200 or 180 thread count. 

(2) It advisable that the facemask is made using two layers of cloth to increase their efficacy. 

(3) A combination of different types of cloth material may be used to achieve both high levels of efficacy as well as comfort in breathing. 

(4) Due care must be taken in choosing the cloth material avoiding materials that may change characteristics after washing such as those containing wax. 

(5) It recommended that further tests be carried out: (i) Evaluate the efficacy over a period of time through successive washing. (ii) Assess the filtration efficiency and breathability using particles that are smaller. (iii)  Explore the use of alternatives and new material that are purposefully identified or developed to provide a high level of protection against exposure.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Access to appropriate machinery to carry out standard tests in a crisis setting.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Programs supporting the production and distribution of masks. All Requests for masks in the country office was based on the results of the study.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Programs supporting the production and distribution of masks. Following the dissemination of results, other UN agencies and CSOs used the recommended specifications for masks based on the study.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, it did, however the second iteration was not carried out. The second iteration aimed to (a) To test the performance of recommended double-layer materials on filtration efficiency and breathability (b) To test fabric combinations to understand the effect on the performance of the fabrics (c) To test the performance of recommended double-layer materials against smaller particles in the range of 1- 10 microns (d) To test the fabric performance of recommended materials in terms of interaction with liquids

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Due to unavailability of equipment the University was able to improvise and simulate similar tests to establish the efficacy of the chitenge cloth masks. However further recommendation were presented on the next iteration (see question directly above) testing and I would recommend also adding a user feedback exercise with a significant number of end users.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

No, its was really specific to the COVID 19 response

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The experiment was informed very much from the sensing and requests from partners for standards on the production of masks. I would say therefore that it was very much informed by the Sensing using different methods and partnerships for scale were developed through exploration.
