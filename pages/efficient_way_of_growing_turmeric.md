> Title of the innovation

Efficient way of growing Turmeric

> Brief description of the innovation

The aim is to harvest more Turmeric by growing Tumeric in a growing media that's very loose and can hold enough water and nutrients to support the plant.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The reason for this is to increase the yield per hectare. This will result in food security, less labour, less land degradation, good economic benefits, etc

> Technical Feasibility

The growing media is mostly composed of 1 part sand loam soil, 2 parts solid organic matter (SOM). The experiment was conducted in my backyard garden and it was successful (see uploaded figure). Small scale Farmers can also intercrop Turmeric with other crops this will reduce pest occurrence and will greatly reduce pesticides use.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Introducing this way of growing Turmeric to small scale farmers will be a big impact to the farmer their community and the nation. The reduction in the use of pesticides. Selling Turmeric will mean more income to the farmer. Most small scale farmers can't afford pesticides hence this will be a better way of pest control.
