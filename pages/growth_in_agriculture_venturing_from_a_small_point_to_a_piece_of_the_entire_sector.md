> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will begin as a venture into poultry farming , in the rearing of chickens . When the chickens reach a point of sale or laying , I as the innovator will be able to create revenue for myself by the selling of the product . 
   I'll later on expand the capital after a number of sales and produce more . In doing so I'll hire a worker to take care of the chickens as I overlook everything , hence creating jobs for others.
   As the profit increases with time I'll be able to expand further and employ more people . With the same increase in revenue as well as profit , I will be able to venture into another form of agriculture ; whether rearing of another animal or investing in crop farming .
   With the expansion into crop farming I'll be able to increase my employee work force as the resources allow . With crop farming in place I can use the waste products of the chickens as fertilizer to reduce on the cost of actually buying fertilizer .
  This venture would help the prices of the various commodities to reduce in the market as the supply increases . This helps the products to be more affordable to various customers out in the community .
