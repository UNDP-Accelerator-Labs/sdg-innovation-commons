## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Daniela Lima



> On date (Day/Month/Year)

04/01/24



> What action learning plan is this activity related to?

No Action Plan associated


## 
****
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

This activity was developed to establish foundations for increased collaboration and complementarity between UN Agencies in Gender Equality programming.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If UN Agencies can discuss about their activities regarding gender equality and women's empowerment, in a structured and strategic way, they will be able to extract insights to develop a joint action plan and establish complementary partnerships.



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

A one day Sensemaking workshop was organized with Gender focal points for each resident UN Agency (11 Agencies), followed by intelligence sessions with a smallest group from the UN Gender Working Group to discuss the insights and create the final intelligence report.



> If you worked with partners, please choose what sector they belong to (select all that apply)

- United Nations

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The hypothesis was proven, insights generated were used to establish new complementary partnerships and develop a Gender Working Group Action Plan.



> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

The experiment helped to extract 6 emerging insights to support strategic action: 

Need to prioritize gender-related vulnerable groups in GEWE projects and interventions (LGBTQI+, AGYW) and intersections (PwD, rural communities, PLHIV, etc.)

Need for more data and information sharing for enhanced collaboration and joint planning;

Need for tailored program to promote women's economic empowerment.

Need to re-think gender and LGBTQI+ capacity building (Gov, CSO's, UN...)

Need to re-think existing funding models and efforts to achieve global access to justice and rights.

Need to measure the effects of the gender-sensitive impacts of climate change on poor rural populations, women and young people

The Sensemaking exercise allowed to explore insights and identify gaps and  opportunities for synergies and increased knowledge about the work developed.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

One of the main obstacles was encouraging sharing outside of the project mindset, including human interest stories and narratives to be able to extract hidden insights. The second obstacle was in the development of intelligence phase for which it is encouraged to envolve a smaller strategic group instead of the entire working group and focus on analyzing the data and information extracted during the sensemaking workshop. For additional deep dives into the data from each agency, a separate work can be developed.
