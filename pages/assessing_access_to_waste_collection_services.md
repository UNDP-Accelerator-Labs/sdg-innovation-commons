## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We are interested in improving

waste management. The main proposal to achieve this consists of promoting

separation of waste in within the households. However, an important assumption

is that to request people separate waste in their house assumes that people

have access to a waste collection service. There will be little benefit in

burning organic and inorganic waste separately over burning it together. We

want to evaluate the assumption of whether people have access to waste collection

and see if there is open data available to test it.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we use open data and software, then we will be able to assess the assumption that people have access to waste collection before investing disproportionate resources in promoting separation at home. 



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We will look at available open data that will be processed using open source software. We will identify the relevant questions in the questionnaires to see if we can identify the distribution of access to waste collection services and the drivers of lack of access to waste collection services. 



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Individual respondents 



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Face to face interviews 



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

One week



> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

We needed time and skills, as well as access to internet connection and a computer. We used the open software R and downloaded open data from the LAPOP project. 


## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

It was proven, we were able to use the open data. However the resulting assumption was not supported. 



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

If we want to keep costs low using open data from third parties, there is little more than we can do. However, we could be more rigorous in the data processing process, trying to test results using the sampling framework and a more sophisticated statistical test. However, that might be an overkill for a quick verification that is not necessarily for publishing in an academic journal. 



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Less than one month. 



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

US$0.00



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We presented the results and encouraged

capacity building to make use of this data 



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We need to scale within the country office the use of open data and open software. 



> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment influenced public policy at a national or local level
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We know that it is not difficult, given the time and skills, to test assumptions using open data with only access to internet and a computer. Also, the assumption tested provides evidence that there are limitations in strategies to improve waste management that target the separation of waste within the household given that people in conditions of vulnerability do not have access to waste collection services. Therefore, appealing to the personal responsibility of separating waste in the house is not considering the reality of most people who have to find alternative means to dispose their waste. 



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The main obstacles in this activity is creating the space to discuss the results and implement the actionable learnings and recommendations. People recognize that open data is valuable and has potential, but is looking for external resources to provide them with the insights. Also, a tricky part in using the software might be loading the data from a format in SPSS into R. 



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All the programmatic areas, and even operations, can benefit from increasing the capacity to use open data.



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

In this case, the Ministry of Environment and Natural

Resources and Local Governments, who are responsible for implementing actions

to improve waste management. 



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

The code used needed some iterations, also, loading the data needed some fiddling. 



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Give it a try. Reach out if you'd like to replicate the code. Be aware that people are afraid that they are not able to use this type of resources. 



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Absolutely, there is open data on many topics now days. 



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Sense has defined the topic area. 



> What surprised you?

It surprises me that the need of doing more with the data is not enough to encourage developing the capacity to use it. Also, that even if there is evidence that an assumption does not hold, there may not be enough flexibility in a project to change its course of action given the commitments linked with the use of resources.
