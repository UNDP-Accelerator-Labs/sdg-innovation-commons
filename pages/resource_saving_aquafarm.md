Mr Azizul Julirin come up with the brilliant idea of creating an aquafarm. Designed to incorporate two functions in one system, the Kundasang Aquafarm takes the form of aquaculture by rearing fish and hydroponics, where vegetables are planted without the use of soil in an enclosed area. What is needed is just an area of any size and some water from the surrounding areas, and you’re good to go. The aquafarm is sustainable and ensures that the environment is not harmed. For instance, waste from the fish is used as nutrients for the vegetable plantations, instead of chemicals. In addition, space is used creatively as vertical planting is also practiced in his aquafarm.  Instead of continuously clearing large areas of land, his soilless invention to grow vegetables does the trick and comes in handy. This method requires less time and labour to increase yield. This will ensure all those involved earn a better living while being eco-friendly.   The Kundasang Aquafarm helps communities in rural and urban areas. The farm is also open to anyone who wants to learn and start her own farm.
