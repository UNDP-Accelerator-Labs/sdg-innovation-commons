## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Mapping responses and popular solutions to an energy crisis in Nigeria Q1, 2022. 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is an energy crisis occurring at a time of when many businesses and homes face great economic challenges due to slow economic growth, high unemployment and high inflation rates. The costs of running alternative backup power systems have increased sharply, where they are available. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Just over half of Nigeria's population is covered by the power grid. Power supply to the areas covered is not constant and most homes and businesses run fossil-fuel powered generating sets to meet their power needs. Between January and March, 2022 the national power grid has collapsed completely several times and power supply to covered areas has been significantly impaired. The price of diesel has risen sharply in the past three months, doubling in less than 6 months and there are frequent, prolonged shortages of petrol due to supply chain disruptions, as petrol is imported. The power shortages have impacted productivity as many businesses are reducing work hours to conserve fuel supplies and people spend more time queuing for fuel. Small and medium scale enterprises and the manufacturing sector are especially impacted. This situation has further increased economic hardship as transportation costs have increased. People using public transport also often have more difficulty finding transportation. In addition, goods and basic commodities are transported by road on fossil-fuel powered trucks. The increased haulage costs are being passed on to consumers, worsening inflationary trends. The costs of running households have increased as cooling, food storage and artificial lighting costs increase. The supply of social services especially healthcare are also being disrupted as patients often have to pay for alternative power arrangements when there are disruptions to power during critical processes. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This is a developing crisis which the Lab is able to quickly respond to as it emerges. It is worth investing resources to this challenge, because this situation is increasing hardship. If we understand what solutions work in this scenario we can support their scale-up, which would increase access to energy, productivity and reduce hardship.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are mapping and making sense of practical and scalable solutions to the current energy crisis.
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.

Hardware Garage is a specialised incubator that supports innovators engaged in hardware fabrication. They started out as a group of innovators who decided to support other startups when they realised there was minimal experienced support in that area. The Lab will leverage their expertise and contacts in the renewable energy space to gain insights into the potential of this ecosystem.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the popular, practical, scalable solutions that are emerging during this energy crisis? We need to understand why these approaches and solutions are working? How they can be scaled up to reach more underserved groups and what kind of policy changes would support mass adoption of these solutions.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will use these methods to understand how this crisis is impacting people, from their perspectives and map workable, practical solutions that are gaining acceptance and wider usage. We aim to use systems thinking to understand how our findings are hacking or disrupting existing energy systems, what impacts these could have and how they can scaled up, if so desired. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These sources will help us understand the pain points during this crisis from consumers' perspectives and the reasons why alternative solutions are being taken up by people. They will also help in mapping locations where there is interest in these solutions. We can also learn how to support further development and mass take-up of these solutions with policy and programme interventions. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Innovators in the energy space and associated services could be champions and possible collaborators depending on our findings. Micro, small and medium-scale businesses and home owners would provide key insights and could benefit from our findings.
