Co-founded by Farah Emara and Omar Emara.  Fresh source is a tech B2B start-up that aims to serve as a connection between farmers and urban retailers/vendors. FreshSource is disrupting the Egyptian horticulture agri-chain through the provision of innovative solutions that are aimed at integrating small-time farmers into the modern value chain. FreshSource is taking a value chain approach to improve the economic and environmental efficiency of the food supply chain in Egypt where the food waste has reached an all-time high at over 30% due to improper handling and storage techniques. Through the platform the company aims to collect and analyse data on market demand and prices, enabling a more strategic and market driven approach to crop production planning.
