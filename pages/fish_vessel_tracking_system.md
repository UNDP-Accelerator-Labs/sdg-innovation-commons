"We developed an economic IoT geolocalization device and through the Fishing Data Platform analyze where are the boats fishing and cross analysis to the type of boat, the permit given, and the fuel being granted, if applies. In technology REMORA presents a significant advantage through three main characteristics: communication, installation, and energy. In REMORA we are using passive GSP, a plug-play installation, and self-energy generation."
