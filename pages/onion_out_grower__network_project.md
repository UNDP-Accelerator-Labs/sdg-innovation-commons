> Title of the innovation

Onion out grower  network project

> Brief description of the innovation

The Onion out grower network project
Is a project designed to uplift youths out of poverty through robust onion production and marketing. This is a pilot project being implemented by Teamwork development multipurpose cooperative located in Chipata district( Luangeni village in chief maguya). The cooperative has 20(twenty) members, 10 male and 10 females. 
The project involves the following stages

1) Training  our members in onion production and management, storage and marketing
3) Provide seed, supervision and guidance throughout the production process.
4) Sign business supply contracts with our members.
5) using precision farming our project will embrace the use of technology to efficiently utilize the farming resources in order to boost our profits and take care of our environment.(applying the right quantity of inputs, at the right time while avoiding wastage)This will be done using a mobile application which will be recording the date onions are planted, variety planted, fertilizer/ manure used, size of the land being used for onion growing etc ) This application will help in recording vital data for our project. this data will be used to make future decisions such as planting time, quantity of seed required for planting and pest control measures required.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Chipata onion out grower network project  generates income through onion sales. Onion produced by our members is sold to traders within Chipata, Lusaka and other neighboring countries such as the democratic republic of Congo.
The challenge prize will enable us to improve our production through conservation methods such as creating our own manure to fertilize our onions. The challenge prize will also allow us to acquire improved onion seed varieties which are disease resistant, acquire irrigation equipment such as drip irrigation, water pump and a 5000 liter tank for water storage. The challenge prize will also allow us to create water reservoirs/ wells for our irrigation during dry seasons.
The project intends to develop a mobile application to be installed on Google store
By using the agric mobile application the environment will be protected in the sense that our project will minimize the use of fertilizers, chemicals and other inputs due to our accurate record keeping using the mobile application. less fertilizer and less chemicals will lead to improved environmental protection.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation is designed to use a mobile application such as agrio found on Google play store. This  mobile application will be recording data such as the date onions are planted, variety planted, fertilizer/ manure used, size of the land being used for onion growing etc ) This application will help in recording vital data for our project. this data will be used to make future decisions such as planting time, quantity of seed required for planting and pest control measures required.
Our implementation plan involves the following steps once the challenge prize is received .
1) training of our members in sustainable onions production and marketing
2) construction of water reservoirs 
3) purchase of irrigation equipment such as water pump, 5000 liter tank, drip irrigation equipment and seed.
4) land preparation, land clearing,, application of manure and planting of onions.
5) Designing the agric  mobile application

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation can improve the lives of others due to the following.
 1) increased production of onions will lead to improved income levels among youths and women. this will help in poverty reduction.
2) increased income among youth and women will lead to improved education levels in the project area, beneficiaries will be able to take their children to school.
3) (employment creation) jobs for youths and women will be realized from this innovation. youth and women will be employed to work in these improved onion gardens.

How relevant is proposed innovation to the current market?

 Demand for onion on the market is on the rise. Traders, retailers and bulk buyers from within Chipata, Lusaka and copper belt are coming to purchase onions from Chipata. This shows that there is high demand for the product from these major cities and neighboring countries.
