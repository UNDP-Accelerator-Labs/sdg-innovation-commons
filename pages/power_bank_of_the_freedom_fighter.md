If you are in pain to recharge your phone, in a non-electrified area, if you don't have time to wait for your phone to recharge even better, if you think you are paying too much for power banks that do not last for long time then here is your solution: the power bank of the freedom fighter.  With a compact frame, it has a minimum autonomy of 5 years and is self-charging without a foreign source of electricity. It allows you to generate by using two dynamos of the voltage current of 12 and 5V (for this prototype in picture) stored using batteries, all connected on by two switches, the first one is responsible for activation a 12V dynamo to generate power to be stored in the batteries and the second is responsible for the distribution of needed power. For this case 5V for charging the phone.

In picture, the power switcher allowing the bateries to receive electricity.

Applying charging cable through the USB port to power supply the phone.

Please see how it works, Enjoy!
