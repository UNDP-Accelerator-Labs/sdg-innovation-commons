## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Dedicated space and time for reflection and learning does not exist in UNDP processes  - The focus on measuring outputs takes away from monitoring and learning from the softer / non-measurable components which often drive the programming and delivery - Facilitation and learning experts can be of great value to teams for adaptive learning and programming - UNDP comms is focused on sharing results and not learning and hence project teams are not incentivized to work out loud - Case for evidence based reporting building on beneficiary narratives from beneficiary survey and identifying opportunities for improvement for UNDP and implementing partners 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

CO culture which is prioritizes delivery and has several competing priorities at any time. Learning is hence de-prioritized and it is difficult to get staff time and commitment for the work 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

These were chosen to understand CO culture for MERL and improve the existing tools. The aim was to showcase data points (e.g. local narratives, impacts and benefits) from community with whom UNDP was implementing projects; harness team intelligence for adaptive learning and demonstrate impact of working out loud

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We needed to showcase the value of learning and reflection if done in a systematic and timely manner. Through co-creating with IRMU, comms and MERL teams, we were able to pass on knowledge from these experiments in to the team. Sensemaking was used for continuous reflection and social media analysis helped show the value of working out loud. We developed a MVP of a reflection tool which can be used by the project moving forward.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

NA

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Only internal partners were part of this leaning cycle. With IRMU and Comms and MERL specialists of a project team, these experiments were designed and trialed in line with their aims and goals 



With the Governance for Resilient Development in the Pacific Project (Gov4Res), 4 entry points were identified for experimentation: MERL survey /tool for GESI - A prototype of a self reflection survey was created which will be tested with the project in the coming months by the GESI specialist who has just come on board. This will help track GESI concerns which are focused on 'being' in addition to 'doing'. Agile and adaptive learning through structured reflection - 3 structured reflection sessions were designed and run over 6 months to learn and iterate on a new area of programming. These reflections have been adopted by the project and extended to Government partners like the Ministry of Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management in Fiji. Retrospective codification of impact for identifying core successes - Culture change impact framework from States of Change was tested with Gov4Res for a codification of best practices over the last 7 years of programming. Working out loud through digital engagement - a 4 week experiment was carried out for using social media as a tool for social collaboration and learning. During the experiment period, posts reached to 54000 individuals vs 24000 in the previous year. It also provided a dedicated space for communication activity and working out loud. Through our engagement with IRMU, we developed a beneficiary survey which was tested with few projects with the Resilience and Sustainable development thematic unit. Through this, all projects have been exposed to additional monitoring tools such as beneficiary surveys for evaluation and reporting purposes. The beneficiary surveys provides the CO with expanded evidence based information/data. The information/data collected provides validation and illustrates human centered stories to the donors and other partners. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Working on multiple experiments with the same project was very useful. It ensured that the team got a sense of not only the 'what' of innovation but also the 'how'. This was the biggest value for the project in terms of their collaboration with the Acclab
