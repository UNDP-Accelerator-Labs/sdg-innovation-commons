## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Strengthening Trade and Supply chain for the Informal Vendors across Zambia and Namibia for the AfCFTA
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that informal vendors need to be included as part of  the economy that would respect their need to continue to trade across borders in ways that affirm their livelihoods and promote new approaches towards using digital to trade efficiently, effectively while addressing their pain points.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Government, while having a pro-poor policy does not address the unique context and challenges of the informal economy.  There is a need to understand the ecosystem and utilize digitalization as an enabler.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.
