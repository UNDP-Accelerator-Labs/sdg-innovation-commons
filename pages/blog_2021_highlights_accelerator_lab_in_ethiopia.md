Executive Summary

UNDP Ethiopia’s accelerator lab launched in December 2019, as part of the largest
and fastest learning network of 91 accelerator labs across the world. The lab is a
space for UNDP to explore, test and grow innovations for development challenges
through collaboration and partnership. We are bringing a new way of working to
meet the 2030 sustainable development goals by mapping, testing, and growing
grassroots solutions that are crafted by those close to the problem.

After our first year of work on frontier issues like youth unemployment and COVID-
19 in line with UNDP’s and Ethiopia’s development agenda, 2021 was a year of deep
diving into our portfolio on solid waste management, expanding our support on
COVID-19 and exploring new challenges in knowledge management. Despite the
challenging circumstance that happened in the country due to security issues and
COVID-19, the lab has been able to continue its work with supporting the Country
Office and the innovation ecosystem.

Work in 2021

Sensing Knowledge Management

The accelerator lab is part of a new way of working for UNDP to bring innovation

into how we identify, understand, and solve challenges. This new way of working

requires a shift in our culture when it comes to how we create, share, and manage

knowledge. Recognizing this, UNDP Ethiopia is creating open, innovative, networked,

and collaborative programs anchored in a portfolio approach for inclusive economic

growth, climate resilience and democratic governance. To spear head this approach,

the lab set out to sense knowledge creation and sharing culture as basis for the

knowledge management in the country office.

The lab set out to learn how our office creates and shares knowledge as a means for

fostering collaboration and innovation. We analyzed existing data, like general staff

survey and blog engagement data, conducted brainstorming exercise with team

leader on how they envision their teams collaborating and innovating, and launched

a staff wide survey on what knowledge creation and sharing culture is. We triangu-

lated this data to get a full picture of the perceived value of knowledge, how it is

developed and consumed.

To explore this further, we conducted a behavioral insight survey that specifically

looked at how knowledge is created and shared within the CO. This exercise outlined

some insights from staff but also the unspoken norms that are practiced. The staff

expressed interest in sharing knowledge but doesn’t always know how to and tends

to wait until requested to share. Knowledge usually moves vertically within the hier-

archy but there is limited horizontal knowledge sharing because of the perceived

lack of readily available platforms to engage in. We also identified the need to con-

stantly articulate a shared vision and objective to break down traditional silos and

become more integrated.

Our sensemaking exercise with team leaders showed that to be

• Open and innovative we need motivated and passionate teams that regularly

interact with each other but also work together to learn new things through

experimentation.

•

Collaboration requires giving value, time, and resources to budling connections

with the direct support of management. We need to experiment with different

modes of working together such as regular brainstorming sessions and joint

planning across the teams.

• Networked means teams having shared goals and interests to which they

dedicate time and resources to create multiple platforms (formats) for

sharing and building horizontal linkages. The platform, however, needs to

show how they benefit the teams and motivate teams to share.

In 2022, we will continue collaborating with a UNDP-SIDA (Swedish International
Development Cooperation Agency) project and the communication team within
our country office to jointly to design and experiment with scalable solutions that
can bring more openness, better collaboration and tighter network.

Exploring Waste Segregation Behavior and
Technology

Waste management as it relates to job creation and environmental sustainability
was the big frontier challenge, we worked on in 2021. It is an urbanization issue
that most cities in Ethiopia struggle especially household waste segregations. For
urban waste, residential areas contribute a considerable amount of waste so
addressing the behavioral and practical issues at the household level could make a
difference on waste management. Therefore, one aspect of the waste
management portfolio was understanding the knowledge, attitude, and practice
around waste segregation at households with a behavioral insight survey.

The behavioral insight survey covered 1500 households across 3 different locations
in Addis Ababa. It explored whether households have knowledge and understand

them. Transfer stations, where waste is sorted before going to landfill, are
unevenly distributed, with more transfer stations available in higher income
neighborhoods than others. In the coming year we will be working with
municipalities across the country to disseminate the learning we have gathered
into proactive community outreach programs.

The lab team also conducted a deep dive exercise to understand household waste
flow and collection system. Insights from the deep dive exercise helped us to
co-create desirable and user centered door to door waste collection pushcart
prototypes.

Testing Digital Technology for Business
Continuity

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented demand for digital solutions
to ensure continuity of critical services. The demand is not just in the private sector
but also in governments and this has opened a new and exciting space for
experimentation within Government tech. UNDP Ethiopia, through the accelerator
lab, continued its partnership with Ministry of Innovation and Technology to enlist
local innovators on digitizing critical government functions to ensure business
continuity. A challenge grant was created to allow government institutions to enlist
private technology startups and SME to pilot and test digital services for business
continuity. From solutions submitted across 8 challenge areas, the grant identified
7 government tech solutions that have been enrolled to a business incubation
program to refine their products.

After completion of the program the tech companies have been paired with
government institutions to test their minimum viable products in the real
world. The testing will continue into 2022 but so far, we have learned that
government institutions have a strong appetite for and have clear ideas about
what they want and need.

Moreover, as part of the Country Office COVID-19 response plan, the lab team
partnered with the Industrial Park Development Corporation and VIAMO, a mobile
tech company to develop an awareness creation campaign to empower
employees to keep themselves safe and create a positive work environment. This
experimental exercise allowed us to reach close to 20,000 Industrial Park workers
across the country in multiple languages . Making sense of the vast amounts of
data collected within the industrial park through implanting the digital innovation
and visualizing it helped to support IPDC revisit its business continuity plans and
take some corrective measures for continuity of their function. The team
continued exploring possible expansion of such innovative mobile tools with
Ethiopia National Youth Volunteer Community Service Programme.

Scale up Waste Solutions and Create Market
Connections

Our portfolio of work on solid waste management continued with the challenges of
downstream waste management, specifically recycling, and reusing waste to create
new and sustainable products. We noticed that there was a missed opportunity to
create market connections between stakeholders within the value chain. There
were some promising initiatives from the private sector, but they were fragmented
and have not been formally integrated into the waste management system. To
address this, the lab hosted a 2-day solution fest and panel discussion.

The solution festival had an exhibition for start-ups and innovators building diverse
waste products to display their work, connected with large-scale recycling
companies, governments, and development organizations. There were also two
discussion forums, one on The Future of Waste Management: Strategies for
Economic Opportunity and Environmental sustainability and another on What
opportunities exist. Their role in building a circular economy on waste. The fest saw
25+ companies, 300+ visitors and 85 panel discussion participants. There was
tremendous interest in the topic and appetite from the participant to network and
connect on the waste topics.

The futuristic and solution-driven discussions highlighted the need for the proactive
creation of economic opportunities through public-Private partnership for job
creation and lack of research and data driven approach for a coordinated effort to
create an environmentally sustainable waste management system. At a systemic
level we need a shared responsibility approach from government, industry, and
consumers to tackle the frowning demands of waste management resources. In the
coming year, we will be working with municipalities across the country to
disseminate these learning and bring a systemic approach.

Beyond the Big Bet

officially launched on March 31st,
2021. The lab has been supporting
the initiative take shape in Ethiopia
by creating a bridge to youth
organizations and brining the much
-needed voice of youth to the
table. The lab led future thinking
exercise with young people to determine the desired future for education, school
to work transition, employment, and civic engagement. In addition, the lab took
the insights from these exercises to build strategy for the active engagement of
youth in setting the priorities for Generation Unlimited and empower themselves
in building youth focused platforms. Most recently, the lab supported the
development of the rapid assessment tools development to create a tool to
assess the scalability of solutions before investment. When launched this tool will
be available to the public to use and identify bankable solutions of Gen U.

income. The project has developed
a biological herbicide to eradicate
Striga (a significant yield-reducing
weed for sorghum and maize). This
solution has been awarded a grant
for
the Singapore Center
by
Innovation, therefore, to test in a practical field setting. To this effect, the
accelerator lab has been facilitating local partnerships development, capacity
support through exposure visit to the Kenyan lab, and further engagement to
take the solution into a pilot scale. Following their training in the Kenyan lab, the
EBTi experts have continued to collect fusarium species and conduct molecular
screening, which is a crucial step in proceeding to pilot this biological herbicide in
maize and sorghum fields. The same lab protocol could also be applied to solve
weed infestation of other crops.

Expanding the lab's methodologies:

The Accelerator lab is dedicated to sharing its methodologies and tools to build
the capabilities of partner organization and UNDP Ethiopia in creating spaces for
innovation and collaboration. One way we did this in 2021 is by organizing at
Bahir Dar
Innovation and Techno-
Entrepreneurship Center. The Bootcamp empowered 30 students with tools and
methods on how to innovate and put humans at the center of the solution
through hands-on exercise, presentations, and pitch sessions.

Institute of Technology’s Business

With the country office, the lab held two open learning sessions that explored the
tools of the lab that can be leveraged by project to invite collaboration and think
outside of the box. In March, we held a session on working-out-loud and thought
leadership. More specifically on how to use them to create visibility for our work
while inviting collaboration and tracking learning along the way. In July we
explored different data sources to inform decision making, bring innovation and
diverse viewpoints to our work. We also invited VIAMO, a technology company
that uses mobile phones to disseminate and collect data from hard-to-reach
places to give us an overview of how their system can be used to get real time
data that can aid decision making, create strategies and build robust citizen data.

Building an inclusive innovation ecosystem

The lab has been supporting the innovation ecosystem in Ethiopia with activities
for both the private and public actors. But we want to make sure that the
ecosystem we are building is inclusive of all peoples especially of marginalized
groups like People with Disabilities (PWD) because we can’t think of economic
growth and transformation without inclusion.

17.6% of the working age population in Ethiopia has some form of permanent or
temporary disability. Despite laws that protect their rights, People With Disabilities
(PWD) still get discriminated against when looking for
jobs and getting a job women is even more difficult
for women with disability. Therefore, the lab
partnered with the
Innovation
International
Center (I2) and Center for
Private Enterprise (CIPE) to organize an
advocacy and engagement event for PWD
including a showcase innovation for and by
PWDs. The event served as a collaboration
point for different actors to connect their
activities and coordinate voices in advocating
for more awareness and better accountability of

Indigenous

institutions in including support services for PWD.

The Czech UNDP Partnership for SDGs : The partnership aims to bring innovative
solutions for a variety of development challenges to different communities, from
the Czech Republic’s private sector, NGOs universities, state institutions, research
centers and individuals to tackle specific developmental challenges in the priority
countries. Two innovations namely DOT glasses and AQUATEST benefitted from
the first-round challenge fund and got a chance to test and pilot their innovations
and business model with their local partners through the support of the lab. DOT
glasses offer low-cost eyeglasses via non vision care supply network. This company
secured license for its product sold 7,000 eyeglasses through its 135 trained youth
networks. AQUATEST is another company benefitted from this challenge to test
Shallow ground water monitoring in Oromia and Sidama regions in partnership
with ATA (Agriculture Transformation Agency) with monitoring devices installed
for observation of groundwater level, temperature and electric conductivity
fluctuations. The experiment was successful, and ATA is considering own funding
to scaling up the ground water monitoring technology to other regions of the
country. Currently there are other two ongoing projects benefitted from this
partnership working on mapping ground water in Somali region and test nature
based solution for waste treatment in Hawasa city.
