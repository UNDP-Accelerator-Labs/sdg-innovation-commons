> Title of the innovation

Keeping Zambia clean and green

> Brief description of the innovation

Most parts of rural parts of Zambia are experiencing massive cutting down of trees due to primitive way of farming and lack of cheeper source of energy.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

By the year 2050 people of Zambia will have very few trees which are very important in construction, energy and farming industry.
If any organisation can help me financially, I can start planting trees which I expect to sale at an exorbitant price in few years to come. I can also engage out growers who be buying small trees from me and such people can be encouraged to stop shifting cultivation by giving them loans to buy inputs and at the end of the day, they would pay me interest on farming inputs loans.
I would also take advantage of local government schools administration to make it a policy for each school to plant trees and I will supply small trees at a minimum fee.
Many cannot access farming inputs from the government therefore, my business would grow very fast because everyone would want to get farming inputs loans on condition that the plant not less than 100 trees. When the trees are fully grown, I will be in a very business of buying logs and selling to individuals and companies for example electricity company
If this innovation is implemented, it effectively address the challenges of climate change in Zambia and the world at large

> Technical Feasibility

1. Sensitisation of farmers
2. Land preparation
3. Planting of trees
4. Giving of farming inputs
5. Buying of agricultural products to pay loans
6. Protect, preserve and prevent trees
7. Selling of trees and replanting

> Anticipated Social Impact

Many people would stop feeding from hand to mouth because they start producing enough food for their families and the surplus for sale. Eventually, people would start making a lot of money after selling trees and plunks.
The innovation relevant to the current market because electricity company is now buying poles from South Africa and in construction industry, people are buying plunks from Tanzania at a very high price.
