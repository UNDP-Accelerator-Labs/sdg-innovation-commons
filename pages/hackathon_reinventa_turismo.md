## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

There is strong evidence that the use of a structured framework including innovation methods, technology and specific capacity building can be an effective method to generate interest and ideas from a large pool applicants regarding a specific topic / area, to engage with them in the development of sound solutions, and grant access to entrepreneurship mechanisms available in local ecosystem to access to market and finance. From our experiment, more than 120 young entrepreneurs applied, 30 solutions were designed during the hackathon and 9 were selected to enter entrepreneurship programs from partners. 3 new start-ups were created and 4 sound digital products for tourism were developed after a 6 month incubation period.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

MS Teams platform is good and performed well in delivering the 3-days online hackathon event. All information, documents, meetings and teams' dynamics were well supported. Nevertheless, challenges were found in managing the flow of the event and the work of the judges and rating process. We discovered during the project alternatives that could manage in an integrated way the whole process and improve participants experience (TAIKAI and iHackOnline), but a cost/benefit assessment is necessary. Regarding stakeholders management, periodic meetings and collaborative platforms helped, but agility and adaptation to changing circumstances was critical.  

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 months until de realization of the hackathon, from September to November 2020. Incubation period with winning teams lasted 6 months, from January to June 2021.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Initiative management and logistics: 20.000 USD (Accelerator Lab Budget); Monetary Prizes: 24.000 USD (National Tourism Fund / Ministry of Tourism); Incubation, mentorship and other in-kind services (provided free of charge by partners).

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The initiative included 2 (two) phases. The hackathon event, including a call for ideas, and a Incubation/entrepreneurship program for selected teams. In the second phase, agreements between hackathon winners and the sponsors providing the prizes were made and a 6 month solutions development period undertaken, in which the teams were supported an monitored to deliver successful products to the market and address the targeted problem statements of the initiative.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes. The same framework can be adapted to be applied to different sectors and different stakeholders to address new target audiences. We plan to scale to the Blue Economy sector and engage with respective challenges and stakeholders.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The trade-off between detailed planning and necessary flexibility to adjust to project needs and manage stakeholder's engagement was a strong challenge in this project. It was not possible to follow a detailed plan on many occasions, namely in communications and advertising initiatives. This led to some delays and schedule adjustments. Team resilience was key to overcome the challenges. Periodic meetings and collaborative platforms helped, but agility and adaptation to changing circumstances was critical. Entrepreneurs and MSMEs are willing to find opportunities and participate in this types of framework to develop their ideas and solutions. Generally, there are good core technical skills available in the teams. Management skills, market analysis and orientation, and communication skills are still big challenges to most applicants. Participants benefited (and rated very well) from pitch sessions and help from mentors in developing sound presentations and business models. Mobilizing the national tech ecosystem was essential to the initiative. The partnership with Cabo Verde Digital was key to accomplish this. Their valuable network of contacts and a well-established position in the system was critical to engage participants and important partners. Working with key institutions and operators in the sector to develop problem statements was key to achieve relevant subjects and increase solutions adherence to the market.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The call for solutions phase was really challenging. The team faced some challenges in timely production of communication assets and to maintain the expected dynamics and communication flow in the web site in this phase. Also, the initial application form was to long and complex, and needed to be revised. This led to delays in application submissions and a lot of pressure in the last days of the call, challenging the evaluation process. A wide range of stakeholders, from public institutions to private sponsors, technical partners, specialists and speakers with very different needs and particularities, in different locations and speaking different languages was a real challenge!

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

In this experience we’ve developed and tested a framework to engage with young entrepreneurs and new partners to develop solutions, in this case digital solutions connected to tourism sector. This concept and way of engaging can be adjusted to be applied to many of the internal portfolios seeking new ways to address young and disperse target audiences, especially those working with youth and entrepreneurship, whichever the sector or thematic area. This approach proved to generate significant interest in target groups, to be a flexible framework to engage with other partners and a very good visibility and awareness instrument.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

First, specific target audiences with interest in developing their ideas and solutions but with little access to other mainstream instruments to access the market and regular financing. This framework assembles a balanced and tailored set of resources for the development of solutions in a specific thematic area, and increases the likelihood of beneficiaries accessing other market and financing instruments that requires more specific skills or qualified project proposals.  Second, partners in the entrepreneurship and financing sector can also benefit from more qualified and market oriented proposals, and can be involved in a more structured way in early stages of ideation and projects design from beneficiaries, improving the quality of proposals and projects.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

The complete process included 3 major iterations: (1) The call for solutions, (2) The hackathon workshop, and (3) The incubation phase. Throughout this process, the applicants ideas and projects underwent a series mid-points evaluations and selections to improve the quality of final proposals. For each stage, a different (and progressively more challenging) criteria were used to progress proposals from one phase into the next, and different resources and upskilling sessions made available to participant teams. Different mentors, tools and assessment methodologies were used to fit this purpose of continuing refining and assessing the solutions being developed, from eligibility criteria in the call for solutions, to co-design in the hackathon, to periodic check-points in the incubation period.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Mobilizing the national tech ecosystem was essential to the initiative. The partnership with Cabo Verde Digital was key to accomplish this in this case. Their valuable network of contacts and a well-established position in the system was critical to engage participants and important partners. Working with key institutions and operators in the sector to develop problem statements was also key to develop relevant subjects and increase solutions adherence to the market.  On the other hand, managing the expectations of a wide range of stakeholders, from public institutions to private sponsors, technical partners, specialists and speakers with very different needs and particularities, in different locations and speaking different languages is a real challenge! Special attention should be paid to this from the very beginning.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes! That was the general idea of the experiment. To test a suitable methodology that could be well dimensioned, engaging, efficient and replicable to other sectors and thematic areas. Necessary adjustments would include, sector and thematic areas selection, target-audience definition and assessment, partnerships building and resources mobilization.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This initiative underwent the 3 phases of the learning cycle. The hackathon process involves a fairly long period of preparation, with activities that falls within “sense” and “explore” phases, including thematic areas selection, ecosystem mapping, partnerships building and so on. Following this, a project team with partners needs to be assembled and a design phase precedes implementation, these fitting into “experimenting” phase.   Regarding what could be done in addition with “solution mapper” and “explorer”, the call for ideas was the instrument used to procure ideas and solutions, and a suitable form was developed to gather necessary information. With more time to enhance this phase, we could use some of the solutions mapping and exploring instruments to dive more into the solutions in this “solutions procurement phase” and start enhancing the quality of solutions in early stages of the process.  

> What surprised you?

The immediate adherence of partners and applicants to the initiative. Both groups are keen to find new ways to engage, and a well-designed new way to interact on relevant topics surely caught their attention.
