This solution was mapped thanks to the third edition of the challenge "Innovating together for children and sustainable development", which aimed to boost solutions that had an impact on clean and affordable energy or solid and liquid waste management.


It is a game that teaches how to classify common solid waste to children from 5 to 14 years old, being this a population of 3,290,835 children according to the CENSUS conducted in 2,018 by the National Institute of Statistics.
The game is based on intuitive challenges that complete 5 levels where they will learn to classify their household waste. The tool seeks to provide environmental education through a digital application that facilitates learning to care for the environment through the proper disposal of household waste and solid waste
