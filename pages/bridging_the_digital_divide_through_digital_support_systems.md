> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)
- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Private Sector

UNDP Governance Cluster, Ministry of Justice, CAJ (Center for Access to Justice) provate sector: SAUDIGITUS and NOSI
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Digitalization is where the world is heading, and when done in the right way, it allows for fewer human errors, creates better scalability, lowers operational costs, and provides more efficient insights and workflows. Aside from making public services better and more efficient, digital processes have the potential to change the core fundamentals of how work is done. The old “paper-based” methods cannot keep up with the current pace at which the world is evolving. 

Our challenge is that existing processes in the Ministry of Justice are centralized and are being carried out manually. The current situation produces slow and extremely inefficient processes, making it hard to create databases of reoccurring patterns or needs of the population. We would like to learn what role digital support systems (trainings and equipment) can play to bridge Digital Divide in the Ministry of Justice (specifically in the Tribunals and in the CAJ, Center for Access to Justice).

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

H1 “IF… digitization training and equipment is provided to staff of the tribunals and CAJ in the regions THEN… they will improve their attitude towards using digital technologies, improve their digital skills, and data and information will be able to flow into SIGDAJ (local solution for Information System and Database) in a decentralized manner. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The first phase will focus on digitalizing and digitizing existing documents from CAJ, the criminal register and the tribunal of Buba, that are still on paper. Training and digital devices will be provided to staff who also will be part of the digitalization process and continue to feed the system when the test is over. When every document is digitized, the data will be connected to the information system SIGDAJ (locally developed solution). In this phase, we will compare the skills and attitude of the staff towards digitalization of services through a pre-post survey.  

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Accelerator Lab

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

A pre-post survey will measure the skills and attitude of the staff towards digitalization of the services they provide.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 week

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Collaboration, building trust with partners and preparation of field trip approximatley: 3 months. Actual field trip and experiment: 2 weeks  The experimental activity was fully covered by the UNDP Governance Cluster
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The pre-post survey worked for its purpose. Next time it would be interesting to compare two completly separate groups instead (RCT). 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

2-3 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

The Governance Cluster paid the whole activity at an amount of: 17.000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, the next test will involve the creation of a digital platform that can be accessed by citizens anywhere at anytime to download their criminal register. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, the experiment is planned to be scaled with the Governance Cluster, the Ministry of Justice and our partner NOSI, from the Cape Verdean private sector.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

- The majority of staff in CAJ and the Court  have never received any form of digital training (92%).  - Digital training and equipment has the potential to imprive attitudes thowards digitalization (pre-post survey) - The close colaboration with the Ministry of Justice and the UNDP Governance Cluster as well as with the private sector has showed a great potential for continuation and scaling. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Bureaucracy and internal politics (especially inside the Ministry of Justice), created obstacles and delayed our activities.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Governance Cluster in particular as the activity has been a support for their ongoing objectives and activities. All Clusters can learn from this activity as it shows the potential of a multisectorial team and close collaboration between the Lab, the Clusters, and the public and private sector.  

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Ministries, as it shows the potential of bridging the digital divide through provision of training and equipment as well as how a test can be done without investing too much time or resources. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Make sure to create close colaboration with the Ministry and the UNDP Cluster in question, has showed a great potential for continuation and scaling. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

We beleive this experiment has a high replicability in the other SDG areas, ex with SDG 3 Good Health and Well Being one can imagine providing digital support systems to health workers in order to improve their attitude and efficency. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

We spend a lot of time on the "explore" phase for this experiment. In order to optimize time, we often split the team. In the future I would liek to work closer tot he other roles for a more dynamic process. 

> What surprised you?

The strong synergy and commitment of the team that was put together.
