## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

·         The majority of the users of the mobile unit did not use the justice services before due to the time and money they would have spent on travel. ·         The populations understand the benefits of civil registration, but often does not complete these documents due to lack of accessibility, especially women and children ·         The majority of the population see the value of legal aid but lack of communication is not localized (ex. translated into local languages) and proximity of the service decreases the accessibility ·         Overall the number of recorded citizens was significantly higher in the mobile units compared to the fixed points. ·         Through exploration of mobile units in the neighboring country Cape Verde, the use of the vehicle was instrumental to reaching unprecedented levels of civil registration and proximity of other justice services, until the mobile unit became redundant due to the development of infrastructure (physical and digital)

N/A

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. Policy does not allow for the House of Justice, through the use of a mobile vehicle, to provide services usually found in courts ex. inforce civil order, provide legal aid, scedule court cases or maintain court record and files 2. Internal politics related to project overseeing, prevented us from digging deeper into the aspects of digitalization

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Observation – was used to create an understanding of the behavior of the citizens towards the fixed point and the mobile vehicle and what aspects can be improved. Citizen data – was used as we needed a baseline to understand how many people used the justice services on the fixed points of service. Direct Interviews- was used to understand citizens perception towards approximation of access to justice due to lack of data in the area.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Behavioural Insights – was necessary to understand the psychological and physical effects of the use of the spaces (fixed points/ mobile point). It helped unpack the system because it allowed us to deliver a feature that was not available before. Participatory design – It was necessary to apply this method to involve the users early in the process with the aim to create a sense of belonging and inclusion. This helped unpack the system because it allowed us to get input from the actual users of the spaces (fixed points and mobile points) Prototyping – Was necessary to apply to understand how a mobile justice unit could significantly improve accessibility to justice for citizens. As we rented a vehicle, it allowed us to learn in a short time what functioned and what could be improved without investing much money.

The UNDP Governance Cluster
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Through working directly with the Ministry of Justice, we were able to hold impromptu workshops with stakeholders in the region of Gabu, that along with a behavioral study, gave us insights into local and cultural dilemmas that led to the lack of successful information sharing as well as information penetration in the most vulnerable communities. Additionally, working with the Governance Cluster, allowed us to tap into their expertise and previous knowledge of how to interact with local partners and facilitate collaboration.
