> Brief description of the innovation

Schistosomiasis is a water-based parasitic disease that affects over 250 million people. Control efforts have long been in vain, which is one reason why schistosomiasis is considered a neglected tropical disease (NTD). However, since the new millennium, interventions against schistosomiasis are escalating. The initial impetus stems from a 2001 World Health Assembly resolution, urging member states to scale-up deworming of school-aged children with the anthelminthic drug praziquantel. With the recent publication of the World Health Organization (WHO) Roadmap to overcome the impact of NTDs in 2020, we have entered a new era. The major approach used for disease control and treatment is chemotherapy, using Praziquantel (PZQ) which has been in use for half a century. PZQ is safe, efficacious and inexpensive. However, with respect to eliminating adult worms, PZQ is only partially efficacious. It is not effective on young worms, and does not prevent reinfection. Moreover, drug resistant strains of the parasite have been documented in endemic areas such as Kenya and Egypt, a situation which is compromising the efficacy of PZQ in managing schistosomiasis. The emergence of worm strains less sensitive to PZQ and the over reliance on praziquantel have presented the urgent need for novo antischistosomal drugs that are cheaper and more efficacious. This innovation, therefore, is the synthesis (and subsequent manufacture) and evaluation of in vitro antischistosomal bioactivity and structure-activity relationships (SARs) of pyridazinylbenzamide analogues (simply new bilharzia drug), the most bioactive of which will be evaluated in vivo in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni, a species common in Zambia. Furthermore, the most bioactive analogues will undergo pharmacokinetic studies.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My new bilharzia drug will recover all the funds I anticipate to receive from NTBC manifold and will reward me and my laboratory international collaborators whose equipment my lab lacks. Proceeds from the sale of my new drug will also help solicit more funding from other sponsors to help equip my research lab further for further research and development of other potential new drugs hence will beef up the Zambian drug manufacturing industry. On patenting, the drug will be ready for export once Zambian drug manufacturers such as Yash life take up the prototype and rights of manufacture. My new drug will make Zambia more liveable by reducing the prevalence of bilharzia to especially school-going children in rural areas.

> Technical Feasibility

I simple (layman's) terms, I have designed a new bilharzia drug and are just finalising on purification of the prototype so that the sample can be sent to University of Cape Town for chemical characterisation and University of California San Francisco for further biosafety evaluation in mice then human clinical trials. This will be followed by commercialisation the drug after patenting with PACRA and industrial scale-up manufacture.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Once fully developed, my new bilharzia drug will be commercialised and used to reduce the prevalence of this dreadful tropical infectious disease (bilharzia/schistosomiasis) in Zambia and help prolong the better lives of millions of people especially children from rural areas with large water bodies such as lakes, rivers and swamps. Since bilharzia is not only in Zambia but the tropical regions of Africa, South America and the Pacific, my new bilharzia drug will be very relevant for export hence add to Zambia's GDP by diversification from mining.
