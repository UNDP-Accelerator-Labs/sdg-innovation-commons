> Title of the innovation

Suwilanji’s entertainment center

> Brief description of the innovation

I want to open up a Game Center in the area that am staying in because young people that stay in the area are very much interested in playing games, there willing to pay anything to be entertained by games eg Fifa, racing games, GTA and so forth. Not only will it be a Game Center but I’ll be offering hair cutting services creating atleast 2 jobs. In addition to that I also want to be offering car washing services just outside the shop creating even more jobs for unemployed youths staying near the area. It’s an idea that I’ve had in my head since I started living in the area and with your help I’d manifest it and see it grow to one day being a big company that will spread around the whole town.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation involves either renting a shop or building one that will create jobs for bricklayers. Upon building the shop I’ll have a barber man, a guy that will be washing the cars and someone that will be in charge of the games creating atleast 4 jobs bringing income not only to myself but to unemployed fellow youths around the area. I have no doubt that the business will be a fast growing one because I’m located along the road which everyone staying in the area or visiting the area will be able to pass through almost every day of their lives.

> Technical Feasibility

To implement this idea, I need to have atleast two TV sets 32 inches or higher, two play station 4 consoles, atleast four hair cutting machines, two moderate size mirrors and last but not least car washing machines eg vacuum cleaner and the rest of the machines.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation will help improve the lives of youths in the area that are reverting to abuse of drugs due to frustration of unemployment. They will instead have a source of income and something to do therefore reverting their attention to better things. Some of them might even start helping their families with the money that they’ll be making and as the business grows they might even start families of their own from earnings they’ll be making. Reducing not only poverty levels but theft and many other bad vices in the area.
