## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Using Citizen-Generated Data to improve Solid Waste Management
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is less current data on solid waste management in Zanzibar

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

One of the world's most pressing urban issues is solid waste management, which has a disproportionate impact on metropolitan areas, particularly in developing countries. According to recent estimates, more than 2.01 billion tons of solid waste are produced worldwide each year, with the volume expected to reach approximately 3.4 billion tons by 2050. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, according to the same reports, will account for 35% of these increases. Similarly, each year, approximately 8 million tons of plastic waste are dumped into the world's oceans, and by 2050, the oceans will contain more plastic than fish. Because of unregulated dumping and burning, solid waste contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily methane and carbon dioxide. Sub-Saharan Africa is a major source of solid waste with insufficient management, which contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and their global impact on climate change.

According to the Zanzibar Environment Management Authority, Zanzibar generates approximately 663 tons of municipal solid waste per day (ZEMA). The three major municipal councils, Zanzibar Urban Municipal Council (ZUMC), West A and B Municipal Councils, generate approximately 216 tons of waste per day, nearly half of the island's total waste, of which only 120 tons are collected and disposed of at the Kibele Landfill Site in Tunguu, Central District. Massive amounts of uncollected waste are dumped into the natural environment, contaminating natural resources, endangering the tourism industry, and providing an ideal breeding ground for flies and rodents, which are vectors of various illnesses, including cholera, especially in slum areas. Indiscriminate dumping of solid waste has been blamed for clogging storm drains, resulting in urban flooding, and influencing irresponsible waste littering behavior.

Waste management is a serious concern in Tanzania due to limited sorting at source and improper storage, collection, transportation, treatment and final disposal. This implies that significant proportion of the waste generated end up in the environment in an unacceptable way of disposal which accentuates environmental and public health risks. The waste management problem is more pronounced in squatter settlements, where 70-80% of the urban population resides without the necessary infrastructure and social services. Consequently, over 70% of diseases attended in health facilities in the country are water and sanitation related. The main pollution sources include municipal wastewater, industrial effluent, and leachate from dumpsites, agricultural activities, gaseous emissions from industrial establishments and transportation activities and noise. The trend seems to worsen particularly in urban areas ( Such as Dar es Salaam and Mwanza City and Zanzibar) due to concentration of socio-economic activities and escalating population growth. Domestic wastewater is the most serious source of water pollution since over 90% of the population use pit latrines and septic tanks for sanitation with walls which are not water tight and as such groundwater can flow freely in and out of the pit. Only about 10-15% of the urban population has access to the sewerage system, which further contributes to incidences of water borne diseases. It is estimated also that the quantity of municipal solid waste generated countrywide amounts to more than 10,000 tons per day. The indicative generation rate ranges from 0.1 – 1.0 kg/cap/day. As much as 80-90% of solid waste generated in urban areas is not collected and most of the domestic waste, which accounts for about 60 % of the total solid waste generated daily, is disposed of by burning or burying. Recycling activities are minimal and in some regions non-existent.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Various studies have pointed out lack of appropriate data Tanzania solid waste managements systems to inform programming and decision making. There is minimal/ or no data related to 1) user opinions/views 2) number of households utilizing the system 3) willingness to pay for service 4) disaggregated solid waste type data 5) limited use of IT to link customers, aggregators. Collective intelligence ( Promoted perhaps by only the Acc Lab) through its methods therefore will help to generate new information that will lead to new ideas and hence help to embed new products or services that will improve the efficiency of the solid waste management systems in the city.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can GIS technology help in improving data in Solid Waste management?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The methods will aid in understanding changing behaviors, preferences, and pain points, as well as in focusing efforts in the right places and in the right ways. Designers can build solutions that work well and widely in our new reality by unlocking the user's perspective—whatever that ultimately looks like.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Government authorities in Zanzibar are currently using outdated data from long term studies/surveys and periodic field visits data. Using new sources of data will enhance policy and programme decisions in  Solid Waste Management.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

There is already interest in two ways  1) the COE will be located at a University, this will enable sustainability of the programme and 2) Development partners in the ecosystem such as embassies and Non-profits organisation will potentially pick up the idea and support.
