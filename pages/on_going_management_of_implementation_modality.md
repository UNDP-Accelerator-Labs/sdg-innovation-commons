## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

The experiment never kicked off because after the procurement process was completed, the only eligible and winning bid was submitted by an NGO which could not be processed under the competitive process. Given that 2021 was an election year for The Gambia, it was not possible to convene an assessment panel to engage the organization under a different modality. Therefore this experiment is still pending. 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
n/a

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes. Noting the above bureaucratic and administrative challenges which also includes some procurement challenges, the experiment has yet to successfully move past the preliminary planning stage. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Engaging the local municipality gave us access to the local community ward councillor which allowed us to get firsthand insights to consider in our design of the park project. Given that the planned area of intervention was the first of its kind, there was no reference point for data on how youths in that particular community were engaging in extra curricula activities.  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Given that the actual construction of the park has yet to occur, both methods are planned for use, but could not be applied in reality. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

n/a 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

n/a

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

n/a - however, we plan to work with audiovisual and printing companies to ensure that the park is fitted with visual aides and guides to boost the moral and interest of young people to engage in exercise. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with the local municipality to gain access to the local community ward where the actual park was going to be built and the relevant councillors who could express the views of the surrounding communities.  

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

It was new for UNDP to be engaging the council at the ward level, and so they would be considered unusual partners. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

n/a but there are plans to engage UNFPA and UNICEF. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We do not have sufficient data to answer this question. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
