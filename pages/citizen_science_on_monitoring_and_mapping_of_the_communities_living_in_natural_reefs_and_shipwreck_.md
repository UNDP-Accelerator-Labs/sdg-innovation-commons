## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by scientists, and citizens participate in data collection. 

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis. 

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process. 
## Overall goal

Promote the conservation of the marine ecosystem, in general, and the communities and underwater cultural heritage of natural and artificial reefs in Mar del Plata, specifically. 
## Specific goals

Monitor the communities living in natural and artificial reefs in Mar del Plata. 

Establish the similarities between the communities living in artificial reefs and those in natural reefs. 

Analyze the development of the different populations inhabiting artificial structures since the moment they sunk. 

Broaden knowledge about the biological communities living in the reefs and shipwrecks in order to offer guidelines about their conservation and handling. 
## Description of citizen participation

Divers from the city make videos of the dives and take pictures of different natural and artificial reefs. The digital information about the presence, absence, or abundance of different living organisms of the sampled communities is sent for analysis through platforms such as WeTransfer and WhatsApp. It is also made available at in-person meetings using the diver’s computer to transfer the data to a project’s external hard drive.
