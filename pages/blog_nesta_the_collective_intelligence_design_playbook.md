what is this playbook for?

This playbook was designed by Nesta
to help you design and deliver a
collective intelligence project.

It will help you understand how to harness the best
ideas, information and insight (aka. intelligence) to
address a complex issue.

It will introduce you to activities you can use to
orchestrate diverse groups of people, data and
technology to achieve your goals.

We call this collective intelligence design.

We think of it as 21st century common sense.

who is it for?

We created this playbook for innovators around the world working
on complex challenges.

You might work in an international organisation, a public institution, a business or a non-profit.
You’re probably familiar with other innovation approaches, and you may already have used
some methods included in this playbook. But you’re likely still grappling with slow or failed
progress on a big social, environmental, economic or political issue. You know that you need to
find fresh insights, more effective solutions, and create new collaborative approaches to drive
real change.

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK01 / 09
how do we use it?

The playbook is designed to be used
by teams or groups working through
the activities and exercises together.
We recommend allocating a facilitator
to take responsibility for helping keep
the group on track, and we provide
facilitator notes throughout the guide
to help with this task.

We have created a number of new tools and activities
specifically for this playbook, but many others are
curated or adapted from other toolkits we admire. All
contain references to the original, so it is easy to trace
back if you wish to dive deeper.

“We’re new to the idea of collective
intelligence and want to understand more.”

“We want some inspiration.”

“We’ve got some important meetings
and workshops coming up, how can use
collective intelligence to make
them better?”

•

•

•

Start by: reading ‘What is collective
intelligence?’ on p.14.

Introduce your group to a quick exercise to
bring the concept of collective intelligence to
life (see section 8).

Look at the case study selection in section 2,
p.20.

• Check out our Trello boards which list many
more collective intelligence projects and
tools (links provided in the 'More resources'
section at the end of this playbook)

• Discuss the collective intelligence design

principles on p.40. How might applying these
change the way you currently do things?

•

Try out some of the workshop activities in
section 7 to boost your event’s collective
intelligence.

• Read the Overcoming Biases Guide (Activity

D2 on page p.152) to be aware of potential
pitfalls.

• Review the ORID, Generative Decision

Making, Open Space and Group Dialogue
Guides and experiment with these formats.

PG. 8

NESTA ― V.00101 / 09
“We want an overview of what collective
intelligence design involves.”

• Read the section ‘An introduction to collective intelligence design’

on p.34.

•

Look through the key design questions, and the prompt cards.

“We want to design a collective
intelligence project.”

• Agree your main purpose for wanting to design a collective

intelligence project and find the correct navigation page in section
4 of this playbook: understand problems on p.52 ; seek solutions on
p.56; decide and act on p.60; learn and adapt on p.64.

• Print out the collective intelligence design canvas template (A3 or

A2), as well as the specific design questions relevant to
your purpose.

• Use the navigation page to see which activities are suggested, and
pick those that you think will be most useful for your group and
project. You should use them to explore the design questions in
greater depth.

• Print out any prompt cards or worksheets you need.

• Work through the design questions set out at each stage with your

group. Identify someone to be the group facilitator.

• Populate your canvas as your group answers the design questions.

Allow time for reflection and iteration.

• Use activities such as prototyping to bring your project to life and
identify any aspects that are missing or need to be changed.

“We want to make suggestions on how you
could add to or improve this playbook.”

• Drop us a line at collective.intelligence@nesta.org.uk

hack this playbook!

This is our beta-version of the
Collective Intelligence Design
Playbook.

It’s a first attempt to bring together some core
resources to help innovators design for collective
intelligence. We know there’s probably a lot that we’ve
missed but hope you’ll help us out with identifying
those omissions. It’s a living collection - please help us
make it better for future versions.

Help us create version 2.0! Please send us:

1. Corrections and edits of errors.

2. Additions for the collective intelligence

design sections:

a. New activities that can help to answer

the design questions.

b. Suggestions for key design questions

that we missed.

c. Suggestions for new prompt cards.

d. Top tips.

3. Your filled in versions of the design canvas.

Collective intelligence design is modular so
there are infinite possibilities depending on
the challenge you want to address. We hope
you’ll share your design blueprints so that we
can continue building an open repository of
collective intelligence projects to inspire others.

This version of the playbook is aimed at
relative newcomers to collective intelligence,
but we want to keep adding more advanced
techniques too.

Please leave your suggestions as comments
in the Google Doc draft of the main text or
directly on the Google slides (for activities &
guides). You can follow a link to these on the
Nesta website page for this playbook.

Please send suggestions for additional
activities, or your versions of hacked activities
and completed canvases to
collective.intelligence@nesta.org.uk with 'CI
Playbook: Version 2.0' as the subject line.

Tell us what you’ve done or what you’d
suggest and you’ll get a credit in our updated
version (as well as our gratitude).

greater than the sum of
the parts

Collective intelligence is created when
people work together, often with the
help of technology, to mobilise a
wider range of information, ideas and
insights to address a social challenge.

As an idea, it isn’t new. It’s based on the theory that
groups of diverse people are collectively smarter
than any single individual on their own. The premise
is that intelligence is distributed. Different people
hold different pieces of information and different
perspectives that, when combined, create a more
complete picture of a problem and how to solve it.

Humans have of course been working together since the dawn of time. But since the start of the
digital age, collective intelligence has really evolved.

How is technology amplifying collective intelligence?

1. Technologies such as the internet now help us to pool ideas in entirely new ways, and

connect people across huge distances. Through this, we can bring more brains together - like
Wikipedia does.

2. Smart technologies help us generate new sources of data. We can use satellite imagery or
mobile phone data, for example, to create new intelligence on our world and societies.

3. Machine intelligence can enhance our human intelligence. Technologies like AI can analyse
large volumes of data to help us make better predictions or more quickly understand lots of
unstructured information.

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE IN HISTORY

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE TODAY

WIKIPEDIA

Thousands of individuals around
the world contribute their
knowledge and improve on each
other’s work.

ZOONIVERSE

Over a million people are using
the platform to analyse satellite
images of space to help identify
new stars.

WAZE

Combines location data from
mobile phones of commuters
and crowdsourced information
on accidents or hazards to create
real-time traffic maps.

The big message is that we can now make the most
of human intelligence at scale, novel data, and clever
technology to help us solve complex problems.

19TH CENTURY

20TH CENTURY

1920s

1990s

In the 19th century,
the Oxford English
Dictionary was
produced through
the collaboration of
thousands of volunteers
who submitted words
and their etymologies to
its editors.

In the early 20th
century, the statistician
Francis Galton observed
a competition to guess
the weight of a cow at
a country fair. He found
that the individual
answers varied widely,
but when he added all
the answers up and
found the average, it
was just 1lb different to
the cow’s real weight.

In the 1920s Gandhi
used a challenge prize
to reward designers –
from anywhere – who
could design a precisely
specified cheap
cloth loom.

In the 1990s, Porto
Alegre in Brazil
pioneered a new
approach to allocating
public spending. The
municipal government
allowed citizens to
debate and vote on how
public funds should be
spent in a process called
participatory budgeting
that has since been
adopted all around
the world.

people

together

data

technology

By bringing together diverse groups of people,
data, and technology, we can create a collective
intelligence that is greater than the individual
parts in isolation. And by doing this, we can
achieve things far beyond what any individual
human or machine could achieve alone.

This playbook is designed to show
you how to do this in practice.

why do we need
collective intelligence?

Have you ever wondered how we
managed to put people on the
moon, but can’t sort out how to
care for our ageing population?
Or how we can create machines
that beat the world’s best chess
players, but are struggling to
stem the tide of online hate?

multiple levels from policies to institutions and
individual behaviour.

Solving complex problems requires new
approaches to problem solving: using new
sources of data to rapidly understand the
dynamics of what is happening; harnessing
collective brainpower to generate multiple
solutions much more quickly; facilitating space
to think, reflect and decide collectively on
a new course of action; and the capacity to
harness data for real-time adjustments and
orchestrating knowledge that enables others
to act too.

The difference is in the nature of those
challenges. Humans (and machines) are
very good at solving complicated technical
challenges, where logical thought and
linear thinking can get us to the finish line.
But solving complex social, environmental,
economic or political challenges is much
harder. These challenges are often multi-
dimensional and decentralised. They usually
can’t be fixed with a silver bullet solution or by
a single organisation. Often they emerge or
change at a faster rate than our ability to act -
especially when the environment
is unpredictable.

The most critical challenges facing us today
are complex challenges. The Sustainable
Development Goals are an example of
this type of challenge: interconnected,
transboundary and requiring change at

To do this, organisations and communities
need to become skilled in mobilising
intelligence of all kinds - data, information,
insights and ideas. In the 21st century, we
believe this will matter as much as mobilising
money or power. The Collective Intelligence
Design Playbook is our first attempt to help
organisations do this well.

Note: even if there are already well-proven
solutions, or if one group of experts has all the
relevant knowledge, there may still be value in
using collective intelligence tools. For example,
getting heart surgeons in the UK and parts of
India to share their methods and regularly review
data on survival rates sharply improved their
performance, turning them from hundreds of
individual experts into something more like a
collective intelligence.

PG. 17

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK
1. Better understanding of problems:
through crowdsourcing, using novel
data, or combining existing data sets
to generate insights, facts, information
or predictions. Examples of this
are PetaBencana1, a platform that
crowdsources reports of flooding in Jakarta
from citizens on Twitter to create real-time
flood maps used by citizens; and Haze
Gazer2, a crisis analysis and visualisation
tool that provides real-time situational
information by combining multiple data
sets to enhance disaster
management efforts.

2. Finding solutions to a problem:

either through tapping into the collective
brainpower of citizens, a wider pool
of innovators, or seeking out tested
solutions from elsewhere. Examples of
this are Wefarm3, a free SMS peer-to-peer
information service for small-scale farmers
in East Africa; or BlockByBlock4, where
citizens can co-create their community
space. Tools like AllOurIdeas allow citizens
to contribute their ideas about what their
city should look like.5

3. More informed and inclusive decisions:
by bringing together a diverse range of
people and relevant actors to discuss,
prioritise and implement ideas. An
example of this is vTaiwan, a hybrid
online and offline consultation process
to crowdsource citizen priorities and
achieve consensus among competing
perspectives.6 Tools like Loomio7 and Pol.is8
are enabling online group decision-making
at scale on policies, budgets, planning
and more.

4. Learning and sharing what works:

through crowdsourcing information and
creating shared repositories of knowledge.
Examples include Public Lab’s work to hold
BP accountable for the Gulf oil spill clear-
up through citizen monitoring, and the
creation of open source tools to help other
community groups monitor environmental
changes.9 The Human Diagnosis Project
crowdsources and ranks diagnostic advice
from thousands of doctors to provide
ongoing training for health professionals
and medical students.10

how can collective
intelligence help us?

Collective intelligence is a multiplier
that brings new insights and ideas.
When you incorporate collective
intelligence into your way of working, it
can help you to innovate and address
problems more effectively.

Here is an overview of four ways that
collective intelligence can help you:

PG. 18

NESTA ― V.00102 / 09
understand problems

Generate contextualised
insights, facts and information
on the dynamics of a situation.

Monitor the implementation of
initiatives by involving citizens in
generating data, and share knowledge
to improve the ability of others.

learn and adapt

seek solutions

Find novel approaches or tested
solutions from elsewhere. Or incentivise
innovators to create new ways of
tackling the problem.

Make decisions with, or informed by,
collaborative input from a wide range of
people and/or relevant experts.

decide and act

You can use collective intelligence at any
stage in a typical innovation process, for
policy design or designing new products
and services in business.

so what?
The data collected is enabling people across
all levels of society to improve flood mitigation
plans and raise awareness and resilience
to natural threats. In 2015 it helped public
authorities responding to an unexpected
outbreak of cholera, providing detailed
information on water points and
sanitation data.

ramanihuria.org

why?
In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the rainy season
can bring devastating floods that wipe out
roads and buildings. The damage caused by
these floods could be prevented with adequate
planning, but much of the city is made up of
unplanned and informal settlements.

what?
Ramani Huria helps communities to map
residential areas, roads, streams, floodplains,
and other relevant features, aiming to bring
disaster prevention and response to areas that
were previously off the map.

how?
The project trains teams of local university
students and community members to use
OpenStreetMap to create sophisticated and
accurate maps. Residents of Tandale, an
informal settlement in Dar es Salaam, first
mapped key local features on OpenStreetMap
in 2011. This map was updated and improved
in 2015 using aerial drone imagery. The maps
are combined with other data in InstaSAFE,
a free software that enables users to run
realistic natural disaster scenarios for better
planning and response. Maps data are publicly
available online and in print with an open
license, making it easier for government,
researchers and people to freely and openly
use and redistribute them.

issues including LGBTI rights, river and lake
revitalization and universal internet access.
The constitution was formally approved in
February 2017 with crowdsourced components
providing an important influence on policy.
For instance, one provision allows transgender
people to change their gender on official
documents without having to go through a
judicial process.

why?
In 2016, the Mexican federal government
granted Mexico City the ability to adopt its
own citywide constitution, but the process
allowed very little input by the people
(assuming the draft would be provided
exclusively by the Mayor).

what?
In order to build trust and gather fresh ideas,
Mayor Ángel Mancera decided to crowdsource
the constitution from local residents. He
appointed a 28-person drafting committee
made up of Mexico City residents, supported
by technical staff to translate ideas into
legal language.

how?
To solicit ideas for the constitution, the City set
up a survey called Imagina tu Ciudad (Imagine
Your City) to gather local people’s visions for
the city. The survey was made available online
and offline, with one strategy including the
recruitment of 200 student volunteers, armed
with tablets to gather responses from citizens
in public spaces. In addition to the survey,
the City also worked with Change.org so
people could petition for specific articles to be
included in the constitution. Any ideas gaining
10,000 signatures or more were given the
chance to present to the drafting committee.

so what?
By the end of the process the City had
collected 26,000 survey responses, and
280,000 signatures on 357 petitions on

PG. 23

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK02 / 09
so what?
More than 130 governments in 35 countries
have used Citymart to date. In San Francisco
Citymart delivered 50 previously unknown
proposals for an open standards street light
system. In Detroit, it found over 1,600 matching
vendors for the government's Smart
City Strategy.

Citymart.com

why?
Procurement is how every city buys goods and
services that it cannot obtain internally, but
often the process can be top-down, or overly
prescriptive, in a way that excludes some of
the most innovative or cost-effective solutions.

what?
Citymart helps cities to get more competitive
and more innovative ideas in their
procurement processes through diversifying
cities’ vendor pools and involving more SMEs.

how?
Citymart crowdsources solutions to specific
urban problems through competition. Cities
post their requirements on a crowdsourcing
platform (BidSpark), which matches the
requirements to thousands of potential
vendors. Vendors can then apply, or rate the
procurement, providing feedback to the City.
The huge vendor database of 27,000 solutions

creating one of the largest repositories
of patient-reported, cross-condition data
available today. Its data forms the basis

researchers to refute traditional randomized
clinical trials, model multiple diseases, validate
quality measures and shed new light on
medication adherence.

Peer-support among patients living with a
chronic health condition can help people
better manage their conditions, share
knowledge and provide a level of ongoing

members, through which patients connect with
others who have the same disease or condition
and track and share their own experiences.

how?
Patients can use the platform to ask questions,
learn how others manage their symptoms
and learn about or discover treatments that
might work for them, or use tracking tools that
help them better understand their health and
make more informed decisions. The website
now provides information on more than 1,000
life-changing illnesses from multiple sclerosis

why?
In the aftermath of the BP oil spill on the Gulf
Coast in 2010, an alliance of activists sought
to track information about the spill and the
extent of natural disaster. Due to its distance
at sea, common tools and methods of aerial
mapping were not easily applicable.

what? how?
Using simple DIY tools - such as balloon
mapping to capture aerial imagery - a
collective of more than a hundred volunteers
worked together to gather data and visualise
the extent of the environmental damage. This
dataset was not otherwise publicly available
and empowered the local community to take
action against polluters and regulators.

so what?
Since 2010, Public Lab has grown into a
global community who share tools, methods
and other resources online to investigate
environmental concerns. Using a combination
of online documentation, iterative adaptation
of open source tools and community building
through both distributed and face-to-face
processes, Public Lab has been adapted to

In 2018 Global Fishing Watch published a
‘live’ global view of likely transshipping at
sea (a legal but poorly regulated activity),
and led to the first ever global assessment of
transshipment published in a scientific journal.

globalfishingwatch.org

why?
Hundreds of millions of people depend on
the oceans for their livelihoods; more than
a billion people rely on fish as their primary
source of nutrition. But today, threatened
by illegal fishing, overfishing, and habitat
destruction, the global fish population is in
crisis; some species’ numbers have dropped by
a staggering 90 per cent.

what? who?
Global Fishing Watch is a remote vessel
tracking system launched by Google in
partnership with other organisations that aims
to address this. Through greater transparency
of global commercial fishing activity, the
project is committed to advancing ocean
sustainability and stewardship.

how?
The system works by combining government
data on commercial fishing fleets with
data from automatic identification systems
(AIS) that large ships use to broadcast their
position in order to avoid collisions. Ground
stations and satellites pick up this and other
information about the vessels’ identity, course
and speed. Vessel tracking information is
made available through an interactive online
map and downloadable data, aimed at
members of the public and journalists as much
as researchers, campaigners and governments.
Partnerships with countries to share and
combine data are also key to making
monitoring cheaper and more effective

Wefarm is a free peer-to-peer service that
enables small-scale farmers in Kenya, Uganda,

Wefarm’s network allows small-scale farmers
to ask each other questions on anything
related to agriculture and then receive
crowdsourced bespoke content and ideas from
other farmers around the world within minutes.
The questions can be asked in any language
and messaging is free of charge.

If farmers don’t have internet access, which
is often the case in rural communities,
they can access Wefarm via SMS on their
mobile phones. Wefarm's machine learning
algorithms then match each question to the
best suited responder. The natural language
processing model can identify three regional
African languages – Kiswahili, Luganda, and
Runyankore – in addition to English. The fact
that Wefarm users don't need proficiency in
English increases reach and access.

more timely and effective way

increased power and ability of citizens to act

For many organisations, responding to
complex problems is often made difficult
by a lack of current or useful data, slow
innovation pipelines and disagreement on
how to proceed. Using collective intelligence
to mobilise new sources of data (from sensors
to citizen-generated information) and ideas
will generate more comprehensive and up-to-
date insights, and more appropriate solutions
for action. Collective intelligence can also
help stakeholders, experts and affected
communities come to greater agreement on
priorities for action.

AIME can predict the location of the next outbreak
of dengue fever up to three months in advance. It
does this by combining data on confirmed cases
of dengue from doctors, with multiple datasets
on the factors that affect the spread of dengue.11

Resilience Dialogues was a set of facilitated
discussions between experts and communities
in the US. Combining their ideas led to more
robust local climate action plans.12

Collective intelligence often involves people
in generating information and opens up
information for people to use. People’s
ability to make decisions and power to act is
increased when they have relevant and timely
information about their situation and options.
This enables citizens to share responsibility in
tackling social problems.

• Madam Mayor, I have an idea is a participatory

smarter cities and communities

When collective intelligence projects integrate
different types of available information they
can help to coordinate and influence the
activities of people and organisations in new
ways. By doing this, collective intelligence
initiatives can act like a central nervous system
for cities or local communities - helping them
to react, remember, think and plan.

Data collaboratives, data warehouses and
open APIs are some of the methods that are
typically used in these data-driven collective
intelligence projects.

production, problem-solving, co-creation and
prediction-making. Methods can include crowd
forecasting, deliberation and peer-to-peer
exchange.

that the UK’s exit from the EU would not
happen as originally planned at the end of
March 2019.

connecting people with data

This form of collective intelligence brings both
people and data together. It often involves
crowds generating, categorising, cleaning,
sorting or tagging unstructured data, photos
or PDFs. Citizen science, crowdsourcing, and
crowdmapping are typical methods to
achieve this.

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK02 / 09

what is not collective
intelligence?

In some respects all of human
civilisation is an expression
of collective intelligence. But
there are lots of examples of
practices that are the opposite of
what we see as good collective
intelligence. Such as:

• Closed organisations that make no use

of the ideas and experience beyond their
boundaries.

• Using collective intelligence methods
to surveil participants or manipulate
behaviour and outcomes.

• Dictators and autocrats making decisions
alone, or just relying on their intuition.

• Crowds that lack any common language

or frames and so become a cacophony
of voices and views without any mutual
listening (like much contemporary social
media).

• Crowds joined together by belief, ideology

and dogma, and resistant to new
information or ideas.

• Markets shaped by incentives that

encourage myopia in relation to risks.

• Extracting data from a crowd without
offering any reciprocal benefits to
contributors or failing to act on the insights
generated.

These examples demonstrate that collective
intelligence is far from the default in society. It
is only through careful and deliberate design
choices that we can get closer to making the
most of the different resources of
intelligence available.

increase diversity of the people you involve
and the opinions you listen to.

2

enable people to contribute views and ideas
independently and freely.

Research shows diversity of people and
perspectives can enhance the collective
intelligence of a group. In fact, diverse
groups often outperform groups of like-
minded experts and the brightest individuals
too. Don’t just include the ‘usual suspects’
in your project. Bring together people with
different experiences, ways of understanding,
interpreting and solving problems (this is
known as cognitive diversity) to help you
address your challenge more successfully.

You’ve successfully brought together a diverse
group of thinkers and solvers. But groups
can still be dominated by the loudest person,
minority views can often be ignored, and
groupthink can lead you to the wrong answer.
Enable people to contribute their intelligence
freely and independently, taking care to think
about how you manage group dynamics and
behaviour to mitigate against biases and
make sure every voice is heard.

integrate different types of data to unlock
fresh insights.

be citizen-centered: data empowerment, not
data extraction.

The emerging variety of real-time, ‘ground-
truth’ and novel data sources is helping us
to build better models of the world. Think
carefully about which data and information
can help you to measure or describe the
problem you’re interested in, from proxy
indicators to inputs from those most closely
affected by the problem. Select, test and
combine new sources of insight to improve
the timeliness and appropriateness of
your response.

Start with the problems that matter to people
not a particular technology. Don’t just use
people to extract the information you want,
but make sure they can access and use
the collective intelligence that is created.
Involve people in producing and using data
by working with them as agents of change not
passive beneficiaries. Ensure people understand
and can determine how their data is used.
Create for the public commons where possible
- opening up information and technology for
others to use. Applying this principle will help
you avoid some of the potential risks of using
collective intelligence.

collective intelligence
design process

At the heart of the playbook are four purposes for using collective intelligence
design: to understand problems; seek solutions; decide and act; and learn and
adapt. In this playbook, we’ll also refer to them as categories of
collective intelligence.

The starting point for collective intelligence design is to have clarity on what
you want to use collective intelligence for. Select a purpose, informed by the
issue you’re seeking to address. This is the guiding star of how your group will
design collective intelligence, and how you will navigate this playbook.

understand
problems

Generate contextualised
insights, facts and information
on the dynamics of a situation.

seek
solutions

Find novel approaches or tested
solutions from elsewhere. Or
incentivise innovators to create new
ways of tackling the problem.

There is no hierarchy among the
different purposes of collective
intelligence, nor do they have to be
used sequentially. They can, however,
be used in combination. The case
studies illustrate how this modular
approach has been adopted by many
examples of collective intelligence
in practice.

Public Lab initially engaged 100 volunteers in community mapping activities
to understand the problems caused by the Gulf oil spill and track BP’s clean-
up efforts. As the community matured it wanted to share its knowledge with
other community groups. To do this, it created an open source repository of DIY
community monitoring tools so that other groups could learn and adapt for
their own purposes.

stages of collective
intelligence design.

STAGE:
DEFINE CHALLENGE

A

What is our issue and our purpose for using collective intelligence?
The first step is to clarify the issue you are addressing and why it is important. You
should also spell out your reason for using collective intelligence - is it to understand
a problem, find a solution, make a decision or to learn/share what’s working? Being
clear on purpose and the change you want to see will help you keep focused on
achieving your outcome.

STAGE:
GATHER DATA,
INFORMATION & IDEAS

B

What data/information/ideas do we need to find, and how will we do it?
Any project needs to start with a good understanding of the information it already
has, what it can access and what it needs. This stage is about exploring uncommon
sources of data and insight that might illuminate your issue in a new way, and the
methods you can use to gather them effectively.

STAGE:
MOBILISE PEOPLE

STAGE:
CONNECT & INTERPRET

C

D

Who might be able to help, and how can we best engage them?
Collective intelligence design can help you tap into distributed experience and
expertise to answer your questions. For this to happen, the goal needs to be clear,
'the crowd' needs to be carefully defined and targeted, and the motivations and
incentives of those participating need to be considered.

How will we bring together people and/or data, and make sense of the results?
In this design stage, you will design how people will contribute and interact when
they’re brought together, considering how to manage group dynamics to draw out
the best from your crowd. You’ll also think about how you will store and process any
data you’ve collected. Finally, you’ll need a plan for turning often messy data or
unstructured text into useful results and insights.

STAGE:
CREATE CHANGE

E

Who do we need to act, and what do they need to do this?
Here you’ll design how to turn the results of collective intelligence into action in
the real world. You’ll create a prototype and testing plan, and make sure you have
thought about how you’ll feedback to participants and open up information for them
to use.

PG. 43

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK03 / 09
collective intelligence
design questions

Each design stage has a number
of key design questions. These
will help guide you to find the
right answers for your challenge.

There is a set of design questions for each of the four different purposes of collective intelligence. You
can find them on the relevant navigation page - your starting point once you have selected whether you
want to understand a problem; seek solutions; decide and act; or learn and adapt.

Example: Design questions for understand problems.

You should attempt to answer all these design questions as best you can. We suggest you work through
them sequentially stage-by-stage. You should also allow time for reflection and iteration. As you work,
you may find that answers to previous questions need to change - so pause to check and
refine periodically.

For each purpose of collective intelligence, there is an associated canvas pre-populated with the specific
design questions relevant to your purpose. Print out a copy of this canvas for reference, alongside a
blank one for your team to fill in (printing it out on A2 or A1 size will make it easier for your group to work
on collectively).

PROMPT
CARDS

collective intelligence methods and tactics

Included in this playbook are six different decks of
prompt cards.

These prompt cards contain a variety of popular collective intelligence methods
or tactics.

Each card provides a summary of the tactic or method, and a short case study
that illustrates its use in practice.

The combination of methods and tactics that you choose to use are highly
important. They are the means to your end goal of collective intelligence. Some
might be new or less familiar to you, while others have existed for decades.

You should be prepared to experiment with combinations until you find what
works best.

The prompt cards are just a selection to help you get started, they are not
exhaustive. Don’t be restricted by them - instead use them as a basis for
exploring a range of approaches and select the most appropriate combination.

The decks and cards are clearly labelled so you know which design stage
they relate to, and which categories of collective intelligence projects they are
usually found in.

You should print these out double-sided before beginning your design activity.

PG. 45

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK03 / 09

ACTIVITIES

mix and match worksheets and guides

Each stage contains a series of worksheets and guides to help
deepen or stretch your thinking on particular design questions.
Many have been curated from toolkits that we admire, while
others have been created especially for this playbook.

You don’t need to try all of these activities at every stage every
time you design a collective intelligence project. Select a few
that you think will be most useful.

If you have just one day, you will probably be designing at a
very high-level, using only 2-3 additional activities beyond the
canvas and design questions. If you have a week, or longer, you
may want to dive deeper and complete a larger number of the
exercises together.

Each activity and exercise has a suggested timing and group
size to help you select appropriately. We also signpost which
design question and design stage it relates to.

As you become familiar with the playbook, we hope you will
find the activities that work best for you, adapt them further, or
even add your own.

You will find all activities grouped together in the relevant
design stage section of this playbook. For quick reference,
refer to the navigation page for Understand Problems, Seek
Solutions, Decide and Act, and Learn and Adapt. These will
give you the page numbers of relevant activities.

PG. 46

NESTA ― V.00103 / 09

the pointers for discussion or reflection

Each design stage includes a number of pointers that you
should discuss or reflect on as a team. They are based on
existing research and practice from the collective intelligence
field. We suggest you do this at the outset of moving into each
design stage.

CASE STUDY: PETABENCANA.ID

PetaBencana.id, is a project that combines data from hydraulic sensors with
citizen reports over social media including via Twitter, to produce a flood map for
cities in Indonesia. The system is programmed to react when someone in Jakarta
tweets the word ‘banjir’ (flood) and tags @PetaJkt. PetaBencana.id automatically
replies, and asks them to confirm the tweet with geotagged photos. The platform
then combines all incoming reports with official data from the city government
to build up-to-the-minute, online flood maps, which are then made publicly

available. Through producing real-time maps of urban flooding,
PetaBencana.id represents a major advance on previous static
PDF maps.

The page opposite provides an illustration of a project design canvas
using the example of PetaBencana. It is not exhaustive, but is intended
to give you an idea of how to start filling in the canvas.

CASE STUDY: WEFARM

Wefarm is a free peer-to-peer service that enables small-scale farmers in Kenya,
Uganda, and Tanzania to share information via SMS, without the internet and
without having to leave their farm. Wefarm’s network allows small-scale farmers
to ask each other questions on anything related to agriculture and then receive
crowdsourced bespoke content and ideas from other farmers around the world
within minutes. The questions can be asked in any language and messaging is free
of charge. It’s now the world’s largest farmer-to-farmer digital network, with more

than 1 million farmers using it in Kenya and Uganda, sharing more than
40,000 questions and answers daily.

The page opposite provides an illustration of a project design canvas

Our issue is that ... The vast majority of smallholder
farmers lack access to relevant information to help
them solve problems or increase productivity.

We want to ... help farmers to share solutions and
learn from one another without needing to leave
their farm.

Who will use the solutions: smallholder farmers
in remote rural areas.

How will we reach them: SMS for simple, low barrier
to entry and accessible interface

Motivation: ‘ASK ME’ command, offers rewards
for farmers who contribute the most solutions (glory)

Who will adopt: multiple solutions sent back to the
farmer by SMS.

Tracking impact: data can also be used to monitor key issues
affecting regions, e.g. disease, ripening periods, or soil conditions.

Process for sharing solutions:
• machine learning determines language, content and intent of
incoming messages and matches with relevant solution.
• volunteers help to translate questions into different languages

CASE STUDY: VTAIWAN

vTaiwan is a hybrid online and offline consultation process used by the Taiwanese
government to crowdsource citizen priorities and achieve consensus among
competing perspectives. It does this by creating several stages, including an initial
‘objective’ stage for crowdsourcing facts and evidence, and a ‘reflective’ stage
using mass deliberation tool Pol.is, which encourages the formation of ‘rough
consensus’. Finally, key stakeholders are invited to a live-streamed, face-to-face
meeting to draw up specific recommendations. vTaiwan’s achievements to date
include: a crowdsourced bill successfully passed through parliament on Closely
Held Company Law; the resolution of a disagreement between civil society
activists on the topic of internet alcohol sales; and the ratification of several items
on ridesharing (Uber) regulations.

The page opposite provides an illustration of a project design canvas using the

What do we need to know: statistics and key facts about
ridesharing from different government departments.

Method for gathering data:
• create live documents containing key definitions to avoid

misunderstanding.

• ask ministries to publish data in user-friendly format.

Key stakeholders: taxi drivers, Uber drivers, unions, business
representatives and passengers.

How do we reach those people: use newsletter, digital marketing
(e.g. Facebook Ads) and online forum to recruit participants
and raise awareness.

DEFINE CHALLENGE
What is our issue and our purpose for using
collective intelligence?

Motivation: targeted audiences have a stake
in the issue (purpose)

Our problem is that: ridesharing is causing disruption
of the local taxi industry in Taiwan. It is also
largely unregulated.

We want to: help ministers to decide on new
regulations for ridesharing that achieve consensus
among diverse stakeholders affected by the industry.

Who will act: recommendations sent to relevant
government department for final decision

Sharing information: all information from the consultation
made fully open (e.g. transcripts ,videos, open data) to improve
legitimacy and trust

Bringing people together: participants asked to
reflect on facts gathered in the previous stages

How people interact: use online deliberation tool
Pol.is to gather reflections, ideas and suggestions from
key stakeholders.

Type of decisions: highest consensus statements on Pol.is (80
per cent or more) taken forward to live-streamed face-to-face
discussion with key stakeholders

CASE STUDY: HUMAN DX

The Human DX is an online platform that aggregates and ranks medical expertise
about medical cases and possible diagnoses. It crowdsources teaching cases
and advice from thousands of doctors and also asks them to rank each other’s
entries to identify those that the community find most useful to learn from. Cases
are collected using structured data entry to capture the clinical decision making
process in a standardised format. This is used to train a machine learning system
and make the information easily searchable. The cases are turned into quizzes for

medical students to help them test, learn and improve their diagnostic
reasoning. The project is already impacting both medical training and
clinical decision-making.

The page opposite provides an illustration of a project design canvas
using the example of HumanDx. It is not exhaustive, but is intended to
give you an idea of how to start filling in the canvas.

GATHER DATA, INFORMATION, IDEAS
What data/information/ideas do we need to find, and how will we do it?

MOBILISE PEOPLE
Who might be able to help, and how can we best engage them?

C

Data / information needs:
• a diverse set of medical cases with symptoms
• possible diagnoses for submitted cases
•

info on learning habits and needs of medical students

Method for gathering data: online crowdsourcing of
diagnoses and medical cases

Who can help: doctors, medical students, professional healthcare
bodies, medical schools

Methods: gamification to improve learning experience of users

Motivation: improving diagnostic capabilities (purpose),
supporting training throughout medical
careers (expertise), peer recognition (glory)

A

DEFINE CHALLENGE
What is our issue and our purpose for using
collective intelligence?

Our problem is that… Global medical knowledge on
medical cases, symptoms and diagnosis is distributed
and siloed, which leads to inconsistent clinical
decision making.

We want to: help physicians and medical students
worldwide learn and improve diagnostic capabilities,
and empower others with the world's collective
medical insight.

Who will act:
• doctors contribute cases and diagnoses, review
cases submitted by others through platform

• students use the app the improve diagnostic ability

with quizzes

Make available for others: searchable open repository of cases
and diagnoses. Use API to develop new uses

How people interact: upvoting or peer-ranking to
interpret the relevance of diagnoses

Bring data together: moderation and peer review to
ensure the quality of submissions

Interpret: machine learning analysis to identify
patterns of learning

What solution(s) are we looking for?

collective intelligence design playbook

What is the problem we want to solve?

What would a ‘good’ solution look like?

What maturity of innovations do we need?

This is where you identify the criteria that are important to you (e.g., it
needs to be able to work in a setting with regular electricity outages).

What data are you already using?

What other data exists, which you are not using?

What new data could you create?

For example: official or government data, data from NGOs
or business.

Are there other types of data or datasets that might contribute
similar information, or act as a proxy measure?

Could you start collecting new types of data to help you now
and in the future?

official data

Official data can include longitudinal survey data,
such as census data, electoral registers or other
population data. Official data provide a long-term
picture of a country over time, and are usually
collected by public institutions or national statistical
agencies as a public good.

The single most important element is official
population records, including census data of official
cartographic resources such as administrative
boundaries. In some cases official data can date back
30 or more years, which is significant given the pace
of demographic and urban trends. Africapolis brings
these datasets together into a single, comparable
resource, as well as additional sources such as satellite
data to confirm the precise location of settlements.
By integrating thousands of smaller agglomerations
(covering inhabitants of a total of 180 million people)
Africapolis also highlights the role of smaller towns
and cities in urban networks, the emergence of new
urban areas and the increasing fluidity between urban
and rural environments.

open API

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provide the
standards by which data is accessed and transferred
between websites. Open APIs encourage collaboration
and are built using open standards, allowing them to
be freely accessed and used.

CASE STUDY: AFRICAPOLIS
Africapolis aims to be the most comprehensive
and standardised geospatial database on cities
and urbanisation dynamics in Africa. It blends data
from across the continent in an effort to provide
standardised, comparable insights into Africa’s fast-
changing urban populations.

Describe your project’s key data
sources, whether you’re collecting
data yourself or accessing via
third parties.Is any personal data
involved, or data that is
otherwise sensitive?

Are there limitations that could
influence your outcomes?

> bias in data collection, analysis,
algorithms

> gaps or omissions

> provenance/quality

> other issues affecting decisions?

Are you going to be sharing data
with other organisations? If so,
who? Are you planning to publish
any of the data?
Under what conditions?

ETHICAL AND LEGISLATIVE
CONTEXT

What existing ethical codes apply
to your sector or project? What
legislation, policies, or other
regulation shape how you use
data? What requirements do
they introduce?

collective intelligence design playbook

RIGHTS AROUND DATA SOURCES

Where did you get the data from?
Is it produced by an organisation or
collected directly from individuals?
Was the data collected for this
project or for another purpose? Do
you have permission to use this
data, or another basis on which
you’re allowed to use it? What
ongoing rights will the
data source have?

CASE STUDY: OPENAHJO
City Councils make hundreds of decisions every
month, and it can be hard for both citizens and civil
servants to follow the progress of legislation making
its way through government. Open Decisions is
Helsinki City Council’s attempt to standardise and
publish all of its decision making data electronically.
Data about meetings, agendas and decisions from all
across the council are tagged according to the Popolo
open government standard, and then made available
via an open API called OpenAhjo. By publishing the
data via an open API, a range of developers have
been able to create digital applications that notify
local residents when decisions are made on topics of
interest. It has also been used by city employees to
more easily search and track progress made by local
politicians.

YOUR REASON FOR USING DATA

What is your primary purpose
for collecting and using data in
this project? What are your main
use cases? What is your business
model? Are you making things
better for society? How and for
whom? Are you replacing another
product or service as a result of
this project?

ENGAGING WITH PEOPLE

How can people engage with you
about the project? How can people
correct information, appeal or
request changes to the product/
service? To what extent? Are appeal
mechanisms reasonable and
well understood?

COMMUNICATING YOUR
PURPOSE

Do people understand your
purpose – especially people who
the data is about or who are
impacted by its use? How have you
been communicating your purpose?
Has this communication been
clear? How are you ensuring more
vulnerable individuals or
groups understand?

POSITIVE EFFECTS ON PEOPLE

Which individuals, groups,
demographics or organisations
will be positively affected by
this project? How? How are you
measuring and communicating
positive impact? How could you
increase it?

NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PEOPLE
Who could be negatively affected
by this project? Could the way that
data is collected, used or shared
cause harm or expose individuals
to risk of being re-identified?
Could it be used to target, profile
or prejudice people, or unfairly
restrict access (eg exclusive
arrangements)? How are limitations
and risks communicated to people?
Consider: people who the data is
about, people impacted by its use
and organisations using the data.

MINIMISING NEGATIVE IMPACT

What steps can you take to
minimise harm? How could you
reduce any limitations in your data
sources? How are you keeping
personal and other sensitive
information secure? How are you
measuring, reporting and acting on
potential negative impacts of your
project? What benefits will these
actions bring to your project?

OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY

ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION

REVIEWS AND ITERATIONS

YOUR ACTIONS

How open can you be about this
project? Could you publish your
methodology, metadata, datasets,
code or impact measurements?
Can you ask peers for feedback
on the project? How will you
communicate it internally? Will you
publish your actions and answers
to this canvas openly?

Are you routinely building in
thoughts, ideas and considerations
of people affected in your project?
How? What information or training
might be needed to help people
understand data issues? Are
systems, processes and resources
available for responding to data
issues that arise in the long-term?

How will ongoing data ethics issues
be measured, monitored, discussed
and actioned? How often will
your responses to this canvas be
reviewed or updated? When?

What actions will you take before
moving forward with this project?
Which should take priority? Who
will be responsible for these
actions, and who must be involved?
Will you openly publish your
actions and answers to this canvas?

What barriers or challenges might prevent them from engaging with you?

Winner takes all prize
People are motivated to contribute
by the opportunity to gain income for
themselves or their team.
Eg. Challenge Prize

Task compensation
Individuals are motivated by the
guarantee of cash or other rewards (such
as vouchers) for completion of a task.
Eg. Amazon Mechanical Turk

Gaining recognition
Individuals are motivated by the thought
of having their knowledge and expertise
recognized by their peers.
E.g. Crowdsourcing platforms

Good feedback is immediate,
interpretable and identifies the usefulness
of contributions made by participants.
This can help them develop their skills.

Good communication is up to date,
accessible in the participants' own time,
two way, and doesn’t bombard people.

deliberation

Deliberation is a method of weighing up different
options through dialogue. It can typically be used
for engaging members of the public or participants
in considering trade-offs, and in establishing greater
understanding of one another’s views to arrive at more
consensus-driven and informed set of solutions
or recommendations.

POTENTIAL BIAS

Conformity Bias

When people suppress opinions or dissent to go along with group consensus.
Also known as group think.

• Allocate someone in the group to play devil’s advocate

• Gain everyone’s personal perspective first (e.g. through a silent brainstorm)

TACTICS TO OVERCOME BIAS

CASE STUDY: ESTONIAN PEOPLE’S ASSEMBLY
In 2012 the ruling Reform Party in Estonia was beset
by a scandal related to anonymous donations, which
sparked a national engagement exercise. The five-
stage process began with crowdsourcing of over
2,000 proposals on an online platform, on topics from
reducing barriers to creation of political parties, to
improving party conduct. The process then culminated
in a face-to-face deliberation between randomly
selected citizens. Over several days, the group was
tasked with sorting through the online proposals, and
making practical recommendations to the Parliament.
Fifteen proposals were submitted, leading to three
new items of legislation and another four proposals
being partially adopted.

Confirmation Bias

Authority Bias

Shared Information Bias

Anchoring Bias

In-Group Out-Group Bias

Interpreting all new evidence as confirmation of existing belief/theories, or rejecting
information that doesn’t confirm existing views.

• Actively seek out evidence that contradicts the group’s theory/world view

• Ensure you have a diverse group

• Use techniques like ‘six hat’ thinking

The opinions of those with the highest social status, or greatest seniority get
prioritised.
This can also occur if there is a very dominant or confident individual in the group.

• Level the field by removing hierarchies among participants where possible

•

Introduce turn-taking and prevent interruptions or collect input anonymously

• Ensure the leader doesn’t state their opinion too early

The tendency for group members to spend more time and energy discussing
information that all members are already familiar with (i.e., shared information), and
less time and energy discussing information that only some members are aware of
(i.e. unshared information).

• Avoid time pressure or other constraints that might dissuade group members

from sharing more information

• Listen out for the minority view for hidden insights

A tendency to jump to conclusions by basing decisions on information or an idea
gained early on in the decision-making process. Also known as first-impression bias.

• Allow time for group deliberation, reasoning and checking of logic

A pattern of favoring members of one's in-group over out-group members. This
can be expressed in being more positive and helpful towards one’s in-group, at the
expense
of others.

• Look for commonalities between opposing groups

• Encourage empathy - asking people to put themselves in another person’s shoes

STAGE:
CONNECT & INTERPRET

D1

STAGE:
CONNECT & INTERPRET

D1

Optimism Bias

Overestimating the probability of positive events or effects and underestimating the
probability of negative events or effects.

• Undertake a ‘pre-mortem’, asking the group to imagine that their solution or

project has gone very badly wrong and describe how this happened.

• This will help people think ahead.

DAILY TASKS

• Welcome new members in comments, messages or with an email

• Encourage new members to post pictures for their ideas and profiles

proxy indicator analysis

In statistics, a proxy is a variable that is not directly
relevant, but can serve in place of an unobservable or
measurable variable. Proxy indicator analysis is useful
for inferring a measurement for unavailable data
based on known correlated information.

CASE STUDY: UNDP SUDAN
The UNDP office in Sudan tested the use of satellite
data for estimating poverty levels via changing
night-time energy consumption. The team used data
pulled from night-time satellite imagery and analysed
these illumination values over a two-year period, in
conjunction with electric power consumption data
provided by the national electricity authority. The
proof-of-concept showed that night-time satellite
imagery provided a reasonable proxy for poverty,
though more detailed analysis with higher spatial and
temporal resolution would have provided a better
result. The experiment demonstrated the feasibility
of using satellite imagery and machine learning
to understand poverty, which a number of other
organisations have continued to explore.

A common challenge for collective intelligence
projects is how to visualise large volumes of
citizen generated text, ideas or interactions.
Good visualizations are not only important
to derive clear insights, they can also be
presented back to participants to boost
satisfaction and improve collective learning.

A range of different approaches can help
to make messy, unstructured data from
citizens more understandable and actionable.
Examples like Pol.is are a powerful way to
visualise consensus across a wide array of
ideas and opinions, whereas other activities
may be useful to visualise consensus within an
online forum-style setting (e.g. Your Priorities
and Kialo for larger groups, or Loomio for
smaller groups).

The diagram opposite provides some examples
and corresponding methods. Examples
vary in the types of input they require from
people, ranging from active to more passive
participation; and from quick and easy to
deeper, more deliberative engagement.

PROTOTYPING PHYSICAL STUFF
(EG. PRODUCTS, ROOMS, COMPONENTS)

PROTOTYPING INFORMATION
(EG. APPS, SIGNAGE OR LEAFLETS)

PROTOTYPING INTERACTIONS
(EG. MEETINGS, CALLS, VIDEO)

CASE STUDY: PREMISE
In Brazil, locals are paid to upload photos of
supermarket items to a platform called Premise. The
platform processes about 42,000 images per day,
each of which is vetted for accuracy and authenticity,
before being aggregated and analysed. The data then
becomes accessible via a dashboard, which can be
customized to display contributor activity with maps,
graphs or photo walls. As a result, commercial clients
are given access to data on their markets often weeks
before official government figures are released. NGOs
may also use the data to see where resources need to
be reassigned, and to understand or pre-empt
food shortages.

SCALE MODELLING

This is particularly useful for physical space when it isn’t practical
to build something at full-scale. Scale models can be built out of
materials such as cardboard, foamboard and Lego.

STORYBOARDING

BODYSTORMING

Storyboarding is a very early stage technique for prototyping.
Describing the idea as a six-step story helps to consolidate
thinking, test stakeholder reactions and capture feedback.

Bodystorming is technique of physically experiencing a situation
to derive new ideas. It requires setting up an experience -
complete with necessary artefacts and people - and physically
‘testing’ it. This is important when an idea relies on physical
interaction with a product or between people.

SIMULATION

PAPER PROTOTYPING

ROLE PLAY

We use commonly available materials to make something
physical to test with people. This isn’t about perfection, it’s all
about speed - making a prototype that people can react to and
give feedback.

Paper prototyping is a quick way to test using pens and paper.
This can include mock-ups of how information is organised and
shared through to mocking-up click-through screens for a
digital interaction.

Role plays help you to test out thinking by following a script or
by improvising (acting out a situation without prior preparation).
Instruction cards providing cues such as specific tasks to be
carried out, or character motivations, might be provided.

dashboard

Dashboards make data more useful by providing
quick and customizable visualisations of different data
streams or variables, usually represented interactively
on a screen.

DECISION ON PROPOSAL BY VISUAL
CONFIRMATION

Invite the group —
“would someone like
to make an initial
proposal?” This will
help the group move
forward into action
and there will be lots
of opportunities to
fine tune the proposal
together.

Hosting tips: Help
the proposer name a
proposal in ideally one
single sentence. Avoid
the proposal spreading
into multiple proposals.
Ensure that the proposal
is written for all to see
(separate from the
proposer) and repeat it
out loud.

The group has the
opportunity to voice
questions to the
proposer. The proposer
has two options i)
provides the answer or
ii) says "not specified" if
the answer is unknown.

Hosting tips: If someone
is speaking without a
question (i.e. reaction)
remind them that is
question period. Ensure
that all questions
are directed at the
proposer and no one else
intervenes. Avoid letting
the proposer speak about
anything further than
the direct answer (keep
it tight). Sense when the
clarification period is
about to finish (i.e. you
feel that people are ready
to react).

It is mandatory that
each person (minus the
proposer) expresses to
the group their reaction
to the proposal; the
different voices and
perspectives of all
need to be heard.
The proposer listens
deeply and takes notes.
Afterwards the proposer
will craft a new version
of the proposal.

Hosting tips: Begin with
the person who has the
most reactive emotion
and then go around, until
everyone has shared their
reaction. Make sure that
the reaction is not about
the proposer, but about
the proposal itself —
correct if necessary.

The proposer formulates
a new version of the
proposal in light of all
that has been spoken.
The host ensures that it
is written and visible to
all and reads it out loud.

Hosting tips: If you feel
that the proposer might
want to stay with the
same proposal, remind her
that she can. If you sense
that the proposer needs
support in formulating the
second version, remind her
that it is possible to ask
for help — however do not
rush into saying this.

An objection needs
to express a risk or a
backward movement
for the organisation/
initiative. All objections
are expressed to the
host who then decides
if the objection is valid
or not. If it is valid, then
the proposer needs to
integrate it into a new
version of the proposal.
(Then the objection
round is repeated).

Hosting tips:Sometimes
people might express
personal concerns that are
not in fact organisational/
project risks. This needs
to be differentiated. If it
is fuzzy you may ask for
help to the group. This is
the hardest part of the
process for the host.

Understand whether
the group is ready to
make a decision. Is
the context clear? Is
there information or
data that needs to be
gathered? Could an
open conversation help
develop the group’s
readiness to make
a decision?

Hosting tips: You
might need to offer the
group one or two open
conversation time slots
to get to this point (e.g..
“I am going to put the
timer on for 10 minutes
while you explore the
topic in question”). Offer
supplementary time slots
as necessary. You might
need to conclude that
the group is not ready to
make a decision, and this
is ok. Listen in deeply and
when you sense that there
is a possible proposal in
the air, the group is ready.
Invite the group to head
into the next step.

With a revised proposal, everyone
visually confirms “I can live with this
decision” by raising their thumb. This
is a way of allowing all to see that
everyone is fully on board with this
decision. If there is something that has
not been spoken that needs to be it
will show up because a person will be
unable to raise their thumb. This can
happen when i) someone is struggling
to find words to put on an idea that
is important to them or ii) someone is
disengaging in the process (holding
on to the possibility to question the
decision in the hallway thereafter).
Either way it will need to be addressed
and the group needs to return to the
part of the process that was not
fully addressed.

Note: It is good to have visual
confirmation as a cultural cue with
which the process may be fast tracked.
Someone makes a proposal and you
can just do a quick check in to see right
away if everyone could live with it.

Hosting tips: This is not a decision council
and it is not an opportunity to lower
thumbs and restart a process. It is simply a
visual confirmation. If the process has run
smoothly all thumbs should be raised. If
someone is struggling to find voice for an
objection, support the person and let them
know that all information is important.

OPEN SPACE OVERVIEW

WHAT IS A GROUP DIALOGUE?

PREPARING TO FACILITATE

GROUND RULES

TUNING IN PARTICIPANTS

1. BEGINNING

2. FRAMING

3. FORMING

4. FLOWING

5. CLOSING

All participants
start by sitting in a
big circle, with the
facilitator in the
middle, who explains
the process.

People are
encouraged to then
announce themes/
topics for breakout
sessions. There may
be a blank agenda
with timed slots and/
or table or room
numbers on the wall.

The facilitator
encourages those
who are passionate
about a topic
and wish to take
responsibility for
convening a meeting
to come to
the centre.

These participants
write down their
topic, announce it
to the group, with a
time and place to
meet, and return to
their seat.

When all topics have
been announced,
everyone moves to
sign up to those they
are interested in.
If there are similar
topics, people may
be asked if they
wish to combine
sessions. Everyone
then disperses and
attends the sessions
they have chosen.

People are actively
encouraged to flow
between sessions if
they wish, if they feel
they are not learning
or participating.

In each of the
groups, the
original convening
participant should
take notes of
key points.

At the end, all of
the different groups
reconvene to form
one big circle. In
turn, each person is
asked to reflect and
share one key insight
with the group as
a whole.

OPEN SPACE PRINCIPLES

There are several underlying principles key to
this process. They are:

1. Whoever comes are the right people.

2. Whatever happens is the only thing that

could have.

3. Whenever it starts is the right time.

4. Whenever it’s over, it's over.

A dialogue is a constructive and equal way of
having a discussion in a group of people. At
its core it is aimed at understanding others,
but not at reaching consensus. A dialogue can
generate new thinking and fresh insights.

A dialogue aims to create a trusting
atmosphere to support participants to gain
a deep understanding of almost any topic.
A dialogue supports the bringing together
of people from different backgrounds to an
encounter in which they are on an equal
footing.

For example, you can use a dialogue as part
of the preparation or before decision-making.

1. Plan how you will start the dialogue and
how people will introduce themselves.

Listen to the others, do not interrupt or start
side discussions.

2. Adapt the ground rules for discussion to

make them better suit your style.

Relate what you say to what the others have
said and use plain English.

3. Plan how you lean into the topic and

develop the initial question.

4. Familiarise yourself with the theme and

Talk about your own experience including
issues, events and situations that have shaped
your views.

capture questions related to the content of
the discussion.

Be present and respect the others and the
atmosphere of trust.

5. Consider how you will deepen the

discussion and conclude it.

6. Decide if the discussion needs to be
documented and how it will be done.

Work together. Talk to the others directly and
ask about their views as a way to deal with
emerging conflicts early.

Tuning in helps to build trust in which the
participants feel they are on an equal footing.
It moves the attention from other matters to
this moment – the space, the other people
and the topic discussed. Ensure you use
adequate time to build an atmosphere of
trust. Here are a few example questions to
help participants start tuning in:

• Who are you and what brings you here

today?

• What are the experiences in your mind
when you come to discuss this topic?

• What perceptions or feelings do you

associate with the topic?

• What is it like to talk about this together?

What do we want to aim at in this
discussion?

1. INTRODUCTIONS

2. IDENTIFY THE GOALS

Introduce yourself and explain that you are a facilitator
rather than a teacher and interested in the topic rather
than an expert.

Ask the participants to introduce themselves and
explain their interest in the topic.

In subsequent meetings at least 90 around the circle to
give names.

Make sure you all know why you are there.

Ask for a list of questions the participants
want answered.

Lay out a range of views. Ask the participants to
volunteer what they see as the main view on the issue
based on the reading material and their knowledge of
the issue.

Folded name cards in front of everybody may be
helpful.

Keep these lists and post them each meeting
for reference.

Review the agenda or study plan and adjust it to suit
the group.

3. PERSONAL CONNECTION OR INTEREST IN THE
ISSUE

Ask participants to talk about why this issue is
important to them.

Telling their story is a good ice-breaker at the
first session.

Anyone may pass.

ENCOURAGING PARTICIPANTS TO EXPRESS
THEIR EXPERIENCES

Share events, situations and experiences to
them or start side discussions.

Ask specifying questions about what they
share including reasons and consequences.

Talk about your own experience including
issues, events and situations that have shaped
your views.

Ask participants to consider and express what
kind of thoughts and experiences come to
mind when they listen to others.

WAYS TO DEEPEN THE DISCUSSION

ACTIVATING THE QUIET PARTICIPANTS

WHAT IS A GROUP DIALOGUE?

4. DISCUSSION AND DELIBERATION

5. SUMMARY AND COMMON GROUND

6. CLOSING

Ask the participants which kind of issues they
would like to increase their understanding of.

Encourage the participants to offer viewpoints
that have not yet been presented even if they
are difficult or conflicting.

Share a personal experience related to the
topic to shift the discussion from a general
level to one where participants share their
own personal experience.

Observe the atmosphere of the discussion
and the level of engagement. Are participants
finding the discussion interesting
and important?

Explain that you hope as many participants
as possible will participate in the discussion.
Over time, pay attention to those who have
not said
anything, yet.

Stop the conversation for a moment and say
you would like to hear from those people who
have not said anything.

Split the group into pairs for a short period of
time if there’s a large number of participants
and the dialogue has stalled. After that, you
can encourage those that have been quiet
to speak.

As a minimum, ask the participants to answer:

• What was the most important insight you

gained in this discussion?

• Where should this discussion be continued

and who should continue it?

If you have time, also ask:

• Have we discussed the right issues?

• Have we discussed different points of

view?

• Was our discussion constructive?

• Did our understanding of the topic

increase?

• What other feedback do you have?

This is where you practise those facilitation skills.

Have questions prepared to help you in any
possible situation.

Ask the participants to summarize the discussion from
time to time.

Use their words and phrases, not your own.

Remain neutral.

Look for common concerns in different approaches.

Guide the discussion without controlling it.

Check your lists of goals and questions

Let the group know that the discussion is about to end.
You might ask each participant for a closing comment.
Establish direction for the next session.

Ask for comments on the group process. What did they
like or not like about the discussion?

Thank everyone for their participation. Acknowledge
the effort and contributions.

On your last session, ask for suggestions on further
involvement or action on the issue. Ending with a
pertinent quotation is an effective closing.

NESTA ― V.00105 / 09
What is our issue and our purpose
for using collective intelligence?

This stage will help you spell out your reason
for using collective intelligence and help you to
articulate the goal of your project. It is important
because it will help you craft a guiding purpose
for your project, which is necessary if you need to
inspire others to join you. Collective intelligence
involves many different approaches, methods
and tools, and it can be easy to get caught up in
simple technical fixes. Completing this stage will
help you keep focused on the outcome.

pointers for reflection and discussion:

• Try to do some desk-based research

about your issue before commencing your
collective intelligence project. It might
be that the solutions you want, or the
information you need has already been
created by someone else.

• Consider what is the purpose of your

collective intelligence project and review
the relevant navigation guidelines in
section 4 (Understand Problems, Seek
Solutions, Decide and Act, Learn
and Adapt).

• Once you are clear about the problem that

needs to be worked on, an important step
is to describe, at least roughly, how it works
as a system. What are the key factors that
may be feeding into the problem? How
much do we know about them? Who has
the power to influence them?

• The Issue Map and the Stakeholder Map can help

a team and others to get a fuller sense of the issue.
All of these can be thought of as hypotheses to
be tested, partly through looking at the data and
partly through talking to relevant people in the
system. The mappings can be repeatedly returned
to as a shared mental model of the problem, its
causes and potential solutions. Don’t skip over
this stage.

• Try to describe your challenge using the following
formula. Our problem is that…[insert a short
description of your problem]. We want to
understand/find a solution to/decide/learn (delete
as appropriate) [what?]

challenge
definition

The Challenge Definition Worksheet
is used to help you clearly define the
challenge to be addressed. It helps you
examine your issue from a number of
angles, as well as articulate the wider
context. The key aim is to capture,
compare and discuss different viewpoints
before focusing on a clear challenge
on which you can base the rest of your
collective intelligence project. Consider
working on the Challenge Definition
Worksheet with a diverse range of other
stakeholders, as this will usually bring up
different perspectives and insight than just
working with immediate team members.

TIME FRAME
60 - 90 mins

GROUP SIZE
4 - 8 people

MATERIALS
Challenge Definition Worksheet,
1 - 2 markers, bluetack

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Quickly review the Challenge

Definition Worksheet questions

2. Answer each question by capturing

responses on post-it notes. Stick your
answers in the appropriate sections.

a. Regarding question 2 use a

Stakeholder Map Worksheet (A3)
and People Prompt Cards (C2) if
you need help to identify the
right people.

b. Regarding question 3 use the
Issues Map Worksheet (A2) if
you need help to identity the
underlying factors.

c. Regarding question 4 use the
Data Mapping Worksheet (B1)
and Data Prompt Cards (B2) to
consider what data is, or could
be relevant.

d. Regarding question 5 use the

format “Our challenge is that…

we want to help [who?] to
understand/find/decide/learn
[what?]” or use the Challenge Call
to Action Worksheet (C6).

e. Regarding question 6 use the
Cover Story Worksheet (A4)
to help you consider what is
the purpose of your collective
intelligence project?

f. Regarding question 7 sketch out a

quick timeline and budget.

3. When you’ve completed your first draft
of the worksheet review the post-its
and write up your final answers to the
questions directly on the worksheet.
However, if you need some reflection
time, review the post-its at a later date
or share with others before writing up.

4. When you’ve completed your first draft
of the Challenge Definition Worksheet
transfer the main points onto your
Collective Intelligence Project Design
Canvas in the Define Challenge stage.

issue
map

Issue Mapping is a visual way to capture
the different interconnected issues linked
to a central or core issue. Everything
is captured on a single ‘poster’ helping
participants to see the issue at a
systems level.

TIME FRAME
60 - 120 mins

GROUP SIZE
10 - 40 people

MATERIALS
Flipchart sheets, 3-4 markers,
sticky dots for voting, masking tape

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Start with making a (very) large canvas

by sticking a 8-10 flipchart sheets
together - see the layout on the
next page.

2. At the edges put some labels that
represent broader categories of
potential drivers (e.g. political,
economic, social, technology,
environmental, legal).

3. Then write the issue you would like
to explore in the middle (e.g. urban
flooding in informal settlements).

4. You may assign two participants who

will map out the drivers (as a facilitator
you should guide the conversation)

5. Then ask participants: “What's driving
or causing this issue?"... one person
at a time may give a suggestion. To
avoid the group being dominated by
loud/confident people we suggest you
enforce a ‘turn taking rule’. After one
person has made one suggestion, the
next person may then make one. This
means everyone can have their say.

6. When a participant mentions a

possible cause, the mappers draw a line from the
category (you may also ask participants what category
it goes under) to the centre, and add a brief description.
Encourage groups to write a short phrase rather than a
single word or two. “Sustained economic growth in China”
gives a better sense of change than “the economy”.

7.

It is important to mention that there is no right or
wrong answer; all drivers mentioned are relevant for
consideration as a potential cause.

8. Once all the drivers are mapped out, you may ask

participants to vote for what they consider to be the
key drivers (the most important). Depending on group
size, they may select 2 or 3. They can use sticky dots to
indicate their choices. Have a brief discussion about each
one, and ask for evidence they have or how they might
find it.

9. Once they have the key drivers, you may ask them:

"Where would you intervene?" "Where are the leverage
points?" "Where could we make the biggest difference?"
Remind the group that in a system you may need to do
multiple interventions at the same time to shift it.

STAGE:
GATHER DATA,
INFORMATION
AND IDEAS

NESTA ― V.00105 / 09
What data/information/ideas do
we need to find, and how will we
do it?

This stage will help you to define what data,
information or ideas are needed for your
collective intelligence project. It is important
because collective intelligence projects almost
always involve some form of data collection.
There are now many more potential sources of
data: from sensors and satellites; commercial
data like mobile phone records which track
travel patterns or economic activity; and citizen-
generated data on everything from floods to
corruption. Any project needs to start with a
good understanding of the information it already
has, what it can access, and what it needs.

pointers for reflection and discussion:

• Sometimes data is proactively contributed
by citizens, but it can also be collected
passively via third parties or social media
apps, with the consent of users.

• Consider what real-time ‘unstructured’

data such as posts on social media could
reveal about the attitudes and values of
a given subset of the population. Often
the less obvious data are more valuable
than official data. For example in many
countries mobile phone data is a better
indicator of economic activity and its
shifting location than anything else.

• Very local, tacit data that reflects lived

experience or community knowledge can
be complementary to formal data from
sensors such as air pollution monitors or
aerial satellite images.

• You should consider whether you need historical or
real time data to help you address the challenge.
Historical datasets might be readily available but
when an issue is rapidly changing, they might not
offer much insight into the current context.

• Some datasets are easier to collect than others,
you should think about the timeline of data
collection and whether you need one-off or regular
contributions.

•

It is important to consider how you will ensure your
data is ‘fit for purpose’. This includes knowing the
accuracy, interoperability with existing standards
and quality requirements. Some common data
quality protocols include validation by experts,
peer review or requiring participants to
undergo training.

• This also brings important questions around data
ethics, data protection and responsible use of
personasl information. Clear rules around these
need to be established before any data collection
takes place.

The Data Mapping Worksheet helps you
consider what you need to know, what
data sources are currently available and
what new data you may need to create.

TIME FRAME
30 - 60 mins

GROUP SIZE
3 - 8 people

MATERIALS
Data Mapping Worksheet, post-
its, 1 x pen per person, bluetack,
Data Cards (B2)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Quickly review the Data Mapping
Worksheet questions. One person
could nominate themselves to read
them out to the group.

2. Then, start by answering the question
at the top of the worksheet, ‘What
specifically do you need to know?'
Capture suggestions from the group
on post-its or write on the worksheet
directly. Spend 5-10 minutes.

3. Now move to the next question on the
bottom left and spend 5-10 minutes
discussing this as a group. Work your
way across from left to right capturing
answers on post-its in the
appropriate sections.

4. Use in conjunction with the Data Cards

(B2) for inspiration to stretch
your thinking.

5. After you have explored many possible
data sources, it is important to focus
on 1-3 key data sources that are a)
likely to be most relevant to your issue
b) give the necessarily granularity
or timeliness and c) are feasible to
gather in the timeframe for the project.
Highlight those on the worksheet.

6. When you’ve completed this

worksheet, add your shortlisted data
sources to the Collective Intelligence
Project Design Canvas.

What data are you already using?

What other data exists, which you are not using?

What new data could you create?

For example: official or government data, data from NGOs
or business.

Are there other types of data or datasets that might contribute
similar information, or act as a proxy measure?

Could you start collecting new types of data to help you now
and in the future?

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Explore these Data Cards and

associated case studies with your
group or workshop participants at any
point to guide conversations.

2. There are also specific activities

elsewhere in this playbook where you
are encouraged to use these cards to
help answer particular
design questions.

3. Consider which sets of data are most
relevant to you and your challenge.

gather data
method cards

These Gather Data Method Cards are
to be used as prompts for discussion in
conjunction with the collective intelligence
project design canvas and associated
activities. They highlight common
methods to gather data, information and
ideas, alongside illustrative case studies
and are not intended to be exhaustive.
The Gather Data Methods Cards are one
of six ‘decks’, structured according to
different stages of the playbook.

TIME FRAME
30 mins

GROUP SIZE
4 - 8 people

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Explore these Gather Data Method
Cards and associated case studies
with your group or workshop
participants at any point to
guide conversations.

2. There are also specific activities

elsewhere in this playbook where you
are encouraged to use these cards
to help answer particular design
questions.

3. Consider which methods are most
relevant to you and your challenge.

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK05 / 09
data ethics

This worksheet is for anyone who collects,
shares or uses data. It helps identify and
manage ethical issues – at the start of
a project using data, and throughout.
It gives a framework to develop ethical
guidance that suits any context.

TIME FRAME
60 - 120 mins

GROUP SIZE
3 - 8 people

MATERIALS
Data Ethics Worksheet and
examples, post-its, 1 x pen per
person, bluetack

INSTRUCTIONS:
1.

Individually, review the Data Ethics
Worksheet questions.

2. Start in the top left of the worksheet
and work across to the right, row by
row. Answer the questions as a group,
spending 5 - 10 minutes on each.
Capture responses on post-it notes.
Stick your answers in the
appropriate sections.

3. When you’ve completed your first

draft of the Data Ethics Worksheet
review the post-its and write up your
final answers to the questions directly.
However, if you need some reflection
time, review the post-its at a later date
or share with others before writing up.

4. Finally transfer the main ethical or
regulatory issues identified through
using this worksheet to your Collective
Intelligence Project Design Canvas in
Gather Data, Information and Ideas
(stage B).

Are there any ethical or regulatory issues with using this data or involving these people?

DATA SOURCES

LIMITATIONS

SHARING DATA

Describe your project’s key data
sources, whether you’re collecting
data yourself or accessing via
third parties.Is any personal data
involved, or data that is
otherwise sensitive?

Are there limitations that could
influence your outcomes?

> bias in data collection, analysis,
algorithms

> gaps or omissions

> provenance/quality

> other issues affecting decisions?

Are you going to be sharing data
with other organisations? If so,
who? Are you planning to publish
any of the data?
Under what conditions?

ETHICAL AND LEGISLATIVE
CONTEXT

What existing ethical codes apply
to your sector or project? What
legislation, policies, or other
regulation shape how you use
data? What requirements do
they introduce?

collective intelligence design playbook

RIGHTS AROUND DATA SOURCES

Where did you get the data from?
Is it produced by an organisation or
collected directly from individuals?
Was the data collected for this
project or for another purpose? Do
you have permission to use this
data, or another basis on which
you’re allowed to use it? What
ongoing rights will the
data source have?

YOUR REASON FOR USING DATA

What is your primary purpose
for collecting and using data in
this project? What are your main
use cases? What is your business
model? Are you making things
better for society? How and for
whom? Are you replacing another
product or service as a result of
this project?

COMMUNICATING YOUR
PURPOSE

Do people understand your
purpose – especially people who
the data is about or who are
impacted by its use? How have you
been communicating your purpose?
Has this communication been
clear? How are you ensuring more
vulnerable individuals or
groups understand?

POSITIVE EFFECTS ON PEOPLE

Which individuals, groups,
demographics or organisations
will be positively affected by
this project? How? How are you
measuring and communicating
positive impact? How could you
increase it?

NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PEOPLE
Who could be negatively affected
by this project? Could the way that
data is collected, used or shared
cause harm or expose individuals
to risk of being re-identified?
Could it be used to target, profile
or prejudice people, or unfairly
restrict access (eg exclusive
arrangements)? How are limitations
and risks communicated to people?
Consider: people who the data is
about, people impacted by its use
and organisations using the data.

MINIMISING NEGATIVE IMPACT

What steps can you take to
minimise harm? How could you
reduce any limitations in your data
sources? How are you keeping
personal and other sensitive
information secure? How are you
measuring, reporting and acting on
potential negative impacts of your
project? What benefits will these
actions bring to your project?

ENGAGING WITH PEOPLE

OPENNESS AND TRANSPARENCY

ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION

REVIEWS AND ITERATIONS

YOUR ACTIONS

How can people engage with you
about the project? How can people
correct information, appeal or
request changes to the product/
service? To what extent? Are appeal
mechanisms reasonable and
well understood?

How open can you be about this
project? Could you publish your
methodology, metadata, datasets,
code or impact measurements?
Can you ask peers for feedback
on the project? How will you
communicate it internally? Will you
publish your actions and answers
to this canvas openly?

Are you routinely building in
thoughts, ideas and considerations
of people affected in your project?
How? What information or training
might be needed to help people
understand data issues? Are
systems, processes and resources
available for responding to data
issues that arise in the long-term?

How will ongoing data ethics issues
be measured, monitored, discussed
and actioned? How often will
your responses to this canvas be
reviewed or updated? When?

What actions will you take before
moving forward with this project?
Which should take priority? Who
will be responsible for these
actions, and who must be involved?
Will you openly publish your
actions and answers to this canvas?

solutions brief

The Solutions Brief Worksheet helps you to
clearly articulate the requirements of the
solution(s) you are seeking including how
developed they need to be.

TIME FRAME
30 - 90 mins

GROUP SIZE
2 - 10 people

MATERIALS
Blank Solutions Brief Worksheet,
pens, bluetack

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First review the questions. You may

need to do some more research before
you can answer all of them.

2. Think about the criteria for what a

'good' solution(s) needs to do without
prescribing how the solutions should
work. Consider things like the context
and the user.

For example: we need a diagnostic test for
antibiotic infection. A good solution will be
a) low-cost b) for use at the point-of-care
c) will give a result in 30 mins or less d) can
be used anywhere in the world.

3. Use in conjunction with the solution
readiness tool if you need help to
consider the maturity of solutions you
are looking for.

4. Finally, transfer the main requirements
identified through using this worksheet
to your Collective Intelligence Project
Design Canvas in Gather Data,
Information and Ideas (stage B).

STAGE:

solutions brief
What solution(s) are we looking for?

collective intelligence design playbook

What is the problem we want to solve?

What would a ‘good’ solution look like?

What maturity of innovations do we need?

This is where you identify the criteria that are important to you (e.g., it
needs to be able to work in a setting with regular electricity outages).

What solutions already exist, and why aren’t they working?

What are the key barriers to innovation and how can we
overcome them?

STAGE:
GATHER DATA, INFORMATION, IDEAS

solutions
readiness

When seeking solutions, it can be helpful
to consider the readiness level that is
required. Do you want something that
is already tried and tested, or are you
searching for early ideas? The Solution
Readiness Level (SRL) guide will help you
discuss and clarify where you set
your aspirations.

TIME FRAME
30 mins

GROUP SIZE
2 - 10 people

MATERIALS
Solutions Readiness Level (SRL)
Guide, Solutions Readiness
Worksheet

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review the SRLs. They range from

early ideas to proven solutions at scale.

2. Review the main different types of

solution maturity and consider which is
appropriate for you.

3. Select the SRL that most closely

matches the level of solution maturity
you want to find or create through your
collective intelligence project.

4. Transfer the maturity of the solutions

required to your Collective Intelligence
Project Design Canvas in the Gather
Data, Information and Ideas (stage B).

PROOF OF CONCEPT

PROTOTYPE

PILOTS

A proof of concept often involves a small
exercise to test the real-world potential of an
incomplete idea.

This isn’t about delivering the idea, but
demonstrating whether it is feasible. It
should be used in the early stages when you
first have an instinct about an idea. A proof
of concept shows if a product, feature or
system can be developed, whilst a prototype
shows how it will be developed. For example,
a proof of concept might be used to test
a technical feature of an online service by
quickly building a working model.

A prototype is the visible, tangible or
functional manifestation of an idea, which
you test with others and learn from at an
early stage of the development process.

Pilots are often used as the first stage of
a new innovation. They are a ‘live’ activity,
usually with a small group of real users
or citizens.

Prototypes should be used when you have
a hypothesis about a solution, but there is
still uncertainty about how it looks, feels
and works. Insights from testing can then
be used to improve the idea. Prototypes are
also a way to engage your stakeholders to
develop a shared vision or common ground
for a solution.

Pilots should be used when you believe you
have an effective solution and are looking
to understand how it works in reality. By
offering a partially implemented concept
to a limited population, it is possible to see
what actually happens. This is useful when
preparing to scale a solution to a wider
group. Pilots, are ultimately measured by
success or failure, and so there is usually
only room to make minor tweaks.

collective intelligence design playbook

MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP)

An MVP allows you to accelerate your
learning about a possible solution whilst
using minimal resources. It does this by
testing only the essential core of your
concept (rather than the full solution) with
real users in practice.

This means that you can find out early on
if there is an actual need or demand for
the solution, what is working and what isn’t,
and make any adjustments accordingly.
MVPs are about using fewer resources and
minimal effort to gather insights and obtain
feedback on potential changes.

Solution is more ‘objective’

(e.g testable against some
known criteria)

IF IN QUADRANT 1 OR 4:
What are the criteria for a
'good' solution?

How can you break these
down into simple guidelines
and communicate them to
participants clearly?

(Also see the Solutions
Brief Guide).

IF IN QUADRANT 1 OR 2:
Who are the specific stakeholders or experts you need?

What channels or tactics will you use to gain
access to them?

How will you ensure a wide diversity of different
perspectives and evidence?

(Also see the Personas Worksheet and Unique
Perspectives Worksheet).

IF IN QUADRANT 3 OR 4:
How will you motivate people to participate?

"What's the call to action?"

"How will you ensure you gather perspectives from the
widest variety of people possible?"

(Also see the Engagement Plan Worksheet and the
Challenge Call to Action Worksheet).

IF IN QUADRANT 2 OR 3:
Moving towards the right of
the diagram could lead to
potentially intense deliberation,
higher chance of conflict,
capture or gaming.

How will you deal with
competing perspectives or
moral values?

(Also see the Crowd Facilitation
Guide and ORID
Framework Guide).

Solution is more
‘subjective’

(e.g based on morals,
opinions or beliefs)

QUADRANT 4

Audience is unknown
(participants could be anyone)

Who do we need to involve, and
how can we engage them?

Collective intelligence design can help you
tap into distributed experience and expertise
to answer your questions. For this to happen,
the goal needs to be clear, 'the crowd' needs
to be carefully defined and targeted, and the
motivations and incentives of those participating
need to be considered.

pointers for reflection and discussion:

• Research shows crowd intelligence is

enhanced by diversity. Whether you’re
interested in engaging specific groups
or sectors in society, or ‘the public’ more
broadly, it’s important to consider how you
will include people with diverse opinions
and backgrounds, underrepresented
groups and unusual suspects.

•

Involving citizens or a wider group of
stakeholders affected by the issue can help
to legitimise the outcome of your collective
intelligence project. It can also decrease
the likelihood of disparate impact and
seed behavioural change which might be
fundamental to achieving the
intended purpose.

• Some crowds are driven purely by curiosity

or to make social connections. An
individual’s motivations might also change
over the course of a project, which impacts
participation. Getting this right requires
clarity on who your crowd is, and deciding
a range of tactics to incentivise them (e.g.
monetary rewards or gamification). See
the Incentives and Retention Worksheet for
more on this.

• Sometimes crowds will be specific groups (e.g.

particular experts, or affected populations), other
times it will be open to anyone. Nonetheless it’s
important to have a clear understanding of who
your audience is, as this will have an important
impact on the methods and tools you choose to
engage them.

•

•

It can be difficult to motivate and coordinate
distributed crowds. Therefore the goals needs to be
clear. Can you condense what you want the crowd
to do into a series of simple tasks or statements?
Use the Engagement Plan Worksheet to decide
how you’ll communicate with participants.

It’s also important to consider the need to retain
crowds over time. Some projects are designed with
a lot of redundancy to ensure that high drop-out
rates do not affect the success. Other types of
collective intelligence rely on dedicated volunteers
or participants over longer periods of time,
meaning it’s crucial to build and maintain trust.
This can take place through active facilitation,
feedback and Crowd Facilitation (we return to
some of these in following stages).

•

Individual level feedback helps participants to
develop their skills, which can in turn benefit the
project as participants build expertise.

• Regardless of who is involved, what you’re asking
people to do should be commensurate with their
skills and experience. Try to acknowledge the value
of different sources of expertise without prioritizing
one over the other.

unique
perspectives

It’s easy to get stuck consulting the
same narrow group of experts or the
professional representatives of particular
groups. This worksheet will help you look
beyond the usual suspects and consider
who could bring new insights, ideas
or perspectives.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Quickly review the tool questions.

2. Answer each question by capturing

responses on post-it notes. Stick your
answers in the appropriate sections.
Make sure you think about people and
communities who might be affected by
the issue.

5. When you’ve completed your first draft
of the Exploring Unique Perspectives
Worksheet review the post-its and
write up your final answers to the
questions directly on the tool. However,
if you need some reflection time,
review the post-its at a later date or
share with others before writing up.

3. Use in conjunction with the People
Cards (C2) for inspiration if you are
struggling.

6. Add the prioritised people/groups to
the Collective Intelligence Project
Design Canvas.

TIME FRAME
30 - 45 mins

GROUP SIZE
3 - 8 people

MATERIALS
Unique Perspectives Worksheet,
post-its, 1 x pen per person, bluetack

4. Once you have finished mapping all

of the people you could potentially
involve, it is important to focus on a
smaller number of key groups that
are a) likely to be most relevant to
your issue b) feasible to involve in the
timeframe for the project. Highlight
those on the worksheet.

people cards

These People Cards are to be used as
prompts for discussion in conjunction
with the collective intelligence project
design canvas and associated activities.
They highlight common groups of people,
and are not intended to be exhaustive.
The People Cards are one of six ‘decks’,
structured according to different stages of
the playbook.

TIME FRAME
30 mins

GROUP SIZE
4 - 8 people

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Explore these People Cards with your

group or workshop participants at any
point to guide conversations.

2. There are also specific activities

elsewhere in this playbook where you
are encouraged to use these cards to
help answer particular design questions.

3. Consider which people are most relevant

to you and your challenge.

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK05 / 09
engagement
plan

The Engagement Plan outlines the key
steps to consider when thinking about the
people you want to engage and how you
will reach and incentivise them.

TIME FRAME
60 mins

GROUP SIZE
3 - 8 people

MATERIALS
Engagement Plan Worksheet, 1-2
markers, post-its

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Quickly review the Engagement Plan

Worksheet questions.

2. You may want to complete the

Personas Worksheet (C4) before
embarking on this activity, so that you
have a good understanding of
your audience.

3. Answer each question in order, starting
with objectives, capturing responses on
post-it notes. Stick your answers in the
appropriate sections.

4. Use this worksheet in conjunction
with the Incentives and Retention
Worksheet (C5), to develop ideas in
this worksheet.

5. When you’ve completed your first

draft, review the post-its and write up
your final answers to the questions
directly on the sheet. However, if you
need some reflection time, review the
post-its at a later date or share with
others before writing up.

6. Add key decisions to the Collective
Intelligence Project Design Canvas.

STAGE:

6. WHEN

What are you trying to achieve and
what do you want people to do?

Who do you want to engage?

What are the main points you want
your audience to hear
and remember? What is the call
to action?

How are you going to communicate
with your audience?

e.g. face-to-face, SMS, email,
focus groups.

Where and when will the
engagement happen? And over
what period? Is it one-off
or regular?

4. INCENTIVES

What’s in it for them?
Why should they engage?

STAGE:

personas

A Persona is a informal summary of a
person or key audience outlining key
characteristics such as needs, frustrations
and goals. These can be completed prior
to meeting stakeholders or after, or both.

TIME FRAME
30 - 60 mins

GROUP SIZE
3 - 8 people

MATERIALS
Persona Worksheet, 1 pen
per person

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Quickly decide who is going to write up
which Persona using the Stakeholder
Map Worksheet (A3) as a starting point
then quickly review all of the
Persona questions.

2. Working individually or in pairs, answer
each question, starting on the left
hand side of the Persona. It may be
you already have a clear picture of
who this person is based on personal
experience, so complete your answers
based on them. It’s also okay to
complete the Persona based on an
amalgamation of people you know (or
best guess) to develop a persona type.
Also draw a little sketch of the person,
to help bring them to life.

3. On the right hand side of the Persona,
the questions are more specific to
them and your organisation. Complete
each question adding as much detail
as possible.

4. When you are unsure of the answer

to a question, speak to another team
member to see if they can help.

5. Personas are a work-in-progress so
update them when you learn more
about the person or the key audience.

6. Once the group has completed its
Personas, each person takes 2-3
minutes to introduce each one to
the wider group. Pay attention to
duplication as there could be cross-
over between Personas and you may
decide to remove one.

incentives
and retention

This tool helps you to consider different
ways to incentivise your contributors to
engage and retain them more effectively.

TIME FRAME
30 - 60 mins

GROUP SIZE
3 - 8 people

MATERIALS
Incentives & Retention Guide,
Incentives & Retention Worksheet,
2 - 4 markers, bluetack

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. As a group, reflect on who you want

to contribute to your project (you may
have used the Unique Perspectives
Worksheet (C1) to identify who you
most want to involve). Review the
Incentives and Retention guide to help
identify the different approaches you
could use.

2. Capture thoughts on the most

important incentives for engaging and
retaining your desired contributors on
post-its. If in smaller teams then share
as a larger group.

3. After you have explored different

options, it is important to focus on
those that you think will be most
significant for your contributors.
Highlight the 1-3 you are prioritising on
your worksheet.

4. When you’ve completed this

worksheet, add the key incentives
you’ll use to the Collective Intelligence
Project Design Canvas.

themselves or their team.
Eg. Challenge Prize

Task compensation
Individuals are motivated by the
guarantee of cash or other rewards (such
as vouchers) for completion of a task.
Eg. Amazon Mechanical Turk

Gaining recognition
Individuals are motivated by the thought
of having their knowledge and expertise
recognized by their peers.
E.g. Crowdsourcing platforms

Good feedback is immediate,
interpretable and identifies the usefulness
of contributions made by participants.
This can help them develop their skills.

Good communication is up to date,
accessible in the participants' own time,
two way, and doesn’t bombard people.

BENEFITS TO CONTRIBUTOR

Greater purpose
People are motivated by the prospect
of helping to move an idea or area
of research forward in ways they
couldn’t alone.

Fulfilment of passion
People are motivated to work on
areas of interest which align with
their passion or values.

Satisfaction
Individuals are motivated by the prospect
of being able to do something well,
commensurate with their skills.

Good guidance ensures that
contributors understand where and how
they are best able to contribute. This
can include FAQs or clear instructions.

Make explicit and prioritise what the
benefits are for contributors, not only
the project and the
stakeholders/beneficiaries.

NESTA ― V.00105 / 09
How can we connect people and
data, and make sense of
the results?

This stage will help you to understand how you
can combine different sets of data to arrive at
new insights, what role the crowd should play
within this, and how to facilitate collaboration
between a diverse group of people. Some
projects use the power of the crowd to do the
work of connecting or cleaning data. For others,
the value is in how members of the crowd
interact with one another by sharing opinions
or ideas, or by upvoting and filtering different
options. Data and crowdsourced information
can be messy, or swathes of unstructured text.
In order to make data useful and actionable,
collective intelligence projects must find ways to
easily interpret data. This can be for the benefit
of the community or for the project leader to
make sense of the results.

pointers for reflection and discussion:

• There are a range of methods for

connecting or bringing together different
data or insights for collective intelligence
projects. These can be categorised
under three broad headings: ‘connecting
data with data’ (e.g. matching datasets,
or establishing data collaboratives or
warehouses); ‘connecting data with people’
(e.g. crowds categorising, cleaning, sorting
or tagging unstructured information,
photos or PDFs) or connecting ‘people with
people’ (e.g. deliberation, peer-ranking
or upvoting).

• Data-heavy projects will rely more on
quantitative tools for exploring and
analysing data. There are both open
source and proprietary software packages
to help with processing and visualizing
data. Other projects may need to
involve much more active community
participation, bringing people together in
making sense of information.

•

Interpreting data is sometimes non-
contentious - it’s about understanding
facts, or joining the dots to spot obvious
correlations or trends (e.g. rising infant
mortality or the number of wildfires in a
region). On other occasions the data will
be much more subjective - it’ll require
interpretation and evaluation by many

different stakeholders, or perhaps even assessment
by an independent group (as is the case for some
challenge prizes).

• When interpreting data it’s always crucial to reflect
on bias - especially when working with predictive
models that are only ever as good as the dataset
they are trained on. This also applies to offline
groups, which can be susceptible to groupthink or
confirmation bias. For some simple tactics see the
Overcoming Biases Guide.

• For projects involving management of crowds,

facilitation or moderation of both online and
offline discussions can encourage more meaningful
contributions. Providing feedback on what kinds
of comments are most useful, and posing framing
questions that redirect conversations or encourage
elaboration help participants to focus on the topic
at hand. The Crowd Facilitation Guide and ORID
Framework Guide will help you to facilitate more
productive online or offline conversations.

• A particular challenge when inviting ideas,

suggestions or free-text contributions from large
crowds is how to make sense of large volumes of
unstructured text. One solution can be to use tools
that constrain what people are able to do on the
platform, so the results are easier to analyse and
display (see the Visualizing Citizen-Generated Data
Guide). Artificial intelligence methods can also help
to sort unstructured information into clusters to
reveal underlying patterns.

overcoming
biases

The saying ‘two heads are better than one’
alludes to the many potential benefits
of group decision-making. But cognitive
and social biases can also undermine the
effectiveness of group decision-making.
The short guide and world cafe exercise
are intended to help your group become
more aware of some of these potential
pitfalls and to think about proactive
tactics to mitigate against them.

TIME FRAME
40 - 90 mins

GROUP SIZE
10 - 40 people

MATERIALS
Flipcharts, pens, post-its

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Before running your first session, read
through the overcoming biases guide.

2. Split your group into smaller groups,

each with its own flip chart.

3. Write on each flip chart one of the

biases from the guide, or any others
you want the group to cover.

5. After 5-10 minutes ask them to move
around clockwise to the next one and
add to it. Repeat this until everyone
has contributed to each bias.

6. Ask them to go back to their original

flip chart and give them a few minutes
to summarise their bias before taking
turns to present back to the wider
group.

4. Give the group 5-10 minutes at each
one, ask them to make comments
around what this bias looks or feels like
from their own experiences. Then add
any strategies to avoid it.

7. Remember to introduce ‘bias reflection

moments’ lasting 10-15 minutes at key
decision-points in any group
decision-making process.

overcoming biases
How will we enable everyone to contribute independently and freely?

collective intelligence design playbook

POTENTIAL BIAS

Conformity Bias

When people suppress opinions or dissent to go along with group consensus.
Also known as group think.

• Allocate someone in the group to play devil’s advocate

• Gain everyone’s personal perspective first (e.g. through a silent brainstorm)

TACTICS TO OVERCOME BIAS

Confirmation Bias

Interpreting all new evidence as confirmation of existing belief/theories, or rejecting
information that doesn’t confirm existing views.

• Actively seek out evidence that contradicts the group’s theory/world view

• Ensure you have a diverse group

• Use techniques like ‘six hat’ thinking

Authority Bias

The opinions of those with the highest social status, or greatest seniority get
prioritised.
This can also occur if there is a very dominant or confident individual in the group.

• Level the field by removing hierarchies among participants where possible

•

Introduce turn-taking and prevent interruptions or collect input anonymously

• Ensure the leader doesn’t state their opinion too early

Shared Information Bias

The tendency for group members to spend more time and energy discussing
information that all members are already familiar with (i.e., shared information), and
less time and energy discussing information that only some members are aware of
(i.e. unshared information).

• Avoid time pressure or other constraints that might dissuade group members

from sharing more information

• Listen out for the minority view for hidden insights

Anchoring Bias

A tendency to jump to conclusions by basing decisions on information or an idea
gained early on in the decision-making process. Also known as first-impression bias.

• Allow time for group deliberation, reasoning and checking of logic

In-Group Out-Group Bias

A pattern of favoring members of one's in-group over out-group members. This
can be expressed in being more positive and helpful towards one’s in-group, at the
expense
of others.

• Look for commonalities between opposing groups

• Encourage empathy - asking people to put themselves in another person’s shoes

Optimism Bias

Overestimating the probability of positive events or effects and underestimating the
probability of negative events or effects.

• Undertake a ‘pre-mortem’, asking the group to imagine that their solution or

project has gone very badly wrong and describe how this happened.

• This will help people think ahead.

D2

crowd
facilitation

Good facilitation of online forums and
communities is vital to keep a crowd
productive. By giving regular feedback the
facilitator adds value through suggesting
real-time changes as well as making
conclusions in the final analysis. Here
are the four primary tasks of a crowd
facilitator, and some daily and weekly
tasks to consider.

TIME FRAME
30 mins

GROUP SIZE
50+ people

MATERIALS
None

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review the recommended daily

and weekly tasks of the online
crowd facilitator and the four main
behaviours of the online
crowd facilitator.

2. Build and moderate your online

community and review, update and
tailor your daily and weekly tasks
as necessary.

data flow

By mapping the data flows over the course
of your project you will start to understand
the interdependencies between different
design stages. It will help you to iteratively
refine your data methods, identify
associated biases and suggest actions
to mitigate. You may need specialist
expertise to help you answer some of
the questions.

TIME FRAME
60 - 90 mins

GROUP SIZE
3 - 8 people

MATERIALS
Data Flow Worksheet, Data Bias
Guide, Data Methods Prompt
Cards, post-its, 1 x pen per person,
bluetack

INSTRUCTIONS:
Part 1: Mapping your project's data flow
1. Review the questions on the Data Flows

Worksheet, some of them may be familiar
to you from earlier parts of the
design process.

2. Fill in the first box with the data sources

and methods that you have decided to use
in your project.

3. For each subsequent question spend 5-10

minutes discussing different approaches
using the Data Flow Guide and/or prompt
cards as a group.

Part 2: Thinking about bias
4. Nominate 1-2 people in your group to act
as the anti-bias 'champions'. They should
review the Data Bias Guide.

5. Other participants should spend 5 minutes
writing down as many possible sources
of bias in the dataflow as they can think
of. Some might be down to the data
collection while other biases might be the
result of the methods used to process or
analyse data.

6. With the help of the anti-bias champions
cluster the biases by category. Discuss
where along your data flow, these biases
could occur.

7. Discuss potential mitigation strategies,

using the Data Bias Guide as a
starting point.

BIASES AFFECTING DATA COLLECTION

Data collection protocol and parameters

Measurement errors

Representation errors

BIASES AFFECTING DATA ANALYSIS

The choice of data collection methods and which features of the
data we choose to capture can sometimes reflect preconceptions
we hold about the issue.

Think carefully about the issue you're exploring and your choice of
variables before you finalise your data collection methods. Discuss
these as a team to make sure you're capturing everything you need.
For example, in the case of qualitative interview methods, questions
should be neutral.

Human recording errors or inaccuracies in the equipment used for
measurements will affect data quality.

Make sure you check the quality of collected data. You can do this
through peer or expert review or using multiple contributions for
one datapoint.

Sometimes the data we collect is not representative of the
underlying issue.

Discuss representation as a team and check your protocols with
others who have experience with data collection or the issue you're
exploring.

SOURCE

DESCRIPTION

MITIGATION

Crowd worker bias

When you rely on a crowd for data analysis using microtasking, you
risk increasing the potential for human error.

Providing training on the analysis task has been shown to improve
microtasking accuracy.

AI model bias

Data drift

Model drift

AI models can be the source of inaccuracies if they are trained on
biased (unrepresentative) datasets.

Interrogate your assumptions during data collection.

Test your model on diverse datasets.

During real-time data collection and processing, any structural
changes to data at the source will affect the analysis.

Introduce period checks on the data to ensure that it hasn’t
changed.

When a model is trained on data about an issue or context that is
changing rapidly, the model’s predictions can become outdated
very quickly.

Seek advice from domain experts or peers. Introduce period checks
of the stability of the model.

interpret
method cards

These Interpret Method Cards are to
be used as prompts for discussion in
conjunction with the collective intelligence
project design canvas and associated
activities. They highlight common
methods to make sense of your results,
alongside illustrative case studies and
are not intended to be exhaustive. The
Interpret Methods Cards are one of six
‘decks’, structured according to different
stages of the playbook.

TIME FRAME
30 mins

GROUP SIZE
4 - 8 people

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Explore these Interpret Method Cards
and associated case studies with your
group or workshop participants at any
point to guide conversations.

2. There are also specific activities

elsewhere in this playbook where you
are encouraged to use these cards to
help answer particular design questions.

3. Consider which methods are most
relevant to you and your challenge.

visualizing
citizen-
generated
data

This activity for anyone who is looking for
the best way to make sense of citizen-
generated data through visualisation.

TIME FRAME
5 - 10 mins

GROUP SIZE
1 - 5 people

MATERIALS
None

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review the guide and the nine different
ways to visualise citizen-generated
data.

2. Consider which visualisation technique
might be best for you and your project.

3. Discuss with colleagues: can you

think of any other ways to make the
data you collect easy to visualize, and
understand? What implications will the
tools that you use have on how people
provide information, or how they
interact with one another?

visualizing citizen-generated data
How will we make sense of the information we collect?

collective intelligence design playbook

A common challenge for collective intelligence
projects is how to visualise large volumes of
citizen generated text, ideas or interactions.
Good visualizations are not only important
to derive clear insights, they can also be
presented back to participants to boost
satisfaction and improve collective learning.

A range of different approaches can help
to make messy, unstructured data from
citizens more understandable and actionable.
Examples like Pol.is are a powerful way to
visualise consensus across a wide array of
ideas and opinions, whereas other activities
may be useful to visualise consensus within an
online forum-style setting (e.g. Your Priorities
and Kialo for larger groups, or Loomio for
smaller groups).

The diagram opposite provides some examples
and corresponding methods. Examples
vary in the types of input they require from
people, ranging from active to more passive
participation; and from quick and easy to
deeper, more deliberative engagement.

collective
decisions

There are many different types of
collective decision making. This guide
provides an overview of the six main types
and provides an overview to consider
which might work best depending on the
decisions you want and need to make as
a group.

TIME FRAME
30 - 45 mins

GROUP SIZE
2 - 10 people

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Before running any collective decision
making process, read through the
Overcoming Biases Guide.

2. Consider your current project and

organisation and consider the decision
that you need to make.

3. Now use the table to consider to what
extent that decision is a) urgent/non-
urgent b) has wide impact/narrow
impact c) has well defined options/
undefined options d) is irreversible/
reversible and e) is high risk/low risk.
As a result select two or three decision
making methods that could
be appropriate.

4. Review the description of each type

of collective decision and discuss the
appropriateness for your
particular situation.

5. Then select the decision making

method(s) that you intend to use and
in what context.

6. The first few times you try a particular
method, factor in time afterwards to
reflect on how it worked and whether it
was effective, or whether any changes
need to be made.

collective decisions
What type of decision do we need?

collective intelligence design playbook

CONSENSUS

- EVERYONE MUST AGREE

CONSENT

- NO ONE OBJECTS

CONSULTATIVE

- I DECIDE, WITH INPUT

Gathering consensus takes time, but it works well when a
decision will impact lots of people and those people have
both valuable insight and the capacity for candid negotiation.
Consensus decision making asks everyone in the group to shape
the decision until a compromise is reached that reasonably
satisfies everyone.

Unlike some other decision making models, consensus strives
to incorporate everyone's perspectives, needs, and ultimately
their permission. Consensus has a long history of use in tight-
knit communities like faith groups, neighborhoods, and unions.
Consensus also tends to be how recently formed organizations
first approach decision making.

Consent works well when speed is needed, when the proposal is
clearly defined, and when the impact of the decision is limited
and reversible. Consent means the absence of objections. Similar
to consensus, consent invites group participation in the decision
making process. But instead of granting each member the power
to mould the proposal in pursuit of a compromise, consent urges
the group to accept a 'good enough' solution. A decision is
ratified when there are no meaningful objections.

Consent has become increasingly popular among engineering
and technology firms over the last decade because it attempts to
combine both speed and inclusiveness.

Consultative decision making works well when you need to
gather expertise from a limited group or when you need the
support of key members of the group. Consultative decision
making means asking for input from a few select individuals, but
ultimately reserving the decision for yourself. The consultative
model is used when you need additional expertise or when you
need to curry political favour.

The consultative process is often done one-on-one, but it can
also happen in a small group setting. For instance the Delphi
Technique is a group process using written responses to a series
of questionnaires instead of physically bringing individuals
together to make a decision.

DELEGATION

- YOU DECIDE, WITH LIMITATIONS

DEMOCRATIC

- MAJORITY RULES

Delegation works well when time is critical, when a single
member of the group has the best information (and it isn't you),
and when the group is crystal-clear on what the execution would
look like. Delegation means giving someone in the group explicit
authority over making a decision, often with some guardrails.

One of the greatest leadership traits you can develop is removing
yourself from the decision making process. Giving members of
the group the authority to make a call independently will help
your group act faster and give you more time to focus on the
high-priority decisions that do require your attention.

Democratic decision making works well when choices are clear
cut, when your team is well informed, and when your culture
embraces majority rule. Democratic decision making is when a
leader gives up authority over a decision and presents a series of
options to the full group to vote on. The option accepted by the
majority of the group is then enacted.

The democratic system, is usually traced to ancient Greek city
states, although it’s probable that people have been voting
throughout history. One form is the Nominal Group Technique
which involves members of the group independently writing
down ideas, then sharing and discussing, and finally voting by
ranking or rating.

ORID
framework

The ORID (Objective, Reflective,
Interpretive, Decisional) method of
strategic questioning is a structured
conversation (face-to-face and/or online),
led by a facilitator, to make intelligent
decisions. ORID can be used in different
scenarios from small meetings where
everyone is in the same room, to large
distributed teams with the help of different
digital methods. For instance in Taiwan
the ORID framework was used by the
government to structure a mixed online
and offline consultation process over
several weeks, using a range of digital
tools to collect and synthesize information
at each stage. This worksheet will help you
plan your structured conversation.

TIME FRAME
Can be delivered as a 1hr+ session
or as a guiding framework for a
longer consultation

GROUP SIZE
10 - 40+ people

MATERIALS
ORID Framework Worksheet, pens,
post-its

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully set your goal for the

conversation - this will help you
articulate what you want to achieve.

2. Develop the ORID questions you want
the group to respond to. It’s advisable
to test these with a colleague/critical
friend in advance of starting the
process. You might want to brainstorm
questions first before refining
and reordering.

3. Use the right hand column to consider
what methods or tools might help to
facilitate the dialogue at each stage
and/or throughout.

4. When kicking off the session, explain
the ORID approach to participants
and ask for their buy-in to follow it
respectfully. It’s helpful to prepare your
opening and closing remarks
in advance.

5. Take the group through each set of

ORID questions either capturing their
key responses in the room as they’re
shared or using an online
collaboration tool.

OBJECTIVE QUESTIONS

REFLECTIVE QUESTIONS

INTERPRETIVE QUESTIONS

DECISIONAL QUESTIONS

The O questions identify objective facts
relevant to the topic.

The R questions ask about how people feel
about the topic.

The key questions is:
What do we know about this?

The key question is:
How do we feel about this?

It’s essential you capture objective facts, not
perceptions and opinions.

Feelings might be positive, negative,
apprehensive and sometimes emotional.

Ask participants to express their gut feelings
even if they have no objective facts to support
them. Capture likes, dislikes, fear and concerns.
There are no wrong responses so encourage
people to be honest and not hold back.

The I questions are to do with meaning.

The D questions lead to a decision.

The key question of the interpretive stage is
this: What does it mean for me/you/us/our
organisation, society, etc?

Interpretive questions allow the topic to be put
into perspective and for the potential impacts
of the topic on the individual, organisation or
society to be explored.

Useful interpretive questions might include
“What if…?” questions as well as “What would
it mean… ?”, “What would that do… ?” and
so on.

The key question at the decisional stage is:
What are we going to do?

The focus of discussion should be future-
focused and might include questions like:
"What would be the best course of action?"
"What would be achievable, positive
outcomes?" "What is realistic given the
limitation of our resources?"

generative
decision
making

Making decisions together does not have
to be long and painful. Consent based
decision making can help organisations
make decisions collectively, efficiently and
wisely. Generative decision making is a
consent based decision making process. It
requires a host, and the person taking on
this role can and should vary.

1. Use the Collective Decisions Guide (D7)
to identify the type of decision that
is appropriate for your issue. If you
selected a consent based collective
decision, then generative decision
making is one method for achieving
this type of outcome.

2. Before running your first session, read

through the seven stages of generative
decision making to give you an
overview of the process involved. You
may want to practice this technique
before using it as part of your
collective intelligence project.

3. Have all your participants seated in a
circle facing each other. Ask people to
put away distractions such as laptops
and phones. Explain the process (steps
1-7) to participants, and the rationale
behind it.

4. Run the session and take time to

reflect on what worked well and what
you could do differently next time.

STAGE 7.
DECISION ON PROPOSAL BY VISUAL
CONFIRMATION

Invite the group —
“would someone like
to make an initial
proposal?” This will
help the group move
forward into action
and there will be lots
of opportunities to
fine tune the proposal
together.

Hosting tips: Help
the proposer name a
proposal in ideally one
single sentence. Avoid
the proposal spreading
into multiple proposals.
Ensure that the proposal
is written for all to see
(separate from the
proposer) and repeat it
out loud.

The group has the
opportunity to voice
questions to the
proposer. The proposer
has two options i)
provides the answer or
ii) says "not specified" if
the answer is unknown.

Hosting tips: If someone
is speaking without a
question (i.e. reaction)
remind them that is
question period. Ensure
that all questions
are directed at the
proposer and no one else
intervenes. Avoid letting
the proposer speak about
anything further than
the direct answer (keep
it tight). Sense when the
clarification period is
about to finish (i.e. you
feel that people are ready
to react).

It is mandatory that
each person (minus the
proposer) expresses to
the group their reaction
to the proposal; the
different voices and
perspectives of all
need to be heard.
The proposer listens
deeply and takes notes.
Afterwards the proposer
will craft a new version
of the proposal.

Hosting tips: Begin with
the person who has the
most reactive emotion
and then go around, until
everyone has shared their
reaction. Make sure that
the reaction is not about
the proposer, but about
the proposal itself —
correct if necessary.

The proposer formulates
a new version of the
proposal in light of all
that has been spoken.
The host ensures that it
is written and visible to
all and reads it out loud.

Hosting tips: If you feel
that the proposer might
want to stay with the
same proposal, remind her
that she can. If you sense
that the proposer needs
support in formulating the
second version, remind her
that it is possible to ask
for help — however do not
rush into saying this.

An objection needs
to express a risk or a
backward movement
for the organisation/
initiative. All objections
are expressed to the
host who then decides
if the objection is valid
or not. If it is valid, then
the proposer needs to
integrate it into a new
version of the proposal.
(Then the objection
round is repeated).

Hosting tips:Sometimes
people might express
personal concerns that are
not in fact organisational/
project risks. This needs
to be differentiated. If it
is fuzzy you may ask for
help to the group. This is
the hardest part of the
process for the host.

Understand whether
the group is ready to
make a decision. Is
the context clear? Is
there information or
data that needs to be
gathered? Could an
open conversation help
develop the group’s
readiness to make
a decision?

Hosting tips: You
might need to offer the
group one or two open
conversation time slots
to get to this point (e.g..
“I am going to put the
timer on for 10 minutes
while you explore the
topic in question”). Offer
supplementary time slots
as necessary. You might
need to conclude that
the group is not ready to
make a decision, and this
is ok. Listen in deeply and
when you sense that there
is a possible proposal in
the air, the group is ready.
Invite the group to head
into the next step.

With a revised proposal, everyone
visually confirms “I can live with this
decision” by raising their thumb. This
is a way of allowing all to see that
everyone is fully on board with this
decision. If there is something that has
not been spoken that needs to be it
will show up because a person will be
unable to raise their thumb. This can
happen when i) someone is struggling
to find words to put on an idea that
is important to them or ii) someone is
disengaging in the process (holding
on to the possibility to question the
decision in the hallway thereafter).
Either way it will need to be addressed
and the group needs to return to the
part of the process that was not
fully addressed.

Note: It is good to have visual
confirmation as a cultural cue with
which the process may be fast tracked.
Someone makes a proposal and you
can just do a quick check in to see right
away if everyone could live with it.

Hosting tips: This is not a decision council
and it is not an opportunity to lower
thumbs and restart a process. It is simply a
visual confirmation. If the process has run
smoothly all thumbs should be raised. If
someone is struggling to find voice for an
objection, support the person and let them
know that all information is important.

OPEN SPACE OVERVIEW

All participants
start by sitting in a
big circle, with the
facilitator in the
middle, who explains
the process.

People are
encouraged to then
announce themes/
topics for breakout
sessions. There may
be a blank agenda
with timed slots and/
or table or room
numbers on the wall.

The facilitator
encourages those
who are passionate
about a topic
and wish to take
responsibility for
convening a meeting
to come to
the centre.

These participants
write down their
topic, announce it
to the group, with a
time and place to
meet, and return to
their seat.

When all topics have
been announced,
everyone moves to
sign up to those they
are interested in.
If there are similar
topics, people may
be asked if they
wish to combine
sessions. Everyone
then disperses and
attends the sessions
they have chosen.

People are actively
encouraged to flow
between sessions if
they wish, if they feel
they are not learning
or participating.

In each of the
groups, the
original convening
participant should
take notes of
key points.

At the end, all of
the different groups
reconvene to form
one big circle. In
turn, each person is
asked to reflect and
share one key insight
with the group as
a whole.

OPEN SPACE PRINCIPLES

There are several underlying principles key to
this process. They are:

1. Whoever comes are the right people.

2. Whatever happens is the only thing that

could have.

3. Whenever it starts is the right time.

4. Whenever it’s over, it's over.

collective intelligence design playbook

WHAT IS A GROUP DIALOGUE?

PREPARING TO FACILITATE

GROUND RULES

TUNING IN PARTICIPANTS

A dialogue is a constructive and equal way of
having a discussion in a group of people. At
its core it is aimed at understanding others,
but not at reaching consensus. A dialogue can
generate new thinking and fresh insights.

A dialogue aims to create a trusting
atmosphere to support participants to gain
a deep understanding of almost any topic.
A dialogue supports the bringing together
of people from different backgrounds to an
encounter in which they are on an equal
footing.

For example, you can use a dialogue as part
of the preparation or before decision-making.

1. Plan how you will start the dialogue and
how people will introduce themselves.

Listen to the others, do not interrupt or start
side discussions.

2. Adapt the ground rules for discussion to

make them better suit your style.

Relate what you say to what the others have
said and use plain English.

3. Plan how you lean into the topic and

develop the initial question.

4. Familiarise yourself with the theme and

Talk about your own experience including
issues, events and situations that have shaped
your views.

capture questions related to the content of
the discussion.

Be present and respect the others and the
atmosphere of trust.

5. Consider how you will deepen the

discussion and conclude it.

6. Decide if the discussion needs to be
documented and how it will be done.

Work together. Talk to the others directly and
ask about their views as a way to deal with
emerging conflicts early.

Tuning in helps to build trust in which the
participants feel they are on an equal footing.
It moves the attention from other matters to
this moment – the space, the other people
and the topic discussed. Ensure you use
adequate time to build an atmosphere of
trust. Here are a few example questions to
help participants start tuning in:

• Who are you and what brings you here

today?

• What are the experiences in your mind
when you come to discuss this topic?

• What perceptions or feelings do you

associate with the topic?

• What is it like to talk about this together?

What do we want to aim at in this
discussion?

ENCOURAGING PARTICIPANTS TO EXPRESS
THEIR EXPERIENCES

Share events, situations and experiences to
them or start side discussions.

Ask specifying questions about what they
share including reasons and consequences.

Talk about your own experience including
issues, events and situations that have shaped
your views.

Ask participants to consider and express what
kind of thoughts and experiences come to
mind when they listen to others.

WAYS TO DEEPEN THE DISCUSSION

ACTIVATING THE QUIET PARTICIPANTS

WHAT IS A GROUP DIALOGUE?

Ask the participants which kind of issues they
would like to increase their understanding of.

Encourage the participants to offer viewpoints
that have not yet been presented even if they
are difficult or conflicting.

Share a personal experience related to the
topic to shift the discussion from a general
level to one where participants share their
own personal experience.

Observe the atmosphere of the discussion
and the level of engagement. Are participants
finding the discussion interesting
and important?

Explain that you hope as many participants
as possible will participate in the discussion.
Over time, pay attention to those who have
not said
anything, yet.

Stop the conversation for a moment and say
you would like to hear from those people who
have not said anything.

Split the group into pairs for a short period of
time if there’s a large number of participants
and the dialogue has stalled. After that, you
can encourage those that have been quiet
to speak.

As a minimum, ask the participants to answer:

• What was the most important insight you

gained in this discussion?

• Where should this discussion be continued

and who should continue it?

If you have time, also ask:

• Have we discussed the right issues?

• Have we discussed different points of

view?

• Was our discussion constructive?

• Did our understanding of the topic

increase?

• What other feedback do you have?

study
circle

A study circle is a group of people who
meet regularly over a period of weeks
or months to address a critical issue in a
democratic, collaborative way. In general,
a study circle will progress from a session
on personal experience ("How does the
issue affect me?") to sessions providing
a broader perspective ("What are others
saying about this issue?") to a session
on action ("What can we do about this
issue right now?"). They emerge with
recommendations for action that will
benefit the community. A study circle is
typically led by an impartial facilitator.

TIME FRAME
60 - 120 mins

GROUP SIZE
8 - 12 people

MATERIALS
None

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review the six stages of facilitating a
study circle in this guide and consider
an issue or topic to explore.

2. Give a personal invitation to a diverse

group of people who might be
interested in helping people address
a specific challenge, and not just talk
about them.

d. Keep the discussions on track.

e. Allow for pauses and silences.
People need time to think and
reflect.

f. Don't worry about consensus.
Just try to find some areas of
agreement.

3. Be aware of the facilitators key role in

the study circle process. Their role is to:

g. When in doubt, ask the group
what they would like to do.

a. Stay neutral. Not to promote an

4.

opinion, but to further
the discussion.

b. Encourage interaction. Let

participants respond to one
another.

c. Don't let anybody dominate the

discussion, and draw out
quiet participants.

Individual study circles can take
place within communities or within
organisations. However, they have the
greatest impact when organisations
across a community work together to
hold multiple study circles as part of a
large-scale program.

study circle
How will people contribute or interact?

collective intelligence design playbook

1. INTRODUCTIONS

2. IDENTIFY THE GOALS

Introduce yourself and explain that you are a facilitator
rather than a teacher and interested in the topic rather
than an expert.

Ask the participants to introduce themselves and
explain their interest in the topic.

In subsequent meetings at least 90 around the circle to
give names.

Make sure you all know why you are there.

Ask for a list of questions the participants
want answered.

Lay out a range of views. Ask the participants to
volunteer what they see as the main view on the issue
based on the reading material and their knowledge of
the issue.

Folded name cards in front of everybody may be
helpful.

Keep these lists and post them each meeting
for reference.

Review the agenda or study plan and adjust it to suit
the group.

3. PERSONAL CONNECTION OR INTEREST IN THE
ISSUE

Ask participants to talk about why this issue is
important to them.

Telling their story is a good ice-breaker at the
first session.

Anyone may pass.

4. DISCUSSION AND DELIBERATION

5. SUMMARY AND COMMON GROUND

6. CLOSING

This is where you practise those facilitation skills.

Have questions prepared to help you in any
possible situation.

Ask the participants to summarize the discussion from
time to time.

Use their words and phrases, not your own.

Remain neutral.

Look for common concerns in different approaches.

Guide the discussion without controlling it.

Check your lists of goals and questions

Let the group know that the discussion is about to end.
You might ask each participant for a closing comment.
Establish direction for the next session.

Ask for comments on the group process. What did they
like or not like about the discussion?

Thank everyone for their participation. Acknowledge
the effort and contributions.

On your last session, ask for suggestions on further
involvement or action on the issue. Ending with a
pertinent quotation is an effective closing.

PG. 182

NESTA ― V.00105 / 09
How can we use and test our
collective intelligence to
create change?

The results of collective intelligence need to be
made actionable and usable. In this stage you
will prototype your project and develop a plan to
test it. You will also consider how you're going to
feedback to participants, to build trust and show
people that their input had meaning.

pointers for reflection and discussion:

• Know the Minimum Viable Product

needed. Raw data is of little use to most
decision-makers, people delivering a
service or to the community who you’re
engaging. It’s unlikely that whoever is
carrying out the action (for example, a
frontline worker or service manager) will
want a spreadsheet or raw data. Instead
they will want the data conveyed in a way
that is actionable and usable.

• Be aware of local resource limitations and

access needs of your intended audience.
It’s no use producing an online real-time
map to visualise disaster-affected areas if
most local residents don’t have access to
computers or smart-phones. SMS, radio
and peer-to-peer neighbourhood alert
systems can be much more effective to
ensure timely action in low
resource settings.

• Don’t forget to provide feedback to the

contributors. Progress updates regarding the
overall goal of the project reminds individuals that
they are part of a collective, building a sense of
contributing to a greater purpose.

• The broader impacts of collective intelligence can
be auxiliary to the intended use. For example some
of the most transformative results of citizen science
projects can come from sustained behavioural
change by communities stemming from their deep
engagement with their local environment.

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK05 / 09
prototyping
techniques

The Prototyping Techniques Guide
provides a selection of ways to share
and test your thinking, to gain valuable
feedback and decide what to do next.
Prototyping helps test how something
looks, feels, works or behaves.

TIME FRAME
45 - 120 mins

GROUP SIZE
3 - 8 people

MATERIALS
Paper, coloured pens, cardboard,
glue, pipecleaners, and anything
else you have lying around. Use
in conjunction with the Prototype
Testing Worksheet (E3).

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Agree with your group what idea(s) you

would like to test.

2. Review the prototyping techniques and

choose at least one.

3. Don’t spend lots of time discussing
the intricacies of your project, jump
straight into making your prototype -
it will be the quickest way to surface
assumptions or gaps.

4. Once you have built your prototype

you will want to test it on people - this
could be with colleagues at first, but
ideally you want to test this with the
people who you hope will use it in the
real world.

5. Use the Prototype Testing Worksheet

(E3) to articulate what you think will
happen, and how you will know when
it does.

SCALE MODELLING

STORYBOARDING

BODYSTORMING

This is particularly useful for physical space when it isn’t practical
to build something at full-scale. Scale models can be built out of
materials such as cardboard, foamboard and Lego.

Storyboarding is a very early stage technique for prototyping.
Describing the idea as a six-step story helps to consolidate
thinking, test stakeholder reactions and capture feedback.

Bodystorming is technique of physically experiencing a situation
to derive new ideas. It requires setting up an experience -
complete with necessary artefacts and people - and physically
‘testing’ it. This is important when an idea relies on physical
interaction with a product or between people.

SIMULATION

PAPER PROTOTYPING

ROLE PLAY

We use commonly available materials to make something
physical to test with people. This isn’t about perfection, it’s all
about speed - making a prototype that people can react to and
give feedback.

Paper prototyping is a quick way to test using pens and paper.
This can include mock-ups of how information is organised and
shared through to mocking-up click-through screens for a
digital interaction.

Role plays help you to test out thinking by following a script or
by improvising (acting out a situation without prior preparation).
Instruction cards providing cues such as specific tasks to be
carried out, or character motivations, might be provided.

2. Use the Prototype Testing - Plan

Worksheet Sheet to articulate what
you think will happen, and how you will
test and measure what does.

3. Carry out your test activity, and

use the Prototype Testing - Learn
Worksheet to capture what actually
happened, what you learnt and the
changes you need to make.

4. You may have multiple hypotheses you

are looking to test through
different experiments.

theory of
change

The Theory of Change Worksheet helps
you to clearly articulate and connect
your work to your bigger goal, and allows
you to spot potential risks in your plan
by sharing the underlying assumptions in
each step.

TIME FRAME
60 - 90 mins

GROUP SIZE
3 - 8 people

MATERIALS
Theory of Change Worksheet, 1-2
pens, post-its, bluetack

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Start by noting down the main

problem you want to solve, and also
your long term vision on the change
you want to accomplish.

2. Next work outwards from your defining
problem, and towards your long-term
impact. Write down the people that
have power or influence to address
your issue – this could be a small
community group or a government
minister. Then think about where to
start, you may need to find a place,
a person or a thing that will be your
first port of call. Try to think of some
practical steps that you can take to get
your key audience to act. Try to keep
these as action-oriented as possible.

3. And finally, what would the immediate
results or outcomes be? These could be
tangible results that help you monitor
whether your project is making a
difference. List the key outcomes that
your activity would lead to: these are
the preconditions that you need to
realise your vision.

4. As you fill each of the boxes in the

worksheet, it is critical to also reflect
on the key assumptions that underpin
these steps in your project. This may
help you to spot potential risks or
interdependencies.

collaboration
agreement

A collaboration agreement helps initiate
strong partnerships. It helps minimise
the risks of working with new people. It
helps to build trusting relationships and to
develop and test the proposition itself. It
is project-based and time-limited and sets
out the rewards, risks and responsibilities
as well as the development milestones for
both parties.

TIME FRAME
60 - 120 mins

GROUP SIZE
2 - 10 people

MATERIALS
Collaboration Agreements
Worksheet, pens, post-its

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. First, review the six sections of the

collaboration agreement and the three
main questions in each.

2. Next, with your partner work through
all of the questions and agree a joint
approach or put in place a process to
agree how to address each point.

3. Finally, write up, share and formalise
the agreement as required and
start collaborating.

dataset
nutrition label

To make sure your dataset or analyses are
taken up by others you should provide as
much information as possible about your
data pipeline. This activity will help you
think about which features of your dataset
are important to log. It is particularly
useful if you are planning to collect new
data as part of your project.

TIME FRAME
45 mins

GROUP SIZE
3-5 people, 1 person to act
as facilitator

MATERIALS
Dataset Nutrition Label Guide,
post-its, 1 x pen per person,
bluetack

INSTRUCTIONS:
1.

In your team, spend 5 minutes
discussing and identifying all of the
new datasets you will be creating as
part of your collective intelligence
project.

2. Working individually or in pairs, take
5 minutes to write down as many
features of a dataset that you think
would help to describe its contents to
others who would want to use it.
Use post-its.

3. Discuss the features you identified with
the rest of your team. Did you end up
with the same answers? What were the
differences? Explain why you think they
are important to know for future users
of the data.

4. Guided by the facilitator try to cluster
the features you’ve identified into 4
categories: Metadata, Provenance,
Variables and Statistics. The facilitator
should explain what each of
these means.

5. Try to use these new categories to

come up with any additional features
that you have missed. Work as
a group.

6. When you have exhausted your ideas,
review the completed example in the
Dataset Nutrition Label Guide.

7. Finish with a discussion about

feasibility. Which information will it be
easy for you to capture? How often will
you need to update the nutrition label
for your datasets?

building the team for
collective intelligence

PG. 202

NESTA ― V.00106 / 09
What kind of teams work best for
designing and implementing collective
intelligence projects?

There are some obvious needs in most teams: people
who understand data and evidence; people who are
good at tapping into tacit knowledge and engaging
stakeholders; and people with a strong commitment
to delivering results and working to deadlines. It helps
to have people with experience across sectors, and if
there is a particular field of activity - like sanitation or
employment - it obviously helps to have more than one
person with some deep knowledge of that field.

The team leader’s job is to make the whole more than
the sum of its parts. They need to know enough about
the different elements of the work to manage, but
above all they need to be good at integrating and
making sense of diverse information and
making decisions.

The team needs to spend time generating a shared
ethos, language and method. Teams need enough
diversity to avoid groupthink but not too much, or they
fall apart in mutual incomprehension. They don’t all
have to be extroverts. Mutual emotional respect and
professional respect is vital though.

PG. 203

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK06 / 09
key questions:

• What (data and people) skills do you already have in your team?
• What expertise do you already have about your issue?
• What skills and expertise are you missing?
• Who could you partner with to expand the skills of your team?

Typically there will be a core team and then an outer
circle of associates or advisers who can be drawn on
for more specialised knowledge and experience. You
can also ask for access to expertise and resources
in partner organisations. For example a national
statistical office may be willing to provide some help in
finding key facts; a major corporate may be willing to
provide some expertise if there is a very specific ‘ask’,
such as designing an SMS experiment.

A skills map is a useful way of organising these three
concentric circles (team, associates and wider network)
covering all the generic and more specialised skills
needed to deliver the project. It’s sensible to keep some
flexibility in budgets so that if there is an urgent need
for a new kind of skill or experience it can be quickly
sought out.

quick ways to boost your
group’s collective intelligence

PG. 206

NESTA ― V.00107 / 09
Collective intelligence design is a deliberate
process that needs time, resources, and a
supportive infrastructure to succeed. It won’t be
feasible for every project or problem you’re faced
with from beginning to end. But there are plenty of
small ways that you can start integrating collective
intelligence into your day-to-day practice. We’ve
included a few of our favourites exercises below.

Try introducing them in your internal team
meetings or in the next external workshop you
run. You don’t need any technology to use these,
beyond some flipcharts and post-it notes. These
exercises will help you get comfortable with using
collective intelligence and can be the first step
towards building the case for larger scale projects.

PG. 207

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE DESIGN PLAYBOOK07 / 09
25/10 crowdsourcing
ideas exercise

Rapidly generate and sift a group’s most
powerful actionable ideas by spreading and
sorting them “out and up” as everyone notices
the patterns in what emerges. Though it is fun,
fast, and casual, it is a serious and valid way to
generate an uncensored set of bold ideas and
then to tap the wisdom of the whole group
to identify the top ten. Surprises are frequent!
Everyone is included and participates at the
same time. Everyone has an equal opportunity
to contribute.

This exercise uses the collective intelligence of
a group to find solutions.

TIME FRAME
30 mins

GROUP SIZE
20 - 40+ people

MATERIALS
Open space. Index cards, one for
each participant

PG. 208

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Explain the process. For example: “First,
every person writes on an index card
their bold idea and first step to making
it happen. Then people mill around and
cards are passed from person to person.
‘Mill and Pass only. No reading.’ When
the bell rings, stop passing cards. Each
individually rate the idea/step on your card
with a score of 1 to 5 (1 = low, 5 = high)
and write it on the back of the card. This
is called ‘Read and Score.’ When the bell
rings, cards are passed around a second
time. ‘Mill and Pass’ until the bell rings.
We’ll repeat this cycle five times.” 3 min.

2. Demonstrate one exchange-and-scoring
interaction using a sample index card
to clarify what is expected during the
milling, namely no reading of the cards,
only passing the cards from person to
person so that each person has one and
only one card in hand. The process can be
confusing for some people. 2 min.

3.

Invite each participant to write a big idea
and first step on his or her card. 5 min.

4. Conduct five 3-minute exchange-and-

scoring rounds with time for milling (and
laughing) in between. 15 min.

5. Ask participants to add the 5 scores on the

back of the card they are holding.

6. Find the best-scoring ideas with the whole
group by conducting a countdown. Ask,
“Who has a 25?” Invite each participant, if
any, holding a card scored 25 to read out
the idea and action step. Continue with
“Who has a 24?” etc …. Stop when the top
ten ideas have been identified and shared.
5 min.

7. End by asking, “What caught your
attention about 25/10?” 2 min.

yes, but exercise

This method helps to increase individual
participation and clarify opinions during group
debates. It enables people to explore and
develop their views, behaviour and attitude
in response to a topic. It also helps to give
some structure to debate that may otherwise
dissolve into chaos.

This exercise uses the collective intelligence of
the group to make decisions.

TIME FRAME
30 - 60 mins

GROUP SIZE
10 - 40 people

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Display the relevant statement on which
there is likely to be a range of views.

2. On the wall spread out the following signs
from left to right: No; No, but; Yes, but; Yes

3. Give a little time for each person to reflect

on their position on the statement.

4.

Invite all participants to stand by the sign
that represents their view.

5. Facilitate debate. It can be good to start
with someone who’s view is in a minority,
or someone who tends to contribute less,
and ask them to argue their case.

6. Encourage movement if people find
themselves being swayed by others
arguments.

7. Consensus is not necessary but can be

sought through suggestions for change to
the wording of the suggested statement.

Note:
Encourage people to explain their own view rather
than going along with dominant opinion and to
challenge and modify the original statement rather
than try to force consensus.

appreciative inquiry

In less than one hour, a group of any size can
generate the list of conditions that have led
to its, or a project’s, success. You can liberate
spontaneous momentum and insights for
positive change from within the group as
“hidden” success stories are revealed. Positive
movement is sparked by the search for what
works now and by uncovering the root causes
that make success possible. Groups are
energized while sharing their success stories
instead of the usual depressing talk about
problems. Stories from the field offer social
proof of local solutions, promising prototypes,
and spread innovations while providing data
for recognising success patterns.

The exercise uses the collective intelligence of
the group to learn and adapt.

TIME FRAME
30 - 60 mins

5.

In plenary, collect insights and patterns
for the whole group to see on a flip chart.
Summarize if needed. 10-15 min.

6. Ask, “How are we investing in the assets
and conditions that foster success?”
and “What opportunities do you see to
do more?” Use 1-2-4-All to discuss the
questions. 10 min.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Describe the sequence of steps and specify
a theme or what kind of story participants
are expected to tell. 3 min.

2. Ask, “Please tell a story about a time

when....”

3. Ask participants to pair up preferably

with someone they don’t know well. In
pairs, participants take turns conducting
an interview and telling a success story,
paying attention to what made the success
possible. 7–10 min. each; 15–20 min. total.

4.

Invite pairs to join with another pair. In
groups of 4, each person retells the story
of his or her pair partner. Ask participants
to listen for patterns of the conditions or
assets that supported success and to make

blind man and the
elephant exercise

This activity will help people understand that
collective intelligence involves combining
diverse viewpoints to build a more complete
picture of a situation.

This exercise is inspired by a traditional folk
tale from India. It illustrates how individuals
can have many different interpretations when
asked to describe the same thing. In the
original story, six blind men have different
explanations when they are asked to describe
an elephant based on what they have heard
about elephants from other villagers.

Even when they encounter a real elephant,
each man is only able to ‘see’ what he already
believed to be true.

TIME FRAME
30 mins

GROUP SIZE
5 - 20+ people

MATERIALS
A copy of the folk tale - see below

PG. 214

They continue to disagree until Rajah reminds them “Perhaps if you put the parts together, you
will see the truth”. The story acts both as a warning against confirmation bias and a reminder of
the value of perspective awareness. Collective intelligence is built up by combining many unique
views of the world based on personasl experience, language, and culture.

c. Does the story give you any ideas
about how these problems can be
solved? Refer to the Overcoming
Biases Guide (p.152) and Crowd
Facilitation Guide (p.154) for
advice on how to surface unique
perspectives in group discussions.

3.

Introduce participants to the collective
intelligence design principles and use as
a basis for discussion around the benefits
of trying to harness collective intelligence
and why it needs conscious orchestration.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Read The Blind Men and the Elephant, a folk
tale from India. You may want to read it
out or let participants read it themselves.

2. After sharing the story, use the following
questions to guide a group discussion
about how different perspectives can
enhance the collective intelligence of
a group and the relevance for tackling
complex problems.

a. Do problems like this happen in real
life? Think of times when a project
failed because people saw situations
from different points of view, or
when only some people’s views were
considered. Describe what happened.

b. What if the men in this story were not

blind? Would they still have different
perceptions about elephants? Why or
why not?

THE BLIND MAN AND THE ELEPHANT

Long ago six old men lived in a village in India. Each
was born blind. The other villagers loved the old men
and kept them away from harm. Since the blind men
could not see the world for themselves, they had to
imagine many of its wonders. They listened carefully
to the stories told by travelers to learn what they
could about life outside the village.

The men were curious about many of the stories they
heard, but they were most curious about elephants.
They were told that elephants could trample forests,
carry huge burdens, and frighten young and old with
their loud trumpet calls. But they also knew that
the Rajah's daughter rode an elephant when she
traveled in her father's kingdom. Would the Rajah let
his daughter get near such a dangerous creature?

The old men argued day and night about elephants.
"An elephant must be a powerful giant," claimed the first
blind man. He had heard stories about elephants
being used to clear forests and build roads.

"No, you must be wrong," argued the second blind man.
"An elephant must be graceful and gentle if a princess is
to ride on its back."

"You're wrong! I have heard that an elephant can pierce
a man's heart with its terrible horn," said the third
blind man.

"Please," said the fourth blind man. "You are all
mistaken. An elephant is nothing more than a large sort
of cow. You know how people exaggerate."

"I am sure that an elephant is something magical," said
the fifth blind man. "That would explain why the Rajah's
daughter can travel safely throughout the kingdom."

"I don't believe elephants exist at all," declared the sixth
blind man. "I think we are the victims of a cruel joke."

Finally, the villagers grew tired of all the arguments,
and they arranged for the curious men to visit the
palace of the Rajah to learn the truth about elephants.
A young boy from their village was selected to guide
the blind men on their journey. The smallest man
put his hand on the boy's shoulder. The second
blind man put his hand on his friend's shoulder, and
so on until all six men were ready to walk safely
behind the boy who would lead them to the Rajah's
magnificent palace.

When the blind men reached the palace, they were
greeted by an old friend from their village who worked
as a gardener on the palace grounds. Their friend
led them to the courtyard. There stood an elephant.
The blind men stepped forward to touch the creature
that was the subject of so many arguments.

The first blind man reached out and touched the
side of the huge animal. "An elephant ais smooth
and solid like a wall!" he declared. "It must be
very powerful."

The second blind man put his hand on the elephant's
limber trunk. "An elephant is like a giant snake,"
he announced.

The third blind man felt the elephant's pointed tusk.
"I was right," he decided. "This creature is as sharp and
deadly as a spear."

The fourth blind man touched one of the elephant's
four legs. "What we have here," he said, "is an extremely
large cow."

The fifth blind man felt the elephant's giant ear. "I
believe an elephant is like a huge fan or maybe a magic
carpet that can fly over mountains and treetops," he said.

The sixth blind man gave a tug on the elephant's
coarse tail. "Why, this is nothing more than a piece of
old rope. Dangerous, indeed," he scoffed.

The gardener led his friends to the shade of a tree. "Sit here and rest for
the long journey home," he said. "I will bring you some water to drink."

While they waited, the six blind men talked about the elephant.

"An elephant is like a wall," said the first blind man. "Surely we can finally
agree on that."

"A wall? An elephant is a giant snake!" answered the second blind man.

"It's a spear, I tell you," insisted the third blind man.

"I'm certain it's a giant cow," said the fourth blind man.

"Magic carpet. There's no doubt," said the fifth blind man.

"Don't you see?" pleaded the sixth blind man. "Someone used a rope to
trick us."

Their argument continued and their shouts grew louder and louder.

"Wall!" "Snake!" "Spear!" "Cow!" "Carpet!" "Rope!"

"Stop shouting!" called a very angry voice.

It was the Rajah, awakened from his nap by the noisy argument.

"How can each of you be so certain you are right?" asked the ruler.

The six blind men considered the question. And then, knowing the Rajah
to be a very wise man, they decided to say nothing at all.

"The elephant is a very large animal," said the Rajah kindly. "Each man
touched only one part. Perhaps if you put the parts together, you will see the
truth. Now, let me finish my nap in peace."

When their friend returned to the garden with the cool water, the six
men rested quietly in the shade, thinking about the Rajah's advice.

"He is right," said the first blind man. "To learn the truth, we must put all the
parts together. Let's discuss this on the journey home."

The first blind man put his hand on the shoulder of the young boy
who would guide them home. The second blind man put a hand
on his friend's shoulder, and so on until all six men were ready to
travel together.

1-2-4 exercise

This activity will demonstrate how collective
intelligence enables you to generate better
ideas and more of them faster by tapping into
the knowledge that is distributed widely.

Engage everyone simultaneously in generating
questions, ideas, and suggestions. You can
immediately include everyone regardless of
how large the group is. You can generate
better ideas and more of them faster than
ever before. You can tap the know-how and
imagination that is distributed widely in places
not known in advance. Open, generative
conversation unfolds. Ideas and solutions
are sifted in rapid fashion. Most importantly,
participants own the ideas, so follow-up and
implementation is simplified.

TIME FRAME
15 - 30 mins

GROUP SIZE
20 - 40+ people

MATERIALS
Bell or timer to announce transitions. Sufficient
space for participants to work face-to-face in
pairs and foursomes.

PG. 216

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Begin by asking a question in response to
the presentation of an issue.(e.g., What
opportunities do you see for making
progress on this challenge? How would
you handle this situation? What ideas or
actions do you recommend?)

2. Then ask everyone to jot down their ideas
and answers to the question during a
period of silent reflection. 1 min.

6. Ask the group with a show of hands “who
felt they came away from that activity
with different ideas or insights?” Explain
that because the activity engaged every
individual in searching for answers we
created more ideas and more diverse
inputs, we created a safe space for
everyone to contribute. In doing this, we
harnessed the collective intelligence that is
in this room.

3. Generate ideas in pairs, building on ideas

7.

from self-reflection. 2 min.

4. Share and develop ideas from your pair
in foursomes (notice similarities and
differences). Maintain the rule of one
conversation at a time in the whole group.
4 min.

If the group's ideas were too similar or
information was not divergent, ask them
why might this be? Is it because they chose
to only share knowledge that they knew
they would have in common, rather than
insight that was unique to each of them?
Or is it because they all come from similar
professional backgrounds or experiences?

5. Ask, “What is one idea that stood out in

your conversation?” Each group shares one
important idea with all (repeat cycle as
needed). 5 min.

8. Refer back to the principles of collective
intelligence design - particularly the
importance of diversity and allowing
everyone to contribute independently.

Tip: if you don’t have a specific challenge or
issue that is relevant to your group, consider
taking one of the Sustainable Development
Goals and ask people about the opportunities
they see to make progress on that goal.
