> Description of the solution

AeroFarms uses indoor vertical farming strategy paired with artificial intelligence and plant biology. They use specific LED lighting to create a custom light algorith and have specific spectrum, intensity, and frequency which controls the physical and flavor components of the crops. The controlled indoor environment disrupts the normal cycle of indoor pests. This pest-resistant design prevents the use of pesticides.
