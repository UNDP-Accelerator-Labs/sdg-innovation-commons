Objective:   

Overall goal:  

Make a record and inventory of the amphibian species living in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires through citizen participation, helping the community get close to nature and becoming a potential management tool for environments identified as important sites for amphibians. 

Specific goals:  

Promote citizen participation in research projects to enhance the value of the amphibian fauna in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas.  

Identify the important sites for amphibian conservation in the City of Buenos Aires.  

Promote and combine the inventory-making and monitoring of amphibians at the important sites previously identified. 

Description of citizen participation: Anyone can upload records (photo or audio) which will be validated by the project's technical team and other users from the community, using a user profile in the iNaturalist (Argentinat) citizen science platform. The project leaders will upload these records when the citizens cannot do it on their own. Citizens should send them to the SAVE THE FROGS! Buenos Aires email. Through these records, contact is established with local citizens at places where a systematic field survey is needed, encouraging the rest of the citizens to monitor records and observe phenomena of interest (disappearance of water bodies or green spaces, etc.) as well as provide training in the territory to enhance and increase the number of records in the platform. Moreover, upon request of the relevant permissions, the photos or audio recordings sent to the project will be used to share educational content through the project’s social media, thus creating feedback. 

Time frame: 03/14/2017 - N/A.

Project leaders: 

Natalia Maruscak, SAVE THE FROGS! Buenos Aires. 

Rocío Rudak, SAVE THE FROGS! Buenos Aires.
