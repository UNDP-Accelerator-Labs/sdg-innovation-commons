> Title of the innovation

Irrigation farming and Livestock gives you money almost all the time and meets market demand

> Brief description of the innovation

I started growing tomatoes and onions last year 2020 getting water from a stream about 600 meters away f I'm the stream in Serenje Chibale area after discovering there's so much I can get from onion and tomatoes. I have put up a tank stand and 5000 ltr tank. I have planted tomatoes and onions and carbages. The only thing is I need drip lines for irrigation for efficience utilization of water and improve on power as am still using a pump which run on genset. I have applied for power, quotation came K143,000. Once this kind of resources are available, the area of Serenje can rely on me as both employer and hub of food not only for Chibale residents but the nation at large

I have applied for power, quotation came K143,000. Once this kind of resources are available, the area of Serenje can rely on me as both employer and hub of food not only for Chibale residents but the nation at large. Am currently working for Zesco but feel my contribution in farming will help my family and the linkage between our family and the community as there will be mutual benefits from the products from irrigation which has never happened before in that area and the community. The river has been there since inception but people around the area have never known the potential the stream has for generation of wealth and improve their lot in life. I have a strong feeling that people will realize the importance of both the land and water when my project will succeed. The only missing item is the resources to patch up move forward to prosperity. The project's intentions is to start growing cabbages, tomatoes and onions on commercial basis so that we can feed both the local and international community. The projected capacity earnings sits at K10 million per annum. Which will also be a value addition to the national reserves in terms of revenue from taxes once completed. Other future plans is to explore fish farming project once the first project is completed.
