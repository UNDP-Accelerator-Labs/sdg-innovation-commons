> Title of the innovation

Career Mentorship Programme in Universities

> Brief description of the innovation

Our research in Zambia on 260 youth participants showed that over 37% have not undergone formal mentorship in their life time. This could be the cause of many youths not achieving their full potential within their prime stage.
Live the Dream Foundation Limited has been mentoring learners from Primary Schools, Secondary Schools and University. It has had overwhelming response and great success stories - some of which will be shared in this document. These include inter alia concentration in schools among mentees, high pass marks, a sense of good direction and increased employability of our mentees who have undergone the programme.
Live the Dream Foundation has come up with the course outline of mentoring Learners and every other person who want to be mentored in Career Development, Living the Dream Principles and being an Outstanding Performer. The courses take the period of three months, meeting once a week. Different facilitators deliver the course outlines.
The aim of the mentorship at the moment is to start the scale up of mentoring learners in Lusaka and Copperbelt provinces in Zambia, forming ‘Live the Dream Clubs in Schools and Universities’ to ensure that the mentorship programme continues. The aim of the clubs is to ensure they run by themselves and on a weekly or monthly basis they get to have key speakers to mentor the members in the areas that they need to be mentored. In order for the mentorship sessions to be productive, mentees have to be consistent and there must be a mechanism to monitor the consistency and at the end of the period, they must graduate in the area they have been mentored.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Innovation is more of a service, it will largely generate value for money in terms of impacting the economy, being effective and efficient as the result of the youths we are mentoring.
The challenge price will be able to help the business grow for it will provide the Live the Dream Foundation organisation with resources that will be able for it to better mentor learners both female and male. We believe in Zambia that what we need is for learners to be mentored by people who have gone ahead of them to ensure they become high impact citizens. In Zambia there has not been a formal way of mentoring learners and therefore by implication they are being mentored by social media and what they listen to on TV without knowing. There is need for a deliberate formal mentorship.

The value addition of the innovation is that it will:
1. Provide access to knowledge, information and skills a learner is not yet aware of or don’t have. It improves different aspects of life especially for specific areas that need adequate improvement. The target areas of improvement are career development, achieving goals (living the dream) and being an outstanding performer.

2.  motivating one in so many ways especially wen one has no ideas on how to go about certain things.
3. Learn things that would have taken a learner a lot of time to know. It gives great advantage as the learner already has enough information about certain things before stepping into them.
4. Builds in self reliance and direction in interests, directs the mentees focus on their strengths and builds the mentees confidence.
5. Gives better focus to learners, helps prepare well for given tasks and responsibilities; gives moral, courage to tackle new challenges and opportunities and improves self esteem; provides a platform to mingle with like minded individuals and grow in that area through networking; Provides a good support system.

> Technical Feasibility

Mentoring youths both male and female with 60% being females.
The programme will be implemented accordingly considering the three areas of mentorship for a period of 3 months. The three areas that will be mentored are:
Career Development.
Live the Dream Principles.
Outstanding Performer
During this period, planning, monitoring and frequency of giving reports will be conducted. Attendance of mentees and feedback sessions will be very important.

Live the Dream Foundation believes that being an Outstanding Performer you must work towards it and have principles that must sustain the repetition of an outstanding performer.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve the lives of others by mentoring the learners. We believe that if learners are mentored, they will be better responsible and that will affect them positively, their family, the community they will come from and the nation at large.

The innovation will improve learners by mentoring them the journey to having a great career, living the dream and being an outstanding performer by mentors who have demonstrated such good traits in society.
We believe that if one person is impacted, he can impact her or his family, the community and the country at large.

The proposed innovation is relevant to the proposed market for the world has become very fast and learners need to learners need to be deliberately mentored on how they can succeed in their areas of interest. 
The research of over 260 learners has shown the learners look forward to having mentorship programmes but they are not just available. This research can be found here:
