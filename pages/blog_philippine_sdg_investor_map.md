Globally, despite gains achieved in some SDG goals, the overall SDG progress is slow and even in some cases reversed in the past three years. The COVID-19 pandemic -- and other various global crises that we faced -- heavily impacted the collective achievements towards the 17 Global Goals. In the Asia and the Paciﬁc, the latest SDG Progress Report as of 2024 points that the region is 32 years behind schedule in achieving the SDGs. And given its current pace, the region will achieve only one-third of the necessary progress by 2030. Now more than ever, the need to accelerate our efforts through multi-stakeholder action has become even more urgent and necessary.In the Philippines, while we see progress particularly in reducing poverty, ensuring good health for all, providing quality education, and protecting life below water, challenges remain in moving the needle towards the attainment of the other goals. Intensiﬁed efforts from all actors to support government actions, harnessing the critical role of the civil society and the private sector, with the aid of development partners, are imperative in designing a viable blueprint to collectively achieve our Common Agenda and shared ambitions.Foreword5
To achieve transformational changes in reducing hunger, promoting gender equality, as well as
addressing climate problems, greater private sector engagement and investments are seriously
needed. The private sector can bring ﬂexibility and speed in delivery, as well as innovative ways
of ﬁnancing the SDGs. It is for this very reason that the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) in the Philippines led the development of the SDG Investor Maps.

SDG Investor Maps, created by countries across the globe, are market intelligence tools that aim
to support the private sector in determining investment themes in emerging markets, which have
signiﬁcant potential to advance the Global Goals. As these Maps are anchored on and aligned
with government priorities and national development needs, they serve as useful technology for
the private sector, particularly for investors who are looking to invest in the SDGs.

The Philippines' experience in developing its own Map is a symbol of synergistic partnership
among the government, the UN, and the private sector in constructing a collaborative instrument
for sustainable development. The themes and investment areas identiﬁed in the country’s Map
that support the 17 SDGs reﬂect the shared vision of the country to promote a holistic and
multidimensional approach in achieving its development priorities.

As UNDP Philippines launches the ﬁrst iteration of the country’s SDG Investor Map, it is our
fervent hope that the information and analyses that the Map offers will become instrumental in
further invigorating the country’s dedication towards continued collaboration and efforts in
attaining the 2030 Agenda. As it has always been, UNDP will remain steadfast in supporting the
government, the private sector, and other stakeholders in its initiatives that aim to realize the
Future We Want – a future where no one is left behind.

The Philippines’ SDG Investor Map was developed by the UNDP Philippines, with the support of the SDG Impact and the Centre for Impact Investing and Practices, a non-proﬁt center established by Temasek Trust. The Map also beneﬁted from the support of the Joint SDG Fund Joint Programme on Integrated National Financing Framework in the Philippines or JP INFF.The UNDP Philippines contracted the services of Mr. Rafael Lopa to facilitate the creation of the Map, for his known expertise on private sector engagement and policy, and with his team the Map was successfully produced.The Philippines’ Map was prepared through close collaboration with the government, including the National Economic and Development Authority, and line agencies, such as the Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Education, and Department of Energy, among others. In addition, the Map will not be produced without the support and partnership of all private sector entities who participated in the mapping process.UNDP PhilippinesAljo Quintans, SDG SpecialistArlan Brucal, EconomistJingde Liu, Private Sector Engagement InternSDG Impact TeamDevahuti Choudury, Senior SDG Impact Specialist Ritika Mehrothra, Independent Consultant7Acknowledgement
Introduction8With only 6 years before the 2030 deadline and having to face several global and national challenges in the last 3 years which eroded progress on the SDGs, the need to heighten efforts to accelerate progress towards the SDGs becomes more urgent. In terms of global SDG attainment, progress stopped and even reversed as of 2023, wherein the COVID-19 pandemic, and other various global crises impacted the countries’ achievements towards the 17 SDGs.The latest global-level data paints a concerning picture that only 15% of our SDG targets are on track and more than 30% of the targets have experienced no progress or even worsened from the 2015 baseline. This underscores the pressing need for intensiﬁed efforts through multistakeholder action to push forward the SDG agenda.
9Source: 2023 Philippine Pace of Progress, PSAIn the case of the Philippines, progress was observed in reducing poverty (SDG 1), promoting good health and wellbeing (SDG 3), providing quality education for all (SDG 4) and protecting life below water (SDG 14).The average overall progress towards achieving all 17 SDGs in the Asia-Paciﬁc region has increased slowly from 4.4 per cent in 2017 to 14.4 per cent in 2022. However, the total number of years required to achieve the SDG targets in the Asia-Paciﬁc region has increased, which means the region will miss the 2030 target year by several decades based on the 2024 SDG Progress Report.Figure 1. Philippines’ SDG Progress, 2023
Role of the Private Sector

Rallying private sector participation and strengthening private and public sector networks for
achieving sustainable and inclusive economic growth take on new urgency. National resource
mobilization and increased commitments from private investors and enterprises will be needed
for recovery, while maintaining progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. To achieve transformational changes in health, climate,
environment, education, agriculture, gender equality, and the eradication of poverty in all its
forms, greater private sector engagement and investments are critically needed.

As interest grows among private sector actors to align investment activity with the SDGs, there
is a demonstrated need for unifying standards, tools, and services that can be relied upon by
investors to support a process of targeting, measuring, and achieving development outcomes.

SDG Investor Maps are market intelligence tools that help the private sector identify investment
themes in emerging markets which have signiﬁcant potential to advance the SDGs that are
aligned to government policies and sustainable national development needs. It seeks to address
the need for more private capital to be channeled to the developing market, and for the funding
to contribute to the SDGs. Private sector investors who are looking for SDG investments can use
the SDG Investor Maps to explore investment themes in the knowledge that they are aligned to
the identiﬁed SDG needs in country and the government’s development priorities - thereby
strengthening the potential for deep sustainable development.

The SDG Investor Map follows an 8-step methodology that allows the ﬁltering down of national
priorities to derive Investment Opportunity Areas (IOAs).

Figure 2. SDG Investor Map Methodology

In the case of the Philippines, there are a total of twelve (12) IOAs identiﬁed as part of its ﬁrst
iteration of the Map covering seven (7) sectors supporting the 17 SDGs.

1.Affordable Education Loansfor Students in Primary and Secondary Education14Market Size: >USD 1 billionIndicative Return: 15% - 20%Payback Period: Short Term (less than 5 years)Investment Size: < USD 500,000Sustainable Development Goals:
Development Need

Result of decades-long suboptimal investment in education, which stood at only 3.9% of GDP in
20201, is alarming. With learning poverty rate at 90.9% as of 20212, the country ranks the lowest
in international large-scale assessments, such as the 2018 Programme for International Student
Assessment [PISA] and the 2018 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study [TIMSS]).

Due to the lack of access to educational ﬁnancing or loans, only 75.7% Filipino students are able
to complete two years of senior high school3. Many students are forced to stop schooling
because household income is not enough to cover expenses beyond family’s basic needs such
as food and shelter. This inter-generational cycle of lack of education and means to get out of
poverty trap persists. Educational ﬁnancing can provide the means to break the cycle through
ﬁnancing human capital.

In most low-income Filipino households, the women are compelled to quit school because
culture and societal beliefs remain that women should be left at home doing care work. This is
reﬂected in the decreasing number of women completing senior high school from 84.8% in 2018
to 74.6% in 20204.

Business Description

Invest in business models offering short-term ﬁnancing solutions through short term loans issued
to students / households / educational institutions with tenure of less than or equal to one year
and interest rates of around 1.5% per month, allowing the borrowers to pay enrollment fee in
low-cost EMIs throughout the school year5. The loans can be offered to those who applied for
the voucher system but are not covered by the said program.

Expected Development Outcome

• Access to low-cost and low-interest rate loans that do not require collateral shall allow
learners to continue their education especially in times of unexpected ﬁnancial shocks
experienced by families.

• Students who dropped out during the pandemic due to ﬁnancial problems may also be

encouraged to enroll again given access to alternative affordable ﬁnancing.

Enabling Environment

• Expanded Government Assistance for Students and Teachers in Private Education Act
(RA 8545) of 1998: "Sec5: Financial Assistance for tuition for students in private high
schools shall be provided by the government through a voucher system"6.

• Lending Company Regulations Act (RA 9474) of 2007. "No lending company shall

conduct business unless granted authority to operate by SEC"7.

• Truth in Lending Act (RA 3765) of 1963. "State to protect its citizens from a lack of
awareness of the true cost of credit to the user by assuring a full disclosure of such cost
with a view of preventing the uninformed use of credit to the detriment of the national
economy"8.

• SEC MC No. 03 s. 2022 SECTION 3. Applicable ceiling/s on interest rates and other fees

for speciﬁc loans offered by LCs, FCs, and their OLPs9.

• E.O. No. 150, series of 1994 - Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) was
granted the express authority to manage and administer contributions, donations, grants,
bequests, gifts and/or loans from the government for programs of assistance to private
education10.

• RA 11534: Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act (CREATE): Deﬁnes
the tax incentives for registered business enterprises investing in the Philippines
including a tax of only one percent (1%) on their taxable income for educational
businesses11.

• Republic Act No. 11595 liberalized restrictions on foreign direct investments: reduced
capital requirements on retail enterprises with foreign entity. Minimum paid-up capital to
only USD 500,000, and minimum investment per store of USD 200,000.

Impact Risks

• Social and Economic: Marginalization may also be reinforced by businesses refraining
from providing loans for low-income households with poor credit history but need further
ﬁnancial bridging.

◦ Low-income schools could incur further costs if the loans structured do not have

mitigating features for further delays in government payments.

• Gender inequality and/or marginalization: If ﬁnancing is not granted the trend of women

not ﬁnishing senior high school may continue.

Case Studies

• Maybridge Finance12, founded in 2008, as a ﬁnance institution lending to SMEs in
healthcare, education, renewable energy, low-cost housing, and ﬁnancial technology
sectors, pivoted to becoming an education-centric ﬁnance institution since 2017 that
focuses on bridging ﬁnancing gaps in the Philippines education sector. Funding for
Maybridge projects include Luxembourg-based Backbone Emerging Market Fund.

◦ Maybridge Finance also provides ﬁnancing to small private schools, its suppliers,
students, and other stakeholders. It offers a lending program to Philippine private
high schools that is complimentary to the Department of Education's (DEPED)
Subsidy program.

◦ This ﬁnancing program allows schools to discount upto half of its subsidy claim –
which is approximately USD 90,000. It issues loans at a monthly interest rate of
1.5%, i.e. around 19.56% compounded annually, and charges Loan Administration
and Processing Fees of 1.75%. Payment of loans is dependent on DepEd's ability to
process a subsidy claim.

• Phinma Education Holdings Inc13., which started investing in education in 2004, is a
private-owned education insitution with a network of 10 schools in the country– 9 in the
Philippines and 1 in Indonesia. In addition to providing quality education, Phinma
Education also offers a ﬁnancing program to its Philippine students. Tuition fee at
Philippine Phinma Schools typically range from USD 800-1,000.

◦ Phinma Education's "Bukas" program offers its students a ﬂexible 12-month tuition
payment plan, charging monthly interest rates of 1.5%, i.e. ~19.56% compounded
annually, with a one-time service fee of 3%. Students may pre-terminate or fully pay
these plans before 12 months without incurring additional fees/penalties.

Development Need

Food security has been a cross-industry development need for the Philippines. Pre-pandemic
Surveys (2019) done by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute show that 60% of households
worry about food14. Malnutrition is also attributed to reduced learning capabilities, a
developmental aspect critical to the Philippines. Stunting which is characterized by low height-
to-age ratio was measured at 28% in 2019 with 5.8% low weight-to-age ratio termed wasting.
UNICEF estimates that due to the pandemic, progress in these fronts have regressed further15.

According to the October 2022 mobile vulnerability analysis and mapping (MVAM), one out of
ten households in the Philippines are food insecure16. Meanwhile, the UN's 2022 State of Food
Security and Nutrition in the World report showed around 5.9 million Filipinos were
undernourished in the 2020-2022 period, the second highest in Southeast Asia17. The food crisis
is caused by various issues, including the limited infrastructure to link farmers and markets18.

The 2022 MVAM results indicate that the poorest regions, including BARMM, Region VIII, and
XII, are the most food insecure. BARMM, the country's poorest region, records food insecurity
above 30%. Agricultural households (25%) are more food insecure than non-agricultural
households (9%). Investing in post-harvest infrastructure, like cold storage, will help reduce
inequality.

Business Description

Provide affordable and energy-efficient cold storage services for small and medium farmers
close to farming areas for perishable agricultural products (meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables).
Internal return rates for building agricultural cold storage facilities to provide the needed
services are pegged at around 15%-20% based on recent public-private partnership feasibility
data.

Expected Development Outcome

• Food hubs can help lessen food prices by reducing the needed layers of traders and

resellers in the food supply chain, thereby addressing the issue of food insecurity.

• Storage facilities also provide better income opportunities to farmers who can chose to

store their produce rather than selling it at a loss or incurring losses due to spoilage.

• Availability of storage facilities improves the stability of supply of food items, especially

during off-production seasons.

• Solutions that stabilize food prices can contribute towards improving food security levels
for low-income households which are severely affected by price ﬂuctuations, and
thereby improve their families' quality of life.

• Farmers and ﬁsherfolks have the highest poverty incidence, 34.3% and 34% respectively,

and solutions that help improve the stability of their income will be productive.

Enabling Environment

• RA 8435 (Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997) "Construction of farm-to-
market roads shall be a priority investment of the LGUs which shall provide a counterpart
of not less than ten percent (10%) of the project cost subject to their IRA level"19.

• National Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization and Industrialization Plan 2021-2030
presents various plans and frameworks of the government in achieving the sector goal.
It comprises of 3 interrelated component plans on commodity, regions and functions20.

• Farm-to-Market Road Network Plan (FMRNP) presents "systematic list of existing and

proposed roads detailing their connectivity and links to agri-ﬁshery" key areas21.

• The Department of Agriculture issued guidelines the implementation of registration
guidelines and the issuance of permit to operate for stakeholders involved in agricultural
and ﬁsheries machinery production and trade, to address information asymmetry that
restricts fair trade22.

• DOLE, DA and TESDA Joint Memorandum Circular No. 02-2021 details the guidelines
and standards on the manpower complement of certiﬁed agricultural and ﬁsheries
machinery pools and service centers23.

• RA 10000 (Agri-Agra Reform Credit Act of 2009) mandates all government and private
banking institutions to allocate at least 25% of their total loanable funds for agriculture
and agrarian reform beneﬁciaries (ARBs)24.

Impact Risks

• Social and Economic: Inefficient supply chain and logistics will continue to push up prices

and worsen food insecurity.

• Environmental: Without transition to low emission energy supply, cold storage will

increase electricity consumption, which in turn will increase emissions.

• Gender inequality and/or marginalization risk: If access to facility is difficult, it could

hamper those from far-ﬂung areas to maximize impact of investments.

3.Affordable and Resilient Housing Infrastructure Market Size: USD 100 million -USD 1 billionIndicative Return: 15% - 20%Payback Period: Medium Term (5 - 10 years)Investment Size: < USD 500,000Sustainable Development Goals:22
Development Need

Infrastructure needs cut across multiple sectors including housing, transportation, and utilities.
Based on a 2015 study by JICA, the annual loss in GDP due to inadequate infrastructure amounts
to USD 20 Billion. (4) With the implementation of the "Build Build Build" policy, government
spending on infrastructure increased, amounting to around 19.5% of total government spending
in 2019. Post-pandemic, inadequacy in key infrastructure across agriculture, transportation and
logistics, education and energy persist, thereby prompting continued interest in promoting
public-private partnership for infrastructure development28.

The country's path towards acceptable housing is constrained due to several factors: (1) The ratio
of unit housing cost to income has risen such that poor households have minimal to negative
income left after paying for housing expenditure, while low-income but not poor households are
vulnerable to experience the same. (2) there are few low-cost alternatives to homeownership in
the formal market while many low-cost housing projects are far from Metro Manila's city centers,
which can signiﬁcantly add to the households' transportation cost; and (3) innovative housing
ﬁnance is limited29.

In 2015, around 500,000 families out of 23 million households in the Philippines occupied
houses and lots without paying rent and without the owner’s consent. An estimate of over 6.8
million housing units is required to cover the growing population as of 2022. Data shows that
even if an average of 200,000 housing units will be produced annually from 2012, backlog will
persist at 6.5 million households in 203030. Rapid urbanization in the country results in an
increase in slum population. In 2010, over 4 million people were estimated to be living in Metro
Manila slums. By 2050, this is expected to rise to over 9 million31.

Business Description

Invest in B2B/B2C models engaged in building affordable homes for the population in peri-urban
informal settlements, especially the areas surrounding Manila or those living in disaster-prone
areas in Metro Manila, with focus on sustainability32.

In this model, the local government unit (LGU) plays a lead entrepreneurial (investor-of- ﬁrst
resort) role. Returns are arranged by the LGU and the Department of Socialized Housing and
Urban Development, which range from 15% to 20%. To ensure transferability and sustainability
of the program, the LGU will charge rental fee comparable to other public housing projects i.e.
between USD 14 to 36 per month, lower than the average monthly rental for a comparable
private apartment unit, about USD 50 to 70.

Expected Development Outcome

• Construction of affordable housing will contribute to the country's goal to provide 6
families, homeless, and

informal settler

for the

million decent housing units
underprivileged by 2028.

• The housing program is seen to generate 1.7 M jobs once it goes full blast with
construction (9). These livable communities aim to provide equitable, inclusive, and
resilient opportunities to improve human well-being and contribute to economic vitality.

• With sufficient and accessible sanitation facilities that come with decent housing, families
will be able to improve and take care of their health better. Children may perform well in
school because they now have an environment at home conducive for learning.

• In building these secured and decent housing communities, there are opportunities to
have shelter initiatives responding to practical needs of the underserved sectors, such
as provision of livelihood trainings, access to health clinics and basic utilities.

Enabling Environment

• RA 7279 or the Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992 provides that socialized

housing be provided for the underprivileged and the homeless (Article V, Sec. 15).

◦ o (Article V, Sec. 20) provides several incentives for private sector participating in
socialized housing including ease of doing business, namely: reduction and
simpliﬁcation of qualiﬁcation and accreditation requirements and simpliﬁcation of
ﬁnancing procedures, as well as tax exemptions such as capital gains tax or ordinary
income tax.

• RA 7644: New Rent Control Law, Section 1 sets the allowable maximum increase of rent

for the ﬁve-year period.

• RA 11201: Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development Act: Section 5.III.c
Implement a single regulatory system that shall govern all activities relative to...housing
and urban development projects.

• RA 7160: Local Government Code of 1991: Chapter 2. Section 17. Basic Services and
Facilities (of the Local Government Units), (viii) Programs and projects for low-cost
housing and other mass dwellings.

• RA 10884: Balanced Housing Development Program Amendments: Subdivision and
condominium developers are required to develop 5-15% socialized housing or
“socialized condominiums” of their total project area.

• National Housing and Urban Development Sector Plan 2040 is a long-term framework
that guides the development of sustainable and resilient cities and communities in the
Philippines. It aims to provide decent and affordable housing, improve urban
infrastructure, and promote inclusive growth.

24

• Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028: Subchapter 2.3. Establish Livable
Communities expresses that by 2028, livable communities are established, and human
settlements are upgraded offering equitable, inclusive, resilient, and quality life for all
Filipinos.

Impact Risks

• Social: Lack of affordable housing limits property ownership among low-income families.

It increases the number of informal settler families, living in hazardous areas.

• Environmental: Informal settlements, situated in non-residential zones, increase pollution

and may lead to mismanagement of natural resources.

• Gender inequality/marginalization: Informal settlements further limit disadvantaged
groups to access government services, which hinder their social, economic and political
development.

Case Studies

• Valenzuela City Socialized Housing:

◦ With a total of 13 hectares, the Disiplina Village Ugong and Bignay accommodate
around 4,594 informal settler families, clearing up Valenzuela City (a city within the
Greater Metro Manila Area) from informal settler families (ISFs) living in danger
zones. The ﬂoor area of each unit is 28 sq. m. including the loft. The project was
initiated and implemented by the City Government with the funding support of the
private sector such as the San Miguel Corporation and MERALCO, amounting to
around USD 1.5 million.

◦ To ensure transferability and sustainability of the program, the “Ordinance
Establishing Disiplina Village as the Flagship Socialized Housing Program of
Valenzuela City”, Ordinance No. 36, Series of 2011 was enacted by the City Council,
that included provisions on basic services and funding being the responsibility of
the city government to sustain a very low rental cost of only USD 50 per month, the
lowest rate in a public rental housing project in the country.

• Quezon City Socialized Housing:

◦

In 2014, Phinma Properties and the Quezon City Local Government partnered to
build the Bistekville II Socialized Housing in Barangay Kaligayahan, with 1,101
housing units in the 4.8-ha land (4). Each socialised houshing unit is amortised to the
customer for around USD 50 per month for a period of 30 years.

◦ Between 2013 and 2019, 5,698 families have been provided safe and permanent
shelters in Quezon City through social housing initiatives funded by the local city
government. The current programme has ﬁnalized 37 communities and aims to
complete 44 more communities by the end of 2019.

Based on the 2020 Annual Poverty Indicators Survey of the Philippine Statistics Authority, the
main sources of water supply for Filipino families were water piped into their dwelling (54.1%),
sourced from protected wells (21.5%), communal sources such as public taps, and developed
springs (16.0%), while around 10% of rely on “unsafe sources” such as unprotected wells, or
rainwater33. This Bulk Water Supply Infrastructure for Underserved Areas will provide sanitized
water for daily necessities to this group of people, and thereby also reduce the probabilities of
diseases that can be communicated via water.

In a survey conducted last December 2023, 17 million out of 25 million households or 67% have
access to running water. With the looming El Niño phenomenon, at least 16 provinces in the
Philippines, most of which are big palay producers, will be severely hit by its impact34.

Large corporations such as Ayala Corporation and San Miguel identify water security risks to be
one of the main issues expected to arise due to climate change impacts. A study conducted by
the World Resources Institute ranked the country 57th most likely to be water-stressed by
204035. The bulk water supply system offers better control of water use and reduce wasting
water.

Business Description

Construct and operate Bulk Water Supply Infrastructure within areas recognised by the local
government, requiring support and initial studies. Investment maybe through direct investment
or project ﬁnancing with the local government unit. Return is expected through bulk water
charge from off-takers. Recent successful partnerships within the space show a return proﬁle of
10% to 15%.

Expected Development Outcome

• Contribute to achieving universal access to safe water and basic sanitation by 2030 in
the Philippines. Additionally, improve the quality of access to water sources for families
across the income spectrum.

• Reduce cases and mortality rates from water-borne illnesses such as cholera and

diarrhea. Mortality for acute bloody diarrhea is at 3 deaths per 100,000 in 2019 (12)

With over a 100 million population, the Philippines is now producing over 21 million metric tons
of garbage annually39. Despite an existing law mandating segregation of garbage at the
barangay (village) level, waste management is still a problem. Trash ends up in water bodies,
resulting to diseases, pollution, drainage clogs causing ﬂoods, among others40.

Proper waste management is crucial for sustainable development in the Philippines.
Environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable practices are needed to prevent
pollution, conserve natural resources, promote sustainable consumption, and protect public
health and safety while reducing social inequities and empowering communities.

The government eyes the establishment of 300 more sanitary landﬁlls nationwide through
public-private partnership in the next two years41.

Business Description

Invest in construction and operation of efficient solid waste management infrastructure,
including sewage systems and sanitation centers. Investments can be concentrated in areas
with high demand as identiﬁed by the local governments.

Expected Development Outcome

• Effective solid waste management practices can reduce the risk of exposure to disease-
causing agents and contaminants that can harm public health. Proper waste disposal
methods and sanitation practices can prevent the spread of diseases, leading to better
overall health outcomes for communities.

• The efficient management of solid waste can generate new business opportunities and
jobs in the waste management industry. Recycling and composting programs can create
new markets for recycled materials and reduce the cost of waste disposal, leading to
potential economic beneﬁts for communities.

• Proper solid waste management practices can lead to a reduction in pollution of air,
water, and soil, which can help protect biodiversity and ecosystems from degradation
caused by improperly managed waste.

Malampaya's natural gas ﬁelds will be depleted by 2027, leading to importing liqueﬁed natural
gas (LNG). Imported gas costs and volatile supplies result in higher power prices42.

There are reports of electricity shortage, with 12 predicted yellow alerts in Luzon from March to
November 2023, and a proposed P12.536 billion budget cut may result in power outages in
800k+ homes across the country, primarily in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

Electricity prices in the Philippines remain among the highest in Southeast Asia. In December
2021, the Philippines’ residential rate was $0.16/kWh, second to Singapore ($0.18/kWh) and

The Philippines consistently have the highest electricity prices compared to relative ASEAN
countries47. Coupled with this, there are grid challenges that creates congestions, uneven power
distribution and stranded electricity that cause power interruptions on some congested areas,
but also wasted energy produced because of power production.

Additionally, as of 2021, 5 percent of Filipino households still live without electricity, bereft of the
beneﬁts including increased welfare and productivity, education, and improved indoor air
quality. Majority of these un-energized households are located in Abra, Albay, Masbate, Basilan,
Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Lanao Del Sur and are being catered by ailing and problematic electric
cooperatives (ECs)48.

While data from the Philippine Statistics Authority shows that 95% of families in the Philippines
already have access to electricity. The Philippine Development Plan of 2023 to 2028 recognized
Philippines still has multiple signiﬁcant challenges in providing access to electricity. Multiple
areas are still not connected to the main grid where concessionaires are mainly operating small
off-grid power generators, mostly diesel-based. Additionally, there are challenges in depletion
of current sources of energy. As such, the Philippines envisions tripling renewable energy
capacity by 2030, requiring an additional 14,900 MW, including from solar power49.

Development Need

According to the Banko Sentral ng Pilipinas, around 56% of adults have bank accounts as of
2022, an increase from 29% in 2019 which is mainly driven by electronic banking. However,
access to insurance and other ﬁnancing solutions are still below adequate levels. In 2022,
insurance industry in the Philippines contributed only around 1.72 percent to its total gross
domestic product53.

Recent research shows a widening gap for lending activities in the agriculture industry, banks
usually site the risk level of default as the main barrier to ﬁnancing agriculture better. In addition,
as of 2021, only 1 in 3 farmers in the country has access to insurance. This phenomenon is known
as the agriculture credit gap, the difference between the credit requirements of the priority
commodities and the ﬁnancing supplied by banks. In 2014, the Agriculture Credit Policy Council
(ACPC) in the Philippines pegged this gap at around USD 7 billion54.

Coupled with the increasing losses brought by the effects of climate change, the agriculture
sector and consequently the country's food supply is at risk if no adequate ﬁnancing and
insurance solutions will be placed. In 2021, agricultural damages brought by natural calamities
amounted to around USD 450 million55. No improvement was seen in January 2022 where
damages brought by rains and ﬂoods alone totaled to around USD 13 million56. Farmers are often
not ﬁnancially protected against these shocks.

Business Description

Invest in insurance solutions (max of 7.5% of daily minimum wage for premium and charges) for
low-income and highly exposed smallholder farmers. This model incorporates an efficient
claims-processing system, through physical and digital platforms, thereby increasing access,
that automatically initiates payouts when predeﬁned index triggers are met. Design and service
delivery of insurance products for smallholder farmer can be implemented in partnership with
micro-ﬁnancial service providers.

Expected Development Outcome

• This IOA would help shorten the recovery rate of the agricultural sector after calamities.
As a result, there would be an improvement in agricultural productivity contributing to an
increase in the country's overall GDP.

• Better access to ﬁnancing can improve farmers productivity as they can use the capital
to technology and infrastructures to increase yield. As a result, this also improves the
household food security as stable supply leads to more manageable prices for
consumers.

• Insurance solutions will also increase investments for the agriculture sector which

experiences weak investment due to the risk of natural disasters.

Impact Risks

• Economic: Delayed payment of claims can cause users to decline because of

unreliability.

• Gender inequality and/or Marginalization: Without ﬁnancial insurance, farmers will
experience greater losses which may render them ﬁnancially inadequate to continue
farming in future.

Development Need

In 2018, public spending on health was only USD 50 per person, i.e., only half the amount spent
by ASEAN countries that successfully implemented universal healthcare. Post pandemic,
analysts expect that the under-ﬁve mortality rate has increased compared to the last reported
2019 data of 12.83%. This is coupled with multiple closures of last mile healthcare delivery
services due to severe cashﬂow issues during the pandemic. Industry leaders highlight the need
for reinvestment in the sector to improve basic healthcare within the country.

Multiple challenges related to health IT emerged during the pandemic. Many hospitals had to
close business due to delays in payment resulting from challenges in processing of requests by
the government owned health insurance company, PhilHealth. Such closures and slowness of
data collection caused delayed delivery of treatment, and other health-related emergencies.

The lack of a digital healthcare solutions including payments within the Philippine Health
Insurance Corporation threatens the ﬁnancial risk protection of millions of Filipinos. The
inadequacy also hampers healthcare delivery systems as many hospitals are dependent on
PhilHealth.

Business Description

Invest in B2B payment processing platform solutions which will streamline payment processing
and expedite reimbursements from both private and government-owned insurance companies.
This digital solution includes claims management, automated payment posting, and electronic
remittance advice (ERA) processing. Revenue can be generated from transaction charges from
hospitals, health care providers, and insurance companies including PhilHealth.

Expected Development Outcome

• Ensuring efficiency, accountability, and transparency in the processes of PhilHealth will
result in the improvement of service delivery and ﬁnancial protection among its
stakeholders57.

• Having improved payment system will lessen risks of small clinics in remote areas in
having sufficient working capital, essential for sustaining operations, which sometimes
lead to closure of critical healthcare facilities, especially in marginalized areas.

• Promotion of digital solutions on healthcare payments will increase productivity in the
health sector that will contribute to addressing other system-related problems, including
information management for better healthcare services.

Development Need

The Philippine Development Plan 2023-2028 outlines four priorities to improve the health sector
and achieve universal health care in the new normal: (1) improvement of the social determinants
of health, especially for the vulnerable sector; (2) people empowerment towards healthy choices
and behavior.

he Philippines' hospital bed density of 1.2 beds for every 1000 people, is one of the lowest
statistics in the world. To reach the target of 4 beds for every 1000 population – as that of upper
middle-income and high-income countries – additional 400,000 beds are required. By 2040,
outpatient visits and inpatient bed-days are expected to increase by 60% mostly due to lifestyle-
and aging-related noncommunicable diseases. In NCR alone, the projected need of Level 1, 2,
and 3 hospital beds are 3189, 1351, and 1985, respectively61.

The Philippine Health Facility Development Plan for 2020-2040 (PHFDP) emphasizes the
importance of investing in specialty health facilities. Speciﬁcally, investment of USD 1.446 billion
in infrastructure and equipment is required until 2025 and USD 19.4 billion for Specialized
Laboratories.

Business Description

Invest in construction of new hospitals or expansion of existing healthcare facilities in remote
and underserved areas to improve bed capacity. Affordability is at the forefront of this initiative,
employing cost-effective, modular hospital designs.

Expected Development Outcome

• Healthcare facilities will be able to cater to variety of health conditions by being able to
provide multi-specialty services. With an increased capacity of available health
infrastructure, the health care and treatment need of the population will be addressed.

• With adequate public healthcare facilities, and competent personnel, Filipinos would be

encouraged to take care of their health better.

• Availability of public healthcare facilities, especially in far-ﬂung areas, will entice Filipinos
to have their health checked without the challenges of riding a boat to the main island;
or traversing a rough path to reach the town.

Latest data from the National Kidney and Transplant Institute states that 40 Filipinos develop
renal disease per day. In 2021, more than 7M Filipinos had been diagnosed with chronic kidney
disease (1). Along with other NCDs, renal diseases belong to the top 10 causes of mortality in the
country62.

Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), including kidney problems, related to unhealthy lifestyles
and environments and an increasingly ageing population are currently the leading cause of
mortality among Filipino adults, which comprised 64% of total deaths in the country as of 2019.
Meanwhile, there are 2.3 million Filipinos with chronic kidney disease and only 372 dialysis
centers in the country as of 202363.

Low-income population and those in remote areas are the most impacted due to inadequate
public health services. Health care facilities, including specialized health centers for kidney
diseases, often close down due to lack of proper investment and ﬁnancing solutions, which in-
turn adversely impacts such communities.

Business Description

with identiﬁed demand and support from local government

Expected Development Outcome

• The establishment of specialized healthcare facilities will help in slowing down the
mortality rate due to NCDs and other diseases needing specialized care and contribute
towards increase in the life expectancy of patients diagnosed with such diseases.

• Supplementary to Philippine Health Center, the creation of specialty health facilities is
crucial to the attainment of universal health care. This allows more focused provision of
care and services for speciﬁc health conditions while increasing the capacity to cater to
the health needs of the rest of the population.

Development Need

Internet access especially in remote areas remain to be a challenge. As of June 2023, only 35%
of the country is reported to have access to the internet64. With heavy transition of education
towards hybrid learning, lack of access to internet and technology signiﬁcantly adds to learning
losses.

This issue is even more prominent in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas (GIDAs)
which lack ICT infrastructure. For instance, in Bangsamoro region where most GIDA can be
found, only 51% of elementary schools have access to internet, which is 14% lower than the
national average (DepEd 2022)65. Further, in a study by T4 Education, around 72% of the
teachers observed learning losses in poorer sections of the country primarily brought by poverty
and the digital divide66.

Asian Development Bank and Thinking Machines Data Science, Inc. reveals a signiﬁcant digital
divide in the Philippines, with 83 percent of the population having adequate ﬁxed broadband
speeds and 70 percent having sufficient mobile internet access67. Urban areas, particularly
Metro Manila, fare better than rural regions, emphasizing the disparity.

Wealthier cities enjoy much faster internet speeds than poorer counterparts, indicating an
economic divide. Access is further limited for the "last mile" population, residing over 2
kilometers from major roads, with only 15 percent having suitable ﬁxed broadband and 6.5
percent out of 9.4 million at the "last mile" having adequate mobile internet access68.
Geographical constraints and uneven infrastructure deployment contribute to these disparities,
underscoring the urgent need for targeted efforts to bridge the digital gap and enhance internet
accessibility, especially in remote and underserved areas.

Business Description

Providing low-orbit satellite internet solutions to last mile communities which can then be used
for education, communication and e-commerce. Business models can operate through
providing short-term loans to local governments for the internet as well as working in partnership

Expected Development Outcome

• Internet connectivity allows learners to access e-learning platforms and digital resources.
A more extensive range of learning materials and resources can improve the educational
outcomes of students.

• Increasing digital connectivity will spur employment growth and enhance ﬁnancial
resilience, through access to more opportunities including e-commerce, within the
identiﬁed locations and communities.
