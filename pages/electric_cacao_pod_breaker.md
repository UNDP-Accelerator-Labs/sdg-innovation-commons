> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

Cacao merits much economic significance in the producing Region like the Davao Region. Considering all these benefits of cacao, cacao production and processing needs to be mechanized and properly improved to aid profits and reduce losses. Hence, the development of this concept of designing of an electric cacao pod breaker machine. The electric cacao pod breaker which crushes the pod. The breaker includes an agitator that starts the process of separating the beans from the husk. Cacao bean pulpers agitate the material and further separate beans
from husk. Beans drop through grated pulper floor. The machine appears to use standard electric motors and switching equipment. Claims to be able to break different sizes of pods. Breaking rather than cutting makes this possible. Low waste and probably less than 5%.

> Need: What need or challenge does this answer?

Efficiency and minimize wastage

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

Cacao farmers and cacao processors

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

Alternative affordable way to process cacao efficiently with minimum wastage.

> Opportunities: What are other opportunities where the solution can be applied?

It can be commercialized to cacao farmers to improve their production efficiency and increase profit.
