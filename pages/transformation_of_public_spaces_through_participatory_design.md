Transforming Public Spaces Through Participatory Design
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

  Our challenge is to create conditions for participatory urban design (both form and function) and planning where residents of an area can share their views, experiences, wishes, and skills with the municipality and other stakeholders who are responsible for building public spaces.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

One of the components of achieving sustainable urbanization is ensuring we create livable cities. This requires citizens to be involved in decision making processes regarding planning and design of public spaces. They need to be open and accessible to people. This encourages collectivism and discourse creation via interactions, it also creates a common ground for art, well-being, and innovation while strengthening collective identity and historical roots.   Despite various attempts participatory urban design and planning practices have not been widely adopted in Turkey. The absence of such practices often leads to situations where public spaces end up being underutilized, or worse, abandoned and dilapidated – also referred to as a ‘ghost space’.

The general overview of the participatory design applications in Turkey shows that participatory methodologies are not adopted as much as needed. Only 1% of the public space design applications use participatory methods and 90% of them are practiced in Istanbul. Other big cities such as İzmir and Bursa also put effort on developing participatory practices in local areas. In general, there is a top-down, regular approach to design of public spaces. On the other hand, participatory design has becoming a hot topic in academia and we have observed this increasing trend in design competitions which have been becoming popular in Turkey, especially in Istanbul. The institutions such as Istanbul Planning Agency or platforms such as urban strategy encourage the involvement of municipalities in such practices. For example, Istanbul has 39 municipality and only 6-8 of them might show interest in these methods, this rate decreases when it comes to Turkey.

This kind of participatory applications are very rare in Turkey.   The problems of poor design and planning stem from a top-down approach to decision-making by local authorities. The current political climate is not helping the situation either, more and more citizens feel disempowered. The gap between decision-makers and residents is widening which leads to disjointed policy making at different scales. It is possible to address these problems by increasing citizen engagement in decision making and one way to do that is to create an environment in which communities can take part in designing something – in our case, a public space – in collaboration with a local authority. During the project design, an open call was launched for municipalities in collaboration with Marmara Metropolitan Municipality. 11 applications were received in a very short period of time that also indicates the need and urgency for such practices and applications.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

  UNDP Turkey has extensive partnerships with local authorities with a focus on development. However, there has been no attempt to work on public space transformation which is an important area for development. Since its launched, AccLab Turkey has had a focus on sustainable urban development and is the perfect unit to initiate a project of this sort.  An institution like UNDP setting a good example in this area can encourage others to take action.    The experimental nature of the Accelerator Lab enables it to lead the way in testing new solutions without the fear of failure. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

 AccLab Turkey is working on transforming a public space through participatory design in partnership with Sotonoba, JIN, and Gokceada Municipality. The project is one of kind as it relies on digital channels for facilitation and brings in Japanese expertise in participatory urban design.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What would it take to design a truly participatory community project whereby a neglected public space is revitalized to create an inclusive and vibrant community hub through placemaking?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Ethnography has enabled us to understand the socio cultural structure, the context, social dynamics, needs and desires and strategies for constructive communication ground. Co-creation and participatory design will ensure citizens' active involvement in the design of the public space.  Human centered design and crowdsourcing will capture the needs and desires and vision of the citizens.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The gap in our understanding of the context will be filled in by ethnographic data. Geospatial data of the site is providing information to the design team. Social network data will be used during the participatory design process to crowdsource and test ideas.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

After the design phase (to be completed by June 2021), AccLab will turn the design into reality through implementation (July-December 2021). This will form the grow phase of this challenge which is expected to influence other local authorities to replicate and include civic engagement in their designs.
