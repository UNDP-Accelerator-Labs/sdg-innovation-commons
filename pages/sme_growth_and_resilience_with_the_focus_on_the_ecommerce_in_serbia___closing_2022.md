## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Serbian businesses still heavily underuse the advantages that e-commerce offers. According to the USAID CFG Annual “Survey of 1000 Businesses” (October 2021), companies in Serbia strongly acknowledge the importance of e-commerce (80% of companies agree that the relevance of e-commerce will grow strongly globally as a commerce channel in the period to come, 68% believe the same when it comes to Serbia, and over 60% have a website). Yet a small number of companies own a web shop (12%), and even smaller online payment options (9.4%), which is the “complete e-commerce” (and instant access to finance and liquidity). The majority of those who do not have a webshop hasn’t ever considered creating one (83%). By doing so, they fail to achieve above-average growth rates.

Lab’s exploration of the e-commerce Landscape in Serbia in the post-COVID context, based on qualitative and quantitative research, showed that the local e-commerce ecosystem requires interventions in the following areas:




Finding new efficient and affordable delivery models

Increasing the operational capacities and efficiency of the processes “beyond the basket”

Providing support to companies to improve business models and establish online sales channels

Increasing awareness of the customer journey and customer experience

Finding new models for marketing partnerships

Blogs are currently being finalised (we have drafts)

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

When we first began exploring the e-commerce landscape, we worked closely with the line ministry, the Serbian Ministry of Trade, Tourism, and Telecommunications. However, in 2022, Serbia formed a new government in which e-commerce responsibilities were divided between two new ministries: the Ministry of Information and Telecommunications and the Ministry of Foreign and Internal Trade. We have begun discussions with both new ministries, but bringing them up to speed and aligning their agendas will take some time.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We needed to use a variety of data sources, both qualitative and quantitative, with the purpose of understanding and mapping the opportunity areas in order to build an e-commerce report as an entry point within the SMEs portfolio and to acknowledge the post-COVID e-commerce landscape.




> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

All of these methods and methodologies assisted us in deconstructing the problem we were confronted with and in identifying the gaps, demands, needs and expectations of SMEs and startups in Serbia (especially during and post-COVID times).



## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Digital Serbia Initiative, Nova Iskra, Belgrade Gets Digital, the Serbian Gaming Association, and the Serbian Blockchain Initiative all assisted us in bringing together all of the relevant actors in the private sector who have digital components in their businesses to participate in this exploration phase Returning Point organization assisted us greatly in reaching our Serbian Diaspora and understanding their expectations perspectives Several organizations, including AFA (All for All, empowering women in business), the e-commerce Association of Serbia, and the Association of Young Entrepreneurs of Serbia, assisted us in better understanding the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Serbia (with a particular emphasis on the e-commerce area), on the basis of which we developed our work priorities.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A




> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Accelerator Lab has worked very closely with many private sector companies for the purposes of the research and the consultation processes as we saw these companies as potential end-users of our interventions. In general, this has been done for the purposes of the research, and it was done through a series of interviews, questionnaires, and focus groups, we have collaborated with them (below we listed different types of actors that we approached and engaged during this process).




> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Our work on e-commerce and the resilience of the MSMEs was interrupted by elections and the formation of the new government in the Republic of Serbia. In this regard, we collaborated extensively with the Ministry of Trade, Tourism, and Telecommunications during the administration that came before the current one, especially with the state secretary with the mandate for trade and e-commerce. We recognized that our work in the field of eCommerce sits at the intersection of the responsibilities of two ministries in this new government elected in 2022: the Ministry of Internal and Foreign Trade and the Ministry of Information and Telecommunications.




> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

We have collaborated with various types of actors from the private sector, including e-commerce marketplace, web media, e-commerce retailers, card companies, telco, consulting companies, banks, courier services, e-commerce businesses, web shop platforms, digital service providers, global fintech company, book retailer/publisher, remote workers platform, innovative home delivery provider, parcel locker provider, crowd investing platform, equity investing platform, online factoring, payment institution, airline tickets company




> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We have not worked together with any other UN agencies; however, the ILO is included in the overall plan to share our findings.
