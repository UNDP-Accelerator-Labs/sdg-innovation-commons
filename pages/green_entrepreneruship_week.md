## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Green Entrepreneurship & Circular Economy
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is developing the Green Economy and Circular Economy by integrating them into the production and consumption patterns but also in the legislative and institutional framework.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

By ratifying the Paris Climate Agreement in October 2016, Algeria has committed to implementing actions to combat the negative effects of climate change. As such, a National Climate Plan (PNC) was developed and approved by the government in September 2019. The PNC has identified climate change adaptation, mitigation actions, and measures for each priority sector at the national and, local level. The challenge lies in developing the green economy by integrating it into the production and consumption patterns but also in the legislative and institutional framework, in order to accompany the national sustainable development strategy to 2030, commitments relating to the Paris Agreement, and on the basis of the objectives set for the revision of NDCs (Nationally Determined Contribution), as described in the PNC. Moreover, the growing interest of institutional actors, the private sector, and the academic sector opens up interesting perspectives for the development of this sector. 

In view of the above, the emerging green economy sectors deserve special attention, as they still have a great deal of untapped potential in Algeria, in a global context scarcity of raw materials and natural resources remains a national concern for economic efficiency. Within the framework of the new economic orientation of the Algerian Government, notably those recommended by the Government-Walis meeting, on 24/25 September 2022, on the measures that have been taken in terms of facilitating entrepreneurship, In particular in youth circles, through the reforms of micro-enterprise creation schemes and micro-credit, the latter considers the green economy as a major axis and bearer of development and technological progress. It encourages investment in key sectors of the green economy such as recycling and waste recovery, agriculture, water, industry, tourism, and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and startups. 

As regards the procedure, the Ministry of Environment and Renewable Energy has implemented a national waste management policy with the various sectors concerned, the objectives of which are summarized as follows: the improvement of the living environment of the citizen and the protection of his health- the preservation of public hygiene and the cleanliness of agglomerations – the healthy and ecological disposal of waste- Recycling of recyclable waste – developing the green economy and creating green jobs.

> 

Considering that plastic has a significant contribution to climate change, urgent action around the world is more than necessary. Annual waste production is expected to increase by 73% from 2020 levels to reach 3.88 billion tonnes by 2050, and over 90% of waste in low-income countries is often disposed of in unregulated landfills or burned in the open. In Algeria, local authorities are faced with the challenge of maintaining a better quality of public services in the context of household waste management while the production of waste per inhabitant in some cities has increased to about 1 kg per day in the past years (APS). This issue is topical in Algeria, and, as part of its new economic orientation, the Algerian Government has made a green economy and investment in some of its key sectors, including recycling and waste recovery, A major axis, and bearer of development and technology progress.

1. For several years, UNDP has strongly believed that human development must not be contradictory with the preservation of the environment, on which humans depend directly, socially, and economically. The source of our livelihoods must be protected at all costs, even if this implies a radical change in the way we produce and consume;
2. Since COP21 and the Paris Climate Agreement, the world is committed to keeping global warming below 1.5°C on our planet, notably through greenhouse gas mitigation measures and public policies geared towards clean energy, the development of new modes of consumption and production, and the encouragement of the green and circular economy;  
3. We are already witnessing a shift from traditional industrial models to regenerative and circular models. The transition has benefits for people and the planet, including reductions in greenhouse gas and other forms of pollution, loss of biodiversity, and environmental degradation;
