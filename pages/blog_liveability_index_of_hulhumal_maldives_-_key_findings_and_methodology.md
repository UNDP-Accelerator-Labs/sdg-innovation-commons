Core
Objectives

1.1 What is the Liveability Index of Hulhumalé?

This research paper is intended for the general public, researchers, and councils

interested in crafting their own Liveability Index. It primarily concentrates on two key

aspects: the introduction and the methodology that can be employed to formulate a

Liveability Index. Additionally, this paper offers an introductory overview of Hulhumalé , a

subject of relevance to the research.

Hulhumalé stands as a reclaimed island city adjacent to Velana International Airport,

nestled within the North Malé Atoll. The development of this island was conceived as an

integral component of the Government of Maldives’ strategy to alleviate congestion in

Malé City. It represents a project under shared jurisdiction between Malé City Council

and Housing Development Corporation (HDC), a wholly state-owned corporation

formed in 2001. Municipal services for Hulhumalé are carried out by Malé City Council

under this jurisdiction, while the planning and development of Hulhumalé fall under the

purview of HDC.

UNDP Maldives recently formed a partnership with Housing Development Corporation

(HDC) to enhance data utilization for informed decision-making in pursuit of Sustainable

Development Goal (SDG) 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities. In pursuit of this

objective, UNDP Maldives and HDC have collaboratively crafted a local Liveability

Index, carefully aligned with the SDG framework. This index serves as an instrument for

assessing the living standards and conditions of Hulhumalé residents. It encompasses

five strategic priorities, or pillars, upheld by HDC: social

inclusion, economic

sustainability, environmental sustainability, good governance, and innovation and

technology. The index has undergone an initial prototyping phase at the citywide

level to assess its quality, consistency, and reproducibility, with the ultimate aim of

creating an index at the neighborhood level.

Index
Framework
Design
Parameters

With these fundamental objectives in view, four principal design criteria have been

established to guide the development of the Liveability Index of Hulhumalé and its

associated dashboard, detailed below.

34
2.1 Framework Validation

The Liveability Index, in tandem with the dashboard, aims to provide a dependable and consistent

means of monitoring significant elements that define on-ground development. To achieve this, the

UNDP team solicited input from HDC (the client), local development experts, as well as residents

and businesses of Hulhumalé, to validate the underlying concepts that contribute to Liveability in

the Hulhumalé context and the assessed outcomes, as depicted in Figure 1.

The comprehensive Liveability Index comprises two main components:

a. The Administrative Data (AD) Index Score, structured from official statistics specifically

collected and compiled for Hulhumalé from various sources, and

b. The Citizen Perception Survey (CPS) Score, derived from a direct survey involving residents,

workers, business owners, and property holders in Hulhumalé, where they rate various aspects of

liveability in the City.

For the AD(AD) Index Score: Indicators representing the five strategic pillars – social inclusion,

economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, good governance, and innovation and

technology – were carefully selected for internal validation with HDC, as these best covered

the concepts and inter-relationships contributing to liveability outcomes. HDC was in the best

position to advise the UNDP team regarding the availability of proprietary information covering

key development aspects in Hulhumalé. In conjunction with secondary AD sources, most notably

the Maldives Bureau of Statistics (MBS), various ministries, and State-owned Enterprises (SOEs),

indicators (variables) were chosen to encompass significant contributions to liveability standards.

As part of this support, the UNDP team conducted

numerous in-person workshops with HDC personnel

in May and June 2023, as illustrated in Figure 2,

to authenticate the concepts and Liveability Index

indicators. The team also sought input from government

experts for external validation of the core concepts

employed and the selection of variables comprising

the index in June 2023. The UNDP and HDC teams

held a series of face-to-face meetings with a range

of subject-matter experts, including key ministries

and SOEs, to ascertain the relative significance of

indicators, thereby validating the weighting scheme

and the approach for index construction.

Moreover, in May 2023, the UNDP and HDC team

engaged with community groups, including Persons

with Disabilities (PwDs), to discern specific interests

and concerns related to the enhancement of liveability

in the City.

Lastly, direct

input from residents, workers, and

businesses in Hulhumalé was collected through a

targeted Citizen Perception Survey (CPS) score,

which was designed in June 2023 and executed in July

2023. The survey aimed to validate the outcomes of

Methodology
of Liveability
Index of
Hulhumalé

The preceding discussion on the project’s overall design approach highlights two key

components in the creation and validation of the Liveability Index of Hulhumalé. The

first component entails establishing the modeled AD Index Score, which is constructed

using secondary data sources. The second component involves gathering input through

a CPS Score from residents, workers, and businesses in Hulhumalé to assess the city’s

quality of life. As previously mentioned, the survey serves as a means to validate the

modeled outcomes at the citywide level and also contributes to generating a hybrid

index that incorporates resident perspectives.

3.3 Determining Index Combination Weights

A core assumption in the construction of indexes concerns the selection of weights

to combine the component variables (or other indexes). These selected weights

indicate the relative importance given to each component variable (or sub-index) in its

contribution to the underlying concept represented by the target index, an approach

taken in similar studies .

The Liveability Index of Hulhumalé uses three sets of weights to aggregate from the

base indicators to the final neighborhood/citywide index, as shown in greater detail

in Section 3.6. In each of the cases shown below, the UNDP and HDC team consulted

with subject-matter experts through structured workshop sessions to determine the

relative contributions of different indicators (or sub-indexes) to their target index.

• Pillar Weights: This is a subindex to the main Liveability Index. As discussed earlier,

these pillars are divided into Outcome Pillars (Social, Economic and Environmental

outcomes), Cross-Cutting Pillar (Governance) and Support Pillar (Technology). The

weights assigned to each of these pillar types would likely be different in contributing

to the overall Liveability score.

• Category Weights: This is a subindex to the Pillar Index. There are 26 category indexes

that map uniquely to one of the 5 pillars. Weights are assigned to each of the category

subindexes to aggregate up to the pillars. The current first prototype of the AD Score

includes 11 categories due to data availability limitations and assumes equal weights

for all categories to avoid introducing calculation biases.

• Indicator Weights: These are used to assign indicators (the basic units of observation)

to the category indexes. The full scope for the Liveability Framework identified 129

indicators. The current first prototype of the AD Score includes 33 indicators due

to data availability limitations and assumes equal weights for all categories to avoid

introducing calculation biases.

3.4. Guiding Concepts for the Pillar and Category Indexes

Table 1, below, shows the complete scope Liveability Index, including pillars and categories representing specific

dimensions of development. The Governance Pillar Index – cross-cutting enabler- is composed of 7 category indexes

that have impacts across development outcome areas. Social Inclusion is an outcome pillar and is composed of 6

category indexes. Economic Sustainability is an outcome pillar and is composed of 4 category indexes. Environmental

Sustainability is an outcome pillar, composed of 6 category indexes. Technology and innovation are conceived as a

cross-cutting support factor to facilitate good governance and city services and is composed of 3 category indexes.

3.5. Variable Selection

With a view of mapping basic indicators to their respective category indexes, a variety of data sources were reviewed

by the UNDP team in various stages in consultation with HDC. The final list of variables and data sources is discussed

in detail in Annex 1 on Methodology of Data Analysis. Important data sources included:

• HDC Databases: HDC provided a variety of data covering municipal services, utilities, real estate development, and

community engagement and outreach.

• Census 2022 and 2016: Each dataset has more than 50 variables of interest that map to the five pillars of the

Liveability framework. The Census covers key topics such as housing characteristics and amenities, energy

consumption, employment situation and disabilities. Census 2022 is currently not available for analysis at the level

of Hulhumalé.

• Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS) 2019: This dataset includes more than 75 variables covering

topics related income, employment, household expenditure and travel, to name a few. Estimations for Hulhumalé

were made in consultation with HDC’s research team.

This was followed by in-person meetings in May 2023 with the MBS and key ministries, including the former Ministry

of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure, that pointed to recent initiatives undertaken by the Government of

Maldives to collect consistent high-quality data, linked to key frameworks, including the SDGs and National Strategic

Action Plan (SAP). The UNDP and HDC team concluded that the Liveability Index of Hulhumalé, and eventually other

future developments, be closely coordinated with these efforts:

• National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS), 2021-20305 : The 2021 Maldives Statistics Act

established the Maldives Statistical System (MSS), with the Maldives Bureau of Statistics (MBS) as lead and was tasked

to develop a framework for the collection and dissemination of key high quality and consistent statistics to monitor

the country’s progress on inclusive, sustainable and gender-responsive development targets. The NSDS framework

is not only a single-point aggregator of a variety of data sources, including the Census, various MBS surveys and

information from various ministries, but also maps indicators to the SDGs. Currently available data points within the

NSDS framework were reviewed by the team to determine the scope for ongoing updates of the Liveability Index of

Hulhumalé.

3.6 AD Score Calculation

The modeled AD Score is constructed in the following sequence:

Indicators
(Transformed
Variables)

Category
Index

Pillar
Index

Administrative
Data Index

Each step is further explained below starting with the Liveability Index at the top, down to the indicators. The

methodology is explained in detail in Annex 1.

• Liveability Index: At the very top, the Modeled Liveability Index results from a combination of the five pillars. Further,

these pillars have been identified as Outcome Pillar (Liveability outcomes – Social, Economic, Environmental), Enabler

Pillar (Governance), and Support Pillar (Technology). The weighting scheme assigns different weights to each of these

groups. The aggregate Liveability Index is developed at the citywide level.

Liveability Index = Governance Index w1 + Social Inclusion Index w2 + Economic Index w3 +

Environment Index w4 + Technology Index w5

where w1, w2, etc. are weights assigned to each pillar index

• Pillar Index: This sub-index is constructed from Category Indexes based on the guiding concepts described

previously in Section 3.4. This index is calculated as the weighted sum of the categories divided by the number

of categories. This averaging is done so that each of the five Pillars can then be combined (weighted) to form the

aggregate Liveability Index. This is expressed in its most general form below with weights assigned to each category.

It was decided that all categories be assigned the same weight, due to the current availability of data.

• Category Index: This sub-index is constructed from indicators, that are transformed variables that are unit-less and

scaled up to a number that can be visualized. The category score is a combination of the various indicators that could

represent different concepts in their original state, including percentage share, ratios (per capita, per square meter,

per meter etc.).

•Indicator Index: The indicators aggregated up to the Category Index level require standardization to similar scales and

transformed to scores without units, as explained in further detail Annex 1. To this end, the UNDP team developed target

and baseline benchmarks to normalize the indicator value between 0 and 1. This transformation is necessary especially

when lower indicator values are better outcomes – for example, lower levels of pollution or income inequality. Referring

to the methodology for normalization provided by the SDR , the research adopts the same methodology, as follows:

Indicator index= (Value - Baseline) / (Target-Baseline)

Both the target and baseline benchmarks relate to upper-middle-income group country data points, which are used

to measure current Hulhumalé outcomes. These include SDR 2022 target and baseline benchmarks further evaluated

in this study for upper middle-income countries, where directly available. For indicators used in this study beyond

the SDR data framework, benchmarks were established from a variety of data sources, including World Bank Open

Data, for the average performance of upper middle-income countries currently (target) and decade prior (baseline),

as proxy measures.

6https: / / dashboards.sdgindex.org / chapters / methodology#3-method-used-to-construct-the-sdg-index-and-dashboards

1718

After normalization, Indicator index measures the distance to achieve the target. For example, an indicator with an

index of 0.7 means starting from the baseline, the city has progressed 70% towards achieving the target. Further, in

cases where indicator values are higher than the target values, these are adjusted to 1, and conversely if lower than

the baseline, these are adjusted to 0, as shown in Annex 1.

3.7 CPS of Residents, Workers, and Businesses

To validate outcomes of the modeled AD Score, a CPS was administered to city residents, workers, business operators

and property owners, to assess their rating of the various aspects of liveability in the City. Additionally, given the

current data limitations, the CPS offers a way to address information gaps. Accordingly, the survey was designed to

obtain responses mapped to the 26 Category Indexes of the Liveability Index, as explained previously. The CPS was

administered in July 2023 over four days and received 500+ responses. The survey instrument is included in Annex 2.

The CPS included 44 unique questions, and resulted in 60 rating variables, which were mapped to their respective

categories and pillars. Following the method described in the preceding section, a survey-based score of the five Pillars

was calculated, which was then aggregated up to a “Citizen Perception Survey Score” in contrast and comparison to

the “AD Score”.

3.8 Index Validation and Adjustments

The CPS Score was then used in two ways.

• First, as a direct comparison to evaluate and validate the modeled AD Score, which is constructed from secondary

data sources. The survey index provides the means for validating the data-based modeled outcomes.

• Second, given the possibility for biases in both the AD(due to current limited availability and data coverage of

the category concepts) and reported perceptions (due to subjective opinions), the two different indexes could be

combined to provide an integrated and holistic picture of the state of liveability in Hulhumalé.

• To this effect, the Liveability Index of Hulhumalé was calculated by assigning weights to the AD Score and the CPS
Score for a combined score. Based on similar studies7 , for example the India ‘Ease of Living Index: 2020’ and in

consultation with the HDC research team, the data index was assigned a weight of 70 percent, whereas the survey

score was assigned 30 percent, for a combined weight of 100 percent.

Conclusions

Presented and discussed further here are the results from the

Administrative Data (AD) Score and the Citizen Perception

Survey (CPS) Score, a comparison of the two indexes, and a

hybrid index including both scores.

4.1 Administrative Data (AD) Score

As shown in Figure 5, results from the index analysis are summarized as presented on the homepage of the Data

Dashboard designed by UNDP for this first Liveability Index study in Hulhumalé. The features of the Data Dashboard

are described further in Annex 1.

The overall AD Score for Hulhumalé is aggregated up from the five Pillar Indexes, as discussed previously. Based on

this approach, the overall AD Score for Hulhumalé is calculated at 0.74, based on target and baseline benchmarks,

where the optimum outcome is 1.00 in the aggregate. The Pillar Indexes were calculated as follows- Governance

(0.90), Social Inclusion (0.77), Economic Sustainability (0.78), Environmental Sustainability (0.50) and Technology and

Innovation (0.98). These are discussed further in the following section.

4.2. CPS Score

The CPS plays a significant role in addressing information gaps given current data limitations, and thus, provides a

better understanding of the liveability conditions in the City.

As noted previously, the survey was designed to obtain responses mapped to the 26 Category Indexes of the Liveability

Index of Hulhumalé covered over 44 unique questions and 60 rating variables. These were mapped to their respective

pillars to develop the Pillar Scores, as shown in Table 2.

An Aggregate CPS of 0.55 (or 55 percent favorable response), where 1.00 (or 100%) is the most favorable response

rating (for e.g., 5 out of 5, “Best”, “Always” etc.), was obtained from the ratings of specific questions mapped to the

5 Pillars of the Liveability Index. Pillar Scores range from 52 percent for Social Inclusion to nearly 60 percent for

Environmental Sustainability.

As shown in Table 2, the CPS is compared against the AD Score, which shows differences between the two sets of

calculations across Pillars. This outcome is not easily interpretable in the absence of a sample cohort of cities to

compare the respective averages (outcome levels) and correlations between the survey and data index.

Other studies, for example, the Ease of Living 2020 study8 conducted in India for 111 cities, which included both

data index and survey scores, found no direct linear relationship (positive or negative) between these two sets of

observations. The study, however, found that leading performers for the equivalent AD Index were surprisingly among

the lowest in terms of citizen perception score outcomes. The report hypothesizes that this could be due to higher

expectations for quality services and amenities by residents in higher income (typically higher data index) cities,

which translates to poorer rating outcomes. It is hard to generalize from this observation for the context of Hulhumalé

but is worth noting.

In the Hulhumalé CPS, the leading (Top 15) and lagging (Bottom 15) response areas, across the 60 rating areas, are

further shown below in Table 3 and Table 4, respectively. These highlight potential areas of attention for HDC in the

future. Since this is the first survey of its kind on liveability issues in Hulhumalé (and Maldives), follow-up periodic

surveys are recommended to draw more stable conclusions for policy design and interventions.

4.3 Liveability Index of Hulhumalé

Additionally, the CPS Score was combined with the AD Score resulting in the Liveability Index of Hulhumalé. This

score provides a wider coverage of local information and a more stable interpretation of liveability outcomes, given

current limitations on the AD side. Over time, with further expansion in the coverage of official statistics and periodic

survey updates, the two scores will likely stabilize within a range of values.

Following other examples, the Liveability Index of Hulhumalé is calculated by assigning weights to the AD Score and

the CPS Score for a combined score. Here a 70 percent weight is assigned to the AD and 30 percent score to the CPS.

As shown in Table 5 below, this results in combined Liveability Index of 0.689 or 68.9 percent.

4.4 Conclusions and Recommendations

• The quality of the AD Score is necessarily defined by the quality and availability of information. For this prototype index

in Hulhumalé, the UNDP and HDC team attempted a thorough assessment of public data resources and developed the

necessary framework to incorporate data as and when made available by the ministries, agencies and SOEs.

• The index itself will be updated on a periodic basis, as more of the requested information is made available. At the time of

writing this report, nearly 80 additional indicators were requested but to be received.

• Pillars and categories with fewer data points should be interpreted with caution, including the Technology Index, which

only included two indicators that were available.

• This prototype study has raised working awareness among HDC staff on the type of information required on an ongoing

basis to update the Liveability Index that would ultimately assist in effective urban management.

• This will also help HDC build capabilities and experience towards implementing a similar approach and methodology to

other islands in the future.

• The extensive outreach conducted by the team for this project has also raised awareness among various government

agencies on the liveability concept and the need for ongoing coordination with HDC on improving data dissemination,

especially as the index could potentially be rolled out in other islands.

• Access to the Data Dashboard, that tracks progress along various dimensions, could also be beneficial to several

government agencies for streamlining their strategic priorities.

• The CPS is an important tool to address current and future gaps in the data environment that impacts the calculation of

a reliable AD Score. It is recommended that this survey be conducted on a regular basis to track public perception reliably.

• If possible, more than one survey outreach should be conducted every year (e.g., semi-annual) to prevent possible skew

in responses due to recency biases and any number of factors external to the local context. A frequent sample allows for

stable and more robust insights over the long-term.

Methodology of Liveability Index
calculation

The design of Liveability Index is evolved from the

concept of the five key pillars – governance, social

inclusion, economic sustainability, environmental

sustainability, and technology and innovation. To further

define the meaning behind the pillars, a breakdown of

each pillar at the category level is developed. And with

consultation with key stakeholders, specific indicators

are formulated under each category.

Therefore, at the most granular level, Indicator indexes

that are normalized within a range of 0 and 1 are

averaged to develop the respective category indexes.

And the final Liveability Index is aggregated by the

calculation of the pillar indexes which are computed by

the category indexes with weightages.

Several important factors are taken into consideration

to determine the selection of indicators from the

Liveability Index framework, including 1) the availability

of data to calculate the value for the indicators; 2) the

availability of benchmark and baseline data to further

calculate the indicator index. A list of indicators is

identified for the development of Liveability Index in the

current version (Annex I). Based on these indicators,

formulas for calculating the value for those indicators

are further developed and documented in the Annex

II. The input data for calculating the indicator value

are from various sources. If the indicators have the

ready-to-use value provided by the data owners or a

verified secondary data source, a new calculation is not

required.

In order to aggregate the index from the indicator

level to the pillar level and eventually to formulate

the Liveability Index, the indicator value needs to

be normalized within a range of 0 to 1. Also, the

normalization is necessary to convert the indicators

with “negative direction” into meaningful measurement

of indicator index. For example, the indicator of crime

rate has a “negative direction” because the outcome of

public security is better when the crime rate is lower.

In case the indicator value exceeds the target, the

Indicator index will be adjusted to be the maximum of

1. Likewise, if the indicator value is below the baseline,

the Indicator Index will be adjusted to be the minimum

of 0.

Overview of data dashboard

The design of data dashboard follows the structure of the five pillars which are underpinned in the development of

Hulhumalé. To represent this idea, the five pillars are visualized on the map of Hulhumalé with the highlights of key

components that are relevant to these pillars. The numbers shown under the column of pillar index are the respective

index to each pillar.

In the navigation bar on the left-hand side, there are buttons to enable navigation to the detailed analysis at the

category and indicator level in each pillar.

• The icon is linked with the page of governance pillar.

• The icon is linked with the page of social inclusion.

• The icon is linked with the page of economic sustainability.

• The icon is linked with the page of environmental sustainability.

• The icon is linked with the page of technology and innovation.

Also, the pages to each pillar can be navigated by clicking the images of the maps representing the pillars. The

navigation bars in the pillar pages have the same function to ensure consistent navigation between the home page

and pillar pages.

Results and insights observed from data analysis

The overall Liveability Index of Hulhumalé is 0.69. It is a compound index based on the calculation of the five pillar

indexes. Among the five pillars, technology and innovation pillar has the highest score of 0.98, followed by the

governance pillar with an index of 0.90. The economic sustainability pillar and social inclusion pillar get almost

equivalent index of 0.78 and 0.77 respectively. The environment sustainability pillar has the lowest score of 0.50

mainly due to the issue related to waste generation in the city.

3132
Diving into the governance pillar, based on the available data, Indicator indexes for the seven indicators under the

category of core infrastructure and services and the category of public participation are calculated. The category

index on core infrastructure and services is 0.94 while the category index on public participation is 0.85. Collectively,

it contributes to the governance pillar index of 0.90.

It is shown that the Indicator indexes of proportion of population with access to electricity and proportion of household

with access to toilet facilities have the value of 1, meaning the city reaches the target of providing residents living in

Hulhumalé full access to electricity and toilet facilities. The Indicator index of percentage of land use for public goods

also reaches the value of 1, indicating the city has allocated substantive space for public goods.

The Indicator index related to proportion of household having access to clean drinking water is 0.86. It indicates

that there are still a small proportion of households without access to clean drinking water. Data related to clean

drinking water is obtained from HIES 2019. It is considered as having access to clean drinking water when a household

reported using bottled water or taking measures to make the water safe for drinking.

With the target of having 100% coverage of mobile network, the indicator of proportion of population covered by a

mobile network has an index value of 0.85, indicating there is a gap of around 15% of households to cover. Since the

data on individual mobile subscription is currently not available, the analysis uses household data obtained from HIES

2019.

Both Indicator indexes for voter turnout rate for local council elections and voter turnout rate for parliament elections

exceed 0.80. The voter turnout rate for local council elections in Hulhumalé was 54.27% in 2020. To achieve the target

of having the turnout rate of 65%, the city has made a progress of 83.50%. The voter turnout rate for parliament

elevation was higher, with a number of 65.28% recorded in 2019. Comparing to the target of reaching a turnout rate

of 75%, the city has achieved 87.04%.

3132
Navigating to the social inclusion pillar, it covers three categories in education, gender inclusiveness, and social

protection and poverty. Among them, gender inclusiveness has the highest category index (0.87) while the education

category and social protection and poverty category have indexes of 0.79 and 0.64 respectively. These lead to the

pillar index of 0.77 in social inclusion.

Delving into the indicators, the high category index of gender inclusiveness is largely contributed by the good

performance in ratio of female-to-male mean years of education received, proportion of women in managerial

positions in the public sector, and proportion of women population living below USD 6.85 per day. All indexes for the

three indicators reach the value of 1.

Though the outcomes achieved in these aspects are promising, more efforts are required to enhance female labour

force participation, promote more women to the managerial positions, and balance wage level between men and

women. It is worth noting that the ratio of women and men average wage was 0.45. And when all the working women

regardless of types of institutions are taken into consideration, the overall proportion of women in managerial positions

is much lower than those working in the public sector, implying potential support to promote gender inclusion might

be needed in the private sector.

The literary rate is high in Hulhumalé. But the tertiary educational attainment among the youth (aged between 18 and

35) has a lower index of 0.59, indicating a gap of around 41% in achieving the target.

With the Maldives progressing to an Upper Middle-Income country, the poverty level has reduced significantly.

Therefore, there is less population living below USD 6.85 per day. However, support to people with disabilities will need

to be strengthened because the disability allowance is limited and not all the people with disabilities receive it. The

indicator on proportion of individuals with disability covered by disability allowance shows only 28% of households

reporting having people with disabilities in the family receive the disability allowance.

3334
The economic sustainability pillar covers three categories in economic opportunity, marketplace conditions, and

business and investment climate. The category of economic opportunity has the highest pillar index of 1. However,

the category of marketplace conditions as well as business and investment climate have lower indexes of 0.68 and

0.67 respectively.

The performance in the category of economic opportunity is outstanding because its subordinate indicators of labour

force participation rate, employment rate and Gini coefficient of household income reach the targets. It is worth

mentioning that since data on Gini coefficient in Hulhumalé is not available, the analysis applies the Gini coefficient

in Malé as a proxy.

The marketplace conditions are measured by the number of commercial bank branches per 100,000 adults, number

of automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults, and percentage change in Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Though there are enough coverage of commercial bank branches in Hulhumalé , more coverage of ATMs is needed

as the Indicator index is only 0.25. The change in percentage of CPI is higher than the benchmark level, with average

month-to-month percentage change of 27.41% in 2022. The high number of percentage change in CPI implies a price

fluctuation. Please note that since data on this indicator is not available in Hulhumalé, following the same principle of

using a proxy, the analysis refers to the data in Malé given the proximity between the two cities.

The category related to business and investment climate is currently reflected by the ease of doing business. The
data is obtained from the World Bank’s global research10 on ease of doing business. Given the data at a more granular

level in Hulhumalé is not available at the moment, the analysis uses the score for the Maldives as a proxy. The Maldives

ranked the 47th place in the group of Upper Middle-Income Countries .

3334
The environmental sustainability pillar has an index of 0.50 with two extreme performances in the category of pollution

and the category of hygiene and circular economy. The pollution pillar mainly covers the emission of greenhouse
gases and harmful chemicals in the air. The data is obtained from the satellite data in the Sentinel Hub12 which

estimates the level of the air pollutants at the surface level. Apart from the relatively high level in ozone, little air

pollutant is detected under this mechanism. Therefore, the category index of pollution is as high as 0.97, indicating

a good performance in maintaining the air quality. However, the category of hygiene and circular economy has a low

index of 0.03 because the amount of waste generated per capita is much higher than the benchmark.

Given the limited data related

to technology and innovation,

only one category which covers

technology infrastructure and

services is included. Since the

Maldives has a high internet

and mobile phone penetration

in general, the Indicator index

measuring

the

proportion
