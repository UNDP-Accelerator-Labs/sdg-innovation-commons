> Brief description of the innovation

Food production and income generation through  fish farming using Recirculation Aquaculture System.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through sale of fresh fish .Target market include customers in Lusaka and offtaker include capital fisheries and horizon fisheries.The system uses less water and waste water is channelled to gardens making it environmentally friendly.

> Technical Feasibility

The business uses a 86 cubic meter fish tank fitted with solar aeration and filtration system to remove toxic substances. The water is pumped into the tank from the borehole and circulated to improve oxygen availability. The tank is stocked with 10,000 tilapia fry that grow to 500g each and harvested for sale after six months.
