NATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS

ACTION PLAN

OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

2009-202

National Human Rights Action Plan of the Republic of Kazakhstan 2009-202. Under the
edition of Tastemir Abishev, Sagynbek Tursynov – Astana, 2007 – 24 pgs.

The National Human Rights Action Plan of Kazakhstan for 2009-2012 (further referred to as
the “National Plan”) herein presented to readers constitutes a consolidated program of planned
concrete steps for the improvement of legislation and practices of its application, the national
system of protection of human rights and the education of the population regarding human rights
and mechanisms of their protection.

The National Human Rights Action Plan was approved by the President of Kazakhstan on the

5th of May 2009, resolution No. 32-36.125.

The National Plan was prepared and based on the results of the Baseline Report on Human
Rights in Kazakhstan, of research of governmental agencies and nongovernmental human rights
organizations and international organizations, using data from a sociological survey.

Establishing positive dynamics in the development of the country’s mechanisms for the
protection of human rights, the National Plan reveals the presence of gaps in the legislative base
and practices of application of rights and the absence of sufficient coordination and systematization
in the work of governmental institutions and nongovernmental organizations for the protection of
human rights.

Implementation of the recommendations of the National Plan will allow Kazakhstan to make
new achievements in the formation of a legal government, strengthen governmental and social
mechanisms for the protection of human rights and create a well-developed civil society on a level
with generally accepted international standards.

The material contained in the National Plan will be beneficial to legislative, executive
and judicial branches of government, law-enforcement agencies, lawyers, representatives of
extrajudicial institutions for the protection of human rights, nongovernmental and international
organizations and other public associations or diplomatic services accredited in Kazakhstan.

This publication is published with the technical assistance of the United Nations Development Programme in
Kazakhstan, the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Kazakhstan and the British Embassy to Kazakhstan
and Kyrgyzstan within the framework of the project “Fostering National Capacities for Development of National
Human Rights Action Plan in Kazakhstan”. It does not necessarily reflect the official views of the UNDP and the

Foreword

The adoption of Kazakhstan’s National Human Rights Action Plan, the first in its history, is an
eloquent testimony to President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s commitment to the further democratization
of our country.

The first article of the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan stipulates that the high-
est values of our state are “an individual, his life, rights and freedoms”. Therefore, all our efforts
during these years of independence have been directed toward the realization of the fundamental
During this time, Kazakhstan has been continually
rights of the individual and society as a whole. During this time, Kazakhstan has been continually
loyal to its international obligations in the sphere of human rights and supports the efforts of the
UN, OSCE and other international organizations in this direction.

The practice of integrated activities of the state for the protection of human rights has suc-
cessfully proven itself in various countries and regions of the world. Kazakhstan, adopting such
a plan for the first time, is a pioneer of its use in the post-Soviet era. I am confident that this plan
of action will become a valuable tool to improve Kazakhstan’s legislation and law-enforcement
practices in the sphere of protection of human rights. Thus, the plan gives consideration to the im-
provement of national legislation and law-enforcement practices, the activities of national human
rights institutions in accordance with international standards, the interaction of the authorities and
institutions of civil society, the definition of the level of legal protection of an individual and his
awareness of his rights and the key problems of law-enforcement mechanisms and measures for
their resolution.

The recommendations and procedures of the National Plan address issues regarding the
improvement of mechanisms for the realization of the constitutional rights of citizens. Particular
attention is paid to reinforcing the independence of the judicial system, the development of non-
judicial mechanisms for the protection of human rights and the protection of the civil, political,
social, economic and cultural rights of citizens, including the rights of socially vulnerable groups,
in harmony with international standards.

The National Human Rights Action Plan for the years of 2009-2012, presented today, not only
launches the development of goals and objectives of the new Concept of Kazakhstan’s legislative
development, but also will serve as criteria for the success of further steps toward the improvement
of the mechanisms for the protection of human rights.

We are grateful to the UN Development Programme, the Embassies of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and Great Britain in Kazakhstan, the members of the work group and international and
non-governmental human rights organizations for their support in the development and publication
of this very important document.

Openning Remarks of the UN Resident-Coordinator/
UNDP Resident Representative in Kazakhstan
Mr. Haoliang Xu

The first plan of the kind in the country, the National Human Rights Action Plan in the Republic
of Kazakhstan for 2009-2012 aims to strengthen the national system of human rights protection,
through specific activities and focus on improvement of the legislation and the law enforcement
practice.

United Nations firmly place human rights at the centre of their development discourse, seeing
promotion and protection of human rights as the bedrock requirement for the realization of the
Charter’s vision of a just and peaceful world. The attention of the UN system to the promotion
and protection of human rights is demonstrated by the use of a human rights-based approach
in the formulation of development interventions and by the multitude of initiatives dedicated to
addressing human rights issues at country, regional and global level.

The preparation of the Human Rights Action Plan for Kazakhstan is the result of a successful
cooperation between the Government, the United Nations Development Programme, non-
governmental organizations, other UN agencies and other partner organizations who definitely
supported this endeavor, such as British Embassy in Kazakhstan, The Netherlands Embassy
in Kazakhstan and the OSCE Center in Astana. The preparation of the Plan was preceded by a
baseline study and report on human rights in Kazakhstan that analyzed the national legislation,
the law enforcement practice and compliance with international law provisions in human rights
protection. The Human Rights Commission and the group working on the Action Plan took note of
the international experience and the successes and lessons learnt. Along with this stream of work,
Kazakhstan has actively supported the establishment and work of the UN Council on Human
Rights and is initiating the Universal Periodic Review process, thus sending clear signals of its
commitment to the human rights agenda.

I firmly believe that the implementation of the Human Rights Action Plan in Kazakhstan will
contribute to better and more effective policy implementation, will strengthen the rule of law and
the respect for human rights and freedoms and will take to new levels the dialogue between the
civil society and the Government. The plan is instrumental for the implementation of the “Path to
Europe” programme of the Government of Kazakhstan and more specifically for the Government’s
commitment to bring the national legislation in compliance to international standards on the
threshold of Kazkahstan’s Chairmanship in the OSCE in 2010.

I would like to express my sincere appreciation and thank all the organizations and individuals
who contributed to the preparation of the National Human Rights Action Plan and wish it success-
ful implementation!

Introduction

As is well known, the concept of National Human Rights Action Plans was developed as a
part of the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in 1993. The Vienna Declaration
and Programme of Action for the development of concrete universal measures for effective and
long-term improvement of the human rights situation, adopted within the framework of the given
conference and approved by the UN General Assembly, recommended that each State considers
the desirability of drawing up a National Human Rights Action Plan.

Kazakhstan, having become an independent State possessing the rights of a member of the world
community, actively demonstrates the importance of developing human rights and a democratic
society and concentrates its efforts on the formation of legal frameworks and the creation of
mechanisms for their support. In its years of independence, Kazakhstan has made serious steps
toward the application of international human rights standards in its national legislature.

At the same time, practice shows that in Kazakhstan, the work of governmental institutions
and nongovernmental organizations in the sphere of the development and protection of human
rights is characterized by the absence of unity and coordination. A series of initiatives on the side
of governmental institutions in the given sphere do not meet an appropriate response from the side
of Kazakhstan’s nongovernmental and international organizations and there is no provision for
participation in them by governmental agencies.

The basic reasons for the development of this situation are the lack of sufficient experience and
traditions, conceptual systematical adaptations of international law-enforcement conceptions to our
present day life and the necessary legal foundation. Based upon this, today it is important to create
a law-enforcement mechanism which will promote a systematical and coordinated organization
of work in the sphere of protection and promotion of human rights. The current National Human
Rights Action Plan of Kazakhstan 2009-2012 (further referred to as “the National Plan”) is a
consolidated program, stipulating concrete steps for the perfection of human rights legislation, the
national system for the protection of human rights and also the improvement of the education of
the population about human rights and mechanisms of their protection.

The National Plan is the first comprehensive document in the history of the countries of Central
Asia and Kazakhstan, formulating fundamental guidelines for the internal and foreign policies of
Kazakhstan in the sphere of human rights and containing concrete proposals for the perfection of
mechanisms and procedures for their protection.

The National Plan was conceived and prepared by a work group educated in harmony with the
resolution of the international round table of April 17, 2006 and dedicated to the development of the
National Human Rights Action Plan 2009-2012. The membership of the work group was selected
on a parity basis: 50% of the work group members were representatives of nongovernmental
organizations and 50% were representatives of governmental organizations.

The objective of the National Plan is the information of Heads of State, Parliament and the
Government of Kazakhstan regarding the human rights situation in Kazakhstan, the gaps in the
national legislature and law-enforcement practices, the level of legal protection of the individual
and his knowledge of his rights, the improvement of the activities of institutions for the protection
of rights and the main problems in the sphere of human rights protection and concrete steps for
their resolution.

In addition, the National Plan promotes:
- The definition of prioritized guidelines for work in the sphere of human rights protection,
requiring the urgent coordinated action of all branches of government and nongovernmental
organizations with the wide and active support of the general population;

- The directing of the attention of governmental agencies and the public to unfavorable

situations and unresolved problems in the sphere of human rights;

- The definition of basic guidelines for the development of legislation and law-enforcement
practices in Kazakhstan in the areas of human rights, contributory to the creation of an integrated



system for the protection of human rights, combining internal and international standards and
norms and governmental and public mechanisms;

- The establishment of close coordination of national systems for the protection of human

rights with international legal systems;

- The development of the legal education of the population.
In the preparation of the National Plan were used recommendations from the baseline report
and yearly reports by the Human Rights Commission, data provided by governmental institutions,
nongovernmental organizations for the protection of rights in Kazakhstan, international
nongovernmental organizations and international organizations accredited in Kazakhstan and
also the results of the sociological survey “Human Rights In Kazakhstan: The General Opinion”,
conducted per the request of the United Nations Development Programme in Kazakhstan by
independent associations of sociologists in Kazakhstan which are permanent members of the
International Association of Sociologists (ISA). In the National Plan was also used information
received as a result of visitations by work group members to institutions of the penitentiary system,
health care, social protection, education, cultural, construction sites and other organizations;
and material from international conferences, “round tables” and seminars, training conducted
by the Human Rights Commission jointly with governmental institutions and nongovernmental
organizations of Kazakhstan, international human rights organizations during the period of the
years 2000 to 2008 and results of general conclusions and analyses presented by physical and legal
entities to the Human Rights Commission.

Questions regarding the guarantee of civil, political, social, economic and cultural human

rights are analyzed in the conceptual portion of the national plan.

In the first section are analyzed in detail questions regarding the observance of the human right
to life and the inviolability of private life, to freedom of movement and residence, to freedom of
thought, conscience and religion, to freedom to form trade unions, to hold peaceful assemblies
and meetings, to participate in the government (free and fair elections), to freedom of speech and
the receipt of information, to the protection of health and medical assistance. In the context of the
observance of civil, social and economic rights the results of special studies by the work group are
presented, dedicated to the actual question of the observance of human rights and the guarantee of
legality in the spheres of migratory and labor relations. Furthermore, in the given section issues
of current importance are reflected, in the observance of the rights of persons with disabilities, the
Oralman, children, women and national minorities and the right to education of the population.
In the second section of the National Plan, questions are analyzed regarding the guarantee of the
rights of citizens to receive free qualified legal assistance and the observance of human rights in
the course of preliminary investigation and inquest, in the sphere of the performance of justice
in criminal, civil and administrative matters, in the stage of executive fulfillment and in the
penitentiary system.

It would be well to note that Kazakhstan is a participant in more than 60 multilateral universal
international agreements in the sphere of human rights, including the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Forms of Treatment or
Punishment, the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination,
the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of
Discrimination Against Women and the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its
Protocol.

In the context of the above-listed ratified international agreements, comparative analyses of
national legislation regulating the human rights sphere are presented in all chapters of the National
Plan, with the object of its compliance with international standards and also conclusions and
recommendations for the improvement of national legislation and law-enforcement practices in the
area of human rights protection. Concrete measures are specified, to be realized by the government
of Kazakhstan in the sphere of human rights protection for the years of 2009-2012.

A situational analysis of sociological research and assessment of the effectiveness of the
activities of governmental institutions for the protection of rights, nongovernmental organizations
and mass media in the sphere of human rights protection within the framework of the project
“Human Rights in Kazakhstan: The General Opinion” is quoted in all chapters of the National Plan
in context with concrete forms of human rights.

The expected results of the realization of the National Action Plan are summarized in the
conclusion and future trends are formed for the improvement of mechanisms for the protection of
rights in Kazakhstan.

The Right to Life

The Right to Life constitutes the fundamental principle of all other rights and freedoms
included in this sphere. It represents the absolute value of world civilization, in that all other rights
lose their meaning in the instance of the death of the individual. It is fully acceptable to consider
this fundamental right as the right of the individual to freedom from any illegal infringement on
his life by the government, its representatives, or private individuals.

Social conditions for the right to life are provided for in a series of constitutional guarantees:
the right to safe and hygienic working conditions (Paragraph 2 Article 24 of the Constitution of
Kazakhstan), social security in old age and in the case of disease, disability, or loss of a breadwinner
(Article 28), the right to protection of health and medical assistance in state and private medical
institutions, the development of systems of health protection (Article 29) and other guarantees.

As a matter of fact, all other rights one way or another are correlated to the right to life. For
example, rights such as the right to social protection, to favorable environmental conditions, to a
meaningful life, as well as the right to freedom from cruel forms of treatment or punishment serve
as supplementary instruments, ensuring its effective realization. The government is obligated to
recognize these rights and create favorable conditions for human life with all available resources. It
is not accidental that crimes against the life or health of an individual are categorically considered
particularly heavily punishable criminal acts.

A separate issue in this area is the right of the government to apply the death penalty as an
exceptional measure of punishment of individuals committing particularly heinous crimes. The
right to life serves as a limitation of the death penalty.

In Article 15 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan, 1995, it is stated:
1. Everyone shall have the right to life.
2. No one shall have the right to arbitrarily deprive a person of life. The law shall establish the
death penalty as an extraordinary measure of punishment for terrorist crimes resulting in the death
of people and also for especially grave crimes committed in times of war, with the provision of the
right of the condemned to solicit pardon.

The wording, “No one shall have the right to arbitrarily deprive a person of life. The law shall
establish the death penalty as an extraordinary measure of punishment for terrorist crimes resulting
in the death of people and also for especially grave crimes committed in times of war, with the
provision of the right of the condemned to solicit pardon” corresponds with Paragraph 2 Article 6
of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the interpretation of this
article, quoted in Paragraph 7 of the UN Human Rights Committee “General Comment No. 6”.

In harmony with Section 5 Article 6 of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan, the death penalty
in the case of a pardon may be replaced by lifelong deprivation of freedom or the deprivation of
freedom for a term of twenty-five years, serving the penalty in a correctional colony with a special
regime, which is in harmony with Paragraph 4 Article 6 of the ICCPR.

On December 17, 2003, the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev signed the Decree
“On the Introduction to Kazakhstan of a Moratorium of Capital Punishment”. The given Decree
was signed by the Head of the government in compliance with Paragraph 1 of Article 15 of the



Constitution of Kazakhstan, reinforcing the right of everyone to life, which was directed to the
realization of determined Conceptions regarding the legal policies of Kazakhstan on the further
humanization of criminal legislation and is an appropriate continuation of the course toward the
limitation of the application of the death penalty.

Many sociological surveys bear witness to the fact that the majority of the population of our
country considers the complete abolition of the death penalty premature. It is impossible not to
take into consideration the opinion of society; therefore, as an intermediate step toward the further
limitation of the application of exceptional measures of punishment, a moratorium on the execution
of the death penalty was chosen.

The decree makes the provision for the abeyance of the execution by judges of death penalty
sentences. The introduction of lifelong deprivation of freedom as an alternative to the death penalty
may be considered warrantable. At the same time, the death penalty in itself as a form of criminal
punishment is not abolished, but the execution of death sentences pronounced by judges is only
halted. The moratorium does not have a time limit, but may be revoked due to necessity.

There is good reason to believe that the establishment of institutions for life imprisonment
will keep the instances of execution by judges of death sentences to a minimum and create the
necessary prerequisites for the possible complete abolition of the death penalty.

Currently, discussions are taking place regarding the signing and ratification by Kazakhstan
of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and
the complete renunciation by our country of the execution of the death penalty as a criminal
punishment. This is directly related to the declaration of the Constitution of Kazakhstan of the
principle of the inalienable value of human life and its protection.

The introduction of amendments to Article 15 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan significantly
constricts the scope of execution of the death penalty, delegating the final resolution of these issues
to the law. But the law until now has not been passed, because of disagreement on the issue of the
necessity to preserve the death sentence, or on the contrary, to fully abolish its execution.

Advocates of the preservation of the death sentence give as reasons for their position the
danger of increase in particularly serious crimes. Meanwhile, from the day of the introduction of
the moratorium on the execution of capital punishment, such an occurrence has not been observed,
although penalties in the form of the death sentence practically did not occur. The convicted,
condemned by past sentences (mainly before the introduction of the moratorium) to the death
penalty, were held in places of imprisonment and served their sentences with the deprivation of
freedom. At present, other forms of penalty have replaced all of their death penalties.

Confidence may be boldly expressed that the moratorium on the execution of capital
punishment, in coming years and possibly altogether, will not be revoked. Consequently, even if
the death penalty will be given by sentence at some time, it will not be executed. The questions
arise: Why, then, from year to year, accumulate the number of such convicted? Isn’t it really so,
that in the future they will again be pardoned? But before that, the status of individuals condemned
to the death sentence, upon whom is applied the effect of the moratorium, is legally uncertain,
which fundamentally violates their rights.

Many countries have revoked the death penalty; among them, developed European countries

and countries with problems in areas of economics, political life and law and order.

The inclusion of the death penalty in the Criminal Code is only grounds for affirmation of the
repressiveness and inhumanness of the legal policies of Kazakhstan. It follows, that it is necessary
to bring about corresponding changes to the Criminal Code.

In Kazakhstan, there have been no instances of extrajudicial or arbitrary sentences or the
forced disappearance of people, executed by law-enforcement agencies or agencies for national
security.

Nevertheless, in order to realize the position of the ICCPR, it is necessary to come to as broad
as possible interpretation of the right to life, including compliance with Paragraph 5 of the UN
Human Rights Committee “Remarks on General Order No. 6”, that protection of this right in a

9

broad sense requires the application of constructive measures in various spheres, for example, the
reduction of children’s mortality and the increase of the average life span, the fight against poverty
and disease, etc.

The Right to Privacy and Protection of Personal Information

Private life (privacy) is a fundamental human right, acknowledged in the UN Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and many
other international and regional agreements. Privacy lies at the foundation of human dignity and
other key values, such as freedom of assembly, freedom of conscience, freedom to create trade
unions and freedom of speech. Privacy has become one of the most meaningful human rights in
modern times.

Almost all countries of the world acknowledge the right to privacy in their constitutions. As a
minimum, these constitutional norms include the right to the inviolability of dwelling and secrecy
of communication. In some new constitutions there are also mentions of limitations to the right of
access to personal information.

According to Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by
Kazakhstan: “1. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy,
family, or correspondence, or to unlawful attacks on his honor and reputation.

2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks”.
In 1988, in its thirty-second session, the UN Human Rights Committee passed the “General

Comment No. 16” to this article of the ICCPR:

“1. Article 17 provides for the right of every person to be protected against arbitrary or
unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence as well as against unlawful

0

attacks on his honor and reputation. In the view of the Committee this right is required to be
guaranteed against all such interferences and attacks whether they emanate from State authorities
or from natural or legal persons. The obligations imposed by this article require the State to adopt
legislative and other measures to give effect to the prohibition against such interferences and
attacks as well as to the protection of this right . . .

3. The term “unlawful” means that no interference can take place except in cases envisaged
by the law. Interference authorized by States can only take place on the basis of law, which itself
must comply with the provisions, aims and objectives of the Covenant.

4. The expression “arbitrary interference” is also relevant to the protection of the right
provided for in Article 17. In the Committee’s view the expression “arbitrary interference” can
also extend to interference provided for under law. The introduction of the concept of arbitrariness
is intended to guarantee that even interference provided for by law should be in accordance with
the provisions, aims and objectives of the Covenant and should be, in any event, reasonable in the
particular circumstances . . .

7. As all persons live in society, the protection of privacy is necessarily relative. However,
the competent public authorities should only be able to call for such information relating to an
individual’s private life the knowledge of which is essential in the interests of society as understood
under the Covenant . . .

10. The gathering and holding of personal information on computers, data banks and other
devices, whether by public authorities or private individuals or bodies, must be regulated by law.
Effective measures have to be taken by States to ensure that information concerning a person’s
private life does not reach the hands of persons who are not authorized by law to receive, process
and use it and is never used for purposes incompatible with the Covenant. In order to have the
most effective protection of his private life, every individual should have the right to ascertain in
an intelligible form, whether and if so, what personal data is stored in automatic data files and
for what purposes. Every individual should also be able to ascertain which public authorities
or private individuals or bodies control or may control their files. If such files contain incorrect
personal data or have been collected or processed contrary to the provisions of the law, every
individual should have the right to request rectification or elimination”.

International practice in the area of protection of privacy and personal information is leading in

the direction of the passing of special laws designed for the protection of an individual’s privacy.

The main reasons for the substantiation of the necessity to pass such legislation are:
- The necessity to correct mistakes of years gone by. The adoption of corresponding legislation
allows the correction of the consequences of human rights under totalitarian regimes of past
years;

- The promotion of the development of electronic business. Legislation concerning privacy
is included in packages of legislation directed toward the establishment of unified regulations of
electronic trade;

- The guarantee of compliance of national legislation to international circumstances.
Nevertheless, international experience in the passing and realization of legislature and other
forms of protection shows that the violation of privacy, as always, remains a large problem. In
many countries lawmakers do not keep up with technical processes and this leads to the appearance
of large gaps in the area of protection of human rights. Sometimes, law-enforcement organizations
and special services prove to be endowed with exclusive power. Eventually, in the absence of
proper control of the execution of the law, the existence of the law in itself does not yet mean active
protection.

In many democratic countries, human rights violations in connection with the control of

communication are widespread.

Even in countries with strict laws regarding privacy, law-enforcement agencies even so keep
a large dossier on citizens who are not accused of anything and are not even suspected of the
committing of crimes.



As a whole, the protection of the right to privacy has many threats.
The complexity of information technology increases continually. New methods of collecting,
analyzing and distributing information on private individuals are emerging and this compels
consideration of the urgent introduction of corresponding legislature. Recent research in the area of
medicine and health care, telecommunications and the many means of transportation and transfer
of financial resources has significantly increased the quantity of attainable information on each
individual. Powerful computers connected by high-speed lines may be used for the compilation
of a detailed dossier on any member of society and for that a central mainframe computer is not
required. New technology, developed originally for defense needs, is used for the armament of
law-enforcement agencies, governmental structures and private companies.

As shown in surveys of public opinion, people in many countries of the world are now more
afraid of the violation of privacy than at any other time in modern history. Entire groups of citizens
in various countries express their concern about the invasion of their privacy and this compels ever
greater numbers of governments to pass legislation especially designed to protect privacy.

Today, it is evident that information technology develops with enormous speed. Opportunities

for the invasion of privacy – or, at least, potential opportunities – also are increasing.

In addition to these obvious aspects, there are a whole series of important factors affecting the

violation of privacy:

Globalization, that is, the disappearance of geographical borders to the flow of data. The

development of the Internet is possibly the most well known example of this.

Convergence, that is, the destruction of technological barriers between systems. Contemporary
information systems freely interact and can exchange with each other and process various types
of data.

Multimedia, that is, contemporary forms of presentation of data and images, presented in one

format, may be easily converted into another format.

Under these conditions, corresponding international tendencies and contemporary summons

for legal regulations guaranteeing the right to privacy are necessary.

Of all human rights which are well known in international legislature, privacy is the most
complicated to determine and classify. The definition of privacy varies widely depending upon
circumstances. In many countries, the conception of privacy is restricted to the protection of
information (privacy is interpreted in terms of protection of personal information). Outside of
these sufficiently strict frameworks, privacy often is considered as a boundary over which society
should not cross, interfering in private life.

In this case, privacy can be divided into:
Informational privacy, which includes the regular gathering and processing of personal data,

such as banking or medical information;

Physical privacy, pertaining to the protection of the physical integrity of a person from outside

interference, such as investigation by internal organizations;

Privacy of communication, which means the safety and inviolability of postal messages,

telephone conversations, electronic messages and other forms of communication and also

Territorial privacy, including intrusion of residences and also of the work place and in public

areas.

At the heart of contemporary models guaranteeing privacy lays the principle of “the protection
of rights”. In compliance with this principle, the State is obligated to provide legislative protection
of the personal information of its citizens.

This legislative protection should touch upon:
- The use of personal cards or files, which to one extent or another are used in practically all
countries of the world. The type of card, its purpose and the amount of information varies and
the personal information contained in them is used for various purposes. Systems for collecting
information may be aimed at the fight with extremism or terrorism, or may be simply a part of
the national registration system. A national identification system requires strengthening of its
protection of privacy.

2

- Biometrics, that is, the process of collection, processing and storing of data regarding physical
characteristics of a person for the purpose of his identification. The most popular biometrics
systems are retinal scanning, fingerprinting, dactylyscopy, voice-recognition and digital (stored in
electronic format) photography. Biometrics is attracting the attention of governments and private
companies, since, unlike other forms of individual identification (cards or documents), it ensures
full and accurate identification. In this regard, DNA identification technology causes the most
controversy. It uses the latest technological achievements, allowing within a few minutes the
comparison of DNA analyses with an enormous database. This also requires an effective means of
legislative protection of privacy.

- Monitoring of communication, inasmuch as practically in every country there is the
possibility of monitoring telephone, telex and telefax communications. In the majority of cases,
this monitoring is done at the initiative and with the direct participation of law-enforcement
agencies. Unlawful access to communications exists in the majority of countries and the volume of
information obtained in such manners reaches enormous proportions. Law-enforcement agencies
traditionally work together with telecommunication companies in order to make monitoring
systems for telephone conversations “convenient” for use at a distance. These agreements have the
appearance of providing special service access to communications to the extent of the installment
of systems for the automatic recording of information. Legislative limitations to such activities are
necessary for the guaranteeing of privacy and the protection of the human right to a private life.

- Interception of Internet messages and mail. In recent decades the Internet has become the
most important means of communication and research. Technology develops by the exponent and
the quantity of users increases each year by the millions. The Internet is used more and more in
commercial operations. The abilities, speed and security of the Internet constantly increase and
together with them the quantity of new approaches to using the Web. But this flexible structure is
not protected from intrusion and monitoring by authorities. Inasmuch as computer networks are
a relatively new phenomena, for them legislative rights similar to those that have been approved
for the regulation of telephone rights have not yet been created. Law-enforcement agencies and
national security services in all the world are working on developing systems of interception and
analysis of electronic mail and all information conveyed through the Internet. In this situation
privacy guarantees are also necessary.

- Video surveillance. In recent years the use of video camera surveillance has been accepted
worldwide on an unprecedented scope. Their use in the private sector has become more and more
popular. These systems are based on complex technology, including night vision, computerized
control and motion sensors (the system can be programmed so that an alarm signal will sound if
any motion takes place in the camera’s field of view). It would be well to note that hidden video
surveillance in some places could be done without any sound. The use of such video surveillance
also should be subject to legislative regulation with the aim of protecting privacy.

- Surveillance at the work place. Workers in practically all countries are subject to careful
observation on the part of management. Legislative protection, as a rule, in such instances is little,
because observation often is one of the conditions for acceptance to work. While companies strive
to legalize this monitoring, it is becoming clear that not all of its forms are actually legal. In this
connection, legislative limitations on video surveillance and the definition of the responsibilities
of employers to coordinate such issues with their workers are necessary.

Kazakhstan’s legislature contains a series of norms relating to the protection of privacy.
First, Article 18 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan states:
“1. Everyone shall have the right to inviolability of private life, personal or family secrets,

protection of honor and dignity.

2. Everyone shall have the right to confidentiality of personal deposits and savings,
correspondence, telephone conversations, postal, telegraph and other messages. Limitations of
this right shall be permitted only in the cases and according to the procedure directly established
by law”.



Second, Article 2 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan states:
“1. Housing shall be inviolable. Deprivation of housing shall not be permitted unless otherwise
stipulated by a court decision. Penetration into housing, its inspection and search shall be permitted
only in cases and according to the procedure stipulated by law”.

The further inviolability of privacy is indirectly protected by remedial legislation.
According to Article  of the Criminal Procedure Code of Kazakhstan:
“Private life of citizens, personal and family secrets shall be under the protection of the law.
Everyone shall have the right to secrecy of personal savings and investments, letter exchange,
telephone conversation, postal, telegraph and other communication. The restrictions of these
rights in the course of the criminal procedure shall only be allowed in the cases and in accordance
with the procedure directly established by the law”.

The basis and procedure for the seizure of correspondence, the interception of
communication and the listening to and recording of telephone conversations are stated in
Articles 2-27 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Kazakhstan.

According to Article 17 of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan: “Housing shall be inviolable. The
penetration of housing against the will of people who occupy it, the performance of its inspection
and search shall only be allowed in the cases and in accordance with the procedure established
by the law”.

The basis and procedure for the penetration of housing for the performance of its inspection

and search are stated in Chapters 27 and 29 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Kazakhstan.

According to Article 10 of the Civil Procedure Code of Kazakhstan: “Private life of citizens,
personal and family secrets shall be under the protection of the law. Everyone shall have the
right to secrecy of personal savings and investments, letter exchange, telephone conversation,
postal, telegraph and other communication. The restrictions of these rights in the course of the
civil procedure shall only be allowed in the cases and in accordance with the procedure directly
established by law”.

Finally, according to Article 18 of the Code on Administrative Offences of Kazakhstan (CAO):
“Private life of citizens, personal and family secrets shall be under the protection of the law.
Everyone shall have the right to secrecy of personal savings and investments, letter exchange,
telephone conversation, postal, telegraph and other communication. The restrictions of these
rights in the course of the procedure for administrative offenses shall only be allowed in the cases
and in accordance with the procedure directly established by the law”.

In Articles 142, 143, 144 and 145 of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan, criminal responsibility
is established correspondingly for the infringement on the inviolability of privacy, unlawful
violation of the secrecy of letter exchange, telephone conversations, postal, telegraph and other
communication, the unauthorized disclosure of medical information and the infringement on the
inviolability of housing.

Nevertheless, the given legislative norms are not sufficient to ensure the guarantee of the
observation of these rights by all governmental agencies, private individuals and organizations.
Administrative legislation altogether does not contain articles directly relating to accountability
for the violation of the rights of a citizen to privacy. Accountability for the refusal to provide
information (Article 84 CAO), the dissemination of information regarding guilt prior to a valid
guilty sentence of the court (Article 86 CAO), or accountability for the violation of disturbing
the silence (Article 333 CAO) are difficult to relate to measures for the protection of the right to
privacy.

In connection with this, in order to bring legislation into compliance with international standards
in the area of protecting the right to privacy, it is necessary to adopt special legislation that would
guarantee protection from both legal and unlawful and arbitrary interference, as is reflected in the
UN Human Rights Committee General Comment.

It is necessary that Kazakhstan’s legislation contain a definition of all the concepts used in
Article 17 of the ICCPR, in compliance with the recommendations of the UN Human Rights
Committee and international practice.

4

For example, the concept “housing” should for this purpose be defined not only as the place

where a person lives, but also where he carries out routine business, including the work place.

It should be noted that the infringement on the right of a citizen to the inviolability of his
private life and personal and family secrets by Kazakhstan’s Customs agencies is often met in
practice. In particular, these violations point to the Customs regulation currently in force on the
mandatory submission by citizens of videocassettes, audiocassettes, discs and photographic film
that they have brought into the country to preview them for forbidden information.

In the opinion of the project work group, these Customs agency requirements evoke the valid
censure of citizens by virtue of the difficulty of their fulfillment and contribute to corrupt violations
of the law on the side of Customs agency workers.

A survey conducted by the Association of Sociologists in Kazakhstan among 1,500 respondents
showed that 19% of those surveyed gave a negative assessment of the situation in the area of
the protection of the right to inviolability of privacy. 65.3% of those surveyed gave a positive
assessment of governmental mechanisms of protection of the right to inviolability of privacy. 15.7
% of those surveyed were at a loss how to answer. As a whole, the results of the sociological
analysis of the situation with the protection of the human right to inviolability of privacy allows
the conclusion that governmental mechanisms for the protection of the right to the inviolability
of privacy are improving, taking into consideration Kazakhstan’s international obligations in the
sphere of human rights, with the exception of some instances of the violation of the law and human
rights by individual officials or other persons.

In conclusion, it is necessary to determine which agencies are responsible for the protection of

the right to privacy and which effective procedures exist for doing so.

The Right to Freedom of Movement and Choice of Residence

In compliance with generally accepted international legal principles and norms, the Constitution
of Kazakhstan establishes that “Everyone who has a legal right to stay on the territory of the
Republic of Kazakhstan shall have the right to freely move about its territory and freely choose a
place of residence except in cases stipulated by law”. (Paragraph 1 Article 21)

Furthermore, in agreement with Article 16 of the Law of Kazakhstan “On the Legal Status of
Foreign Citizens”, foreign citizens may freely move about the areas of Kazakhstan which are open
to foreign citizens and choose a place of residence in compliance with the procedure established
by the legislation of Kazakhstan.

International standards on freedom of movement are founded on the following basic

principles:

- Freedom of movement inside the country is the assumed right of everyone who is legally in
its territory, to freely move about its territory and choose a place of residence without the need to
request particular permission from authorities. This right applies in equal measure to citizens of the
country, foreign citizens, individuals without citizenship, refugees and legal migrants.



- The right to leave one’s country and the right to return to one’s country is a personal human

right and should be guaranteed by law.

- Limitations of exit-entry or freedom of movement inside the country may be imposed only
by law in the interests of guaranteeing national security, defense of public order, protecting health
and morality, or protecting the rights and freedoms of other people. These limitations should
correspond to other internationally acknowledged rights and freedoms, serve a clear goal and be
reasonable, necessary and sufficient.

- In regard to refugees or individuals seeking asylum, the main principle is the principle of
non-deportation, that is, the responsibility of the government not to deport and not to return them
to the border of the country where their life or freedom is threatened with danger by reason of their
race, religion, social affiliation, citizenship, or political convictions.

Current migration legislation of Kazakhstan began to be formed after the collapse of the USSR.
At the very beginning – the mid 90’s – the principle legislative acts in this area were passed. In
December 1991, the Law of Kazakhstan “On Citizenship of the Republic of Kazakhstan” was
passed and in June of 1995 – the Presidential Decree of Kazakhstan “On the Legal Situation of
Foreign Citizens in the Republic of Kazakhstan”. The foundation of migration legislation is in the
Constitution of Kazakhstan, ratified in August 1995, fixed in Article 21 as the right to freedom
of movement and choice of place of residence and in Paragraph 4 of Article 12 as the equality of
rights and responsibilities of foreign citizens and stateless persons with citizens of Kazakhstan,
“unless otherwise stipulated by the Constitution, laws and international treaties”. In December
1997, the Law of Kazakhstan “On the Migration of the Population” was passed.

However, many migratory issues remain untouched by current legislation. Issues of entry,
stay in Kazakhstan, exit from Kazakhstan, formation of documents for the right to temporary and
permanent residence in the State and many others are regulated by Government decrees, orders of the
Ministry of the Interior, or instructions from various ministries and departments. Among them are
the regulation of the Government of Kazakhstan of January 28, 2000 “Individual Issues Regarding
the Legal Regulation of the Residence of Foreign Citizens in Kazakhstan”, the instructions “On
the Procedure for Application of Regulations on Entry and Residence of Foreign Citizens in the
Territory of Kazakhstan and also their Exit from Kazakhstan”, the instructions “On the Issuance by
Agencies of Interior Affairs Permission for Exit to a Permanent Residence Beyond the Borders of
Kazakhstan” and many others. An approximate estimate of the total quantity of bylaw documents
regulating the area of migration exceeds 100. Some bylaws contain limitations to the rights and
freedoms of foreigners on the territory of Kazakhstan, which is a violation of Article 39 of the
Constitution of Kazakhstan, stating: “Rights and freedoms of an individual and citizen may be
limited only by laws and only to the extent necessary for protection of the constitutional system,
defense of the public order, human rights and freedoms, health and morality of the population”.

Limitations to the right to freedom of movement about the territory of Kazakhstan remain in
existence in Kazakhstan’s institution of obligatory registration of place of residence, descended
from the Soviet passport system and registration procedure. It is important to note that issues
of social security, the realization of voting rights, the right to leave Kazakhstan and others are
dependent on the institution of registration.

A selective analysis conducted by the Human Rights Commission of individual normative
legislation shows their noncompliance with the norms of the Constitution, guaranteeing citizens
freedom of person and movement.

For example, Paragraph 1 Article 76 of CAO establishes that, as a disciplinary measure, a

minor may be assigned limitations on his spare time and special requirements of conduct.

Inasmuch as the CAO does not stipulate by which institutions such measures may be assigned,
today, essentially these measures may be assigned by, in addition to judges, any establishment
considering matters of administrative violations. This does not comply with the requirements of
Articles 16 and 21 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan.

7

Such noncompliance is found in the norms of Article 11 of the Law “On Associations of Internal
Affairs of Kazakhstan” and Article 30 of the Law “On the Rights of Children in Kazakhstan”,
according to which children may be placed in rehabilitation centers without their consent and
without the permission of the court.

In connection with this, with the aim of the protection of constitutional rights of children,
the Human Rights Commission before the Head of State recommends that the Government of
Kazakhstan conduct an analysis of all legislation and supplement it with norms that any restriction
of freedom of a minor or his freedom of movement take place only by the decision of the court.

In harmony with Paragraph 2 Article 21 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan: “Everyone shall
have the right to leave the territory of the Republic. Citizens of the Republic shall have the right
to freely return to the Republic”.

Institutions of the Procurator receive many appeals from foreign citizens regarding the violation

of their rights by members of law-enforcement agencies.

An investigation conducted by institutions of the Procurator has established that law-enforcement
officials, after considering a matter of an administrative violation and the pronouncement of
a decision to impose an administrative penalty in the form of a fine, confiscate the foreigner’s
national passport.

As a substantiation of the legality of their actions, law-enforcement officials refer to Sub
Paragraph 5 Part 1 of Article 618 of the CAO, where it is determined that in the interests of
guaranteeing the execution of an accepted decision in a matter, an official representative has the
right, within the boundaries of his authority, to employ in his relations with the physical person a
measure guaranteeing execution in a matter of administrative violation in the form of confiscation
of documents and other items.

At the same time, they understand the regulation “guaranteeing the execution of an accepted
decision in a matter” as the right of officials to hold a citizen’s passport, taken with administrative
authority as security until full payment of the fine which they imposed.

Application of the given regulation by law-enforcement officials contradicts other requirements
of the CAO, including procedures defined for the execution of individual types of administrative
penalties (Chapter 44 of CAO) and international standards.

Not having a passport with him, a foreigner cannot obtain tickets or freely exit the country and
is limited in his legal rights, which is a violation of Paragraph 2 Article 21 of the Constitution of
Kazakhstan and Paragraph 2 Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
ratified by Kazakhstan in 2005.

A passport, for foreign citizens in the territory of Kazakhstan, is not only a document
establishing identity and necessary for movement, staying in a hotel and conducting banking
operations including the payment of fines, but also for the realization of vitally important needs,
for example, medical care.

Furthermore, the movement of a foreigner around the territory of Kazakhstan without a passport
is a violation of Part 1 Article 394 of the CAO, in connection with which, after the confiscating of
his passport, he will be subject to administrative violations per the above-mentioned article.

In this manner, appointed individuals in law-enforcement agencies, having confiscated the
passport of a foreign citizen, restrict their rights and freedoms guaranteed by international treaties
and the Constitution.

On the basis of the above-stated, in the interests of preventing the improper application of
regulations of administrative legislation and the violation of rights of physical persons, the Human
Rights Commission and the Prosecutor General are introducing appropriate motions within the
framework of the currently developing Administrative Procedure Code project.

An analysis shows that the quantity of migrants arriving to the country is increasing yearly.
Growth is also taking place in the number of individuals violating regulations on the residence of
foreigners in Kazakhstan, in connection with which measures of administrative force are applied,
including administrative expulsion from the territory of the State.



In connection with insufficient legislative regulation of the mechanism of deportation of
foreigners, currently problems arise in the execution of court decisions for the administrative
expulsion of the violator.

For example, by agencies of the Prosecutor only, during the course of a planned investigation
of the application of legislation regulating the use of the labor of foreign citizens in Kazakhstan in
the 3rd quarter of 2008, criminal prosecution was commenced in regards to 5 foreigners per Article
330-1 (failure to execute a court decision on expulsion) of the Criminal Code of Kazakhstan.

The procedure for the expulsion of foreigners is regulated by Article 731 of CAO, where there
is the provision that the execution of the decision for the administrative expulsion from Kazakhstan
of foreigners and individuals without citizenship takes place by officially handing over foreigners
and individuals without citizenship to the representative of the government of the foreign citizen,
onto whose territory the person is expelled, or, by means of controlled independent exit of the
expelled person from Kazakhstan. If the handing over of the expelled person to the representative
of the foreign government is not provided for in an agreement between Kazakhstan and the foreign
government, expulsion takes place in a place determined by border control agencies.

Currently, in connection with the absence of legislative regulation, the handing over of
foreigners to the representative of the government of the foreign citizen, that is, to the embassy of
the country of citizenship of the violator by migration police does not take place.

Also, legislative acts of the State do not take into consideration the understanding of “controlled
independent exit of the expelled person”, stated in Article 731 of CAO and mechanisms of its
execution (fulfillment).

Furthermore, Border Service agencies have not determined a location for the deportation of

foreigners.

Consequently, the necessity arises to pass legislation regulating the mechanism and procedure

of realization of Article 731 of CAO.

The condition of the governmental borders of Kazakhstan has considerable influence in the

sphere of counteracting illegal migration.

In this connection, improvement of legislation regulating activities at government border

crossing points is necessary.

Up until now, there is no single list of all existing border crossing points in Kazakhstan with
a description of the status of each of them (international, multilateral or two-sided, daytime or
24-hours, etc.). Earlier published legislation by the Cabinet of Ministers of Kazakhstan regarding
border crossings have undergone many revisions and additions that partially contradict norms of
other legislation.

For example, in Paragraph 1 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Kazakhstan Regulation of 30.10.1992
No. 906 “On Border Crossings in Kazakhstan”, the “Dostyk” border crossing (Almaty Region) is
designated as an automobile crossing.

However, in the Government Regulation of the State of 26.08.2003 No. 870 “On Measures for
Further Development of International Railroad Border Crossing Dostyk-Alashankoi, the Railroad
Section Aktogai-Dostyk and the International Automobile Border Crossing Korgas in 2004-2005”,
it is listed as the international railroad crossing “Dostyk-Alashankoi”.

Moreover, in Paragraph 4 of the “List of Railroad Border Crossings on the Governmental
Border of Kazakhstan”, as approved by the Government Regulation of Kazakhstan of 03.07.2003
No. 648, “Dostyk” is designated as entirely a railroad border crossing.

In connection with the above statements, it is considered a necessity to develop legislation

establishing a single list of border crossings in Kazakhstan.

Together with this, the steady growth of the stream of migrants to the State observed in recent

years also requires the improvement of systems of governmental migration control.

9

Earlier, the Human Rights Commission in addressing the Government of Kazakhstan and key
governmental agencies, has repeatedly put forward the proposal to examine the issue of designating
a governmental agency responsible for the realization of governmental policies in the sphere of
migration.

Furthermore, in the current year this proposal has come under the framework of the work
group for the improvement of migrational legislation, created by a decree of the Prime Minister of
Kazakhstan, but has not found support.

Today, despite a united goal and the objective of migration policies, the system of migrational
control in Kazakhstan consists of several governmental agencies. At the same time, each agency
has responsibility only for the fulfillment of its separate commission.

The result of such a state of affairs at the given moment is the absence of unified migration
policy, proper coordination between governmental agencies, efficiency and a low level of control
over migratory processes, which in the final analysis negatively reflects also on the effectiveness
of governmental policies in the sphere under consideration.

Currently the task of realization of migration policies lies with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of
Agriculture, the Border Service, the Committee for National Security and also Akimats of regions
and the cities of Astana and Almaty.

In some instances, the function of one governmental agency duplicates or supplements another,
which leads to the situation that not one of the above-mentioned agencies has accurate statistics
regarding the issues defined.

For example, “Work Visas” for foreign citizens are given exclusively by foreign institutions of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (further referred to as “MFA”) and their renewal is carried out by
representative agencies of the Ministry of Interior Affairs (further referred to as “the MIA”).

In turn, initial visas in the “Business” category may be issued by agencies of the MFFA as well

as the MIA and both agencies have the right to their renewal.

Questions regarding the formulation of documents for the receipt of citizenship of the State
are considered by agencies of the MIA and their documentation is the prerogative of the Ministry
of Justice.

Also, according to the Law of Kazakhstan “On the Migration of the Population”, the central
executive agency, handling internal coordination and direction in the sphere of migratory processes,
is defined as the Committee for Migration of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.

However, the Committee, in connection with the absence of corresponding legislative leverage,
is not properly fulfilling its functions, limiting its actions to only the filling of its quota with the
migration of the Oralman.

The designation of a single agency responsible for coordination and development of migrational
policies of the government would contribute toward effective control and regulation of migratory
processes and also the strengthening of the national security of the country.

Furthermore, in view of the similarity of migratory processes, we propose a study of the
experience of the Russian Federation, where there is a single agency in the system of the Ministry
of the Interior of the Russian Federation – the Federal Migrational Service, under the function of
which, together with the management of unified migrational policies, comes the function of the
consideration of issues of citizenship, documentation, registration of the population, control of
exit, residence and entry of foreigners and the giving of permission for the bringing in of a foreign
work force.

***
The tendency of increase in illegal labor migration to Kazakhstan is observed – so called
“seasonal workers”. This, in the first place, pertains to citizens of the Central Asian countries of the
CIS – Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, where there is a slow pace of economic development,
a low standard of living and tension in the social and political situation. Considering the given

20

factors, the poorer part of the population strives to leave the country in search of work and better
living conditions, including within Kazakhstan. For a series of objective and subjective reasons,
they often must enter and work in a foreign country illegally, creating a deficit of jobs in the local
labor market and prerequisites for the development of such phenomena as unemployment. At the
same time, employers in Kazakhstan, being interested in an inexpensive work force, willingly hire
illegal migrants, which deepens the situation in the labor market and does not pay a significant
sum of taxes to the country’s budget. Often, citizens of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan,
having come to Kazakhstan in search of work, become victims of deceit, fraud and exploitation
by employers. These citizens, having agreed to the completion of work without the conclusion of
a contract or agreement with an individual, not having proper licenses, at the same time residing
in Kazakhstan illegally, become potential victims and subject themselves to similar criminal
infringements.

To the question, “Are the rights of workers – that is, people who have come to Kazakhstan
for work – being observed?” out of 1,500 respondents only 18% answered positively. At the same
time, 42.5% of respondents think that rights of migrant workers are being partially observed and
16.8% think that rights of migrant workers are not observed at all. The given results witness to
the necessity of improvement of national legislation and law-enforcement practices in relation to
migrant workers and members of their families.

Illegal labor migration and the search for effective methods of its regulation is one of the most
serious problems of Kazakhstan’s immigration politics. The positive influence of the immigration
flow on the development of economy, the demographical situation and the ensuring of the
migrational security of the country depends largely on the making of timely and proper decisions
in this area. The main objective in this connection is not only the strengthening of measures to
suppress illegal migration, but also the creation of conditions for the expansion of legal labor
migration and legalization of migrants currently employed.

As a whole, an analysis of the situation of human rights in the course of migratory processes
shows, that despite ongoing work, there are isolated instances of the violation of the law and human
rights by governmental agencies and their responsible officials and also by migrants themselves.

***
Kazakhstan has encountered issues regarding refugees in recent years. On January 1, 2009,
237 families (578 people) were officially registered as refugees in the State. Individuals receiving
refugee status are mainly from Afghanistan (575 people).

Refugee status is given in compliance with the Law on the Conferment of Refugee Status,
approved by decree by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Kazakhstan on November
20, 2007 No. 273-P, registered in the Ministry of Justice of Kazakhstan on February 19, 2008.

The activities of government agencies dealing with the problem of refugees are based on
articles of the Geneva Convention of 1951 “On the Status of Refugees” and its Protocol of 1967
and the Law “On the Legal Position of Foreign Citizens in Kazakhstan”.

On December 15, 1998, Kazakhstan officially endorsed the Convention of 1951 on the
Status of Refugees and its Protocol of 1967 and took upon itself certain responsibilities in
relation to refugees before the international community. These are, first of all, the principles of
non-deportation, accessibility of procedure, information, opportunity to appeal a decision and
provision of registration for the term of consideration and appeal. Kazakhstan’s endorsement of
the Convention significantly preceded constructive cooperation between governmental officials
and the office of the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Kazakhstan.

In harmony with the law, “On Migration of the Population”, the procedure for working with in-
dividuals petitioning for acknowledgement as refugees and definition of their status in Kazakhstan
and their registration was begun in 1998.

Refugees in Kazakhstan are foreigners petitioning Kazakhstan for their acknowledgement as
refugees, who, in view of valid danger could become victims of persecution for political convictions,

2

racial characteristics, religious beliefs, citizenship, nationality, or belonging to a certain social
class, those who are forced outside of their country of citizenship and do not have the right to make
use of the protection of their country or not wish to on account of such dangers, or individuals
without citizenship, outside of the country of their former usual residence, who can not or do not
wish to return to it on account of these dangers.

The majority of refugees – 88,1%, live in the city of Almaty and the rest in the Southern
Kazakhstan and Karaganda Regions. Regarding education, 99 refugees have higher education, 14
have secondary specialized education, 248 have secondary general education, 126 have primary
education and 18 refugees have no education.

In compliance with the requirements of the Code on Administrative Offenses of the Republic
of Kazakhstan, the observance of regulations on the residence of refugees is continually monitored
and a monthly consultative advisatory meeting is conducted with representatives of social
organizations on the legal protection of refugees.

In November 2007, in a meeting with the Head of State, the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, Mr. António Guterres, giving a positive assessment of the situation with human rights in
Kazakhstan, noted the necessity of the fulfillment by the State of its international responsibilities
in the area of rights of refugees and requested the passing of a special Law of Kazakhstan “On
Refugees”.

With the goal of improving national legislation and law-enforcement practices in regards to
refugees, we consider advisable the expedited passing of the Law of Kazakhstan “On Refugees”
by Parliament.

In harmony with the foregoing, we recommend the Government and Parliament of
Kazakhstan during the period of 2009-202 put into practice the following measures of the
National Plan:

1. Eliminate contradictions between legislation and bureaucratic instructions regulating the

freedom of movement within the country.

2. Develop mechanisms and procedures for monitoring and suppressing the exit from the
country of citizens of Kazakhstan with the goal of permanent residence abroad whose exit is
forbidden (bearers of government secrets, individuals for whom was chosen preventive punishment
in the form of a written statement not to leave the country, etc.).

3. For the effective coordination of work with migrants, in 2012 create a single governmental

agency for migration within the Government of Kazakhstan.

4. In 2012, ratify the UN International Convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant

workers and members of their families.

5. Expedite the adoption of the Law of Kazakhstan “On Refugees”.
6. Develop a procedure of dealing with individuals seeking refuge and migrants, not permitting

their deportation or extradition without a judicial decision.

7. Create and introduce a modern system of border and migrational control and network of
temporary holding points for foreign citizens, individuals without citizenship and individuals
seeking refuge or not having a certain legal status at border crossing points of the Border Service
of Kazakhstan.

8. Create an open and accessible system of informing foreign citizens or individuals without
citizenship of legislation regarding entry and residence in the territory of Kazakhstan and the
migrational legislation of the country.

9. Conclude international agreements on legal assistance in criminal cases and the extradition
of individuals from countries to which they illegally take citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan
for the purpose of sexual, labor, or other exploitation.

10. In 2010, write and pass the Law “On Documents of Identity of a Citizen of the Republic

of Kazakhstan”.

11. In 2012, write and pass the Law “On the Introduction of Amendments and Addendums
to Legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan Regarding Issues of the Registration of the
Population”.

The Right to Freedom of Forming Associations

The right to form associations in the Republic of Kazakhstan is regulated by Articles 5 and 23 of
the Constitution, Section VII Chapter 2 of the Civil Code, laws on non-commercial organizations,
political parties, public associations, trade unions, freedom of conscience and religious associations,
some statutes of legislation on national security and the counteraction of extremism, criminal,
administrative and tax legislation and also entire and acts and bylaws: instructions, regulations,
statutes, etc.

The freedom to form associations gives people the right to collectively voice, pursue and
defend common interests exactly in the same manner as these are voiced, pursued and defended
by the individual.

The guarantee of the right to form associations is contained in fundamental international
documents on human rights – The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 20), the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 22), in many UN Conventions and in
regional documents on human rights.

A series of provisions regarding responsibilities of guaranteeing the right to form associations

are contained in OSCE documents, adopted at its meetings.

The Republic of Kazakhstan ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
and upon joining the UN and the OSCE, has taken upon itself certain responsibilities in the
observance of fundamental human rights and freedoms including the right to form associations.

These responsibilities are set out not only by the establishment in the Constitution and national
legislature of the right to form associations, but in the perceptions of the contemporary interpretation
of this right, its regulating and the legality of the validity and adequacy of limitations imposed.

Consequently, the matter not only includes the political responsibility to guarantee the right to

form associations, but also how this responsibility is fulfilled in concrete situations.

. Issues Regarding the Legal Position of Public Associations
in the Republic of Kazakhstan

Paragraph 1 Article 23 of the Constitution of RK establishes that citizens of the Republic of
Kazakhstan shall have the right to the freedom of forming associations. The activities of public
associations shall be regulated by law.

If the first phrase of the given Paragraph is interpreted strictly, the Constitution of RK is in full
compliance with the international law guaranteeing a citizen the right to unite with other citizens
with the goal of forming public associations.

However, based upon the sense of the second phrase of Paragraph 1 Article 23 and Article
5 of the Constitution of RK, only one form of association is supported – public associations, the
activity of which are regulated by law.

Thus, according to Article 5 of the Constitution of RK, the formation and functioning of public
associations pursuing the goals or actions directed toward a violent change of the constitutional
system, violation of the integrity of the republic, undermining of the security of the state, inciting
social, racial, national, religious, class and tribal enmity, as well as formation of unauthorized
paramilitary units shall be prohibited.

Analogous prohibitions are contained in Article 5 of the Law on Public Associations of May
31, 1996 (with amendments and addendums). Therein is established the additional prohibition on
the activities of unregistered public associations.

The given prohibition contradicts international standards.
In support of this statement we turn, for example, to such documents as “Fundamental Principles
on the Status of Non-Governmental Organizations in Europe”, (2002) approved by Decision of the
European Council of Ministers on April 16, 2003.

2

Taking into consideration that practically all European countries are participants in the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), in essence, this document defines
the understanding of international standards regarding the right to unite which are set out in the
responsibilities of those within the framework of the OSCE.

According to this document, the term “NGO” is understood to apply to associations, unions,
public associations, funds, charitable organizations, noncommercial organizations, etc. The sphere
of activities of an NGO are also diverse, because an NGO can be either a small local organization
with few members such as, for example, a village chess club, or an international association well-
known in the entire world, especially organizations involved in activities regarding the protection
of rights. Examples of various types of NGOs are listed in the text of Fundamental Principles, but
the list is not exhaustive. Trade unions or religious organizations are not found in the list. In some
countries, all or part of these structures come under the sphere of influence of legislation regarding
public associations, whereas in other countries they act within the framework of individual laws.
Political parties are not considered NGOs.

As is shown in Paragraph 4 of Fundamental Principles, the fundamental characteristic of an
NGO is the absence of the receipt of income among its main aims. Common traits among all NGOs
are self-government and voluntariness.

From the viewpoint of the responsibilities of registration of an NGO, Paragraph 5 of the above-
mentioned document is very important: “An NGO may be either an informal organization or a
structured organization possessing a legal personality. With the aim of highlighting differences in
financial or other forms of support received by an NGO in addition to legal personality, they may
use various statuses in harmony with national legislation”.

In other words, the case in point is regarding the difference between NGOs not wishing to
obtain a legal personality and NGOs having the status of a legal entity. In the legislature of the
majority of countries, as well as in the text of Principles are found a series conditions relating
exclusively to NGOs having a legal personality. Nevertheless, principles are acknowledged in the
document, in harmony with which NGOs have the right to accomplish their activities without the
obtainment of such status. At the same time, the importance of stating this in national legislature
is also emphasized.

Consequently inasmuch as the given Principles are common to European governments,
in all European countries it is acknowledged that an NGO may be either a formal or informal
organization.

As previously indicated, Kazakhstan’s legislation contains a prohibition of the activity of
unregistered public associations which also creates certain problems in the use of legal terms and
understanding.

First of all, there are no legal grounds for use of the term “unregistered public associations”.
A public association is a legal form of noncommercial organization that in its turn is one type
of legal entity (Civil Code of RK 1994, Article 34). This is a legal status. Before the registration of
a public association in agencies of justice, it does not legally exist, but exists as a group of citizens
striving to obtain the status of a legal entity in the form of a noncommercial organization and the
legal form of a public association. In other words, if a group of citizens calls itself a committee,
council, club, public association, etc. it does not mean that it is in fact a public association.

Secondly, legislation for some reason contains a prohibition on the creation and activities of
unregistered public associations only, although among noncommercial organizations are also such
legal forms as institutions, public funds, etc.

Thirdly, if the creation and activity of unregistered public associations is prohibited, it is not
understandable whether this applies only to organizations that have ten (the minimum quantity
of citizen initiators for the establishment of a public association per Kazakhstan’s legislature)
or more members, or to those in which the quantity of members is less. For example, the issue
arises regarding the legality or illegality of a public committee for the cleaning of a courtyard
in the quantity of five persons in a chapter with a chairman. Furthermore, it is unclear how it is

24

determined that an organization legally exists if it is not yet registered in compliance with the
procedure established by law.

Consequently, the following conclusion can be drawn: the circumstance of registration of
associations of citizens and the legal norms regarding responsibility for their activities only by
reason of lack of registration do not conform to international standards.

In connection with this, in order to bring national legislation into compliance with international
standards of human rights and freedoms, it is necessary to establish the right of a person to create
or join an association or union, including those of an informal character.

For that, it is necessary to either pass an individual law on the right of citizens to form associations
(for example, based on the experience of the Republic of Poland), or the individuals stipulated
by law should apply to the Constitutional Council with the request to give an interpretation of
Paragraph 1 Article 23 of the Constitution of RK, in particular the right of a citizen to freedom to
unite in any form, in formal as well as informal organizations.

2. Issues Regarding Legal Forms of Public Associations in Kazakhstan

It is necessary to resolve a problem connected with limiting the amount of legal forms
of noncommercial organizations as types of legal entities. This problem has existed since the
beginning of the ‘90s of the XX century. The first attempt to correct the situation was undertaken in
the Civil Code of RK of 1994, where in Chapter VII “Noncommercial Organizations”, other legal
forms of public associations aside from public associations appeared: institutes and public funds.
It is important to note that in the Civil Code of RK, for the first time, public associations listed as
legal forms received noncommercial status.

Moreover, in Article 34 of the Civil Code of RK, apart from the above-listed forms of
noncommercial organizations that are legal entities, there is the provision for the possibility of
the existence of other forms of noncommercial organizations, which should be “provided for by
legislation”. Admittedly, no other legislation reinforcing the possibility of formation and function
of other legal forms of noncommercial organizations other than those listed in the Civil Code has
yet been passed.

Consequently, in the course of seven years (1994-2001) before the passing in 2001 of the Law
of RK “On Noncommercial Organizations”, the only legislative act which mentioned other forms
of noncommercial public associations was the Civil Code of RK, in which two more forms were
mentioned: institutions and public funds.

As a result of this, all public initiatives by citizens for the creation and activity of public
associations were practically limited to only three legal forms: public associations, institutions and
public funds. This created and is creating serious problems in the course of the development of the
third sector in the country.

Let’s consider the situation in practice.
A group of citizens decided to unite for the attainment of their common goals and objectives
and create a public organization with the status of a legal entity. Which legal form should they
choose? A public association? But then, according to the Law on Public associations these citizens
should number no less than ten, their organization should have membership and a certain structure
of administration, etc.

But, if these citizens number less than ten and they do not want to have a membership
organization, hold general meetings as a structure of administration, etc., then they must create a
noncommercial organization in the form of an institution or a public fund.

However, an institution as a legal form of noncommercial public organization has its
disadvantages, especially in that the founder is personally liable for the debts of the organization
in the case of deficit of assets of the noncommercial organization. Furthermore, per current tax
legislation an institute does not come under the category of noncommercial organizations for
taxation purposes. It is understandable that this situation “frightens away” the social initiative of
citizens.

2

A fund has another nature from the standpoint of its relationship to noncommercial public
organizations and is most often considered in the context of charitable activities, which is
understood as “a means of voluntary charitable (gratuitous) assistance (including the transfer of
possessions or money, provision of services and other support), existing in the interests of support
and protection of groups of individuals who, by virtue of physical or other circumstances are not
capable of satisfying their needs without assistance, or defending their rights and legal interests”.
Hence, a fund should be considered as a legal form of noncommercial organization, involved in
charitable or other analogous activities.

As a result, as already noted, all public organizations created in Kazakhstan from 1994 to 2001
and until now, “maneuver” between three legal forms: public associations, institutions and funds.
Dozens of funds have appeared in the country, which in principle are not funds, inasmuch
as they do not accumulate financial and other resources and are not involved in charity or in the
distribution of these resources. Citizen founders, creators of many institutions, constantly feel the
threat of bringing upon them a personal property suit in connection with a deficit of assets of the
institution.

Finally, hundreds of public associations have followed a more logical course – the creation
of public associations, although many of their initiators did not have the desire to seek additional
members for fulfillment of the requirement of the law – no less than 10 citizen initiators.

It makes sense to introduce amendments to the Law “On Noncommercial Organizations”,
defining the understanding of “public associations” as noncommercial organizations or other legal
forms.

. Issues Regarding Members, Organizers and Founders
of Public associations in the Republic of Kazakhstan

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the Republic of Kazakhstan
ratified in 2005, contains the following formulation: “Each person shall have the right to association
with others...”

The comprehensive character of the word “each” indicates that the freedom to unite, in
principle, encompasses those individuals who are not citizens also (in other words, individuals who
are citizens of other governments, refugees, individuals without citizenship and the Oralman).

This international right acknowledges the possibility of the introduction of a few limitations
to the political activity of individuals who are not citizens of the government that propagates
the freedom to unite. However, only those limitations which correspond to principles of political
democracy, freedom and supremacy of the law are considered acceptable. Therefore, the prohibition
on membership in political parties by a non-citizen is justifiable, inasmuch as the party participates
in the formation of national organs of power.

In harmony with Paragraph 15 of Fundamental Principles, any physical person or legal entity,
citizen of a country or foreigner, or a group of such persons, should be free to create NGOs. At
the same time, an Explanatory note to the Fundamental Principles indicates, that there should be
no foundation for limiting foreign citizens from creating NGOs. Naturally, this does not include
political parties, which, as already noted, are not NGOs.

Consequently, based upon the position of international documents on human rights and
foreign experience, the following conclusion may be drawn: no limitations exist for foreign
citizens, refugees, individuals without citizenship and the Oralman in the creation, membership,
or participation in the activities of noncommercial organizations, except a few limitations of their
political activities (especially, their participation in the activities of political parties, financing
of voting campaigns, etc.). Furthermore, there is no limitation to any citizen in the right to lead
noncommercial organizations or their branches (agencies).

2

4. Issues of Registration of Public Organizations in the Republic of Kazakhstan

As already noted, in compliance with international standards and practices of many countries

of the world, a NGO may exist with or without the attainment of the status of a legal entity.

Nevertheless, the majority of NGOs prefer the attainment of such status (in the form of a
noncommercial organization) inasmuch as this allows them to receive tax privileges, support of
the government and altogether simplifies their operation.

In the Fundamental Principles it is indicated that any physical person or legal entity, citizen
of the country or foreigner, or group of such persons, has the freedom to create a NGO. Two or
more persons should have the right to found a NGO based on the principle of membership. For the
attainment of the status of a legal entity a greater number of members may be required, however
the number should not be set on a level that hinders the formation of the NGO. Any person should
have the right to found a NGO by means of a will or the gift of belongings, as a result of which a
fund is usually created.

In the Explanatory note to the Fundamental Principles it is made clear that the issue of the
minimum number of individuals needed for the foundation of a NGO has been under lengthy
discussion in the course of the development of the document, inasmuch as in the laws of different
countries the number varies. In some countries one person is sufficient, while in others a greater
number is established by law – two, three, or even five or more persons. Finally it was decided to
differentiate between informal organizations and organizations wishing to obtain a legal personality.
In the first instance, for foundation of a NGO based on principle of membership, two people are
sufficient, whereas for the obtainment of a legal personality, a greater number of members may
be required. But, in this case, the given number should not hinder by its magnitude the foundation
itself of the organization.

The procedure itself for the creation of an organization with the receipt of the status of a legal
entity differs among countries of the European Union. Organizations may receive status of a legal
entity as a result of declaration (the announcement of its creation), notarial certification of its
charter, notification of the competent authorities, or registration.

The registration system for the attainment of the status of a legal entity is used in

Kazakhstan.

Regarding the registration of noncommercial organizations, the legislation of RK does not
contain a direct prohibition on the activity of NGOs without registration (without the receipt of
the status of a legal entity). Such a direct prohibition, as previously noted, is established only in
relation to public associations.

However, from the law-enforcement practices of agencies of justice and the Procurator it
follows that in a series of incidents, NGOs created by a group of citizens not claiming the status of
a public association and not obtaining the status of a legal entity, are considered as nonregistered
public associations and its organizers are subject to administrative charges. Similar problems arise
with unregistered religious associations.

It would be good to note that in the Republic of Kazakhstan, there is an established procedure
for the registration of legal entities. This procedure in the state provides for the responsibility of
the government to register organizations if its founders fulfilled all corresponding requirements of
legislation pertaining to the creation of such organizations.

In itself, the procedure and requirements extending to the procedure of attaining the status of
a legal entity in Kazakhstan are established in the Law on Governmental Registration of Legal
Entities (passed in 1995) and Regulations on Governmental Registration of Legal Entities (passed
in 1999).

It is necessary to note a series of problematic issues connected with the registration procedure

for noncommercial organizations in Kazakhstan.

The first issue is the amount of the registration fee for noncommercial organizations
(around $70 dollars USA). At the same time institutions financed from budgeted funds, official

27

organizations and cooperatives of housing (apartment) owners have the advantage (registration
fee – not much more than $10 dollars USA). Children’s and youth associations have privileges
(registration fee – not much more than $15 dollars USA). Even legal entities that belong to small
business undertakings have the advantage (registration fee – not much more than $35 dollars
USA). But public noncommercial organizations by registration fee are equated with commercial
organizations. Kazakhstan’s NGOs have pointed out this injustice during the course of a number
of years but a decision has not yet been made.

Secondly, is the differentiation of activities of one legal form (noncommercial organizations)
of public association by territorial criteria: local, regional and state. For registration of a regional
public association it is necessary to have branches in more than one region of the republic and state
organizations – more than half the regions of Kazakhstan including the capitol and cities of state
significance.

In connection with the above-stated, in order to bring Kazakhstan’s legislation into compliance
with international standards of human rights and freedoms in the area of the attainment of legal
status for noncommercial organizations, it is necessary to:

- Guarantee in legislature and in practice simplification of the procedure for registration of

noncommercial legal entities;

- Lower the amount of the registration fee for noncommercial organizations with the goal of
making it easier for them to obtain legal status and contributing toward the development of civil
society;

- Establish in legislature those additional rights or privileges which are provided to public
associations per confirmation of regional or state status or exclude these positions from legislation
on public associations;

- Establish in legislation regarding noncommercial organizations, as a minimum, one more
legal form of nonmember NGO, for example, under the name of “public association”, in order to
make it possible for citizens in quantities less than ten to create nonmember NGOs, but at the same
time not making use of the legal form fund or institution.

. Issues Regarding Limitations on the Right to Unite and the Responsibilities
of Public Organizations in the Republic of Kazakhstan

According to Article 5 of the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the formation and
functioning of public associations pursuing the goals or actions directed toward a violent change
of the constitutional system, violation of the integrity of the Republic, undermining the security
of the state, inciting social, racial, national, religious, class and tribal enmity, as well as formation
of unauthorized paramilitary units is forbidden in Kazakhstan.

Fundamentally, the given constitutional position meets the requirements of international

laws.

Furthermore, in harmony with Article 39 of the Constitution of RK, rights and freedoms of an
individual and citizen may be limited only by laws and only to the extent necessary for protection
of the constitutional system, defense of the public order, human rights and freedoms, health and
morality of the population. This position also meets international standards from the standpoint of
the introduction of limitations to one right or another.

However, a straightforward analysis of legislation concerning the regulation of the right to
unite indicates that contained in them a significant quantity of limitations which are connected to a
broad interpretation of constitutional norms and do not meet the requirements of such limitations
according to international legal theory and practice.

In Article 374 of the Code on Administrative Offenses of RK it is stated, that “actions
committed by leaders and members of public associations, going beyond the bounds of the goals
and objectives defined by the founders of these public associations or violating legislation of the

2

Republic of Kazakhstan on public associations, after the receipt of a written warning necessitates
a warning or fine on the persons on the board of directors of the social organization, in the amount
of up to twenty monthly indices. The violation of the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan
by public associations or the repeat of such actions in the course of a year after the imposition of
administrative penalties provided for in the first part of the given article necessitates a fine on the
persons on the board of directors of the public association, in the amount of up to twenty monthly
indices with the halting of the functioning of the public association for a term of six months.
Those same actions, if repeated within the course of a year after the imposition of administrative
penalties, as provided for in the first and second parts of the current article, necessitate the banning
of the activities of the public association.

As a whole, in current administrative legislation a public association is the only form of legal
personality which is threatened with the banning of its activities for repeat violations within the
framework of all existing legislation regarding public associations.

Banning the activities of any legal personality is the most extreme measure of action and
therefore, in legislation as well as in practice, the necessity, validity and appropriateness of this
measure should be confirmed.

If the goals or actions of a social society are directed toward a violent change of the constitutional
system, violation of the integrity of the Republic, undermining the security of the state, inciting
various types of enmity, creation of paramilitary units, infringement of health or moral principles,
then, taking into consideration the seriousness of the violation and possible consequences, such a
measure may be justified. However, any small violation, even repeated or multiple, should not be
deserving of the halting or banning of activities.

In this connection, it is logical to suggest the introduction of amendments to administrative
legislation in the parts detailing administrative responsibility for administrative violations in the
sphere of the activities of noncommercial organizations, including public associations so that these
norms correspond to the requirements of predictability, flexibility and effectiveness and do not
make their wide interpretation possible.

Therefore, it is necessary to consider the issue of more clear requirements harmonizing with
international standards in the area of acceptable limitations for a group, the legality or illegality
of the goals, objectives and activities of noncommercial organizations and their reflection in the
charters of NGOs.

It is also necessary one more time to return to the positions of our criminal legislation in the

area of responsibility of leaders and members of public associations.

In the Criminal Code of RK there are a series of articles considering the criminal responsibility
of members of public associations and their leaders in comparison with citizens who are not
members of public associations.

Thus, in Article 336 of the Criminal Code of RK, criminal responsibility is established for
“the impediment legal activities of state bodies by members of public associations”, in which the
sanctions provided for by law for members of public associations consists of a fine or arrest for a
term of up to four months and for heads of a public association as much as imprisonment for a term
of up to one year. It is notable, that for normal citizens or workers in commercial organizations
similar articles in the Criminal Code are not provided. In other words, it is obvious that, having
committed such actions, they would be charged with responsibility per the articles “Disorderly
Conduct”, “The Use of Violence In Regard to Representatives of the State”, or per a series of
articles in Chapter 5 of the Criminal Code of RK: “Crimes Against the Basis of the Constitutional
Order and the Safety of the State”.

As a while, administrative and criminal legislation of RK in the area of the responsibility of
public associations requires perfecting, from one side, with the goal of removing “disparities”
between public associations and other legal forms of noncommercial organizations or commercial
organizations and from the other side, for the bringing of limitations and sanctions into compliance
with international standards and criteria acceptable for such limitations.

29

The Right to Create and Join Trade Unions

By the Law of RK “On Trade Unions” the right to create and join trade unions is provided
to citizens. At the same time, the quantity of trade unions created within the boundaries of one
profession is not limited. All trade unions are provided equal rights and opportunities.

There have been incidents of the hindrance of the creation and activities of trade unions on the
side of employers. Thus, per data collected by the Atyrau branch of the trade union of construction
workers and manufacturers of industrial construction materials, during the course of 2007 the
creation of trade unions was opposed by managers of 16 enterprises, the majority of whom were
conducting contractual work on the projects Tengizchevroil Ltd. and Ajip KKO. The largest of
the companies were Atyrau-Bolashak Ltd., Tengizstroyservice, Senimdi Kurylys, Khemimontazh,
Punj Lloyd Kazakhstan, Jurest Reiteon Support Services, Saipen, Caspian Vender Park and others.
In 2007, these organizations experienced collective labor conflicts and spontaneous actions of
workers.

For suitable protection of the rights and interests of workers, not only is the creation of trade
unions necessary, but also the entry of trade union organizations into the local union chapter. For
example, in the course of 2007, under administrative pressure in Intergas of Central Asia Corp., (a
chain of Kazmunaygaz) meetings were conducted and the creation of a trade union organization
was concluded which includes approximately 6,000 gas transport workers. The first talks regarding
their invitation to join the local branch of the state trade union of gas transport workers have so far
led to nothing. The management of the newly created trade union, being fully independent from
administration, is discussing creating its own union branch, although there is the provision in the
Charter for joining a higher trade union organization. The situation complicates itself when new
trade union organizations come under the control of their employer’s management, which gives
birth to “pocket” trade unions. These types of trade unions leave workers without the conditions
and benefits provided for in wage agreements.

Locally, difficulties in concluding collective agreements are also observed.
Per statistics from the state branch of geology, geodesy and cartography workers’ trade
union, in 26 organizations through the fault of administration collective agreements have not
been concluded and trade unions are practically dismissed. There have been instances of the
interference of employers in the activities of trade unions. Thus, in Volkov Corp. in Almaty, trade
union organizations were accused by their employers of the violation of the use of union dues. In
response, the administration of the corporation dissolved the trade union organization.

The above-stated circumstances allow us to recommend the Government of the Republic

of Kazakhstan in the period of 2009-20 put into practice the following measures:

1. Legislatively simplify the procedure for the registration of public associations of citizens.
2. In legislature, the right of each person to create or join associations or unions, including
those of an informal character, should be clearly fixed. For this purpose it would be appropriate to
pass a separate Law “On the Right of Citizens to Form Associations”.

3. Guarantee in legislature and in practice simplification of the registration procedure for

noncommercial legal entities.

4. Lower the amount of the registration fee for noncommercial organizations with the goal of
simplifying their obtainment of the status of a legal person and assisting the development of civil
society.

5. Introduce a regulation into the Tax Code on the exemption of an NGO from tax payments
for business activities carried out within the framework of chartered objectives, or use another
mechanism of tax benefit based upon the experience of developed countries.

6. Introduce a regulation into the Tax Code on the introduction of tax payments for commercial
organizations and individual enterprises, setting aside a portion of their revenue for the support of
Kazakhstan’s NGOs.

0

7. Establish in legislature on noncommercial organizations, as a minimum, one more legal
form of non-member based NGO, for example under the name of “Public Organization”, in order
to give citizens the ability to create non-membership based NGOs with a quantity of less than ten
people without making use of the legal forms fund or institution.

8. In 2011, develop and pass a new Law of RK “On Trade Unions”.
9. Simplify the procedures of registration, re-registration and liquidation of political parties

by means of legislation.

The Right to Freedom of Thought, Conscience and Religion

In its years of independence, fundamental and necessary favorable political conditions for a
democratic social system and the development of civil society have been created in Kazakhstan:
internal stability, interethnic and interfaith peace and accord.

In its years of independence, the number of religious associations has increased six times.
In the 1990s, 671 religious associations were active and the status on March 1, 2009, was that
3993 religious institutions are active in Kazakhstan representing more than 40 confessions and
denominations. 3034 of these institutions are valid religious associations.

A simplified mechanism for the registration of religious associations in force since 2004 and
also the tax policy of the government, directed toward the freeing of religious associations from the
payment of taxes on profits and church collections, facilitates the free development of registered
religious associations on the territory of the State.

Multinationality and interfaith have been defined as some of the fundamental pr�iorities of
iorities of
�iorities of
governmental policy in the sphere of religion – that is the establishment of interfaith agreement
as a necessary condition for the maintaining of stability in society and the observance of human
rights.

Experience with interfaith dialogue in Kazakhstan received acknowledgement and support from
world religious leaders. In Astana in 2003 and 2006 were held two Congresses of Leaders of World
and Traditional Religions. In 2003, 17 delegations from various religious confessions were at the
conference and at the second conference 29 delegations from 43 countries participated, including
not only leaders of religious confessions but of political activities, scientists and experts from
European and Asian countries, leaders and representatives of leading international organizations
– the UN, OSCE and UNESCO. The humanitarian concept of Congresses has had a large part in
the strengthing of mutual understanding.

In June, 2006, the President of Kazakhstan signed the Decree on the Approval of the Conception
of the Development of Civil Society, the goal of which is acknowledged as further improvement of
legislative, social-economic and organizational bases for comprehensive development of institutions
of civil society and their equal partnership with the government in compliance with international
legal instruments in the framework of international agreements and pacts in the area of human
rights and the human dimension. Among institutions of civil society are also indicated religious
associations. A key instance of interaction of government authorities and institutions of civil society
is the guaranteeing of religious freedom and the right of citizens to form associations.

In 2007, the State Programme on the Provision of Freedom of Belief and Enhancement of State-
Confessional Relations in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2007-2009 was passed, the fundamental
goal of which is the creation of conditions for the implementation of religious freedom in the
Republic of Kazakhstan.

In addresses, Kazakhstan has been given a series of positive assessments by the OSCE, UN and
other international organizations on the grounds of the effectiveness of models of civil peace and
accord currently functioning in the country.

A high assessment of the models of interfaith accord existent in Kazakhstan was given by
Pope John Paul the Second during his visit to the country in 2002 and other leaders of various
confessions visiting Kazakhstan for conferences of leaders of world religions.



It would be good to note that the guarantee of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and

religion in the Republic of Kazakhstan is contained in Article 22 of the Constitution of RK.

“1. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of conscience.
2. The right to freedom of conscience must not specify or limit universal human and civil

rights and responsibilities before the state”.

Article 39 of the Constitution of RK establishes:
“1. Rights and freedoms of an individual and citizen may be limited only by laws and only to
the extent necessary for protection of the constitutional system, defense of the public order, human
rights and freedoms, health and morality of the population”.

Furthermore, Paragraph 3 of Article 39 of the Constitution of RK includes freedom of

conscience in the list of rights and freedoms that shall not be restricted in any event.

The legal regulation of the right to freedom of conscience and religion in Kazakhstan is in
effect per the Law “On Freedom of Religion and Religious Associations” (further referred to as
“the Law on Freedom of Religion”), the Civil Code and other legislation.

The total quantity of normative legislation influencing the existence of freedom of conscience

and religion to one extent or another is numbered at approximately 100.

In international regulations the guarantee of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and
religion is contained in fundamental international documents on human rights: the UN Declaration
of 1981 on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or
Belief (further referred to as “DEIDRB”), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(further referred to as “ICCPR”) and in the responsibilities which governmental members of the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) take upon themselves.

Article 18 of the ICCPR defines the understanding of freedom of thought, conscience and
religion in the following manner: “This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion
or belief of his choice and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public
or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.

Article 1 of the DEIDRB expands this understanding of the principle conditions of expression:
“This right shall include freedom to have a religion or whatever belief of his choice and freedom,
either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or
belief . . ”. (further per the text of Article 18 of the ICCPR).

The understanding and contents of the freedoms of thought, conscience, religion and belief
are more fully developed in Concluding Documents Meetings on the highest level of the OSCE
(Helsinki 1975, Madrid 1980, Vienna 1989, Copenhagen 1990, Paris 1990, Budapest 1994).
Especially, in Paragraph (9) of the Copenhagen Document of 1990, participating States of the
OSCE confirmed, “(9.4) everyone will have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and
religion. This right includes freedom to change one’s religion or belief and freedom to manifest
one’s religion or belief, either alone or in community with others, in public or in private, through
worship, teaching, practice and observance. Here, the understanding of the freedom of thought,
conscience, religion and belief is expanded to the freedom to change them and the manifestation
of these freedoms includes also the freedom to teach.

Consequently, the contemporary understanding of the freedom of religion, including freedom
of thought, belief and religion consists of the following: The right to have or not to have, accept or
change any belief or religion of his choice and also to manifest and express his beliefs or religion,
either alone or in community with others, in public or in private, through teaching, worship,
practice and observance.

The including of freedom of religion as a constituent of freedom of conscience is more fully
covered in the positions of the Concluding Document of the Vienna Meeting of 1986, to which
member States of the OSCE obligated themselves:

“(16.4) - Respect the rights of these religious communities to:
- Establish and maintain freely accessible places of worship or assembly;
- Organize themselves according to their own hierarchical and institutional structure,

2

- Select, appoint and replace their personnel in accordance with their respective requirements

and standards as well as with any freely accepted arrangement between them and their State;

- Solicit and receive voluntary financial and other contributions,
(16.5) - Engage in consultations with religious faiths, institutions and organizations in order to

achieve a better understanding of the requirements of religious freedom;

(16.6) - Respect the right of everyone to give and receive religious education in the language

of his choice, whether individually or in association with others;

(16.7) - In this context respect, inter alia, the liberty of parents to ensure the religious and

moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions;

(16.8) - Allow the training of religious personnel in appropriate institutions;
(16.9) - Respect the right of individual believers and communities of believers to acquire,
possess and use sacred books, religious publications in the language of their choice and other
articles and materials related to the practice of religion or belief;

(16.10) - Allow religious faiths, institutions and organizations to produce, import and

disseminate religious publications and materials;

(16.11) - Favorably consider the interests of religious communities to participate in public

dialogue, including through the mass media.

(17) The participating States recognize that the exercise of the above-mentioned rights relating
to the freedom of religion or belief may be subject only to such limitations as are provided by
law and consistent with their obligations under international law and with their international
commitments. They will ensure in their laws and regulations and in their application the full and
effective exercise of the freedom of thought, conscience, religion, or belief.

(32) They will allow believers, religious faiths and their representatives, in groups or on an
individual basis, to establish and maintain direct personal contacts and communication with each
other, in their own and other countries, inter alia through travel, pilgrimages and participation
in assemblies and other religious events. In this context and commensurate with such contacts
and events, those concerned will be allowed to acquire, receive and carry with them religious
publications and objects related to the practice of their religion or belief.

Constitutional guarantees of the freedom of thought, conscience and religion in the Republic
of Kazakhstan are expressed in the following principles: respect for the principles and norms of
international law, the priority of international law over the laws of the Republic – Paragraphs 1
and 3 Article 4, Article 8; acknowledgement of the absolute and inalienable right of everyone
to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and the forbidding of limitations of the freedom
of conscience under any circumstances – Paragraphs 1 and 2 Article 12, Paragraph 1 Article 18,
Paragraph 1 Article 19, Paragraph 1 Article 22, Paragraph 3 Article 39; the equality before law
and the freedom from discrimination under any circumstance – Article 14; the equality of rights of
citizens and non citizens – Paragraph 4 Article 12; legislative and judicial protection – Paragraphs
1 and 2 Article 4, Paragraphs 2 and 3 Article 74, Article 78.

Consequently, the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan guarantees that: everyone
(citizens of Kazakhstan, foreigners legally on its territory, refugees or stateless persons) has the
right to freedom of conscience, (in other words, subject to the regulations of international law,
which are part of the current laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the right to have, accept, or
change religion or belief at one’s choice); no one may be forced to disclose their thoughts or
affiliation with one religion or belief or another; no one may be subject to discrimination on the
grounds of his relationship toward religion, or his affiliation with various religious trends, groups
or associations.

Constitutional guarantees of the freedom to manifest one’s religion or beliefs “either alone or
in community with others, in public or in private” are expressed in the following principles: respect
for the principles and regulations of international law and the priority of international law over the
laws of the Republic – Paragraphs 1 and 3 Article 4, Article 8; ideological diversity – Paragraph
1 Article 5; equality before the law – Paragraph 2 Article 5; freedom to form associations and



to assemble – Paragraph 1 Article 23 and Paragraph 1 Article 32; freedom from discrimination
under any circumstances – Article 14; equality of rights of citizens and non citizens – Paragraph
4 Article 12; the forbidding of illegal interference by the government in the affairs of associations
and by associations in the affairs of the government and also the forbidding of the imposition of
functions of governmental agencies on associations – Article 1, Paragraph 3 Article 5; legislative
and judicial protection – Paragraphs 1 and 2 Article 4, Paragraphs 2 and 3 Article 74, Article 78.

Consequently, the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan guarantees that: religious
institutions (of all forms) are separate from the government; in the government there is no State
supported religion and no religion is a factor in the formation of the government; no confession
fulfills any governmental function; no one religion, religious group or association may have
any privileges in relation to other religions, religious groups or associations; no one (citizens of
Kazakhstan, foreigners legally in the territory of Kazakhstan, refugees or stateless persons) may
be subject to discrimination by reason of religion, affiliation with various religious trends, groups,
or associations.

Constitutional limitations of the freedom to manifest religion or belief “either alone or in
community with others, in public or in private” are based on the following positions: the exercise
of human rights and freedoms must not violate rights and freedoms of other persons, infringe
on the constitutional system and public morals – Paragraph 5 Article 12; the goals or actions of
associations must not be directed toward a violent change of the constitutional system, violation of
the integrity of the Republic, undermining the security of the state, inciting social, racial, national,
religious, class and tribal enmity, as well as formation of unauthorized paramilitary units, –
Paragraph 3 Article 5; the prohibition of the actions of religious parties – Paragraph 4 Article 5; the
activities of foreign religious associations on the territory of the Republic as well as appointment
of heads of religious associations in the Republic by foreign religious centers shall be carried out in
coordination with the respective state institutions of the Republic – Paragraph 5 Article 5; and the
rights and freedoms of an individual and citizen may be limited only by laws and only to the extent
necessary for protection of the constitutional system, defense of the public order, human rights and
freedoms, health and morality of the population – Paragraph  Article 9.

Legislative Guarantees of Freedom of Thought, Conscience and Religion

Legislation оn freedom of conscience and religion in Kazakhstan, as a whole, is liberal to a
sufficient extent. Therefore, in compliance with international standards, the law on freedom of
religion does not provide for the mandatory governmental registration of religious associations;
however, Article 375 of the Code on Administrative Offenses (CAO) makes provision for the
punishment of a religious association for acting without governmental registration. In practice, this
contradiction in legislation is settled by judges most often in favor of the norms of the CAO, which
has led to multiple violations of the law on freedom of religion, Article 39 of the Constitution and
international standards, especially the right to freedom of religion “in association with others”.

In 2005, with the goal of fighting extremism and strengthening national security, three
laws were passed: The Law of February 18, 2005 “On Counteracting Extremism”, the Law of
February 23, 2005 “On the Introduction of Additions and Amendments to Laws of the Republic of
Kazakhstan Relating to Counteracting Extremist Activity” and the Law of RK of July 8, 2005 “On
the Introduction of Additions and Amendments to Laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan Relating
to National Security”.

Paragraph 3 of Article 18 of the ICCPR does not include “national security” in the number
of acceptable reasons for the imposition of limitations on freedom of thought, conscience or
religion.

In compliance with the Syracuse Principles regarding the interpretation of the limitation and
derogation from the position of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, “the
interests of national security” may be invoked to justify measures limiting certain rights only in

4

situations when such limitations lead to the protection of “the existence of the nation or its territorial
integrity or political independence against force or threat of force”. “National security cannot be
invoked as a reason for imposing limitations to prevent merely local or relatively isolated threats
to law and order” and it cannot “be used as a pretext for imposing vague or arbitrary limitations”
and it is “may only be invoked when there exists adequate safeguards and effective remedies
against abuse”. “Interests of national security” may serve as justification for limitations only of
certain groups of rights and freedoms: freedom of movement and choice of residence; limitation
of the presence of the public and press at juridical processes; freedom of speech, freedom to form
associations and freedom of assembly. The freedom of thought, conscience and belief is absent
from the list of rights and freedoms, the limitation of which is acceptable “in the interests of
national security”.

Nondiscrimination and equality before the law on the grounds of religion or opinion (Article

26 of the ICCPR).

For religious associations, in comparison with other legal persons, unequal responsibility
is established by law for the violation of legislation. A wider basis for suspension and a more
complicated procedure for renewal of activities are established for them (Article 723 CAO and
Article 10-1 of the Law on Freedom of Religion).

Distinctions in comparison with other legal persons are established also in regards to the basis

for the liquidation of a religious association.

The activity of a religious association as a legal person may be forbidden by court in the
following instances: the violation of legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan; the systematical
carrying out of activities in contradiction to the charter and similarly the failure to remove within
the set period of the violation the basis for the suspension of activities (CAO, Article 375, Parts 4
and 5).

The right to freedom to manifest religion or belief “in community with others and in public
or private, . . .in worship, observance, practice and teaching”. (Paragraph 1 Article 18 of the
ICCPR).

Kazakhstan’s legislation contains limitations of this right, going beyond the bounds of
Paragraph 3 Article 18 of the ICCPR and Paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 39 of the Constitution of
Kazakhstan. These limitations concern the ability to practice religion regardless of legal status,
the possibility of receiving legal status, the freedom to preach (“missionary activity”) and teach
(spiritual instruction).

Freedom of religion regardless of legal status.
The activity of unregistered religious associations is forbidden (Part 4 Article 4 of the Law on
Freedom of Religion) and is punished in administrative procedure up to the forbidding of activity
(Articles 374-1 and 375 of CAO).

If a religious group did not undergo governmental registration (by reason of lack of funds,
a small amount of members, or bureaucratic impediments to registration) or refuses to register
because of religious reasons, it is considered illegal. In practice, this is reflected in that the group
is forbidden from all forms of practicing religion “in association with others”, prayerful meetings
(including those conducted in private homes and apartments), teaching of religion, preaching,
distribution of religious literature, etc.

The Law on Freedom of Religion contains the understanding “a religious group with a small
amount of numbers, not having acknowledgement as a legal person”, which may function after
undergoing registration in local governmental agencies (Articles 6-1 and 6-2). However, conditions
and procedures for undergoing registration are not defined in the Law.

The possibility of receiving legal status.
The Law on Freedom of Religion makes the provision of four forms of legal personality for
religious groups: local religious associations (community), religious offices (centers), theological
instructional establishments and monasteries (Article 7). A legal personality in the form of a
“religious association” may be formed at the initiative of a group of 10 citizens (Article 9).



In contrast to all other types of legal entities in Kazakhstan that undergo registration with the
Committee of Registration Services of the Ministry of Justice of RK and its territorial divisions, a
distinct procedure of governmental registration is established for religious associations. Religious
offices (centers) and associations active in the territory of two or more regions of the republic and
also theological institutions, monasteries and other associations formed by them are registered by
an authorized state body – The Committee for Religious Affairs of the Ministry of Justice of RK.
The procedure for governmental registration of religious associations, in comparison with other
forms of legal entities is complicated by the circumstances that the authorized state body may at
its discretion assign reviews by religious experts and others and also require the conclusions of
the specialists regarding the given religious organization in document form (Article 9). The basis,
the procedure for the assignment and procedures for the conducting of reviews and conclusions
are not stipulated in the Law and are determined by State bylaws. The Law provides also for the
interruption of the term of registration for the time of the conducting of reviews, but does not
restrict this period to any time frame.

Although the Law does not provide a basis for the refusal of registration of a religious
association, in practice, complicated procedures allow the drawing out of the registration process
indefinitely. Because of this, groups awaiting registration fall into the position of “illegal” their
right to freedom of religion “in association with others” is infringed.

Missionary activity
The Law on Freedom of Religion defines missionary activity as “preaching and distribution by
means of religious proselytizing activity beliefs which are not contained in the chartered position of
the religious organization carrying out its activities in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan”.
(Article 1-1, Paragraph 2). “Citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan, foreign citizens and stateless
persons (further referred to as “missionaries”) may carry out missionary activity in the territory of
the Republic of Kazakhstan after undergoing official registration. The carrying out of missionary
activity without official registration is forbidden” (Article 4-1).

In contrast to the official registration of “religious groups with few members not having
acknowledgement as a legal person”, the Law establishes clear regulations regarding the official
registration of missionaries (Article 4-2).

Theological education
The Law allows only religious associations (centers) the right to found theological educational

institutions (Article 7).

In compliance with the Constitution of RK, the Law on Freedom of Religion states that state
education in Kazakhstan has a secular character (Article 5) and does not contain direct requirements
for the governmental licensing of theological educational activities. In practice, governmental
agencies require from theological educational institutions licensing in harmony with Articles 40
and 57 of the Law of RK “On Education” and Article 23 of the Law of RK “On Licensing”.

The right to alternative service
The Law on Religious Freedom establishes that “No one has the right by reason of his religious
beliefs to refuse the fulfillment of civil responsibilities, with the exception of instances provided
for by law. The exchange of the fulfillment of one responsibility for another by reason of religious
belief is allowed only in compliance with the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan” (Article
3). A law on alternative service does not exist in Kazakhstan.

Based upon the above-stated, The National Human Rights Action Plan contains the following
series of measures directed toward the improvement of legislation and law-enforcement practices
in the area of the guarantee of the constitutional right of citizens to freedom of thought, conscience
and religion.

The Right to Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association

The guarantee of the freedom of peaceful assembly in the Republic of Kazakhstan is contained
in Article 32 of the Constitution of RK: “Citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan shall have the
right to peacefully and without arms assemble, hold meetings, rallies and demonstrations, street
processions and pickets. The use of this right may be restricted by law in the interests of state
security, public order and protection of health, rights and freedoms of other persons”.

In addition to this, Article 39 of the Constitution of RK establishes: “1. Rights and freedoms
of an individual and citizen may be limited only by laws and only to the extent necessary for
protection of the constitutional system, defense of the public order, human rights and freedoms,
health and morality of the population . . ”.

The legal regulation of the freedom of peaceful assembly in Kazakhstan exists by means
of the passing of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan of March 17, 1995 “On the Procedure
for the Organization and Conducting of Peaceful Assemblies, Meetings, Processions, Pickets and
Demonstrations in the Republic of Kazakhstan” with amendments of December 20, 2004 (further
referred to as “the Law”).

Individual regulations concerning the legal regulation of the freedom of peaceful assembly in
the Republic of Kazakhstan are contained in the Law of RK of December 21, 1995 “On Agencies
of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan” and the Law of RK of June 26, 1998 “On the
National Security of the Republic of Kazakhstan”.

Bylaws regulating the freedom of peaceful assembly in Kazakhstan include the Decree of
the Ministry of the Interior of RK of December 31, 1993 “On the Organization of the Work of
Agencies of Internal Affairs in Relation to Public Associations;” the Decree of the Ministry of the
Interior of RK of December 6, 2000 “On Approval of the Regulation on the Organization of the
Work of Subdivisions of Agencies of Internal Affairs Regarding the Guarantee of Guarding Public
Order and the Safety of Citizens when Conducting Events of Public Associations on Streets and in
other Public Places;” the Decree of the Ministry of the Interior of July 5, 2002 “On Approval of the
Regulation of Patrol Post Services of Agencies of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Regarding the Guarantee of Guarding Public Order and Security;” the Decision of the Maslikhat
of the City of Astana of May 2, 2002 “On Additional Regulation of the Procedure and Places for
Conducting Peaceful Assemblies, Meetings and Pickets” and the Decision of the XVII session of
the Maslikhat of the City of Almaty of July 29, 2005 “Some Issues Regarding the Rational Use of
Places of City Infrastructures”.

Finally, the Code on Administrative Offenses of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Article 373) and
the Criminal Code (Article 334) contain sanctions for the violation of legislation on the procedure
for organization and conducting of peaceful assemblies, meetings, processions, pickets and
demonstrations from fines and administrative arrest for a term of up to 15 days up to imprisonment
of a term of up to one year.

Considering international standards in the area of the guarantee of the freedom of peaceful
assembly, as set forth in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), ratified
by the Republic of Kazakhstan and other international documents on human rights, in decisions
of the European Court of Human Rights and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human
Rights (ODIHR) developed on their basis and in the OSCE document “Guidelines on Freedom of
Peaceful Assembly” published in the end of March, 2007, an analysis of current legislation of the
Republic of Kazakhstan in this sphere highlights its noncompliance to the given standards in some
parameters.

Since the existing definition in the Law On the Procedure for Conducting Assemblies
and Meetings . . . does not correspond with the category of peaceful assemblies acceptable in
international practice, inasmuch as besides meetings, processions, demonstrations and pickets
(in the given instance, hunger strikes in public places, the erection of yurts and tents, defined in



Kazakhstan’s legislature, may be considered as special forms of protest actions, similar to pickets)
the word “assembly” is used separately. In other words, not only are peaceful assemblies held as
public actions in open public areas regulated in legislation, but all assemblies as such.

In current legislation, nowhere is the interpretation of the understanding of “assembly” given,
nor the understanding of “demonstration”, “procession”, “meeting” or “picket”, which violates the
principles of legal predictability and specificity and makes possible the purely arbitrary designation
of one or another aggregation, group or action of citizens as an illegal assembly or picket.

The legal regulation of all forms of peaceful assemblies, as encompassed by law, has a

permissive and not advisory character and exists by means of identical regulations.

Since, for the conducting of peaceful assemblies, an application in written form is given to
the local executive agency, no later than 10 days before the named date of its being held. In the
application must be indicated the objective, form, location for the conducting the event or the route
of movement, time of its beginning and end, estimated quantity of participators, the last name,
first name and patronymic of its representatives (organizers) and individuals responsible for the
observance of public order, the place of their residence and work (school), the date of submitting
the application. The submission date of the application is counted from the day of its registration
with the local executive agency. The local executive agency considers the application and informs
the representatives (organizers) of their decision no later than five days before the time of the
holding of the event, as stated in the application (Article 3 of the Law).

A similar procedure applies to all types of peaceful assemblies defined in the Law: assemblies,

meetings, processions, demonstrations and pickets.

This makes practically impossible the carrying out of spontaneous actions connected with the
expression of protest or another public manifestation in connection with events arousing urgent
public reaction.

The local executive agency in the interests of the guarantee of rights and freedom of others,
public security and also the normal function of transport, places of infrastructure, the protection
of green areas and small architectural forms may, according to need, offer those applying another
time or place of conducting the event (Article 4 of the Law).

In addition to this, Article 10 of the Law makes the provision that, “local representative
agencies may additionally regulate the procedure for the conducting of assemblies, meetings,
processions, pickets and demonstrations taking into account local conditions and in compliance
with the requirements of the current Law”.

The representative agency (Maslikhat) of the city of Astana used this position of the Law in
making the decision “in the interests of the guarantee of rights and freedom of citizens, public
security and also the uninterrupted functioning of transportation and objects of infrastructure, the
protection of green areas and small architectural forms . . . the places for the conducting of peaceful
assemblies, meetings and pickets in the city of Astana have been defined as the territories belonging
to the buildings PKF “Gazservis” (1 Vtoraya Nagornaya St.) and OAO Okan Amriko (Mikrorayon
3)”. (Decision of the Maslikhat of the City of Astana of May 2, 2002 “On Additional Regulation of
the Procedure and Places for Conducting Peaceful Assemblies, Meetings and Pickets”)

A similar decision was made by the Maslikhat of the city of Almaty: “To recommend to the
Akimat of the city of Almaty to use: . . .2) the square beyond the movie theater “Sari-Arka” for
the conducting of nongovernmental events of a public political character”. (Decision of the
XVII session of the Maslikhat of the City of Almaty, third calling, of July 29, 2005 “Some Issues
Regarding the Rational Use of Places of City Infrastructures”.) At the same time, the main city
squares are set aside for government events.

Consequently, the peaceful assembly in itself, in the form of a demonstration, meeting or
picket loses all sense, inasmuch as usually such actions are an expression of public interests,
including protests, directed toward the attracting of public attention to the expression of their

9

opinion regarding a governmental decision, action or process, namely in front of the buildings of
those agencies or offices of those organizations which made the decisions or took the action.

Moreover, similar decisions by representatives of agencies of authority, although of a
reccomendational nature, are directly guided by local executive agencies, making such forms
of peaceful assembly such as parades, processions or demonstrations practically impossible for
citizens living in the capitol of Kazakhstan, Astana or in the city of Almaty, inasmuch as these
forms of peaceful assembly in themselves involve movement from one point to another.

In contradiction to international standards, current legislation does not contain any differentiation
between participators and passers-by who chance to be at the place of the event and also observers:
journalists, law-enforcement and others from the viewpoint of bringing them to accountability in
the instance of illegal action. As a result, in a series of instances, journalists and bystanders, etc.
have been held accountable.

Current legislation does not contain the understanding or the guarantee of the right to counter-
demonstrate, nor the procedure of action for agencies in support of public order and the protection
of rights of participators of the main event as well as counter-demonstrations.

Current legislation does not contain the position obligating governmental agencies and most of
all law-enforcement, to assist citizens in realizing their rights to peaceful assembly and to protect
participators of legal peaceful assemblies.

According to Article 2 of the Law, the application to hold an assembly, meeting, procession,
picket or demonstration can be given by representatives of work collectives, public associations or
individual groups of citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan who are more than 18 years of age.

Based upon similar application, the conclusion can be drawn that an individual person does not
have the right to turn in an application on a picket or a meeting and this is a clear contradiction to
international norms, inasmuch as they guarantee the freedom of peaceful assembly to each person,
including, under certain limitations which do not infringe upon human rights, minors (Article 15
of the UN Convention On Rights of the Child).

According to Article 11 of the Law, “the procedures for organizing and conducting assemblies
and meetings, established by the current Law, are not applicable to assemblies and meetings of
labor collectives and public associations, conducted in compliance with legislation and their
charters and located in enclosed areas”.

Based upon the formulation of this article, it follows that any other assembly or meeting,
organized in enclosed areas which are not of labor collectives or public associations, but, for
example, of individual citizens, groups of citizens, commercial organizations, funds or institutions,
come under the procedure established by the given Law. In other words, the necessity to turn in an
application 10 days in advance, etc.

The above-quoted analysis allows us to make the following conclusion: the legislation and law-
enforcement practices of the Republic of Kazakhstan concerning the right to peaceful assembly,
to some extent do not correspond to international standards, including responsibilities under the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, other international human rights agreements
and also responsibilities within the framework of the Organization for Security and Co-Operation
in Europe, especially the OSCE Guidelines on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly.

The main problems in legislation are summarized as follows:
1. The Law establishes strict permissive but not informative procedures. Permission for
conducting any assembly is given by local executive agencies. Applications must be submitted 10
days in advance of conducting the assembly and a violation of this regulation is an administrative
violation.

2. The Law does not give clear definitions of types of peaceful assembly, which violates the
principles of legal predictability and specificity. Any cluster of people in such a situation could be
potentially termed an assembly in the sense of the Law and correspondingly, illegal, if there was
no permission given by an executive agency of the government. In other words, citizens seeking
to lay flowers on a memorial or carrying a petition to the authorities, participants of flash mobs,

40

courtyard meetings of apartment residents, etc may be held to administrative accountability. In
addition, the Law does not contain a distinction between who is considered a participant in an
assembly and who is not. This makes it possible to hold accountable anyone found in the location
where an assembly is held.

3. The law does not provide for the submitting of an application to conduct an assembly by an
individual person. This directly contradicts Article 21 of the ICCPR, which provides for freedom
of assembly not only for groups but also for individuals.

4. The Law, together with decisions of local representative agencies limits the places for holding
assemblies of citizens and public associations. In a series of cities, are established strictly out-of-
the way places, as a rule, located on the outskirts of the city. Higher officials and local authorities
and also some political organizations, for the holding of assemblies, have the unfounded exclusive
right to use squares in the city center, in comparison with citizens and their associations, which
is discrimination. In addition to the element of discrimination, this is a violation of the essence
of freedom of assembly. In fact, there can be no reasonable substantiation, from the viewpoint of
international standards, to bind the realization of freedom of assembly to one location. Moreover, not
all forms of assembly can be held in such conditions, since pickets, demonstrations or processions
virtually cannot be contained to one place in the city.

5. Article 373 of the Code on Administrative Offenses and Article 334 of the Criminal
Code excessively broadly interpret violations in the sphere of the freedom of peaceful assembly.
Administrative responsibility per these articles may occur in the instance of the violation of the
procedure for conducting assemblies as stated in the Law. At the same time, law-enforcement
agencies may independently determine the margin of public danger of an action.

Legislation does not establish the line by which administrative and criminal responsibility may
be clearly distinguished. In compliance with Paragraph 2 Article 373 of the CAO, a third party
rendering assistance to an assembly unsanctioned by the authorities comes under administrative
responsibility. This type of limitation is unnecessary in a democratic government and unjustified
from the viewpoint of the availability of vital public and social necessities and, consequently, is
disproportionate.

6. The Law contains a large quantity of prohibitions of the holding of an assembly. These
prohibitions are so broadly stated that they allow the possibility for their abuse from the side of
executive agencies. In them is no clarity regarding the question: whose violations and in what
quantity may influence the prohibition of the holding of an assembly and the responsibility of
authorities to take into consideration concrete circumstances is absent.

7. The Civil Procedure Code does not support effective measures of legal protection in the case
of appeal of a refusal of the authorities of the holding of an assembly. In it is established a monthly
time for the consideration of civil suits. Consequently, even if the prohibition of authorities would
be acknowledged as illegal, the holding of the assembly may become irrelevant.

As indicated by the observations of non-governmental organizations for the protection of rights,
including monitoring conducted by the public fund “Charter for Human Rights”, law-enforcement
practices are also imperfect and require cardinal improvement.

Thus, the following problems were disclosed:
1. Freedom of assembly is interpreted by local authorities as a collective right, which
contradicts both the Constitution and international standards. As a result, the situation is created in
which a person individually does not have freedom of peaceful assembly.

2. Judges do not apply the principle of proportionality to limitations of the freedom of assembly
when considering suits regarding the appeal of refusal to hold an assembly and when considering
administrative matters regarding the charge of violation of legislation on freedom of assembly.

3. Law-enforcement agencies are not always guided in the detainment of demonstrators by the
existence of an actual threat, in consequence of which a large quantity of unfounded detainments is
allowed. Detainment often takes place on the grounds of suspicion only of the intent to participate
in an assembly.

4

4. Conduct of officials of law-enforcement agencies creates the feeling of uncertainty and
unpredictability in citizens. In a series of instances of the forced termination of assemblies, the
police do not warn participators of their actions. There have been frequent instances of assault
and detainment of journalists and independent observers collecting information at the place of the
event.

5. Local authorities, considering applications for the holding of assemblies, are inclined to
apply extreme measures in the form of a denial, often on a formal basis. At the same time, the
possibility is often ignored of requesting additional information from applicants and engaging in
preliminary discussions with organizers regarding the holding of assemblies.

Based upon all the above-stated, The National Human Rights Action Plan contains a series
of measures directed toward the improvement of legislation and law-enforcement practices in the
sphere of guaranteeing the constitutional right of citizens to freedom of peaceful assembly.

The Right to Freedom of Speech and the Receipt of Information

In the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the right to freedom of speech and creativity
is guaranteed, censorship is forbidden and the right of everyone to receive and distribute information
by any means not forbidden by law is reinforced.

Moreover, limitations also exist, accepted in international practice. Paragraph 3 of Article 20
of the Constitution of RK does not allow propaganda of or agitation for the forcible change of the
constitutional system, violation of the integrity of the Republic, undermining of state security and
advocating war, social, racial, national, religious, class and clannish superiority as well as the cult
of cruelty and violence.

These freedoms, rights and limitations are repeated in Article 2 of the Law of RK “On Tools

of Mass Information”.

One of the most important instruments for the realization of the right and freedom of citizens

to information is the mass media.

4

In Kazakhstan, over the last years cardinal transformation in the sphere of the activity of the
mass media have been executed. Privatization of the mass media sector occurred, the result of
which, today more than 0% of mass media is nongovernmental.

Market reforms have resulted in the growth in quantity and quality of instruments of mass
media. Kazakhstan today leads the majority of countries of Central Asia and Transcaucasia in the
pace of mass media development. The fact that the Annual Eurasia Media Forum is held in the
country testifies to Kazakhstan’s leadership in the development of media infrastructures.

Nevertheless, in practice, instances of the limitation of freedom of speech of citizens have
arisen. As noted by some NGOs, in Kazakhstan there have been instances of the violation of the
human right to freedom of speech. There have been isolated instances of the death of journalists
and some instances of the bodily injury of representatives of instruments of mass information.

Data from the sociological survey “Human Rights in Kazakhstan: The General Opinion”.
witnesses to the restriction of the right of citizens to freedom of speech. Of 1500 respondents to the
question, “How do you assess the situation in the sphere of the protection of the right of citizens to
freedom of speech?” 27,3 % gave a negative assessment of the governmental mechanism for the
protection of the constitutional right of citizens to freedom of speech, 51,7% gave a positive assessment
and 21,0% of respondents had difficulty in answering. The results of the sociological survey lead to
drawing the conclusion regarding the necessity to improve legislation and law-enforcement practices
in regard to mass media in Kazakhstan, in compliance with international standards.

A significant event in the year 2006 was the approval on June 25, 2006, of the Decree of the
President of the Republic of Kazakhstan on the Concept of Civil Society Development in the
Republic of Kazakhstan in the years 2006-2011.

The Concept defines the basic direction of development of institutions of civil society and the
possibilities of realization of civil initiatives and has become a basis for the development of target
programs and legislative and other normative legal acts, directed toward the creation of favorable
conditions for the functioning of institutions of civil society.

The main objective of the Concept is the further improvement of the legislative, social-
economic and organizational basis for the comprehensive development of institutions of civil
society and their equivalent partnership with the government and business sector in compliance
with international legal instruments within the framework of international treaties and covenants
in the area of human rights and the human dimension.

With the goal of the realization of the Concept of Civil Society Development in the Republic
of Kazakhstan in the years 2006-2011, an Outline of Measures for the Realization of the Concept
of Civil Society Development in the Republic of Kazakhstan for the years 2006-2011 was prepared
and approved September 30, 2006 by the Government of RK.

With the aim of guaranteeing the Constitutional right of citizens to freedom of speech
and the receipt of information, we recommend that the Government of the Republic of
Kazakhstan implement the following measures in the period of 2009-20:

1. Improve legislation regulating the activities of mass media, taking into consideration

international legislation in the sphere of human rights, ratified by the Republic of Kazakhstan.

2. With the aim of fully guaranteeing the constitutional right of citizens to the receipt of

information, in 2011 develop and pass the Law “On the Access of Citizens to Information”.

3. Strengthen legislative responsibility (material, administrative, criminal) of officials and
individuals who hinder the legal activity of journalists and other representatives of implements of
mass media.

4. Halting the activity of an implement of mass media should be allowed only by decision of

the court.

5. Legislatively establish limitation periods regarding matters of the protection of honor and

dignity.

6. Strengthen instruments of cooperation with governmental agencies and institutions of civil
society and create favorable conditions for the effective realization of the governmental social
decree.

The Right to Participate in the Government
(Free and Fair Elections)

The right to participate in the government, the right to elect and be elected into governmental
agencies and institutions of local government are established in Article 33 of the Constitution of
the Republic of Kazakhstan and also in Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and in Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

The Head of the State, Parliament and local representative institutions are chosen on an
electoral basis. Elections of the President, deputies of the Majilis of Parliament and Maslikhat of
the Republic are held on the basis of the universal, equal and direct electoral right by secret ballot.
Elections of deputies of the Senate of Parliament are held on the basis of the indirect electoral right
by secret ballot.

Citizens of Kazakhstan have active voting rights upon reaching 18 years of age, despite their
parentage, social, official and material status, sex, race, nationality, language, religion, beliefs,
place of residence and any other circumstances.

In harmony with Paragraph 3 Article 33 of the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan,
the right to elect and be elected, to participate in the all-nation referendum shall not extend to the
citizens judged incapable by a court as well as those held in places of confinement on a court’s
sentence. According to Paragraph 4 of Article 4 of the Constitutional Law of the Republic of
Kazakhstan “On Elections in the Republic of Kazakhstan”, (further referred to as “the Law on
Elections”) individuals having previous convictions which have not been acquitted or withdrawn
according to the procedure established by law may not be candidates for the President of the
Republic of Kazakhstan, deputies of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan, included on
party lists, the Maslikhat and also candidates for membership in any other institution of local
government.

The Constitution establishes a residential qualification, an age requirement and a series of

other requirements for candidates for electoral office.

The President may be a citizen of the Republic of Kazakhstan, by birth not younger than 40
years of age, freely speaking the State language and having lived in Kazakhstan the last 15 years.
A deputy of Parliament may be an individual who is a citizen of the Republic of Kazakhstan
and who has continually lived on its territory the last 10 years. A deputy of the Senate of Parliament
may be an individual who has reached 30 years of age, having a higher education and length of
service of not less than five years and has been a permanent resident for not less than three years
on the territory of the respective oblast, major city or the capital of the Republic. A deputy of the
Majilis of Parliament may be an individual who has reached 25 years of age.

A deputy of the Maslikhat may be elected by citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan when he

has reached 20 years of age.

In Kazakhstan, there is a four-level system of electoral commissions. In all, in the Republic of

Kazakhstan there are 13,283 electoral commissions, in which work 92,981 people.

It would be good to note the fact that in the sphere of the guaranteeing the active electoral right
of citizens it is necessary to improve conditions for the participation in elections and referendums
by persons with disabilities. This involves the installation of ramps at voting points, the use
of special voting ballets for blind voters and the application of new technology for voting by
persons with disabilities. In this connection, it would be beneficial to study corresponding foreign
experience (uppermost, USA and countries of the European Union) and implement a corresponding
legislative basis for the guarantee of full participation of the persons with disabilities in the electoral
process.

4

. Registration, Voter Lists

International standards require the guaranteeing of the full and comprehensive transparency
of the entire process of working with lists. At the same time transparency means that voter lists
should be documents open to the public and available for verification without expense to the
individual requiring verification.

In the opinion of experts, sufficient transparency in the compiling of voter lists is not provided
for in Kazakhstan’s legislature. In order to be included in a voter list, a citizen should be registered
at his place of residence. Later, local executive institutions compose voter lists on the basis of
this information. How they compose them and how accurately, is impossible to control. Citizens
may check themselves if they are on the list, however, the overwhelming majority do not do this.
Political parties, candidates and NPOs have no rights to verify the accuracy of the compilation of
voter lists.

Furthermore, regulations forbidding the unauthorized use of personal data of citizens are

absent from legislature.

2. Political Parties and Candidates

According to international standards, legislation regulating the formation and registration of
political parties should not contain unduly difficult requirements for the formation of a political
party.

The Law of RK “On Political Parties” contains a sufficiently large amount of requirements for

the formation and registration of political parties.

The collection of the minimum number of signatures of registered voters for the nomination of
candidates as representatives of governmental agencies and for the registration of political parties
corresponds to international standards. It is necessary to perfect the mechanisms for checking the
signatures of citizens.

Kazakhstan’s legislation regarding the requirements, procedure and refusal of registration

require reconsideration and bringing into compliance with international standards.

The absence of a clear interpretation of the understanding of “agitation” in comparison with
“the distribution of information and propaganda as the goal and objective” allows a sufficiently
arbitrary interpretation of the actions of various political parties and groups from the viewpoint of
holding them accountable for so-called untimely “agitation”. This problem concerns both individual
candidates for deputies of Parliament as well as for President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Therefore, legislative permission to bring the given interpretation regarding the expression of one’s
opinion and the distribution of one’s political views into compliance with international standards
is required.

In harmony with international practice, a particular problem is the permitting from time to
time within the framework of legislation the early termination of deputy mandate as a result
of changing his political party alliance. The chosen candidate should be responsible before
voters. This responsibility may be undermined in the case when legislation requires the candidate
who changed party alliance to present his credentials.

. Equal Treatment by and equal Access to Mass Media

According to international standards, political parties and candidates should be provided
equal access to mass media and should have the guarantee of equal treatment by mass media
belonging to or controlled by the government with a view of objective and impartial information
of electors regarding political platforms and views and goals of political parties and candidates.
This is true of all forms of mass media including radio, television, newspapers and developing
forms of media such as the Internet.

4

One of the factors which can ensure this standard is a requirement to grant political
parties the right to free radio and television time on a continual basis and not only during
elections.

The standard of equal treatment by and equal access to mass media is discredited if the
mass media belonging to or controlled by the government in its news, political reviews,
discussions or editorials display preference for one political party or candidate over another.
In harmony with international practice, democratic elections are impossible where legislation
hinders speeches and expression of opinions or lowers their tone during the course of election
campaigns.

In CIS countries that are in transition to democracy, legislation in practice ensures the
censoring of speeches by using sanctions for speeches that “slander” or “insult” another person.
This person could be understood to be the government, an official, or a candidate during an election
campaign. These regulations are often found in Election Codes or in legislation regulating the mass
media or public information. These regulations are also found in constitutional legislation as
well as the civil, criminal and administrative codes.

Any law regulating slanderous sayings against another person or affecting his reputation

should be a part of applicable civil legislation.

Such restrictions of freedom of expression violate international standards in the field of human
rights. In addition, such regulations usually violate the guarantee of freedom of speech stipulated
by the Constitution of the country.

Lack of clear criteria for the differentiation between the expression of one’s opinion and
“materials and other information deliberately discrediting the honor, dignity and business
reputation of a candidate or political party” creates the basis for violent interpretation of these
concepts and a selective approach to application of similar provisions of the law.

In this regard, Kazakhstan’s legislation is in need of reconsideration, decriminalization of
“slander” and “insult” and determination of clear and sound criteria for the differentiation between
the expression of one’s opinion and dissemination of information contrary to facts and discrediting
honor, dignity or business reputation.

4. Review of Election Legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Recommendation on Improvement of Election Legislation.

Since the initial enactment of the Election Law of September 28, 1995, it was amended and
added nine times with a view to its improvement and the bringing of it into harmony with the
standards of international election legislation – by the Constitutional Laws of June 19, 1997, May
8, 1998, November 6, 1998, May 6, 1999, June 28, 1999, April 14, 2004, April 15, 2005, December
25, 2006 and June 19, 2007.

The main innovations of the year 2004 were: non-alternative elections and preliminary voting
were excluded; the principle of formation of elective committees by Maslikhats for the representation
of political parties was introduced; restrictions were cancelled according to which the following
people could not be registered as candidates for elective positions: 1) those who during the period
of one year before registration were called to disciplinary account for a corruption violation; 2)
those who during the period of one year before registration were given in court an administration
penalty for an intentional violation; candidates who stood in preliminary elections received the
right to participate in second elections (earlier, the law prohibited this); into the law was included
a full and exhaustive list of violations which can serve as a basis for cancellation of registration for
candidacy; the voting procedure and counting of votes were regulated in more detail; candidates
and political parties were allowed to have a greater quantity of trustees who are granted the right
to require the recounting of ballots at election centers; the principle for the compilation of voter
lists was changed so that voters are listed according to their registration by place of residence; a

47

clear definition of the concept “agitation” was introduced into legislation; charity was prohibited
during election campaign which, in the same way as bribery of electors, is a violation of principles
of free declaration of citizens’ will; the mass media was imposed with the duty to realize impartial
coverage of election campaign candidates or political parties without preferences given to any of
them; guarantees of equal access for candidates to mass media were established; inappropriate
election campaigning was prohibited and as its main features were defined (the provision of goods,
services, or securities for free or on preferential terms to voters as well as the conducting of raffles
or charity activities, paying out of money or promising to do so); and the possibility of using an
automated information system for elections was foreseen.

Regulations regarding the significant expansion of observer rights were included in the law in
2004. Earlier, the Election Law did not cover rights of observers such as: to remain in the voting
room at so-called “closed election centers;” to be in the vehicle during the transportation of portable
ballot boxes; to observe the voting; to observe the counting of votes in conditions ensuring the
clear view of all procedures; to be present during the course of voting outside the voting room in
case it is impossible to remain inside the voting room; to make photo, audio and video recordings;
to read election committee protocols regarding voting results; and to receive their verified copies.
These rights are now established.

Changes in the year 2005 resulted in filling gaps in election legislation which were revealed by
the election campaign in the year 2004: citizens were granted the opportunity to vote with detachable
certificates; measures were taken to enhance the responsibility of candidates for elective positions
(candidates as well as their mates prior to registration must submit their income and property
statements to their local tax authorities on the first date of month of the period of nomination); the
quantity of trustees of candidates was limited to a number not exceeding three people per every
election center in corresponding election areas; regulations regarding the financing of election
campaigns were specified and detailed and issues of financial reporting and financial operations in
the period of elections were itemized in more detail.

The ban introduced in the year 2005 on any form of expression of public, group or private
interests or protest which would influence voters or members of election committees beginning
from the moment of completion of the election campaign and lasting until the official publication
of election results was cancelled in 2006 by means of the removal of Paragraph 6 of Article 44 of
the Election Law.

In June 2007, as a result of amendments to the Constitution made in May 2007, the Election Law
was greatly changed. A new procedure for the formation of the Majilis of Parliament according to
party lists was established; the amount of election fees paid by political parties was differentiated
according to the number of votes obtained in support of the political party in the course of previous
elections; opportunities of political parties to participate in the work of election committees were
expanded: political parties not having representatives in the election committee have the right
to delegate a representative with the right of advisory vote for the period of preparation and
conduction of the election campaign and he is empowered with all the rights of a member of the
election committee; the rule restricting the election of individuals without a higher legal education
for the position of chairman or secretary of the Central Election Commission was excluded, which
resulted in the expansion of the circle of people able to qualify for the above-mentioned positions;
the procedure for production and issue of detachable certificates of voting right was regulated at
the legislative level: now detachable certificates are not issued to voters wishing to vote in another
election area or at another election center in the limits of one population center; the status and
powers of local observers and those from foreign countries or international organizations as well
as powers of trustees are determined. Thus the guaranteed observance of internationally recognized
observer rights is ensured, including the right to be present at all stages of election process, to
receive from the election committee information on the progress of the election campaign, to meet
with all participants in the election process, to have access to all election centers during the voting
and counting of votes, to observe the transfer of protocols on election results to higher election

4

committees, to inform members of election commissions about their observations and violations
revealed, to make recommendations and to make public statements after the announcement of
election results.

The Central Election Commission interacts with the Office for Democratic Institutes and
Human Rights of OSCE (further referred to as “ODIHR/OSCE”) with regard to the improvement
of the election legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan. It discussed with ODIHR/OSCE the
recommendations on improvement of the election legislation as set out in four documents: 1)
The ODIHR/OSCE evaluation regarding the Constitutional Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan
“On Elections in the Republic of Kazakhstan” (August 24, 2004); 2) The ODIHR/OSCE Mission
report regarding the observations of the elections of the Majilis of Parliament of the Republic
of Kazakhstan on September, 19 and October 3, 2004; 3) The final report of the ODIHR/OSCE
Mission regarding the observations of presidential elections in the Republic of Kazakhstan on
December 4, 2005; 4) The final report of the ODIHR/OSCE Mission regarding the observations of
special elections of Parliament on August 18, 2007.

In 2006, two round tables were held with participation of all interested parties including
representatives of international organizations. Three consultations with ODIHR/OSCE experts
were also held. The above-mentioned amendments and additions to the Election Law were the
practical implementation of the ODIHR/OSCE recommendations. A series of ODIHR/OSCE
recommendations were implemented at the level of Central Election Commission regulations;
for instance, the informing of observers of a recount votes and providing them the opportunity
to watch the recount (Enactment of the Central Election Commission dated August 2, 2007, No.
103/218).

Some ODIHR/OSCE recommendations are unacceptable, since they can lead to the worsening
of the situation of election participants. In particular, this is the ODIHR/OSCE recommendation to
reduce the 10-day period of appeal against actions (inaction) and decisions of election committees
as stipulated by the Election Law. Considering the long distances in the country and related
difficulties in rapid collection of all original documents needed for appeal, the experts of the
Central Election Commission have convinced ODIHR/OSCE experts that the above-mentioned
10-day period was optimal and has proved that judicial recourse and other appeal actions could be
taken during any day during this period.

In 2008, with a view to the preparation of a set of recommendations on amendments and
additions to the Election Law, a special work group was created by the Decree of the Chairman of
the Central Election Commission. It included deputies of both Chambers of Parliament, as well as
representatives of state authorities, political parties and nongovernmental organizations. The work
group has collected and systematized the suggestions of all interested parties and these were sent
to ODIHR/OSCE in June 2008.

Issues regarding the reformation of election legislation were discussed in the course of two
round tables organized by the Central Election Commission together with ODIHR/OSCE. The first
round table on the theme “Participants in the Election Process: Their Problems and Opportunities”
was held on March 28, 2008 and the second round table on the theme “Election Technologies and
Procedures” was held on June 13, 2008. In March, June and October 2008, consultation meetings
with ODIHR/OSCE experts and the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities took
place.

On the basis of the prepared suggestions for the improvement of election legislation, the
Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan developed the draft law “On the Introduction
of Amendments and Additions to Constitutional Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Election
in the Republic of Kazakhstan” which on November 14, 2008 the Government submitted to the
Majilis of Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In January 2009, the draft law was ratified by
the Parliament and in February, the Head of State signed the Law.

The Law ensures the legal mechanism allowing the formation of Parliament with the

involvement of not less than two parties even if the second party does not pass the 7% barrier.

49

Moreover, the Law ensures the restriction of people guilty of corruption crimes or violations to
stand as a presidential contender, deputy of Parliament or Maslikhat, or as a member of any other
local authority.

With a view of the provision of equal opportunities in elucidation of election activities of all
political parties, Paragraph 7 of Article 27 of the Law was added, with the second part ensuring
the equal size of printing pages and amount of telecasting time in the course of dissemination of
information about the activities regarding the nomination and registration of candidates and party
lists in mass media.

The Law regulates the deadline of elections of deputies of the Maslikhat instead of former
deputies. It empowers the Central Election Commission to interpret election legislation and
produce the detachable certificates of voting rights. It regulated the operation of regional election
committees. During the period of preparation and holding of elections it improves the material
provision of election committee members who are not governmental officials. It ensures the
reimbursement from the state budget of costs for the services of specialists to maintain the operation
of the electronic election system.

Paragraph 4 of Article 28 of the Law was amended to ensure equal and uniform conditions for
the provision of facilities for voter meetings as well as publication of the voter meeting schedule
in mass media.

From Paragraph 2 of the fourth part of Article 20-2 of the Law, the rule was excluded which
stipulated that people not having experience in election observation are not accredited observers of
international organizations and foreign states. Thus, the opportunities to participate in international
election observation were expanded.

In whole, it is worth noting that the process of improvement of election legislation is not

limited to the above and is being implemented continuously.

. Implementation of International Standards in Election Legislation
of the Republic of Kazakhstan

The implementation of standards of OSCE international acts into the election legislation and
practice of Kazakhstan is being accomplished by means of their inclusion into the standards of
elective legislation of Kazakhstan. Thus, Paragraph 7 of the OSCE Copenhagen Document of
1990 regarding the necessity of free elections with reasonable frequency was expressed in Article
2 of the Election Law “Freedom of Elections”, in Article 51 “Regular Elections of the President
of the Republic”, in Articles 69 and 85 (regarding regular elections of the Senate and Majilis of
Parliament correspondingly) and in Article 101 “Timing of Elections of Deputies of Maslikhats”.
Paragraph 7.6 of the same Copenhagen document regarding the necessity of creation of conditions
needed for legal guaranties for participants of the election process, which would allow “them to
compete with each other on the basis of equality to the law and authority”, corresponds to Article
27 of Kazakhstan’s election law which states that election campaigns are held, in particular, by
means of the conducting of “public election debates and discussions, assemblies, processions and
demonstrations”.

A second element ensuring the implementation of standards of international agreements in
the field of the election legislation of Kazakhstan is the realization of relevant recommendations
of ODIHR/OSCE missions regarding the elections in Kazakhstan. The ODIHR/OSCE has studied
the election legislation of Kazakhstan on an expert level with regard to its accordance to OSCE
international obligations, the findings of which were expressed in the document “ODIHR/OSCE
Evaluation of the Constitutional Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Elections in the Republic
of Kazakhstan” (August 24, 2004).

A noteworthy element of the mechanism by means of which conditions for the implementation
of the standards of international agreements and acts into the election legislation and practice
of Kazakhstan are created, is the conferences and seminars on issues of the human dimension
annually arranged by the OSCE and its structures.

0

Another element of the mechanism for implementation of the standards of international
covenants (agreements) on election matters is the enactment of the legislative act regulating the
procedure for their application. Thus, on June 7, 2007, the Law was approved that ratified the CIS
Convention on Standards of Democratic Elections of October 7, 2002. Since June 7, 2007, this
law obliged competent governmental authorities of the Republic to begin the implementation of
international standards into domestic legislation and law-enforcement practices of the Republic of
Kazakhstan. In the case of contradictions between the standards of Kazakhstan’s national election
legislation and the given Convention, unconditional priority will be given to the norms of the
Convention.

Among the elements of the mechanism for implementation of the standards of the international
agreements into the election legislation and practice of Kazakhstan is the use of special references
to international agreements (acts) in order to direct competent governmental authorities towards the
application of corresponding international agreements. A reference to the international agreement
(act) takes place when a legislator in Kazakhstan gives priority to the application of the international
agreement (convention) in case of a contradiction during the course of settlement of a legal issue.
In addition, it is worth noting that the election legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan in
whole conforms to fundamental international documents regulating the procedure for conducting
elections and referendums. Along with this, Kazakhstan needs to further improve its election
legislation in harmony with the international standards established by the UN and OSCE.

***
As a result of ratification of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights by the Republic of Kazakhstan, citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan have the
opportunity to appeal to the UN Human Rights Commission regarding the violation of civil and
political rights. In this regard, the Republic of Kazakhstan needs to take measures to improve the
available mechanisms of human rights protection in order to prevent the large flow of complaints
to this international remedial institution and thus to actually settle the claims and complaints of the
citizens inside the country.

First of all, it is necessary to give attention to the improvement of the Law of the Republic of
Kazakhstan of January 12, 2007 “On the Procedure for Claims of Individual and Legal Persons”
as well as to the raising of the efficiency of investigation of citizens’ claims by judicial and local
executive authorities. In this regard, it would be advisable to carry out a legal examination of the
laws regarding authorities of the interior, advocacy, judicial system and status of judges, as well as
of other laws related to investigation of claims and complaints during elections.

In connection with the above-stated, we recommend that the Central Election Commission
of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the
period of 2009-20 implement the following measures:

. Continue the work on further improvement of election legislation in harmony with

international standards established by the UN and OSCE.

2. Considering the fact that one’s rights to free and fair elections depends on the observance
of many other civil and political rights, introduce changes to legislation regarding mass media,
political parties and public unions and peaceful assemblies (mass-meetings, processions, marches)
with the goal of bringing it into conformity to international standards and OSCE responsibilities.
3. Ensure the involvement of representatives of all political parties registered in the established
order in the activity of election committees, which involvement should not depend on the political
composition of the Maslikhats which elect committees members but should be based on the
mechanism ensuring the objective participation of all political forces in the activity of election
committees.

4. Legislatively ensure the transparency of voter listings.
5. Legislatively establish public control of the electronic voting system at the stage of counting
of votes and at the stage of making protocols on the results of the vote count at the election center.

Human Rights in the Sphere of Labor Relations -
The Right to Social Security

As a result of consistent state policy in the Republic of Kazakhstan in the field of remuneration
of labor, a legal basis was established which allows organizations basing their legal form on the
conditions of a market economy to settle matters of remuneration of labor in the course of social
dialogue by means of collective agreements and branch agreements.

As is well known, the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan establishes the minimum
wage, lesser than which employers have no right to pay citizens. The principle of the contractual
regulation of salary was introduced to control relations between employees, employers and trade
unions by means of collective agreements and contracts in the conditions of a market economy.
The salaries of employees of state organizations are controlled.

Thus, by annually estimating the level of the minimum wage and increasing the salary of
employees of state organizations, the Republic reaches its economic potential, since uncontrolled
increase can be incommensurable with the capacities of the state budget. At the same time, to settle
the issue of the determination of the minimum wage, the Government takes certain steps. Annual
increase of the minimum wage surpasses corresponding inflation growth.

In addition, presently, the minimum wage is based on the minimal subsistence level.
According to data from the Statistical Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan the number of
employees who in 2008 received a salary comparable to the minimum wage was 1,5 % (40,520
people) of the total number of employees in the country.

The Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan incrementally increases the salary of employees
of the state organizations with the simultaneous improvement of the labor remuneration system.
Thus, the salary of employees of state organizations (excluding government employees) during the
period of 1998 through 2008 increased from 6,851 tenge to 35,253 tenge, or by 5.1 times.

However, despite measures taken to increase the salary of employees of state organizations,

the level of their salaries remains low in comparison with the average level in the Republic.

In the mid-term period, in compliance with the Message of the Head of State to the People of
Kazakhstan on February 6, 2008, the salary of employees of state organizations will be doubled by
the year 2012 in comparison with the year 2008.

In 2009, the salaries of employees of state organizations were already increased by 25%
(Enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan of December 24, 2008, No. 1257).
Currently, a work group involving representatives of trade unions and central state authorities is
working under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection. This group jointly with JSC “National
Analytical Center Under the Government and National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan” is
working to improve the labor remuneration system for employees of state organizations.

Based on their work, the development of a three-tiered system of labor remuneration is

suggested, ensuring:

1) Distribution of civil employees into managerial, main and auxiliary levels in accordance

with their functions and level of responsibility, with a corresponding amount of official salary;

2) Optimization of the system of additional payments and bonuses considering the specifics of

the branch;

3) The third component is the proposed introduction of compensation payments to reduce

regional differences in standard of living.

The issue raised by the Trade Union Federation of the Republic of Kazakhstan (TUFRK)
regarding the replacement of the base official salary (BOS) used for the calculation of salaries of
employees of the state organizations with the minimum wage (MW) is also under consideration by
the work group of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection.

According to data from TUFRK, labor legislation is being violated in the Republic, adequate
labor conditions and protection are far from being provided, employee discrimination is allowed,

2

especially against women and youth and an imperfect and unfair system of labor remuneration
divides society into the poor and the rich.

The most important part the activity of trade unions are issues regarding salary, which vary in

different branches and regions.

Thus, in November 2008, the average monthly nominal salary in the Republic reached the
level of 59,575 tenge; however, however, the average in the agricultural sector amounted only to
46.3 percent of the national average; in health care organizations – 41.2 percent and in educational
organizations – 42.7 percent.

At the same time, the average salary of an employee in the financial sphere in November
2008 amounted to 127,000 tenge, in the mining industry – 107,500 tenge, in the transport and
communication industries – 80,400 tenge and in the construction industry – 82,600 tenge – that is
1.4-2 times more than the average national level.

In a regional cross-section there are also significant differences: in the Zhambyl, Northern
Kazakhstan and Southern Kazakhstan regions the average salary in October 2008 amounted to
a little bit more than 40,000 tenge, while at the same time in the Atyrau and Mangistau regions
– 114,000 and nearly 98,000 tenge correspondingly.

In the opinion of the Trade Union Federation, the Republic of Kazakhstan needs to take
legislative measures to eliminate unfair disproportion in the field of labor remuneration of
employees of various categories, to ensure a fitting salary for employees in the fields of education,
health care, culture and agriculture. Considering the economic growth of the regions and increased
opportunities for businesses and organizations, it is necessary to reform the labor remuneration
system. Correspondingly, the salary should be indexed quarterly according to the growth of prices
for goods and services.

Taking into account that the Constitution declares that Kazakhstan is a social state, in 2007
the Trade Union Federation has developed suggestions on a formula for the determination of
the National Standard of Living. These were sent to the Government, the Parliament and NDP
“Nur Otan”. The President of the Republic of Kazakhstan commissioned the Administration of
the President to review and evaluate the reasonableness of the suggestions of the Trade Union
Federation.

For this formula, the trade unions stress labor remuneration, pension security, the consumer
basket, standards of medical and educational services, family social support, the provision of
housing and the provision of utility services.

First of all, they have in mind the determination of an approach to the establishment of a
minimal subsistence level as the main basis for calculation of the minimum wage and other social
payments.

Presently, state authorities are considering the suggestions on the National Standard of Living,
taking into account the requirements of the Trade Union Federation of the Republic of Kazakhstan
(further referred to as “TUFRK”).

Based on a study of the practical experience of CIS countries in the field of improvement
of methodology for establishment of a minimal subsistence level, TUFRK has suggested that
the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan calculate the minimal subsistence level with due
consideration to the zoning (regionalization) of the country in regards to the living conditions of
the population.

In addition, TUFRK demands the re-calculation of the consumer basket based on the actual

needs of the population.

It is necessary to increase the minimum wage guaranteed by legislation to a higher social
indicator – the minimal consumption budget and the poverty limit should be determined at the
level of minimal subsistence.

The Head of State has offered new parameters in social policy – by means of doubling the
gross domestic product (GDP), to double the social expenditures of the State and eventually double
the standard of living. However, the labor situation in whole reveals the unfair distribution of its
results.



In Kazakhstan, the proportion of labor remuneration (even with “shady” payments) amounts
to only 31.2% of the GDP, while in European Union countries it remains 50-56%. Therefore,
TUFRK thinks it is necessary to increase proportion of salary to the gross domestic product.

To implement the task of determination of the National Standard of Living, we recommend
that the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan ensure the following primary measures
in the years 2009-202:

Jointly with social partners, develop and approve the Concept of Principles of Social Policy
in the Republic of Kazakhstan in order to determine the direction of forthcoming work and
the rights and duties of agents of social policy regulation – state authorities, local authorities,
entrepreneurs, business and public associations;

Develop and approve the new Laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan: “On the Minimum Wage”

and “On Employers”;

Ratify the International Labor Organization Convention No.131 “Minimum Wage Fixing
Convention”, No.95 “Protection of Wages Convention”, No.26 “Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery
Convention” and No.103 “Maternity Protection Convention”;

Ratify the International Labor Organization Convention No.102 “Social Security (Minimum
Standards) Convention” in order to increase pension payments and on the basis of its provisions,
to correspondingly amend the Law “On Pension Security”;

Establish in the Republic a special state office that would regulate prices since this function is
not included in the powers of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Regulation of Natural
Monopolies and Protection of Competition. Since there is no clear policy on regulation of prices
in the Republic, the prices for goods of the first necessity keep on growing and the tariffs for utility
and other services keep increasing.

***
In the Republic of Kazakhstan, there has long been a need to revise the employment policy
with regard to categories such as “self-employed”. According to official data, the number of self-
employed is 34.7%. The majority of these are women who are not paid for leave for pregnancy and
birth, sick days, annual vacations, or pension installments and who do not come under compulsory
social insurance for damage to their health.

Another concern is the sum of employees’ salary debts, in view of which the social tension in
labor collectives is increasing. In March 1, 2009, overdue salary debt amounted to nearly 2 billion
tenge. The largest debts owed to employees belong to companies of the mining, processing and
construction industries, by region – Eastern Kazakhstan, Karaganda and Zhambyl.

According to records for the year 2008, state labor inspectors have revealed 6,008 violations
of salary payment periods. In regards to the individuals who committed these violations, 3,216
written warnings were issued and 2,212 administrative fines were imposed to the sum of more than
73.5 million tenge.

The main reasons for unpaid salary violations are the impact of the world economic crisis on
the country’s economy, the reduction of production and the shutdown of companies, especially in
the construction sector.

In addition, more than 13,000 companies and organizations in the Republic owe payments to

pension funds.

As a result of inspections held in 2008, state labor inspectors revealed 649 instances of the
unwarranted dismissal of employees. With regard to violations committed, 208 written warnings
were issued and 154 administrative fines were imposed to the sum of more than 2 million tenge.

The review of violations related to the unwarranted dismissal of employees shows that
employers violate laws due to lack of knowledge of labor legislation or its incorrect application,
the negligence of responsible employees to their functions, or inefficient organization of labor.

There have been instances of discrimination against employees in the course of labor relations.
Lack of individual standards in the Labor Code prohibiting the discrimination against citizens

4

with regard to their right to labor remuneration, does not allow state labor inspectors to implement
preventive punishment. Consequently, the people of Kazakhstan, working in their homeland, are
discriminated against by foreign employers and work in unequal and more restricting conditions
than foreigners.

Up to the present, foreign employers pay foreign employees salaries that dozens of times
exceed the salaries of specialists from Kazakhstan fulfilling the same work and having the same
qualifications.

For instance, in “Petro Kazakhstan Kumkol Resources JSC” last year the income of their
foreign expert including salary and lump sum traveling costs amounted to 0 million tenge,
while during the same period, the income of the expert from Kazakhstan fulfilling the same work
amounted to 2.2 million tenge.

According to the labor agreement of “SNPS-Ai Dan Munai JSC”, Chinese specialists in the
Republic of Kazakhstan are provided with an annual paid leave 90 calendar days long not counting
travel time, while employees from Kazakhstan are given leave 24 calendar days long, additional
paid leave 9 calendar days long for residence in environmentally unfriendly regions and 6 calendar
days for work in hazardous (especially hazardous) and (or) in dangerous working conditions.
In this company, the salary of foreign specialists amounts to 351,200 tenge, while the salary of
Kazakh employees in the same positions amounts to 82,400 tenge. As a result, the difference in
labor remuneration is more than four times. Discrimination in labor remuneration between foreign
and domestic specialists is noted almost in all other companies.

Similar instances of discrimination are not unique and are revealed in foreign companies in the

city of Almaty and in the Aktyube, Atyrau, Western Kazakhstan and Mangistau regions.

A review of the causes and conditions for such violations showed that despite the prohibition
of discrimination for any reason, stipulated by Articles 14 and 24 of the Constitution of the
Republic of Kazakhstan, the Labor Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan does not directly prohibit
discrimination against employees with regard to labor remuneration.

However, these provisions are stipulated in the international agreements that are ratified not
only by the Republic of Kazakhstan but also by the countries whose companies carry out their
activity in our country.

Thus, according to Article 1 of the International Labor Organization Convention No.
111 “Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention” (further referred to as “the
Convention”), discrimination is defined as any difference, exclusion or preference made on the
basis of foreign origin, resulting in elimination or violation of equality of opportunities or treatment
in the field of labor and occupations.

In addition, Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
determines that the countries participating in the Covenant acknowledge the right of each person
to fair and favorable working conditions, including a fair wage and equal remuneration for work
of equal value without any differentiation.

It should be noted that, in harmony with Paragraph 2 of Article 1 of the Convention, any
difference, exclusion, or preference with regard to certain work based on specific requirements is
not considered discrimination.

In this connection, the above-mentioned problematic issues relate only to employees with the

same qualifications and fulfilling the same work.

It should be noted that such social inequality causes an environment of conflict that can develop
into mass and uncontrolled encounters at the international level and can destabilize the social and
political situation both in individual regions and in the whole Republic.

The Labor Code of RK has established a legal framework in the field of labor protection. In
the opinion of trade unions, the public inspector for labor protection is the most objective and
most popular link in public control of labor safety and protection in the organizations. The public
inspector for labor protection working continuously among the employees of his department
affects the attitudes of employees towards the issue of labor safety and protection like no one else.



The life, health and work capability of employees depend on his competence in the field of labor
safety and protection and on his active work. Meanwhile, according to data from the Emergency
Ministry, in 2008 more than 216,000 violations of safety rules and standards occurred in industrial
companies of Kazakhstan. According to their statistics, out of ten months of the year 2008, the
total number of industrial accidents reported in the Republic of Kazakhstan amounted to 1990. The
number of fatal accidents during these ten months of the year 2008 was 327.

In 2006, jointly with the International Labor Organization, the National Program of Decent
Work was developed and approved for the years 2007-2009 in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The goal
of the Program is the promotion of decent work as the main component of development strategy
as well as the state policy maintained by the government and its social partners. It is necessary
to take additional measures to improve the efficiency of labor protection specialists including
the enhancement of the training system and the implementation of a systematical approach to
labor protection in small companies. It is necessary to pay special attention to the adjustment of
management systems to international standards.

***
The citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan have the Constitutional right to a minimum pension

and social security in old age, sickness, disability, or loss of breadwinner.

Foreigners and individuals without citizenship continually living in the Republic of Kazakhstan
have the right to pension payments from the Center and government social benefits on the same
level as the citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

Since January 1, 2007, pensions and benefit payments are paid out on the principle “month to

month”.

Starting from the year 2006, the uniform base social indicator for calculation of the state base

social benefit payment is the minimal subsistence level.

Along with an annual increase of the minimal subsistence level, the state basic social benefit
payments for disability, loss of breadwinner, or old age are incremental. Since January 1, 2009,
due to the increase of the minimal subsistence level from 12,025 tenge to 13,470 tenge, the amount
of the state social benefit (SSB) was increased on an average of 12 %. In the framework of the
Message of the Head of State on February 6, 2008, a 9% average annual increase of the SSB is
ensured with a view toward the further enhancement of the standard of living of the population.

In the Republic of Kazakhstan there is a multilevel system of pension security.
The introduction of the base pension payment in 2005, being the first (base) level, became the

most important step to increase the income of elderly people.

Since 2008, its amount was established at 40% of the minimal subsistence level and it is

proposed to retain this ratio until the year 2011.

Beginning in the year 2011, the amount of the base pension payment will be increased to 50%

of the minimal subsistence level with subsequent incremental increases to 75%.

The second (compulsory) level of the pension security system is pensions paid from the
solidarity system provided that individuals have a work record before January 1, 1998 (state
budget) and from accumulation pension funds due to compulsory pension contributions.

More than 1.6 million pensioners are provided with pensions from the solidarity system, which

is financed from the State budget.

Pension payments are increased annually according to the inflation level and, beginning in the

year 2005, the indexing was done in advance of the Consumer Price Index.

Since January 1, 2009, pension payments were increased by 30% for all recipients of pensions,
taking into account the limitation of 75% of 28 times the monthly calculation indicator, but not less
than by 22%. Because of this, the income restriction used for calculation of pension payments was
raised from 25 times to 28 times the monthly calculation indicator (from 29,200 tenge to 35,644
tenge).



As a result there was an increase:
- Of 30 % - for more than 1332,800 pensioners;
- Of 22 % - for more than 1,500 pensioners;
- Of 30% with account to restriction of 26,733 tenge, but not less than by 22% - for more than

251,200 pensioners.

On the average, this allowed the increase of the average amount of pension payments by

25%.

During the last 9 years (2000-2009):
- The minimum pension payment with due account for the base pension payment was increased

by 4.4 times (from 3,500 to 15,263 tenge);

- The average pension payment with due account for the base pension payment was increased

by 5 times (from 4,462 to 22,493 tenge);

- The maximum pension payment was increased by 4 times (from 8,156 to 32,121 tenge).
The third (supplemental) level is pensions from voluntary individual and voluntary employer

pension contributions.

The increase of pensions and state social benefit payments will be continued as well as the

incremental increase of base pension payments.

Considering the fact that the accumulation pension system has existed during a relatively short
period of time (by estimate, the optimal period of pension contribution allocation is over 40 years),
the amount of pension payments from the accumulation pension funds are small.

With a view toward the implementation of the Message of the Head of State to the people
of Kazakhstan “New Kazakhstan in the New World”, since January 2008, compulsory social
insurance of pregnancy, birth and maternity for employed women has been introduced.

In case of loss of income due to pregnancy and birth, employed women receive a social benefit
payment from the State Social Insurance Fund at the rate of the average monthly salary for all
the days of their maternity leave as well as the social benefit payment for child care up to the age
of one year in the amount of 40% of the average monthly income, provided that social benefit
payments were allocated to the State Social Insurance Fund timely and fully.

If, previously, women were excluded from the accumulation pension system during their
maternity and child care leave, upon the implementation of compulsory social insurance of
pregnancy, birth and maternity, 10% of obligatory social payments are deducted as compulsory
pension contributions and are transferred to the accumulation pension funds.

the age of one year continue to
Thus, women during maternity leave and child care leave until the age of one year continue to

accumulate their pension.

solidarity pensions and of the base social payment as well as the incremental
The increase of solidarity pensions and of the base social payment as well as the incremental

increase of the state base pension payment will be continued.

The situation in the field of social relations as described above causes us to recommend
that the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Ministry of Labor and Social
Protection of the Population of the Republic of Kazakhstan develop and approve the follow-
ing legislative acts during the years 2009-20:

1) “On Amendments and Additions to Some Legislative Documents of the Republic of Ka-
zakhstan with Regard to Social Security of Certain Categories of Citizens” (directed at the imple-
mentation of the Message of the Head of State to the people of Kazakhstan of 2008, time of execu-
tion – the year 2009);

2) “On Amendments and Additions to Some Legislative Documents with Regard to Migra-

tion” (time of execution – fourth quarter of 2009);

3) To improve the Labor Code, to make additions with regard to any kind of discrimination
regarding labor remuneration of employees in foreign companies regardless of their nationality
and citizenship.

4) In 2011, to ratify the International Labor Organization Convention No. 128 Concerning

Invalidity, Old Age and Survivors’ Benefits (Geneva, June 29, 1967).

7

5) Take measures to toughen state control of compliance with labor legislation in companies
with foreign shares; for every uncovered fact to take legislative measures to ensure the protection
of the internal labor market against illegal migration and the ungrounded import of labor force into
the Republic.

6) In 2010, develop and ratify the Law of RK “On Collective Agreements”.

The Right to Protection of Health and Medical Assistance

The Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan ensures the right of citizens to the protection
of health, to guaranteed free medical assistance and paid medical care established by the law and
to medical assistance from state and private health care institutions as well as from private medical
practitioners for which they pay.

The health of the population is the most important factor that ensures the national safety of
the Republic. The main principle and objective of State policy in the field of health care is the
observance of the constitutional rights of the citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan to health
protection, obtainment of quality medical services and provision of State guarantees.

The Head of State and the Government pay special attention to these issues considering them
as national priorities; therefore, the improvement of the population’s health condition and further
development in the field of health care is thought to be the compulsory condition for Kazakhstan
to be numbered among the competitive countries of the world.

Currently, the development of health care is entering the stage of institutional reforms,
development of the potential of personnel and security of quality medical services. Preventive
health care and formation of a healthy life-style have become priority, which is expressed in the
Message of the Head of State to the People of Kazakhstan on February 6, 2008 “Enhancement of
the Welfare of Citizens of Kazakhstan – the Main Objective of State Policy”.

Improvement of citizens’ health implies such goals as the improvement of the health of mother
and child, the reduction of the burden of socially significant illnesses and injury, the security
of sanitary and epidemiological welfare and the cultivation of a healthy life-style and correct
nutrition.

During the last three years, the birth rate in Kazakhstan has increased by 13%, the total mortality

rate has stabilized and therefore the rate of natural increase of the population is 1.6 times greater.

Along with the implementation of the Program for Reduction of Maternal and Child Mortality,
logistical support of organizations for children and obstetrics and their equipment with updated
instrumentation (mainly diagnostic and rehabilitative) keeps on improving; the ratio of recovery
of sick children detected in the course of preventive inspections is being increased; and pregnant
women, sick children and people registered at health centers according to the approved list of
illnesses are provided with free medications. There is a trend toward reduction of maternity
mortality rate.

Socially significant illnesses result in great economic loss and reduction of life expectancy.
During the last three years, there was a reduction of the illness rate (by 11%) and the tuberculosis
mortality rate (by 19%); however, there is a need of further logistical support and intensification
of activities related to compulsory treatment and isolation of sick ones with resistant forms of
tuberculosis.

According to WHO, Kazakhstan is at the concentrated stage of the HIV/AIDS epidemic –
0.2% of population compared to the world average of 1.1%. With the purpose of stabilization of
HIV-infection distribution, the implementation of the Program for Counteraction of AIDS will be
continued which will ensure the expansion of preventive activities.

Mortality due to injuries, accidents and poisoning is second ranked of the reasons for mortality
of the population in the Republic of Kazakhstan. It is necessary to intensify the coordination of the



operation of transport and communication services in regard to traffic safety issues as well as to
enhance labor safety protection at the work place.

The stabilization of the sanitary and epidemiological situation and the improvement of public
health remains the essential task. With the purpose of the improvement of the drinking water
supply to guaranteed quality in compliance with the State Program “Drinking Water”, measures
for the modernization and installation of upgraded laboratory equipment are being implemented
at existing laboratories of the sanitary and epidemiological offices, which fulfill laboratory control
of drinking water.

During the last three years, the amount of medication being sold on Kazakhstan’s market has
almost doubled. In spite of this, the availability and quality of medication still remain a problem.
With the objective of the improvement of the medication supply to the population, a uniform
medication distribution system will be created and the system of outpatient medication supply will
be improved.

Every year, the deficit of health care personnel tends to grow, especially in rural localities. In
harmony with the commission of the Head of State, a work group for the development of suggestions
with regard to the assignment of medical personnel to rural localities and to the determination of
social services for young specialists has been created under the Government of the Republic of
Kazakhstan. The number of students admitted to medical universities will be raised.

In order to improve the quality of medical and pharmacological education in the Republic,
measures for the implementation of the Concept of Reformation of Medical and Pharmacological
education in the Republic of Kazakhstan approved by the Enactment of the Government of the
Republic of Kazakhstan on April 24, 2006, No. 317 are being taken. The construction of university
clinics for four medical universities is planned in order to enhance the quality of clinical practice.
The low level of salary of medical employees affects the quality of services rendered. To solve
this problem, the list of specialties where the salary increase ratio will be raised for psychological
and physical stress is expanded. In addition, effective motivation and stimulation mechanisms
including the improvement of labor remuneration for medical employees will be introduced.

The National Medical Holding, based on a medical cluster of 6 modern clinics founded in
Astana, will become a scientific and practical base for highly specialized assistance and a center
for the training and retraining of medical personnel that meets world standards.

World experience shows that in order to improve the quality of medical services, in addition
to training qualified personnel, it is necessary to develop the private sector of health care and to
stimulate the competitiveness of medical services. In this regard, it is necessary to secure the right
of citizens to the free choice of doctor.

The right to health protection is stipulated by Article 29 of the Constitution of the Republic of
Kazakhstan and the obtainment of qualified medical assistance by the Law of RK of July 7, 2006
No. 170-III “On Health Protection of the Citizens”, by the State Program of Reformation and
Development of Health Care in the Republic of Kazakhstan during the years 2005-2010, ratified
by the Order of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan on September 13, 2004 No.1438, by
the Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Health Protection of the Republic of Kazakhstan during the
years 2009-2011, ratified by the Enactment of the Government of RK on December 23, 2008 No.
1213 and by the List of Guaranteed Free Medical Assistance during the years 2008-2009, ratified
by the Enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan on September 28, 2007 No.
853.

With the purpose of implementation of the commission of the Head of State and establishment
of a uniform policy in the field of health protection and the improvement of the legislative base,
the Draft Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On the Health of People and the Health Care
System” was developed and submitted for the consideration of the Majilis of the Parliament of
the Republic of Kazakhstan. This Law will cover issues such as the rights and duties of patients
and medical employees, the responsibilities of health care agents and issues regarding medical
ethics and public health protection. In addition, health protection standards and plans for raising

9

the knowledge of the population and increasing the transparency of the health care system will be
developed; and memorandums between the ministry and Akimats will be concluded which will
serve as the basis for the implementation of strategical direction of state policy in the field of health
care protection.

Codification of legislation in the field of health care will allow the enhancement of the status
of medicine, the organization of the large quantity of legislative documents in the sphere of health
protection, the harmonization of them with international legislation, the improvement of the level
of medical services provided to the citizens and the changing of the public attitude towards health
care issues.

It should be noted that citizens of remote rural localities cannot obtain highly qualified medical
assistance. This fact restricts the right of citizens to the receipt of accessible qualified medical
care.

On the basis of the above-stated, we recommend that the Government of the Republic of
Kazakhstan and the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan implement the following measures
during the years 2009-2011:

1. Accelerate the adoption of the Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On the Health of

People and the Health Care System”.

2. Implement the programs recommended by WHO for the improvement of medical assistance

to women and children.

3. Establish departments (hospitals) for nursing the terminally ill.
4. Improve the training of medical personnel with regard to medical assistance in accordance

with advanced foreign experience.

5. Train and retrain managerial personnel in the field of health protection concerning

management, resource management and financing.

6. Develop and implement a procedural base in the field of safety and protection of rights of

the patient.

7. Improve the system of labor remuneration of medical employees with the purpose of
improvement of material welfare and motivation. Low labor remuneration of medical employees
has resulted in common lack of personnel at the primary level – children’s treatment and ambulatory
institutions as well as in rural localities. To attract personnel to work in rural localities and remote
regions, it is necessary to revise the system of benefits and incentives for specialists.

8. Assess the activity of all levels of antituberculosis services, to implement a system of strict
epidemiological control of treatment of people having tuberculosis and to toughen the quality
requirements of purchased antituberculosis medications.

9. Ensure the establishment and improvement of a modern food safety control system including

effective control as to genetically modified sources of food imported from abroad.

10. Ensure the adequate control of implementation of activities in the framework of the
Republican Program “For Counteraction of the AIDS Epidemic in the Republic of Kazakhstan
During 2006-2010”.

11. Implement a new pattern of medication supply to the population at outpatient clinics with

the use of fixed prices for medications.

12. Ensure the quality and competitiveness of state medical institutions as well as scientific

research in the field of health protection.

13. Develop and adopt a standard and a legal document on donation and transplantation of

human organs and tissues.

14. Take measures for the implementation of Article 44 of the Law of the Republic of
Kazakhstan of May 19, 1997 “On Health Protection in the Republic of Kazakhstan” to ensure the
rights of the citizens to the free choice of medical organization as well of doctor. In this regard,
it is necessary to amend the decree of acting Minister of Health Protection of the Republic of
Kazakhstan of December 15, 2004 No. 874 “On Approval of Rules of Ambulatory and Clinical
Assistance”.

Rights of Persons with Disabilities

The security of the basic rights of the persons with disabilities and the creation of equal

opportunities for public life is one of the functions of the social state.

The relevance of this issue is related not only to the great number of disabled individuals in the
country, but also to significant changes in interpretation of disability and new approaches to the
arrangement of the social protection of persons with disabilities.

According to international standards, disability implies not only functional inadequacy and
limitation of opportunities, but is characterized by failure to interact with the environment and public
conditions. It hinders the human in the fulfillment of his/her social role and causes discrepancy
between the actual capabilities of the human and those capabilities that could be expected at his/
her age under normal conditions with education, culture and professionalism available.

This approach to the interpretation of disability allows the determination of activities and
methods which would compensate or replace for the disabled the lost vital activity and would
create an opportunity to exercise basic human rights.

According to data of January 1, 2009, the number of disabled people in the Republic of
Kazakhstan amounts to 466,300 people (or 3% of the total population), nearly 10% (43,100) of
which are children.

. Medical and Social Examination and Ascertainment of Disability

According to statistics from the year 2008, the frequency index of primary disability amounted
to 28.2 cases per 10,000 people, which is slightly higher in comparison to the preceding year, but
lower than in the years 2003-2006.

In a regional context, the level of primary disability remains high in the Karaganda (36.8 cases
per 10,000), Southern Kazakhstan (33.0), Akmola (32.7), Mangistau (31.9), Northern Kazakhstan
(31.9) and Western Kazakhstan (30.3) regions.

In extent of severity, disability of the first and second categories prevails - 23,500 people or 64
% of the disabled (in comparison to last year, an increase of 2%). There are 13,100 people (36% of
the disabled) who are in the third category.

By age, the average age of the disabled is decreasing. According to statistics from the year
2008, in the Republic 44,400 people received disability status and of these, 75.4% were people of
working age, 7.0% were elderly people and 17.5% were children.

As is well known, disability and its extent depend on a range of reasons – the health condition
of the nation, the level of development of health care and the availability of medical services, the
level of social and economic development and its priorities, historical and political reasons, etc.

There is an increasing trend of primary disability in children. In 2007, 7,300 children received

disability status, while in 2008 this number was 7,800 children.

As in preceding years, last year disability due to congenital defects was the largest reason
for disability in children (2,300 children, or 32.6%, received disability status according to this
pathology while in 2007, the quantity was 2,100 children, or 31.8%).

Primary disability due to congenital defect requires great attention in the cities of Almaty
(39.9% of the disabled) and Astana (38.7%) and in the regions of Akmola (36.4%), Karaganda
(35.7%) and Southern Kazakhstan (34.2%).

Illnesses of the nervous system are second – an average of 25.3% of the disabled (in 2007

– 24.4%). This percentage remains high in the Zhambyl (28.2%) and Kostanay (29.2%) regions.

The third largest reason for disability is mental disorders, – 11.8% of the disabled (in 2007 –
13.0%). This percentage remains high in the Kostanay (19.6%), Kyzylorda (20.0%) and Mangistau
(18.1%) regions.



Thus, the increasing trend of primary disability is related to the increase of major and
complicated forms of sickness such as diseases of the circulatory system, tuberculosis and cancer,
which accordingly lead to severe categories of disability. This is a result of the low quality of
clinical examinations, especially among chronically and frequently sick patients as well as a lack
of medical institutions for the rehabilitation of chronically ill patients and the disabled in some
regions.

To increase the efficiency of disability preventive measures, it is necessary to direct the
combined efforts of medical and social inspections and health care organizations at the prevention
and timely detection of originated defects (physical, mental, psychological and sensory), at not
allowing the defect to become a functional limitation (disability).

With the purpose of the elimination of administrative barriers in the course of disability
ascertainment and improvement of conditions for socially vulnerable groups of the population,
the Enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan of November 29, 2008 No. 1113
makes additions and amendments to the Rules of Conduction of Medical and Social Examinations
ratified by the Enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan of July 20, 2005
No. 750, with regard to the simplification of the procedure of medical and social examination of
individuals with anatomic defects as well as the extension of the list of anatomic defects from 27
to 44 paragraphs, in case of which the disability category is ascertained without a re-assessment
period. At the same time, the period needed for a territorial department to make an expert opinion is
reduced by half and the responsibility of medical organizations for quality and validity of referrals
to MSE (certificate 088/u) was intensified.

2. Efficiency Criteria of State Policy with Regard to Persons with Disabilities.
Legislative Base for Social Protection of Persons with Disabilities

The effectiveness of governmental policy with regard to disabled individuals is assessed by
a series of criteria: objectives, existence of social legislation, the opportunity to exercise civil
rights, availability of a system of benefits and compensation and accessibility to the physical and
information environments.

In Kazakhstan, governmental policy with regard to the disabled has a long history. A turning
point was the year 1991, when the Law of RK was adopted “On Social Protection of Disabled In-
dividuals in the Republic of Kazakhstan”. This Law declared that the first objective of governmental
policy was not to assist the disabled person, but “the creation of social, economic, legal and
organizational conditions for equal opportunities in the lives of disabled individuals”. In this way,
the Law declared an approach to the disabled individual applied by the world community.

However, the practical implementation of the new approach that was declared in the policy
failed. There was a discrepancy between the formally declared goals of the open society for the
disabled individuals and their real involvement in labor and public life due to the fact that society
(first of all, financial and economic) was not ready to take such an approach.

Actual conditions for this were established only by the middle of the current decade. In
2005, a new Law was adopted “On Social Protection of Disabled Individuals in the Republic of
Kazakhstan”, which declared that the objective of governmental policy was the prevention of
disability and the creation of conditions needed for integration of the disabled into society.

Along with this law, the legislative base of governmental policy with regard to the disabled
individuals includes the Laws of RK: “On State Social Benefits for Disability, Loss of Breadwinner
and Old Age in the Republic of Kazakhstan”, “On Special State Benefit Payments in the Republic
of Kazakhstan”, “On Social, Medical and Pedagogical Correction Support of Children with
Limitations”, “On Compulsory Civil Employer’s Liability Insurance for Life and Health Damage
of Employee in the course of Fulfillment of Labor (Service) Duties” and “On Special Social
Services”.

With a view toward the more effective realization of the rights of the disabled individuals,
on December 11, 2008 the Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 711 “On

2

Signing of the Convention on the Rights of Disabled Individuals and Optional Protocol to the
Convention on the Rights of Disabled Individuals” was adopted; this will promote the strengthening
of Kazakhstan’s position on the international scene, will prove the adherence of the government to
the implementation of international standards in the field of human rights and will create the legal
basis for the more effective realization of the rights of disabled individuals in our country.

To develop the suggestions on creation of conditions for participation of the Republic of
Kazakhstan in the UN Convention on the Rights of Disabled People and Optional Protocol to it,
a work group was established by the Decree of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan
on October 8, 2008 No. 251-P. Upon the completion of its work, the group sent the relevant
suggestions to the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

. System for the Social Protection of the Persons with Disabilities

The current system for the social protection of the persons with disabilities is comprehensive

and is based on state guarantees. It includes:

- A multilevel social security system (state social benefit payments, special state benefit

payments and lump sum social payments);

- Provision of technical auxiliary (compensatory) means (prosthetics and supply of orthopedic

prosthesis items, supply of devices and assistance to deaf and blind people);

- Provision of special social services (social services and rehabilitation in medical and social

institutions);

- Material support (target social assistance, housing assistance).
The levels of the state security system are:
The first level of guaranteed social protection is state benefit payments to disabled people (in
case of the loss of working ability, the base social payment is the state social benefit payment for
disability which is provided to certain categories of citizens regardless of their career record and
former salary, at the expense of the state budget);

The second level is compulsory social insurance paid at the expense of the employer to
the social insurance fund. (The main goal of the system of compulsory social insurance is the
compensation of the portion of income lost as a result of social risk. In this case, the amount
of social payment directly depends on the former income of the employee and the duration of
payments to the system.)

The third level is voluntary savings of the citizens, which in the future will be transformed into

social payments for employees who suffered in the course of fulfillment of service duties.

Social support of the disabled is provided in conformity with the Laws of RK “On the State Social
Benefit Payment for Disability, Loss of Breadwinner or Old Age in the Republic of Kazakhstan”
and “On Special State Benefit Payments in the Republic of Kazakhstan”. In accordance with these
laws, disabled individuals receive the state social allowance for disability (further referred to as
“SSA”) and especial state allowance instead of benefits (further referred to as “ESA”).

In harmony with the Message of the President to the People of Kazakhstan, the amount of the
state social allowance for disability starting from January 1, 2009 was increased in comparison
with the amount paid in July 1, 2008 by 12% and in comparison with January 1, 2008, by 28%.

In 2009, the total monthly payment for social allowances paid to the disabled on common

grounds (SSA and ESA) is:

For disabled people of the first category – 20,102 tenge;
Second category – 16,061 tenge;
Third category – 10,732 tenge;
For disabled children up to 16 years – 14,616 tenge and from 16 to 18 years – depending on

the disability category:

First category – 20.102 tenge;



Second category – 16,735 tenge;
Third category – 12,483 tenge.
Additional sources of income for the disabled who are participants in the system of compulsory
social insurance are social payments from “The State Fund of Social Insurance JSC” (further
referred to as “the Fund”).

The system of compulsory social insurance is financed due to transformation and personification
of a portion of the social tax. Payees of compulsory social tax payments are employers and self-
employed people.

The system of compulsory social insurance covers more and more of the population every
year: from 3.9 million people in 2005 to 5.5 million people in 2008. The number of recipients of
social payments from the Fund increased from 1,851 people in 2005 to 321,531 people in 2008.

4. Creation of Equal Opportunities and Security of Civil
and Political Rights of the Persons with Disabilities

The rights of the persons with disabilities established by the legislation of the Republic of
Kazakhstan correspond to the human rights, the international standards and include the rights to
social protection, medical assistance, education and labor, the right to marriage, upbringing of
children, right to judicial recourse as well as political rights.

Exercising civil and political rights by the persons with disabilities directly depends on

arrangement and results of rehabilitation process.

Upon the adoption of the Law “On Social Protection of the Disabled People in the Republic of
Kazakhstan”, a system model for rehabilitation of the disabled people was created which included
medical, social and vocational rehabilitation.

With a view of improvement of the rehabilitation system, intensification of social support and
enhancement of life quality of the disabled people, the Program of Rehabilitation of the Disabled
People during the years 2006-2008 was developed and implemented in the framework of which
the following measures were realized: disability prevention; improvement of medical and social
examination and development of new technologies for determination of limitation extent of the
citizens; development of social security to the disabled people and intensification of social support to
them, expansion of range of services for medical, social and vocational rehabilitation; development
of forms of employment of the disabled people; development of the network of rehabilitation
institutions, improvement of forms and methods of their activity, enhancement of the logistics;
increase of satisfaction of needs of the disabled people in technical auxiliary (compensatory)
means, orthopedic prosthesis items; creation of the conditions for unimpeded access for the disabled
people to facilities of social, transport and recreational infrastructure; improvement of personnel
in the field of medical and social examination, rehabilitation, arrangement of social service of the
disabled people and in rehabilitation industry.

4. Medical Rehabilitation

Medical rehabilitation includes restorative therapy (medication, physical therapy, treatments
in sanatoriums, or other methods of treatment) or reconstructive surgery. These methods are
implemented incrementally in the framework of inpatient, outpatient and sanatorium levels.
Special attention in this regard is given to specialized rehabilitation assistance in regional and
state rehabilitation centers, health centers, large clinics of scientific and research institutes and
sanatoriums.

A low level of medical rehabilitation is noted in the regions of Karaganda (74.3%), Mangis-

tau (83.5%) and Eastern Kazakhstan (85.2%) and in the city of Almaty (87.8%).

4

This is related to the insufficient number of inpatient, outpatient and clinical departments for
medical rehabilitation in regional (city) hospitals and disability rehabilitation centers, of which
there are only 10 in the Republic.

In case the desired effect is not reached at the stage of medical rehabilitation and the disabled
person still has limitations due to incomplete recovery of function, he needs social rehabilitation.

4.2 Social Rehabilitation

Social rehabilitation includes the teaching primary social skills to the disabled, social services
for the disabled at home or in medical or social institutions and the rendering of special social
services.

Disabled children are compensated for the costs of education at home. The quota for the
number of disabled educated in secondary and higher institutions is established on the basis of a
governmental order.

On the basis of need, the disabled are provided with orthopedic prostheses, special wheelchairs
and technical compensatory equipment. Disabled individuals with special needs are provided with
necessary hygienical substances, services of sign language interpreters and individual assistants.

Disabled people needing constant nursing are provided with social services in nursing homes

for the elderly and disabled, or in psychoneurological nursing homes.

102 state medical and social institutions are available in Kazakhstan (51 general nursing homes
for the elderly and disabled, 31 psychoneurological nursing homes, 3 nursing homes for disabled
children with impaired musculoskeletal systems and 17 children’s psychoneurological nursing
homes) in which more than 16,000 disabled and elderly people live.

In 2008, 1,073.9 million tenge were allocated from the state budget for the development of the
design and estimate documentation and start of construction of six medical and social institutions
in the Karaganda, Kyzylorda, Atyrau and Zhambyl regions.

However, the network of rehabilitation and social institutions does not satisfy the need of
the people for social services; and this is especially true of institutions for psychoneurological
patients.

There are 10 rehabilitation centers for social protection of the disabled (in the Almaty, Atyrau,

Zhambyl, Kostanay, Pavlodar, Northern Kazakhstan and Southern Kazakhstan regions).

The Enactment of the Government of RK “On Some Issues Regarding the Rehabilitation of
the Disabled” of July 20, 2005 No. 754 is planned to be amended and added to with the objective
of the utmost satisfaction of the needs of the disabled for technical compensatory equipment
and special wheelchairs meeting modern requirements, with a view toward the determination of
periods of their replacement and the medical indications and contraindications for the provision
of rehabilitation assistance to the disabled of hygienic items or the social services of individual
assistants or sign language interpreters.

In the framework of the Message of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan of March
1, 2006 “The Strategy for the Inclusion of Kazakhstan in the 50 Most Competitive Countries of
the World (Kazakhstan on the Verge of New Spurt in its Development)”, on December 29, 2008
the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Special Social Services” was adopted, directed at
the creation of conditions needed to overcome difficult situations in life, which Law provides the
strategical direction for the development of the system of special social services.

According to Article 6 of the Law, special social services are provided to individuals in difficult

situations in life, including:

- Impairment of early psychophysical development of children from birth to three years;
- Permanent impairment of function of organism due to physical and (or) mental impairment;
- Inability for self-help due to advanced age or as a result of disease and (or) disability.
Issues regarding access for disabled people to facilities of the social infrastructure require

special attention and the disabled rightly criticize these issues.



Local executive authorities do not fully implement measures for the provision of unimpeded
access to residential, public and industrial buildings existing or under construction, as well as to
the facilities of the social infrastructure.

An inventory of the operating facilities of the social transportation and recreation infrastructure
is not complete; only 17,349 facilities (89.6%) have been inventoried out of 19,351. This inventory
should have been finished in 2006.

In the Eastern Kazakhstan region, an inventory has been made at only 227 out of 1080 facilities

(21%) and in the Mangistau region, 144 of 288, or 50%.

At the time of inspection by the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, in the Mangistau
and Karaganda regions, in the state institution “Karakaralin Psychoneurological Nursing Home”
in the village of Linda and in some departments for social employment programs of the Mangistau
region there were no ramps.

In the Atyrau, Almaty, Southern Kazakhstan, Northern Kazakhstan, Mangistau, Kyzylorda
and Zhambyl regions and in the city of Almaty there is no provision for vehicles adapted for the
disabled.

Construction of passenger bus stops for the disabled is very slow in the Almaty, Zhambyl and
Pavlodar regions and in the cities of Almaty and Astana. In the Atyrau and Kyzylorda regions, this
issue is only under consideration.

In view of the non-fulfillment of certain standards of legislation in the field of social protection
of the disabled, including the standard ensuring access for disabled people to facilities of the
infrastructure, presently it is impossible to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities.

4. Vocational Rehabilitation of the Persons with Disabilities

Much effort will be needed to provide the disabled people with an access to the labor market,
since adequate vocational rehabilitation is defined as making a disabled person competitive in the
labor market and practically assisting him with employment.

In order to provide employment for the disabled, local executive authorities determine quotas
of work places for disabled people at the rate of 3 % of the total number of employees, create
additional work places for the disabled by means of the development of individual entrepreneurship
and small and medium businesses and they set up special as well as social work places.

In the course of the Program, 144 special work places for disabled people were set up, equipped

with special devices and equipment for the convenience of persons with disabilities.

It should be noted that these special work places have been created only in 8 regions out of
16 (in the region of Akmola – 27 work places, Aktyube – 5, Western Kazakhstan – 8, Southern
Kazakhstan – 9, Eastern Kazakhstan – 1, Kostanay – 53, Mangistau – 18 and Pavlodar – 23).

3,493 disabled individuals are employed, while there are 16,961 work places available as
stipulated by quota. However, work places are not provided per the quota in the city of Almaty,
in the Zhambyl region only 12 work places were provided, in the Kyzylorda region – 14, in the
Atyrau region – 76 and in the city of Astana – 46.

In the Mangistau region, despite the available 3,140 work places, only 24 disabled people are
employed. The same situation is found in the Southern Kazakhstan region, where 164 disabled
people are employed with 2,531 work places available.

73 disabled individuals were directed to temporary work and 1,390 to public work.
Considering the low competitiveness of the disabled, according to the Individual Program
of Rehabilitation (IPR), during the year 2008, 717 disabled people were directed to vocational
training and retraining, out of which only 240, or 33.4% were employed.

These numbers illustrate that the majority of the disabled who are able to work do not have the

conditions for vocational rehabilitation.



4.4 Implementation of a Central Database of the Persons with Disabilities

A compulsory condition for the improvement of the system for rehabilitation of the disabled
is the establishment of the Central Database of the Disabled (further referred to as “CDD”), which
was completed in 2008.

The CDD contains information on the quantity of disabled, their condition and cause of
disability and measures taken for their rehabilitation. It ensures the control of the quality and
efficiency of the rehabilitation work in compliance with the individual program of rehabilitation
of the person with disabilities.

Despite the measures taken and positive improvements in the system of social protection of

the disabled, the following problems persist:

- As previously, a weak link in the work with the disabled is disability prevention among
the frequently and chronically ill and, as a result, the number of disabled is quickly increasing,
especially due to cardiovascular and oncology diseases. As has been said, the highest rate of
disability out of the general disability rate is among the population of working age;

- An insufficient quantity of rehabilitation centers and departments in hospitals results in more
severe categories of disability. There are no rehabilitation centers in the Akmola, Aktobe, Western
Kazakhstan, Eastern Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Kyzylorda, or Mangistau regions, or in the cities of
Astana and Almaty.

- The provision of hospital treatment only for the purpose of functional rehabilitation is not
sufficient for the implementation of inpatient rehabilitation (currently, in the Republic the number of
hospital beds provided for departments of medical rehabilitation is only 3% of the total number);

- There are very few facilities for modern forms of care and rehabilitation of the persons with

disabilities (outpatient centers, small nursing homes);

- The persons with disabilities have limited access to facilities of social infrastructure and

transportation.

- Despite funds allocated in budgets of local authorities, the persons with disabilities criticize
local executive authorities for the lack of unimpeded access to existing facilities and those under
construction. Not all social, entertainment, or sports facilities under construction will provide
adequate access for the persons with disabilities.. There is much criticism of public transport which
is not equipped with special devices for the persons with disabilities, and bus stops are also not
equipped for the persons with disabilities.

- The low level of vocational rehabilitation of the persons with disabilities is complicated by

their low competitiveness.

. Involvement of NGOs and the Use of Opportunities of Civil Society

The formation and development of a contemporary system of social security for the disabled
and expansion of opportunities for their active participation in public life are impossible without the
participation of the non-governmental sector. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection closely
cooperates with public associations of the disabled with a view toward solving the problems of the
disabled and the development of legislation.

A Coordination Council has been established and is operating in the field of social security
of the disabled (Enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan of December
21, 2005 No. 1266), which consists of representatives of interested state authorities and non-
governmental organizations. The Council is a consultative advisory board under the Government
of the Republic of Kazakhstan which was founded with the purpose of development of suggestions
and recommendations on issues regarding the social security of the disabled and the interaction of
central and local executive authorities, organizations and public associations of the disabled.

Within the framework of implementation of the Law “On Special Social Services” during the
years 2009-2001, 1,686.9 million tenge were allocated to the non-governmental sector from the
state budget.

7

In addition, within the framework of the state social order, in 2009 three social projects have

been planned to the sum of 8,100,000 tenge, at the expense of the state budget, including:

- “Development of the Standard of Special Social Services to the Disabled with

Psychoneurological Illnesses;”

- “Production of Social Video Advertisement ‘Integration of Disabled Children into the

Healthy Environment (Prevention of Social Orphanhood and Severe Disabling Pathologies);’”

- “Support of Internet resources and the Organization of Information, Legal and Social Support

to Individuals in Difficult Life Situations”.

All these directions and new approaches to social security of the persons with disabilities
are a practical response to the challenges of our time. In addition, it is necessary to remember
that the preservation of social stability and the improvement of the welfare of the population to a
large extent depend not only on the government, but also on the mobilization of the efforts of all
representatives of society and each citizen of the country.

With the objective of securing the rights of the persons with disabilities, we recommend
that the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Ministry of Labor and Social
Protection, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and Science and the Akimats
of the Regions and the cities of Astana and Almaty implement the following measures during
the years 2009 – 202:

1. Continue work on the improvement of national legislation and law-enforcement practices
in the field of protection of the persons with disabilities with due consideration to generally
acknowledged international standards;

2. We recommend that the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Ministry of
Labor and Social Protection jointly with interested state authorities develop an Action Plan on
securing the rights and improvement of quality of life of the disabled, the implementation of which
will ensure the conditions necessary for ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities.

3. Jointly study the needs of the regions for health care institutions of a rehabilitational nature

for the chronically ill and disabled.

4. With a view toward the enhancement of health care of the population and securing the
constitutional right of citizens to health protection, we recommend that the Government of the
Republic of Kazakhstan and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kazakhstan take necessary
measures to protect maternity and childhood so as to reduce the rate of child disability.

5. With the objectives of the improvement of the rehabilitation system, the intensification of
social support and the improvement of the quality of life of the disabled, we recommend that the
Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Republic of Kazakhstan develop and adopt “The
Plan of Measures for the Improvement of the Rehabilitation System for the Disabled During 2009-
2011”.

6. With the aim of support for the persons with disabilities and the fulfillment of international
responsibilities, we recommend that the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Ministry
of Labor and Social Protection, the Ministry of Education and Science, the Akimats of the Regions
and the cities of Astana and Almaty ensure the increase of state educational grants for the training
of social employees in corresponding specialties and qualifications in higher and secondary
vocational educational institutions.

7. We recommend that the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Republic of
Kazakhstan and the Akimats of all Regions develop cooperation with international and non-
governmental organizations involved in issues of the disabled.

8. With a view toward the improvement of the cultural level of persons with disabilities, we
recommend that the Ministry of Culture and Information of the Republic of Kazakhstan jointly
with the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection prepare and publish short informational materials
and disseminate them in mass media.

Rights of the Oralman (Repatriates to the Republic of Kazakhstan)

Repatriation of Kazakhs to their historical homeland is one of the main priorities of the
country’s migration policy. At the governmental level, measures are taken to establish mechanisms
of repatriation of ethnic Kazakhs including their organized immigration and the creation of
conditions for their life and activity at the place of their settlement.

Beginning in the year 1991, the Republic of Kazakhstan has accepted more than 706,000

ethnic Kazakhs.

From the first years of independence, the regulation of migration policy has been one of the

main directions of governmental policy.

In 2007, the Concept of Migration Policy of the Republic of Kazakhstan was adopted for the
years 2007 – 2015 (Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan of August 28, 2007 No.
399).

The legal basis for this Program is the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Law
of the Republic of Kazakhstan of December 13, 1997 “On Migration of the Population”, Decrees
of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan of August 28, 2007 No. 399 “On the Concept of
Migration Policy of the Republic of Kazakhstan During 2007 – 2015”, of August 28, 2006 No. 167
“On the Strategy of Territorial Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2015” (further
– the Strategy of territorial development of the Republic of Kazakhstan until 2015) and of July
10, 2003 No. 1149 “On the State Program for the Development of Rural Localities During 2004
– 2010”.

In the framework of the current legislative base, the government renders to the Oralman
necessary social assistance and support. At present, taking into account the lump sum allowance,
funds for the purchase of housing and compensation for the expense of moving and transporting
belongings, each family, on average consisting of 5 people, is given 833,000 tenge.

In the country there are 14 centers for the temporary residence of the Oralman (further referred
to as “centers”). Since 2008, centers of adaptation and integration of the Oralman have been
launched in Karaganda, Shymkent and in the village Aksukent in the Southern Kazakhstan region.
The construction of a standard adaptation center has begun in Aktau.

The adaptation programs implemented in the centers ensure legal consultations, learning
of the state language and optionally the Russian language, vocational training or retraining and
professional development.

All the Oralman are provided with access to medical assistance, education and social security
and they belong to one of the target groups that are helped with employment. More than 66% of the
Oralman of employable age are employed in various spheres of manufacturing and every fourth is
employed in the agricultural sector.

With the purpose of assisting the Oralman, the Councils of Oralman were established under
the regional Akimats, which study and solve the problems of the Oralman in their new living
conditions.

An information database, “Oralman”, has been created and is being improved, which, in the
future, will be integrated into the united social information system and will allow the provision of
ethnic immigrants with the entire range of social services.

At present, housing projects for ethnic immigrants are being implemented in the Republic.
Thus, in the city of Shymkent in the Southern Kazakhstan region, a project for the immigration of
nearly 2,000 families of ethnic immigrants from the Republic of Uzbekistan is being realized. Two
thousand cottages, a space-saving settlement, are being constructed by the immigrants themselves
with the use of local construction materials. In Almaty, the project “Baibesik” for the construction
of 185 houses is under way and in the Saryarkin region of the city of Astana a project for the
construction of the micro region “Nurbesik” is being developed.

During the course of immigration and integration of ethnic migrants into new public conditions,

some problems arise.

9

The settlement of the Oralman is uneven and secondary migration occurs. At present, nearly
sixty percent of immigrants live in regions with a problematic labor market – in the Southern
Kazakhstan, Mangistau, Almaty and Zhambyl regions. This situation does not conform to the
state policy of labor resource distribution.

The level of employment and housing security of the Oralman is low.
In this regard, the Head of State has commissioned the development of the Program “Nurly

Kosh” (Enactment of the Government of December 2, 2008 No. 1126).

The goal of the Program is the reasonable settlement on a voluntary basis and the provision of
assistance in employment and routine life to ethnic Kazakhs, former citizens of the country who
wished to come back to Kazakhstan and internal migrants for the sake of demographical, social
and economic development of the regions and realization of participants’ potential.

The implementation of the Program will ensure the control of the processes of ethnic, internal
and external migration and will subject them to the interests of social and economic development
of the regions. It will stimulate the return to the country of citizens of various nationalities who
emigrated from Kazakhstan for one reason or another.

Unfortunately, in practice, there are instances when the rights of the Oralman that are guaranteed

by current legislation of Kazakhstan have been violated.

A review of appeals by the Oralman to the Human Rights Commission under the President
of RK as well as of documentation of inspections performed by prosecuting authorities reveals
that some territorial agencies of authorized state migration institutions frequently violate the
provisions of the Law of RK “On the Procedure for Investigation of Appeals of Physical and Legal
Personalities” as well as the Guidelines for determination of the status of the Oralman and their
inclusion in the immigration quota for the Oralman. In addition, some of the Oralman drew the
attention of the Human Rights Commission to instances of violation of their right to the receipt of
pension payments until their obtainment of citizenship in the Republic of Kazakhstan.

A review of current legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan with regard to issues of housing
assistance, pension payments and allowances to the Oralman disclosed that, in conformity with
Article 2 of the Law of RK “On Pension Security in the Republic of Kazakhstan”, foreigners and
individuals without citizenship continually residing on the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan
have the right to pension security equally with citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan, if not
otherwise stipulated by the law and international agreements.

Paragraph 1 of the Rules of Documentation and Registration of the Population of the Republic
of Kazakhstan approved by the Enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan of
July 12, 2000 No. 1063 (further referred to as “Rules”) stipulates that citizens of the Republic
of Kazakhstan regardless of their place of residence, foreign citizens and individuals without
citizenship continually residing in the Republic of Kazakhstan should have one of the following
identity documents: 1) a passport of a citizen of RK; 2) an identity card; 3) a residence permit for
a foreigner in the RK; or 4) an identity card for an individual without citizenship.

There is no provision for the use of other documents not stipulated by the Rules.
Under these circumstances, the Oralman who have not yet obtained citizenship in the
Republic of Kazakhstan and who have not documented their continual residence in the Republic
of Kazakhstan (residence permit) are not provided with pension payments and allowances from the
Center (on the basis of the Oralman identity card).

According to Article 14 of the Migration Law, individuals recognized as Oralman are given
standard identity cards. Oralman identity cards are documents liable to strict accountability and
serve as a basis for the obtainment of benefits and compensations provided for by the Law.

Under the requirement of Paragraph 18 “Certain Issues of Legal Regulation of Residence of
Foreign Citizens in the Republic of Kazakhstan” approved by the Enactment of the Government
of January 28, 2000 No. 136, individuals permanently residing in the Republic of Kazakhstan
are considered as foreign nationals who have obtained relevant authorization as well as residence
permits issued by agencies of the interior.

70

The joint order of the Ministry of the Interior of RK of April 9, 2004 No. 215, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of RK of April 14, 2004 No.08-1/93 and the Chairman of the Agency of Migration
and Demography of the Republic of Kazakhstan of April 14, 2004 No. 35-p ratifies the Guideline
“On the Procedure for Application of Rules of Entry and Residence of Foreign Citizens in the
Republic of Kazakhstan and Their Departure From the Republic of Kazakhstan and Organization
of Activity of Authorities of the Interior on Prevention and Suppression of Illegal Migration of
Foreign Citizens on the Territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan”.

In harmony with Paragraph 68 of the mentioned Guidelines, applications for permanent
residence permits in the Republic of Kazakhstan by foreign citizens who entered the Republic in
accordance with the immigration quota, should be submitted directly to the territorial departments
of the Migration Committee of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of RK. In case of
simultaneous application by the Oralman for citizenship of the Republic of Kazakhstan, covered
by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Procedure for Investigation of
Issues Related to Citizenship of the Republic of Kazakhstan”, permanent residence documents
may not be issued.

Thus, the lack of provisions in the Rules and Procedures ensuring the issue of identity cards to
the Oralman, which serve as a basis for the obtainment of appropriate benefits and compensations
(housing and other benefits and pensions), to a great extent infringes on the rights of the
Oralman.

In addition, it is necessary to introduce amendments and additions to Paragraph 2 of the above-

mentioned Rules with the inclusion of the Oralman’s identity document.

One measure which stimulates the repatriation by Kazakhs of their historical homeland is the

free provision of land to them for the individual construction of residences.

However, there are frequent violations of the requirements of Articles 405, 502 and 506 of the
Tax Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan, according to which the Oralman are exempted from state
taxes if they have registered their right of real estate and related transactions and have obtained
citizenship in the Republic of Kazakhstan.

In the city of Almaty and the Almaty, Akmola, Aktyube, Western Kazakhstan, Eastern
Kazakhstan, Mangistau and Kostanay regions, instances of the illegal imposing of the state tax on
the Oralman have been discovered.

It is necessary to legislatively regulate the allocation of finances from the budget for the
Oralman who have relocated to their historical homeland under the immigration quota; however,
it is also necessary to stipulate the compulsory rate of reimbursement back to the state in case of
their voluntary return to their original country.

The Human Rights Commission under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan shares the
opinion of the government and strives to promote the process of repatriation of Kazakhs to their
historical homeland. In this regard, they are launching a range of ideas aimed at the improvement
of governmental policy in the field of migration of the Oralman. The Commission speaks in support
of a differentiated approach that takes into consideration the complicity of the problem itself and
the need for the coordination of various approaches and positions in this respect. They think that
it is necessary to set priorities with regard to the Oralman and give preference to the return of
those who went to live abroad unwillingly. Regarding Kazakhs residing in the territories of Russia
and Uzbekistan, it is necessary to remember that most of them have been living there for many
centuries, although, admittedly, there are many who came to live there during times of revolution
and collectivization which resulted in a genuine genocide of the Kazakh nation. According to
results of a survey executed by co-workers of the Secretary of the Human Rights Commission
under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, in the city of Saint Petersburg, the Saratovsk
and Omsk regions and the city of Omsk, the majority of ethnic Kazakhs residing there prefer to
work and live in Russia.

With the goal of protection of the rights of the Oralman during their return to their historical
homeland under the immigration quota or outside of it and to guarantee their social and economic

7

rights, the Human Rights Commission under the Head of State recommends that the Government
develop and ratify a separate legislative act that would exempt the Oralman from customs duty
during their crossing of the national border, regardless of the quantity of their possessions. In
addition, it recommends making related additions to the Migration Law.

It is necessary to make adjustments to the government housing program and to implement a
balanced approach with due consideration to the interests of the Oralman as well as other citizens
of Kazakhstan. The solution can be found only in the framework of the social partnership of society
and the authorities. Caring for the Oralman should not infringe on the interests of other citizens
or violate their rights. This situation requires responsibility not only on the part of government,
but also agencies of civil society, NGOs and trade unions. Issues regarding the Oralman are the
common problems of society and the government and their resolution requires the interaction of
society and the government. For instance, the issue of adaptation of the Oralman can be settled by
means of the establishment of modern integration centers which are to assist people in problems of
obtainment of citizenship, employment and professional education.

With the objective of securing the rights of the Oralman, we recommend that the
Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan implement the following measures during the
years 2009-20:

1. With the goal of securing the rights of the Oralman who have not obtained citizenship
and have not yet documented their permanent residence in Kazakhstan to receive pensions and
other social allowances, make amendments and additions to legislative documents regulating
the procedure for payment of pensions, benefits and other social payments, in particular, to the
Guidelines on the procedure for the establishment and payment of pensions, state social allowances
and state especial allowances from the Center. The list of acceptable documents should include
the Oralman’s certificate, which would be the basis for the establishment of pension and benefit
payments.

2. Legislatively establish the minimal pension payment to the Oralman of pension age from

those countries with which Kazakhstan has no bilateral agreement regarding pension issues.

3. Make an addition to Paragraph 2 of the Rules of Documentation and Registration of the
Population of the Republic of Kazakhstan approved by the Enactment of the Government of the
Republic of Kazakhstan of July 12, 2000 No. 1063 which includes the Oralman’s certificate as an
acceptable identity document.

4. In an effort to protect the rights of the Oralman upon return to their historical homeland
under the immigration quota or outside of it and to secure their social and economic rights, it
is necessary to elaborate and ratify an individual legislative act exempting them from customs
duties during their crossing of the national border, regardless of quantity of their belongings. In
addition, it is necessary to make corresponding additions to the Law of RK “On Migration of the
Population”.

5. Continuously monitor the implementation of the government program “Nurly Kosh”.
6. For the purpose of securing the right of the Oralman to housing, develop and implement
a mechanism for the provision of affordable housing to the Oralman within the framework of the
Government Housing Program.

7. With the purpose of securing the right of the Oralman to obtainment of citizenship in the
Republic of Kazakhstan by means of a simplified procedure, as well as the elimination of all
possible conditions for corruption crimes by employees of the Migration Police and governmental
authorities, exclude the address certificate from the list of documents required for obtainment of
citizenship by the Oralman, which certificate obliges them to regularly register at their place of
residence immediately after their move to their historical homeland despite the fact that they have
no permanent residence with the right of ownership.

8. In order to eliminate double citizenship of the Oralman, it is necessary to conclude bilateral
intergovernmental agreements with the countries of the original residence of the Oralman, which
would ensure that the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Kazakhstan informs corresponding

72

authorized governmental agencies of the foreign countries upon a certain Oralman becoming a
citizen of Kazakhstan.

Rights of the Child

In the area of protection of the rights of the child and childhood, work is being carried out in
the Republic of Kazakhstan in order to secure the social and legal guarantees of children’s quality
of life, in harmony with international standards.

An important step in the implementation of international standards for the quality of life of
children was the ratification of the UN Convention “On the Rights of the Child” by Kazakhstan
in 1994.

The general principles of the Convention On the Rights of the Child were implemented in many
laws of Kazakhstan, including: “On the Rights of the Child in the Republic of Kazakhstan”, “On
Marriage and Family”, “On Children’s Villages of Family Style and Youth Homes”, “On Health
Protection of the Citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan”, “On Social, Medical, Pedagogical
and Correctional Support for Children with Disabilities”, “On Juvenile Crime Prevention and
Prevention of Child Neglect and Homelessness” and others.

Since the time of ratification of the Convention On the Rights of the Child, Kazakhstan has
already twice reported to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding the fulfillment
of its provisions. The joint second and third report prepared by the Government of the Republic
of Kazakhstan was discussed at the 45th session of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child
in May 2007.

It should be noted that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has positively acknowledged
the measures implemented by Kazakhstan in the field of protection of the rights of children. In
the course of discussion on the report, one of the positive achievements was recognized to be the
development and improvement of new legislation as well as the cooperation of governmental
authorities with international organizations and various UN agencies on childhood issues.

The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child also positively evaluated the experience of
the Republic of Kazakhstan in the field of alternative care for children left without the support
of parents: the establishment of “hope homes”, youth homes and family style children’s villages.
An initiative on the development of new forms of family type upbringing such as guardianship,
tutorship, patronage and adoptive families was approved.

The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has approved the adoption of various plans
and strategies in the field of education, health care and support for youth. However, although their
evaluation of the activity of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the field of protection
of children’s rights was positive, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has noticed existing
problems in this regard and has given recommendations for the further improvement of the situation
regarding the rights of children in Kazakhstan.

One of the Committee’s recommendations was to establish an independent authorized agency
for the implementation of the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, including
effective coordination of activities between central and local executive agencies in cooperation with
NGOs. In harmony with the given recommendations, the Committee for Protection of Children’s
Rights under the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Kazakhstan was established in January
2006 by the Enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and in August 2007,
departments for the protection of children’s rights in all regions of the Republic were founded.
These measures allowed the creation in the Republic of a new governmental rights protection
system in the interests of the child, the main component of which is moral and spiritual human
development.

The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has also recommended developing the related
National Action Plan. In this regard, in 2007, the program “Children of Kazakhstan” for the years

7

2007-2011 was ratified by the Enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan of
December 21, 2007 No. 1245. The program includes a set of measures for the improvement of the
quality of life of children, prevention of social orphanhood and the provision of conditions similar
to family conditions for orphans and children left without the support of parents. During the course
of implementation of the program, it is planned to open five special correctional educational
organizations, three rehabilitation centers for minors left without the support of parents, six family
style children’s villages and also an increase in the number of specialists in guardian and tutorial
agencies.

With the purpose of implementation of these recommendations, the Ministry of Education
and Science together with the interested ministries, departments and local executive authorities
has prepared the Plan of Measures for Implementation of the Concluding Remarks of the UN
Committee for the Rights of the Child, which was considered and ratified at a meeting of the
Interdepartmental Commission on International Humanitarian Law and International Agreements
on Human Rights. At present, the implementation of this Plan in the Republic is in progress.

With the aim of implementation of Article 20 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child
as well as fulfillment of Paragraphs 8 and 45 of the recommendations of the 33rd session of the
UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, the draft law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On the
Accedence and Ratification by the Republic of Kazakhstan of the Convention on Protection of the
Rights of Children and Cooperation with Regard to Foreign Adoption (adopted by the Hague on
May 29, 1993)” was developed. Currently, the given document is being considered by the Majilis
of Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The ratification of this document will ensure the
protection of rights of children after their adoption.

In accordance with the Plan of legislative development for 2009, the draft Law of the Republic
of Kazakhstan “On Amendments and Additions to the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On
Children’s Villages of Family Style and Youth Homes” is being developed. Taking into account
the experience of foreign countries, the draft law suggests the alteration of the requirements for
educators; in particular, it proposes to omit the age requirement (30 years of age) and to add
the provision to employ married couples as educators in the children’s villages. In addition, the
expansion of the number of graduates of educational organizations for orphans and children left
without the support of parents is suggested, who could then undergo social adaptation in youth
homes.

Measures are being taken to develop effective mechanisms for resolving issues regarding
social orphanhood and early detection of dysfunctional families. Various events are being held
with the participation of international and domestic experts, representatives of agencies of internal
affairs, NGOs, parents’ associations, psychologists, social pedagogues and directors of schools
– training sessions, conferences, seminars, consultations and many others.

Various studies and monitoring activities are being held jointly with governmental and non-
governmental organizations in order to study the situation of the children in the Republic. Thus,
in harmony with the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the
UN Children’s Fund UNICEF, two sociological studies have been conducted jointly with non-
governmental public associations: “The Situation of Orphan Children and Children Left without
the Support of Parents in the System of Children’s Boarding Institutions” and “Evaluation of
Needs and Requirements of Vulnerable Children and Families for Social Services”. The given
studies were conducted in an effort to study the situation of orphans, children left without the
support of parents and children from vulnerable classes of the population.

Special attention is paid to the prevention of the worst forms of child labor, which can
also affect the quality of life of children. Although legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan
has established restrictions on child labor and stipulated criminal and administrative liability for
compulsion of children to the worst forms of child labor, there have been instances when children
were forced to do work which could damage their physical development and hinder their receiving
a good quality education. For example, there were instances of the illegal involvement of children

74

in tobacco harvesting in the Almaty region and cotton harvesting in the Southern Kazakhstan
region. Unfortunately, at present, the mechanism for gathering statistical reports regarding the
use of child labor in branches of national agriculture has not yet been developed. The issue of use
of child labor at home and on farms requires additional study and standards of labor legislation
regulating the procedure and conclusion of labor contracts with minors and some aspects of their
labor activity including concurrent studies and work need to be revised. In the context of these and
other issues in the sphere of underage employment, the interested ministries and departments and
the Confederation of Employers of the Republic have signed the Cooperative Plan of Work in the
Framework of the Regional Project of the International Labor Organization (ILO) on Eradication
of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. In harmony with this document, in an effort to increase the
public awareness of the worst forms of child labor, a collection of international and Kazakhstan’s
legislation in the field of protection of children’s rights, namely in the field of combat against the
worst forms of child labor was published and research of the child labor situation in the regions of
the Republic has been conducted.

However, despite the measures taken, there are still certain problems and unresolved issues

with regard to the protection of children’s rights and interests.

The issue of social orphanhood remains urgent. Over 12,000 families are dysfunctional; in
only the year of 2008, 854 parents were deprived of their parental rights. At present, out of 16,008
children growing up in institutions of education, health protection and social security, 84.2% are
social orphans.

Housing for the graduates of institutions for orphans is a complicated issue. Only about 10%
of children raised in children’s homes and boarding schools have a lodging in their name. In the
last three years, only 80 apartments were allocated for children of this category.

There are serious difficulties with regard to the receipt of competitive vocational education
of graduates of institutions for orphans. Today, only 82.4% of these graduates work by their
professions.

Every year, 10,000 neglected and homeless children are found. Even with close relatives
available, 25% of these children are sent to governmental institutions for orphans and children left
without the support of parents, where they are completely provided for by the government.

Currently, the issue of legislative determination of the establishment and payment of benefits
for a child (children) to guardians and tutors remains urgent. This provision will ensure the
development of legislation that would stipulate the amount and procedure for payment of this
benefit.

The purpose of adoption of such legislation is the necessity to resolve issues of material support
of nearly 30,000 children who are currently under guardianship and tutorship in families and to
further reduce the number of children growing in boarding institutions. Over 3 billion tenge a year
(10 monthly calculation indicators for the support of one child per month) are required for these
purposes.

Violence against children, various forms of children exploitation, neglect and homelessness
are among the unresolved problems. In only the current year, nearly 6,000 neglected and homeless
children were found.

Not everywhere are found the necessary conditions for receiving a secondary public education.
The number of populated localities without schools is increasing. In comparison with the year 2007,
their number increased by 65 and amounts to 1,434 in the year 2008. There are 32,500 children
of school age living in these localities; 13,300 of these children are transported to school, 3,600
live in boarding schools and 15,000 children live in apartments or travel to school independently.
Transportation of children to schools in the Southern Kazakhstan, Almaty and Atyrau regions is
poorly organized.

At the same time, local authorities are slow to resolve issues with regard to the renovation
and replenishment of their school bus fleet. While there is a demand for 466 new busses in the
Republic, only 96 busses were purchased in the year 2008.

7

Still, the most urgent social problem is violence against children and various forms of children
exploitation. According to the ILO, 16 children of every 100 are involved in child labor (including
children of 5 years of age) and 12 out of every 100 in the worst forms of child labor (slavery,
servitude, prostitution). In the Republic there is almost no reliable information about the nature
and extent of child labor, neglect and homelessness.

The issue of use of child labor at home and at farms requires additional study. Many families
(parents) do not know the rights of children as stipulated by the labor legislation of the Republic
of Kazakhstan.

There is a need to train professional personnel to work with families and children; the content
of the training programs for professional development of children’s rights specialists, social
pedagogues, psychologists and educators working for educational organizations for orphans and
children left without the support of parents requires improvement.

. Child Criminality and Issues Regarding Prevention of Child Criminality

One of the main links in the system of prevention of neglect and homelessness as well as
socialization of minors left without care and tutorship are the Centers of Temporary Isolation,
Adaptation and Rehabilitation of Minors (CTIARM), which currently function under the agencies
of the interior.

Moreover, in harmony with legislation, the main functions of CTIARMs are the protection
of children’s rights, the ensuring of their social security and the rendering of everyday, medical,
pedagogical, psychological and legal services and material assistance. The social rehabilitation of
children in its entirety comes under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Science.

The responsibilities of agencies of the interior cover only the arrest, delivery to and upkeep of
minors in these specialized children’s institutions. However, the reason for a teenager to be placed
in a CTIARM is the decision of the guardian and tutorship agencies of the educational system,
which also make decisions on the further life of the minor.

In whole, the Centers of Temporary Isolation, Adaptation and Rehabilitation of Minors fulfill
the same tasks as the Centers for Temporary Residence of Children Deprived of Parental Care
(orphanages), which are under the authority of the Ministry of Education and Science.

The Human Rights Commission under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan and
the Prosecutor General’s Office have recommended that the Government find opportunities for
the further introduction of a position of district police inspectors for the affairs of minors (these
inspectors [school policemen] would serve in educational organizations) at the expense of local
budgets and to resolve the issue of the transfer of Centers of Temporary Isolation, Adaptation
and Rehabilitation for Minors, which currently function under the agencies of the interior, to the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and Science.

During the course of inspections, agencies of the Prosecutor General revealed violations of
the constitutional children’s rights to personal liberty guaranteed by Article 16 of the Constitution
of the Republic of Kazakhstan and by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These violations
took place due to illegal legislation, incorrect procedures for its application by agencies of the
interior and the negligence of educational institutions.

However, it should be admitted that one of the main reasons for such violations are discrepancies

in the current legislation.

Thus, according to Articles 81 and 82 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan
(further referred to as “CC RK”) and Articles 494, 495 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the
Republic of Kazakhstan (further referred to as “CCP RK”), placement of a minor in a special
educational or medical-educational institution is one of the compulsory measures of an educational
character that may be imposed by the court.

7

In harmony with the above-mentioned standards, this compulsory measure can be decided by

the court under the following conditions:

- The case may be settled only during the course of a legal investigation of a criminal act by
the court of original jurisdiction, in making a decision concerning the minor with regard to holding
him criminally responsible or freeing him from criminal responsibility (Articles 78, 80-83 of the
CC RK and Articles 494 and 495 of the CCP RK);

- This type of compulsory measure of an educational nature may be imposed exclusively upon
a juvenile who committed a deliberate crime of medium gravity (Paragraph 5 of Article 83 of the
CC RK).

However, Article 14 of the Law stipulates the possibility of a court decision on the advisability
of sending minors to educational institutions for special custody upon the submission of the case
both to the Commission for Minors and Protection of their Rights and to the agencies of the
Interior.

At the same time, according to Sub Paragraph 2 of Paragraph 2 of Article 59 of the CCP RK,
the imposition of compulsory educational measures upon a person is the exclusive right of the
court.

The Resolution of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan of April 11, 2002 No. 6
(with amendments of December 25, 2006 “On Judicial Practices Regarding Matters of Juvenile
Crime and Their Involvement in Criminal and Antisocial Behavior” (further referred to as “the
Resolution”) explains the procedure for application of such measures.

According to Paragraph 15 of the Resolution, the decision on the imposition of compulsory
educational measures can only be made by the court and only in the case when a “guilty” verdict
is declared in the main trial.

Therefore, the imposition of such compulsory educational measures by the courts without
a principal legal investigation is illegal and Paragraph 2 and Paragraph 7 of Article 14 of the
Law contradict the above-mentioned standards of the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal
Procedure.

The requirements of Articles 57 and 58 of the Code on Administrative Offences of RK (further
referred to as “the Code”) contradict the standards of Sub Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 13 of
the Law concerning the reasons and procedure for decision-making regarding the imposition of
compulsory medical measures upon alcoholics and drug abusers.

In addition, the list regulated by Article 57 of the Code is exhaustive and does not stipulate the
possibility of transferring the minor to a special educational institution as an administrative and
legal measure.

The imposition of administrative and legal measures other than for the reasons and in the order

determined by the Code is prohibited.

Therefore, it is also necessary to revise the reasons for placement of a minor in a special
educational institution for the persistent evasion of primary, principal secondary, or comprehensive
secondary education, the regular unauthorized withdrawal from the family or from children’s
educational institutions, as well as the commitment of other antisocial actions.

Currently, the above-mentioned contradictions in legislation result in violation of the rights of
minors, hindering the actions of the public prosecutor for the protection of children’s rights and
interests, since the legislation does not stipulate the procedure for appeal (protest) or its revision.

In this regard, it is suggested to consider the issue of setting in order the legal regulations of

the procedure for the placement of children in special institutions.

2. Current Issues on Protection of the Rights and Interests of Children
Deprived of Parental Care

The extent of the protection of children is the main characteristic of any civilized society and

the social orientation of governmental policy.

77

Family crises, the difficult financial situation of the majority of families, the failure of traditional
family relationships and the increase of divorces have become serious reasons for the deterioration
of the conditions of children.

Transformations during the last years have greatly intensified problems of childhood and have

indicated the need for extreme measures.

During the last years in Kazakhstan, the number of children deprived of parental care has been
increasing. Every year, their number keeps on growing; however, only a small number of these
children have lost the care of their parents due to their death. The rest come under the phenomenon
of so-called “social orphanhood”, i.e. they are orphans with living parents. Presently, according
to statistics from the Ministry of Education and Science, more than 18,000 children live in 204
institutions for orphans and children left without the care of their parents.

The main reasons for the increase in the number of orphan children having the living parents
are the loss of social family prestige, material and housing problems, the increase of illegitimate
birth and the high rate of parents leading an antisocial way of life. In this regard, the protection of
the rights and interests of children deprived of parental care has become more important and one
of the methods of such protection is the creation of adequate legislation.

However, it should be noted that there are significant gaps in legislation, there is a lack of
mechanisms for the implementation of current legislation and there is no adequately authorized
governmental agency. In our opinion, the establishment of the special Committee for Protection of
the Rights of Children under the Ministry of Education and Science of RK has not solved the main
issues of protection of the rights and interests of children, including children deprived of parental
care.

A possible resolution of this problem in our circumstances will be the creation of the
Institute of the National Ombudsman for the Rights of the Child with due consideration to
the requirements of well known international standards.

The status and function of guardianship and tutorship institutions are subject to radical change.
Presently, these agencies which are the main governmental structure for the protection of the rights
and interests of children often consist of only one inspector working under the district educational
department who does not have even an elementary legal knowledge.

At the same time, the established Departments for the protection of the rights of children are
not fulfilling their direct functions, in most cases doubling the functions of other governmental and
non-governmental organizations, for instance departments of education and commissions for the
affairs of minors.

Lack of coordination of the roles of the Committee for Protection of the Rights of Children and

its departments is a result of gaps in current legislation.

In an effort to settle the situation, we think it is necessary to:
- Remove the concept from applicable legislation of guardianship and tutorship as state

structures, as they are non-existent in the state mechanism;

- Determine the circle of governmental agencies fulfilling guardian and trusteeship functions

with regard to both minors and adults needing such by virtue of specific reasons;

- Entrust the coordination of matters related to the protection of the rights and interests of
children to the Committee for Protection of the Rights of Children as the authorized agency in this
field;

- Entrust the determination of guardian and tutorial functions to the Government of the Republic

of Kazakhstan;

- In administrative and territorial districts where there are no structural departments of the
Committee, entrust guardian and tutorial functions to other agencies – agencies of education,
health care and social security – without changing the number of personnel or amount and source
of financing.

Considering the above-mentioned and taking into account the need for conceptual alteration of
approaches to the protection of the rights and legal interests of children, we propose the resolution

7

of these issues in the draft Law of RK “On Marriage (Matrimony) and Family” which is under
consideration.

The departmental dissociation of specialized children’s institutions is a persistent problem.
A sampling review of certain legal documents testifies that there are gaps in the implementation

of some standards.

Thus, Paragraph 1 of Article 76 of the Code on Administrative Offences of RK determines
that restriction of entertainment and imposition of special requirements for one’s behavior can be
applied to a minor as an educational measure.

Since the above-mentioned Code does not stipulate which agencies can assign such measures,
in essence, today these measures can be assigned by any agency investigating the case of the
administrative offence, except for the court. This contradicts the requirements of Articles 16 and
21 of the Constitution of RK.

The same discrepancy is found in the standard of Article 11 of the Decree “On Agencies of the
Interior of the Republic of Kazakhstan” and of Article 30 of the Law of RK “On the Rights of the
Child in the Republic of Kazakhstan” in compliance with which children can be placed in Centers
of Rehabilitation and Adaptation without their consent and without a legal decision.

In this connection, with a view toward the protection of the constitutional rights of children, the
work group recommends that the Government of RK review the entire legislation and supplement
it with standards regarding the fact that any restriction of the freedom of a minor or restriction of
his right to freedom of movement can be imposed only by a court decision.

Current legislation does not stipulate any restrictions regarding the attendance of minors at
entertainment facilities (computer clubs etc.). Also, it does not mention the responsibility of the
owners of such entertainment facilities for rendering services to children in the night hours.

Thus, in reality, this sphere of public relationships is outside of legal control and numerous
problems of children point out to the need for the fastest legal regulation of all issues in the field
of these common relationships.

Law-enforcement practices of governmental agencies also revealed a number of gaps in the
current marriage and family legislation regulating issues of protection of the rights and interests of
children deprived of parental care.

According to some facts, the applied form of patronage care of children deprived of parental
care is not always for the sake of the child, but is aimed at the solution of material problems of
some individuals.

There are also known instances when children were passed to the guardianship and tutorship

of relatives who were interested only in obtainment of social benefit payments due to the child.

In our opinion, the rights and interests of children deprived of parental care should be protected
with a view of their upbringing to the greatest extent possible in conditions similar to a family and
with a view of their right to be brought up in a family. The problem of orphans has to be resolved
on the principle of “a family for each child” and not “a child for each family”. In this regard, the
preferred form of care for children deprived of parental care is the adoption.

Adoption is understood as a legal action, as a result of which adoptive parents and relatives

and the adopted child obtain the same rights and duties as blood parents and their children.

Adoption is permitted only with regard to minors, only for the sake of their interests; however,

the adoption of fleshly brothers and sisters by different people is not allowed.

In case of adoption, preference is given to citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan and children’s

relatives, regardless of their citizenship and place of residence.

The Law of RK “On Marriage and Family” upon determination of adoptive individuals does
not include stateless persons, which is an infringement of their constitutional rights (Part 2 of
Article 76 of the Law).

Adoption by foreigners should be viewed as an alternative method of care for a child when it

is impossible to provide any adequate method of care in the country of origin.

79

The opportunity for the adoption of children “by relatives regardless of their citizenship and
place of residence” is stipulated in the current Law of RK “On Marriage and Family”. However,
due to the fact that in practice, adoptable children usually have no such relatives, during the course
of investigation of adoption matters courts rarely apply this standard.

A review of judicial practices and actual facts shows that in every case of international
adoption, the foreign adoptive parents are helped by international or foreign non-governmental
organizations (agencies) for adoption.

At the same time, Article 100 of the current Law does not permit such activity of any

organizations for adoption, except for guardian and tutorial institutions.

With due consideration to the fact that agencies involved in adoption are licensed by foreign
states and are under their governmental control, as well as to the international adoption practice
realized in conformity with the Hague Convention of 1993 “On Protection of Children and Co-
operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption”, it would be necessary to permit these agencies to
participate in adoption provided that they are accredited and controlled by the government.

With the objective of resolving the issue of international adoption, presently, the opportunity
of the accedence of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the 1993 Hague Convention on international
adoption is being considered in the framework of the draft law, which is currently in the
Parliament.

The employment of socially vulnerable children, single mothers and graduates of family-
style children’s homes and youth homes is another problem. Therefore, we do not agree with the
legislator’s provision that stipulated the availability of only “mother” in children’s villages and
a governess in children’s family-style homes (Article 14 of the Law “On Children’s Villages of
Family Style and Youth Homes”.

In our opinion, the absence of a “father” in the home certainly distorts the child’s perception

of the surrounding world and his future independent life.

A special topic is the homelessness and neglect of children, the situation of children with
disabilities and provision of housing for children. Thus, Article 14 of the Law of RK “On the
Rights of the Child in the Republic of Kazakhstan” secures the right of the child to housing and
determines that the orphan child or the child left without the support of parents and living in
educational, health care, or other institutions has the right to ownership of living quarters or the
right to use the living quarters and in case of absence thereof has the right to obtainment of living
quarters in accordance with the housing legislation of Kazakhstan. Children deprived of parental
care including orphan children cannot be moved from their housing without the provision of other
housing.

Many violations were discovered in the activities of guardian and tutorial institutions, expressed
in inadequate work with regard to the detection and registration of children that are in difficult
situations in life and with regard to the protection of their valuable interests.

Thus, due to the negligence of local executive authorities and heads of children’s institutions,
the right to housing of orphan children and children deprived of parental care is not secured (as
provided for in Article 14 of the Law of RK “On the Rights of the Child in the Republic of
Kazakhstan”).

During the years 2007 and 2008 only, in the Republic 3,741 children have graduated from

children’s homes and 2,109, or 56% needed housing.

According to the Law of RK “On Housing Relations” (further referred to as “the Law”), only

58 people, or 2.7% of the above-mentioned number received housing.

After two years, these children upon their reaching the age of twenty years will lose the right

to the obtainment of housing, since the Law determines establishes this age limit.

Moreover, out of all the graduates who need housing, only orphan children have the right to
obtain housing from state housing facilities, since under Article 68 of the Law of RK “On Housing
Relations” this category comes under the list of socially protected classes of the population.

This group does not include children deprived of parental care (the parents of these children

have been deprived of parents’ rights, have refused them, or their location is unknown).

0

After graduation from children’s institutions, children of this category in most cases do not
have housing rights in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan or a permanent income and do
not receive social security benefit payments for loss of breadwinner.

Article 68 of the Law does not stipulate the obtainment of housing by children deprived of

parental care.

However, Article 14 of the Law of RK “On the Rights of the Child in the Republic of
Kazakhstan” secures this right for orphan children as well as for children left without the support
of parents.

In this regard, with the objective of securing the rights of children left without the support
of parents, we believe it is necessary to make related additions to the Law of RK “On Housing
Relations”.

The lack of specialists working in guardian and tutorial institutions is one of the main reasons for
the violation of the rights of minors. Local executive authorities have not implemented Paragraph
31 of the Plan of Activities of the Program “Children of Kazakhstan during 2007-2011” concerning
the increase of the number of specialists in protection of children’s rights and legitimate interests
in district and city departments, administrations and regional departments of education.

In accord with this Plan, solely in 2009, the sum of 217 million tenge was provided for these

purposes to 10 regions of the country.

However, not in one region was the number of personnel increased, since this sum of money

was not foreseen when local budgets were fixed.

The reason for this was the failure to take action on the alteration of the personnel limits
established by the Enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan of December
15, 2004 No. 1324 “On Some Issues of Approval of Personnel Limits of Local Executive
Authorities”.

At the beginning of 2008, the number of the population in the Republic less than 18 years
of age amounted to 5,021,456; however, the number of guardian and tutorial institutions is only
185.

On average, in the Republic there are 25,782 children per one specialist protecting their

rights.

At the same time, in world practice the number of specialists on protection of the rights of

children is determined on the basis of “one specialist per 5,000 children”.

In this connection, with the goal of implementation of the Plan of Activities of the Program
“Children of Kazakhstan during 2007-2011” and elimination of the conditions promoting breaches
of law and infringement of children’s rights, we suggest the consideration of needed changes to the
number of personnel approved by the Enactment of the Government of RK of December 15, 2004
No.1324 “On Some Issues of Approval of Personnel Limits of Local Executive Authorities”.

In a similar way, the issue of provision of governmental assistance to children left without the

support of living parents, so-called “social orphans”, is not resolved.

Up to the present, a procedure for the assignment and payment of social security benefit payments
for the child left without the support of parents to guardians and tutors is still not determined and
this hinders the transfer of the children from children’s homes to guardians’ families.

Thus, the existing problems and legislative gaps regarding issues of protection of the rights
and interests of children left without the support of parents, once again prove the need to continue
the laborious work of improvement of the mechanisms for the protection of children’s rights.

With the goal of effective protection of the rights of the child, we recommend that the
Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan
and other authorized governmental authorities and Akimats of all levels implement the
following activities during the years 2009-202:

1. Accelerate the adoption of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Marriage (Matrimony)

and Family”.

2. In 2010, ratify the Convention “On Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect
of Intercountry Adoption” (Hague, May 29, 1993) with the purpose of the complete protection



of children’s interests, security of his principle rights and freedoms, as well as for balanced
development of his personality in a family surrounding and control of the adoption of children by
foreign citizens.

3. In 2010, ratify the Convention for the Suppression of the Circulation of and Traffic in

Obscene Materials, September 12, 1923 (Geneva, with amendments of November 12, 1947).

4. In 2011, ratify the Convention on the Civil Aspects of Child Abduction (Hague, October 25,

1980).

5. In 2011, introduce the post of the National Ombudsman for the rights of the child with the

view of effective protection of children’s rights.

6. Make Amendments to the law “On Children’s Villages of Family Style and Youth Homes”
ensuring the involvement of a “father” as an educator along with the “mother” in the operation of
children’s villages.

7. Make related additions to the Law of RK “On Housing Relations” to secure the rights of

children left without the support of parents.

8. Legislatively transfer the functions of the commissions for problems of minors to local
executive authorities as well as the functions of guardian and tutorial institutions to the Committee
for Protection of the Rights of Children of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic
of Kazakhstan and to its local territorial agencies.

9. Establish specialized juvenile courts that would investigate criminal, civil and administrative

cases related to children’s rights in all the regions of Kazakhstan.

10. Relocate the administration of Centers of Temporary Isolation, Adaptation and
Rehabilitation for Minors (CTIARUC) from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Education
and Science.

11. Establish the position of district police inspectors for problems of minors (school policemen

who would serve educational institutions) at the expense of local budgets.

12. Legislatively restrict attendance by minors of entertainment facilities without accompanying

adults and to impose the absolute prohibition of such attendance in the night hours.

13. Organize compulsory and regular television programs in the State and district mass media

dedicated to the problems of families and children and traditions of family education.

Recommendations in the Sphere of Labor Legislation and Social Security Legislation of

the Republic of Kazakhstan:

1. It is advisable to elaborate the governmental program for the employment of minors on terms
of temporary employment during school holidays and spare time as well as to make amendments
and additions to legislation regarding the employment of minors.

2. Include a section on labor protection of youths (including minors) in legislation regarding

collective agreements.

3. It is necessary to resolve a number of unresolved problems in the sphere of elimination
of the worst forms of child labor. In particular, it is necessary to develop and legislatively ratify
mechanisms and procedures of detection of children involved in the worst forms of child labor,
becoming victims of various kinds of violence. Develop a governmental program for eradication
of the worst forms of child labor.

In the Field of Legislation regarding Health Protection of Minors:

1. Take actions to increase the number of children’s sports organizations and institutions for

the improvement of health for children’s summer vacations.

2. Revise the current system of disability ascertainment, recognizing disabled children as

those not able to work up to the age of 18 years (instead of 16).

2

In the Field of Educational Legislation:

1. In 2012, ratify the Convention against Discrimination in Education.
2. Implement into legislation the principle of equal opportunity of realization of the right to

education guaranteed by Article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

3. In harmony with Article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, introduce human

rights training into educational curricula.

4. Develop and ratify the Law “On the Governmental Standard of General Secondary Educa-
tion” and on the initiation of standard financing of educational institutions that are implementing
the educational standard.

5. Enhance the social status of teachers and their material security and improve the prestige of
teachers in society. Change over to a system of labor remuneration depending on one’s professional
skills, additional commitments, etc.

Rights of Women

A priority of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the field of foreign policy is integration into the

world community.

In the UN Millennium Declaration, which was signed in the year 2000 by the majority of
countries of the world, encouragement of the equality of men and women and expansion of rights
and opportunities for women are among the principal goals of human development in the third
millennium.

During the 17 years of its independence, Kazakhstan has made certain advancements in the

sphere of protection of the rights and legitimate interests of women and men.

In 1998, Kazakhstan ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women. In addition, the UN Conventions on the Political Rights of Women
and on the Nationality of Married Women have been ratified. In all, Kazakhstan has ratified more
than 60 multilateral international universal agreements on human rights.

It should be noted that in general, the experts of the UN Committee on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women have given the situation with regard to the protection of
women’s rights in Kazakhstan a positive assessment.

The enactment of the President of Kazakhstan of November 29, 2005 No. 1677 has approved
the Strategy of Gender Equality in the Republic of Kazakhstan for the years 2006-2016 (further
referred to as “the Strategy”).

The Strategy is an important document directed at the implementation of the gender policy of the
government and is an instrument of its implementation and monitoring on the part of the government
and civil society, an important factor of the development of democracy. The implementation of the
Strategy will promote conditions for equal realization of the rights of women and men and ensures
the resolution of the problems of achievement of equality of the rights and opportunities of men
and women during the period of 2006 through 2016.

. The Right to Security of Gender Equality in the Field of Labor, Employment and

Pension Security

It should be noted that TUFRK fulfils necessary work with the goal of protecting and acting
on behalf of employees – members of trade unions including working women. Some work on
security of the rights and guarantees of working women is being done by the trade union branches
of education and science; health care; culture; governmental institutions; communication, mining,



metallurgical and atomic industry; railway workers; and others; and by the regional trade unions of
the Aktyube, Akmola, Eastern Kazakhstan, Kostanay, Karaganda, Pavlodar and other regions.

The main task of the trade unions included in the TUFRK is the promotion of the development
of a socially oriented market economy and an actual democracy, the security of the economic and
social welfare of hired employees, both men and women.

The Trade Union Federation and its member organizations have given much attention to issues
of agreement and to solving the problems of working women in the conclusion of contracts at all
levels of social partnership.

To ensure the social security of this large category of the population, at the request of the
Trade Union Federation, in the General Agreement for the years 2007-2008, there was a special
chapter on the rights and guarantees of working women and youth. This promoted the role of trade
unions in the improvement of women’s situation and strengthened their positions in the production
sphere.

The requirement of the Trade Union Federation has been met regarding the compulsory
inclusion of special chapters determining social guarantees in branch (tariff) and regional
agreements and collective contracts for working women and regarding issues of employment, labor
and health protection, vocational training, vacation, treatment, health improvement of women and
enhancement of their material situation in the process of labor relations.

An analysis revealed that the conclusion of branch (tariff) and regional agreements and collective
contracts in organizations provide for higher quality and more realistic mutual obligations of both
parties to the provision of additional social guarantees for working women and in most cases these
contracts have been implemented.

During the last years, the Trade Union Federation and its member organizations required the
Government to implement practical plans on the improvement of women’s situation, to eliminate
all forms of discrimination, to promote economic independence of women and their equal access
to economic resources. On the initiative of the Trade Union Federation of Kazakhstan and the
Human Rights Commission under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Congress of
Working Women has been held.

The participants of the Congress passed the Resolution “Worthy Labor Rights and Social
Security for Women is a Characteristic of the State’s Welfare” and suggested the exemption of
employers from the obligation to pay benefits for maternity and birth.

Since January 1, 2008, the benefit payments for pregnancy and birth are paid from the state
social insurance fund and pension for working women will continue to be accumulated during
their maternity and child care leave for one year.

The draft Law “On Equal Rights and Equal Opportunities of Women and Men” provides
Articles obliging employers to implement special programs for the elimination of the discrepancy
in the labor remuneration of men and women by balancing their professional development and
eliminating jobs with low qualifications and poorly paid jobs. In addition, employers are obliged
to create labor conditions allowing the combination of work with family duties (introduction of a
flexible work schedule, part-time work, exemption from over-time work, advanced training during
work time). The employer bears administrative responsibility for non-observance or inadequate
observance of the legislation on equal rights and equal opportunities.

Current legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan prohibits the use of women’s labor for heavy
physical work and work in hazardous (especially hazardous) or dangerous (especially dangerous)
labor conditions. The list of productions, professions that require heavy physical work and work in
hazardous (especially hazardous) or dangerous (especially dangerous) labor conditions, in which
women and children under 18 years of age are prohibited to work has been confirmed.

Women can be employed for work in hazardous and dangerous labor conditions only after
a preliminary medical examination and ascertainment that they have no contraindications for
health and are in compliance with the requirements established by the legislative documents of the
authorized health care agency.

4

Pregnant women having a medical certificate are transferred to another job, excluding jobs

with unfavorable factors; however, their average monthly salary remains the same.

Young women who have been forced to discontinue their studies on account of pregnancy and

child care are provided with an academic leave, after which they can continue their studies.

In compliance with the Law “On Pension Security in the Republic of Kazakhstan”, women
retire five years earlier (at 58 years of age) than men (at 63 years of age). Women who gave birth
to 5 or more children and raised them until the age of 8 are granted the right to retire at 53 years of
age. Earlier, this right was granted only to women living in rural areas.

With due consideration to the international obligations of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the
sphere of human rights and to the demand of the domestic labor market, as well as in an effort to
exclude gender discrimination against women who will be retiring, we believe it is necessary to
legislatively secure the implementation of equal rights for retiring men and women and to give
women the right of choice to retire either at 58 years of age or at 63 years of age.

2. The Right to Freedom from Domestic Violence

The international community views the security of protection against family violence as one of
the most important tasks of the socially oriented state. The UN has developed Model Legislation
against family violence as a recommendation.

The Model Legislation recommended by the UN stipulates the extensive intervention in family
life, securing the protection of its members against violence, regardless of the presence or absence
of claims of suffering individuals to the police or social services.

As is well known, the Republic of Kazakhstan has assumed accountability to the world
community to prevent and to eradicate violence against women, children, the elderly and the
disabled. These categories of people are the most vulnerable and susceptible to family violence.

Presently, there is an urgent need for a Law ensuring the establishment of agencies involved in
the protection against family violence and having the right and opportunity to work in our specific
conditions, in which family violence is concealed from the social surroundings and the police try
to avoid family crisis situations. It is necessary to accelerate the consideration and adoption of the
Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Domestic Violence”.

. Rights of Women to Participate in the Government

Presently, the number of women in the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan is 13% of the
total number of deputies and in the Maslikhats – 17.1%. In developed countries of the European
Union, the number of women in representative authorities amounts to 30-33% of the total number
of deputies.

In harmony with Article 12 of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Government

Service”, no gender restrictions are permitted in the employment of government service.

The number of women in governmental executive agencies has increased and currently is
58%. The posts of political government employees, i.e. at the level of decision-making, are held
by only 7% women.

In harmony with the recommendations of the UN Committee for the Elimination of All Forms
of Discrimination against Women, we believe it is necessary to legislatively establish a quota
for women involved in the representative authorities at the amount of 30% of the total number
of deputies. In addition, it is necessary to increase the representation of women at the decision-
making level in governmental executive authorities.

4. Prevention of Trafficking in Women and Children

The Office of the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Kazakhstan jointly with the National
Security Committee and the Ministry of the Interior have reviewed the results of criminal
investigations related to human trafficking during 2008.



The review shows that during recent years, this type of crime tends to grow rapidly. According
to evaluations of the experts of the United Nations Organization and the International Organization
for Migration, the number of victims of human trafficking all over the world amounts to hundreds
of thousands and even millions (according statistics of American experts, it amounts to not less
than 700,000 every year and by other expert estimates it reaches 2 million people). Young women
are exported to Europe, America, Canada and countries of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. The
recipients of profit are transnational organizations of dealers and homosexuals. Not only are
women affected by the criminal business of human trafficking, but also a large part of this sector
of criminal economy is made up of child slavery.

According to information from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, more than
500,000 women have been sold from CIS countries. Human trafficking, especially in women and
children, became such a serious problem in Kazakhstan and a number of other countries that
it threatened both their security and their national gene pool. Organized networks of criminals,
regardless of their nationality and citizenship, support human trafficking.

It should be noted that there are many features that indicate that the problem has quite
explainable fundamental causes. First of all, there is the openness of the boundaries of the
Republic of Kazakhstan with CIS countries; second, the intensification of migration both between
the countries and inside Kazakhstan; third, the favorable economic situation and high salaries
in Kazakhstan in comparison with other former Soviet countries; and fourth, the globalization
of organized crime and expansion of its opportunities with regard to the establishment of stable
delivery channels of “living goods”, which view our country not only as a supplier but also as a
buyer and as a transit corridor.

Given the conditions of the increasing human traffic in our country, current legislation has been
supplemented with special legal provisions specifying criminal liability for the above-mentioned
types of unlawful activity.

Thus, on March 2, 2006, all articles of the Criminal Code of RK stipulating criminal liability
for crimes related to human trafficking were amended and supplemented (Articles 113, 125, 128
and 133 CC RK). The adopted Law to a large extent expanded the characteristics of corpus delicti
of this category and the penalties for these crimes were toughened.

Moreover, for the first time, the Criminal Code stipulates liability for the illegal removal of

organs and tissues from human corpses. (Article 275-1)

In harmony with the recommendation of the Human Rights Commission, in 2008 the following
Conventions were ratified: the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and
the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others, the 1926 Convention to Suppress the Slave Trade
and Slavery and its Protocol of 1953 and the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of
Slavery, Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery. In addition, based on the
recommendation of the Human Rights Commission, in 2008 the following documents were also
ratified: The Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and
Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime
and the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance.

An important role in combat against the criminal business based on human trafficking is
undoubtedly played by the Law “On Governmental Protection of Individuals Involved in Criminal
Procedure” of May 5, 2000, which stipulates a range of measures implemented in an effort to
ensure the security of protected individuals who, in accordance with the provision of Article 1 of
the Law, can be claimants, eye-witnesses, or victims of the crime.

The Law provides the legal basis for the protection of victims of human trafficking and members
of their families by means of their move to a new place of residence, replacement of documents,
change of appearance, individual bodyguards, protection of housing and property, provision of
special means of individual protection, communication and notification of danger, the ensuring of
confidentiality of information regarding the protected individual, change of place of work or study
and temporary placement in a safe location (Article 7 of the Law). This protection is provided to
both victims and their families.



A specialized department has been established in the MIA of RK for the purpose of the
systematic prevention, detection, disclosure and investigation of crimes in the field of illegal
migration, human trafficking and use of slave labor.

Procedural recommendations on the investigation of human traffic were developed. The
procedure indicates the criminal law qualifications, methods and procedures for the disclosure
and investigation of human trafficking, issues of interaction, tactical features of certain initial
investigative actions and the subsequent and final stages of investigation.

Statistical information on crimes in the field of human trafficking is as follows: in 2008,
agencies of the interior filed 20 criminal suits for instances of human trafficking crimes including
5 for the traffic of minors and 10 criminal suits for prostitution.

A review shows that these crimes are divided into two forms – sexual or labor exploitation.

The victims of the first group are mostly women of age 16-25.

The victims of the second group are men aged 20-35, mostly citizens of the Central Asian

countries of the CIS.

In addition, the coordination of combat against human trafficking is based on the orientation
of the law-enforcement and other agencies of the country toward detection of the causes and
conditions leading to the crimes.

The Interdepartmental Commission under the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan for
Combat against Illegal Export, Import and Human Trafficking (Enactment of the Government of
September 26, 2003 No. 983) is functioning.

Taking into account the transborder nature of human traffic, the Prosecutor General of RK is

working on the expansion of international treaties with foreign countries.

For the purpose of the complete security of women’s rights on the level of generally
acknowledged international standards, we recommend that the Government of the Republic
of Kazakhstan during the years 2009-202 implement the following measures:

1. Accelerate the adoption of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Domestic

Violence”.

2. In 2011, adopt the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Equal Rights and Equal

Opportunities of Women and Men”.

3. Legislatively secure the realization of equal rights of retiring men and women of age 58 or
63, with due consideration to the international obligations of the Republic of Kazakhstan in the
sphere of human rights and the demand of the domestic labor market.

4. Legislatively establish a quota for women working in representative governmental agencies
of the amount of 30% of the total number of deputies. Increase the representation of women at the
decision-making level in governmental executive agencies.

5. Practically implement the recommendations of the UN Convention on The Elimination
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, given after the consideration of reports by the
Republic of Kazakhstan regarding the fulfillment of the provisions of the Convention on The
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

6. In 2012, ratify the Convention “On Maternity Protection” of June 28, 1952.
7. In 2012, ratify the Convention concerning Equal Remuneration for Men and Women

Workers for Work of Equal Value of June 29, 1951.

8. Implement regular preventive activities aimed at the prevention and suppression of crimes

related to human trafficking, sexual, labor and other exploitation.

9. Establish shelters for women suffering from domestic violence, human trafficking and other

kinds of discrimination.

10. Implement in practice the recommendations of the OSCE Action Plan on Combating
Trafficking in Human Beings, which was ratified at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in
2003 in Maastricht.

11. Consider the possibility of establishing in Kazakhstan an Institute of National Reporter on

Human Traffic.

Rights of National Minorities

Presently, many countries of the world community face a new challenge. The economic crisis
all over the world has resulted in exacerbation of social, economic, political, ethnical and inter-
religious relations.

Complicated geopolitical relations are developing between the principal world strategic
participants of Eurasia and Central Asia and Kazakhstan are granted important roles owing to their
resources and strategic position in the region between the East and the West.

An open secret is that the rules of this political game become tougher, which is proved by
events in the Caucasus and the Middle East and by the spread of extremism and terrorism in the
world. The economic crisis looks more and more political and its impact in different countries
increasingly results in growth of intolerance and the tendency to take extreme measures.

The Head of State, Nursultan Nazarbayev, pointed out that the unity of the people of
Kazakhstan is the main condition for overcoming the crisis. In this respect, today as never before,
interethnic peace and harmony have become more meaningful for Kazakhstan and have become a
provision for social security and its development.

Under crisis conditions, even the greatest world powers realize that the unity of the people is
the main factor for the development of any country and for overcoming the threats and challenges
of the modern world. We were eyewitnesses that the day before the inauguration of President
Barack Obama, the USA held the “We the United People Walk”.

Another important task in the achievement of the unity of the people is the cultivating of
patriotism in Kazakhstan. In this regard, it is difficult to overestimate the role of the Assembly of
Nations of Kazakhstan.

The next vital task with regard to the preservation of the unity of the nation is the cultivation

of tolerance.

Even now, tolerance is characteristic of the people of Kazakhstan and it is necessary to fully

protect Kazakhstan’s society against any attempts to destroy it.

Governmental policy in the sphere of interethnic relations in Kazakhstan is based on five

crucial principles:

- Ethnic, religious, cultural and language variety is an invaluable treasure;
- The Government creates all the conditions necessary for the development of culture and

languages;

- The most important values of the nation have become tolerance and responsibility;
- The consolidating role of the prevailing ethnic group;
- The unity of the people.
These principles are proven in practice, are tailored to every individual situation and can be

applied in any country.

Kazakhstan’s policy in the field of interethnic relations is also being built in strict compliance
with international human rights standards. In particular, the Republic of Kazakhstan has acceded
to many multilateral universal international agreements in the field of human rights.

In this respect, Russian experts (N. Haritonova, A. Vlasov, R. Nazarov and others – The
Informational and Analytical Center of the Moscow State University) point out that the legislation
of Kazakhstan completely meets the requirements of the principal agreements in the field of security
of the ethnic rights of citizens, such as the document of the 1992 Copenhagen Conference on the
Human Dimension, the Hague Recommendations Regarding the Education Rights of National
Minorities (1996), the Oslo Recommendations Regarding the Linguistic Rights of National
Minorities (1998), the Lund Recommendations on Effective Participation of National Minorities
in Public Life (1999) and the OSCE Guidelines on the use of Minority Languages in the Broadcast
Media (2003).



In whole, the trend and nature of ethnic policy in Kazakhstan is increasingly affected by
commonly acknowledged standards of international law establishing the basic criteria of human
rights.

Like the majority of OSCE countries, Kazakhstan adopted the special legal documents for
implementation of ethnic policy, since the legislative security of ethnic rights is the most effective
way of their protection.

Thus, the Law “On Languages in the Republic of Kazakhstan” meets the recommendation
of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities made to countries in the course of
establishing ethnic policy. The Government pays much attention to teaching the languages of
ethnic groups and arranging studies in these languages. In Kazakhstan, there are 88 schools where
studies are completely held in the Uzbek, Tajik, Uighur and Ukrainian languages. In 108 schools,
the languages of 22 ethnic groups of Kazakhstan are taught as a self-standing discipline. 195
special ethnological linguistic centers are functioning where all who apply can learn the languages
of 30 ethnic groups. More than 7,000 people are currently studying in these centers. In the opinion
of specialists, one of the most developed educational systems for ethnic languages has been created
in Kazakhstan.

In accordance with the Government Program for functioning and development of languages for
the years 2001- 2010, the government supports the teaching of native languages to representatives
of ethnic groups. Funds allocated for the financing of Sunday schools keep increasing. To improve
the knowledge of the Kazakh language, students of the Sunday schools annually arrange Summer
Camps for the Kazakh language.

35 newspapers and magazines in 11 languages of Kazakhstan’s ethnic groups are published
in Kazakhstan with a printing of over 80,000, not counting Kazakh and Russian mass media and
radio programs are being conducted in 8 languages and television programs in 7 languages.

In addition to Kazakh and Russian theaters, in Kazakhstan there are four other national theaters
– Uzbek, Uighur, Korean and German. Moreover, three of them are unique in the territory of the
CIS and the Baltic countries.

Legal safeguards and the respectful attitude toward all languages in full measure protect the
inherent right of ethnic groups to develop their languages and culture. Based on the study of the
language policy in Kazakhstan during 2005-2006 done by OSCE agencies, on December 12, 2006
the OSCE Office of High Commissioner on National Minorities declared that the language policy
in Kazakhstan was the most loyal of all former Soviet countries.

Small ethnic groups in the territory of Kazakhstan such as Assyrians, Iranians, Nogai and
Dungans also have all possible opportunities to develop their language and culture. This is especially
exemplary given the fact that, according to the latest information of the UNESCO language atlas,
out of 7,000 existing languages in the world, 2,511 are under threat of disappearance.

In whole, ethnic and language problems in Kazakhstan are being resolved in line with the

civilized standards applied by the OSCE member countries.

Ethnic aspects prevail in all economic, social, political and spiritual developments of modern
Kazakhstan and fill an important place in the activity of the Head of State and agencies of
governmental authority and management.

In answer to the question posed by KISI research, “On which individual of public society do
you rest your hopes regarding the resolution of interethnic relations in the Republic?” the absolute
majority of experts named the President (94%). Obviously, this is explained by the fact that, in the
opinion of the experts and the majority of the population, the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan
Nazarbayev, is a real guarantor of interethnic and social stability and personifies and defines the
policy of the state including the policy in the field of interethnic relations.

For comparison, the following are the results of the sociological study done by the Association
of Sociologists of Kazakhstan with regard to the evaluation of institutions ensuring human rights:
84.4% of respondents positively evaluated the work of the President of Kazakhstan in the field of

9

human rights, the courts (72.4%), the Prosecutor General’s Office (65.7%), the police (59.2%) and
NGOs (52.9%). These facts prove that the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan is the guarantor
of the rights and freedoms of humans and citizens and that he ensures the coordinated functioning
of all branches of governmental authority and responsibilities of governmental agencies to the
people.

In the course of preparation for Kazakhstan’s chairmanship of the OSCE, in the second half
of February 2009, in Brussels, a “round table” was held on the subject: “The Way to Europe:
Preparation of Kazakhstan for the Chairmanship of the OSCE in 2010” arranged jointly with the
Center for European Policy and the Institute for Strategic Studies in Brussels.

This activity showed that the European countries placed high expectations on the chairmanship
of Kazakhstan. In particular, the special representative of the European Union for Central Asian
countries, Pierre Morel, emphasized that the role of Kazakhstan as a future chairman of the OSCE
was very important since Kazakhstan should be worthy of its choice, which will affect the entire
Central Asian region. He pointed out that Kazakhstan as a chairman faces serious challenges – the
fight against drug traffic from Afghanistan, the increase of public awareness on this problem, the
regulation of water resources in Central Asia and others.

Within the framework of the 17th annual session of the Parliament Assembly (PA) of the OSCE
in Astana, the High Commissioner of the Parliament Assembly of the OSCE, Knut Vollebek, stated,
“as a chairman of the OSCE in 2010, Kazakhstan could play great role in the solution of interethnic
problems”. However, he noted that today, OSCE countries face challenges related to the variety of
ethnic groups, globalization and relations between various religions.

Upon the adoption of the Law “On the Assembly of Nations of Kazakhstan”, the Assembly
became one of the unique key components of the political system of Kazakhstan and acquired
constitutional status and representation in the highest legislative body of Kazakhstan. Decisions
of the Assembly’s sessions are subject to compulsory consideration by governmental agencies and
officials.

The UN Under-Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information, Kiyotaka
Akasaka, confirmed that the experience of the Assembly of Nations of Kazakhstan with the
objective of international and inter-religious harmony was very important and relevant to the whole
world community. (Before the positive evaluation of the interethnic situation in Kazakhstan was
given by the UN ex-Secretary General Kofi Annan, ex-Prime Minister of Great Britain, Margaret
Thatcher, the President of France Jacques Chirac, the President of the Swiss Confederation Pascal
Couchepin and others).

Welcoming the efforts of Kazakhstan to increase the representation of national minorities in
the Majilis of the Parliament of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the OSCE High Commissioner K.
Vollebek expressed his concern that 9 members of the Assembly of Nations of Kazakhstan (ANK)
were elected by the members of ANK and not by the nation-wide voting and that this situation
did not fully comply with international standards; in particular, with the provisions of the OSCE
Copenhagen document.

In this regard, Mr. K. Vollebek has suggested rendering expert assistance for further improvement
of the system of ANK representation in the Parliament of RK. For this purpose, the parties agreed
to discuss this issue at a “round table” with the experts of ODIHR/OSCE with participation of
representatives of ANK, Parliament and lawyers.

It should be noted that Kazakhstan, on principle, evaded the quota of representation along
ethnic lines. The Deputies of Parliament elected from the Assembly represent the interest of all of
Kazakhstan’s ethnic groups and not just one of them. This allows pursuing a united ethnic policy
on a national scale.

The fact that the Chairman of the Assembly is the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan
himself – guarantor of the Constitution and human rights – proves that the ethnic groups of
Kazakhstan possess all necessary instruments for the realization of their interests and that in the
country there are all necessary prerequisites for the balanced development of ethnic relations.

90

Experienced gained by Kazakhstan in the framework of this model was used in Russia, which

pursues a similar ethnic policy.

Kazakhstan’s chairmanship of the OSCE falls in a period of complicated dialogue between the

East and the West and misunderstandings are worsened with the global economic crisis.

At the same time, problematic developments continue on the European territory of the OSCE
related to the migration from countries of Africa, the Near and Middle East, Central and South-
Eastern Asia and China, to the expansion of Islam in Europe and to the adaptation of migrants.

In this regard, Kazakhstan is ready, not only to keep on playing the role of initiator of continuous

dialogue between civilizations, cultures and religions, but also to act as its champion.

Kazakhstan has already made the first steps: in Astana, the international forum took place
entitled “Common World: Progress Through Diversity” with the participation of the Ministers
of Foreign Affairs of Muslim and Western countries. Presently, cooperation with the group “The
Alliance of Civilizations” is being intensified, relationships are developing in the framework of the
Congress of World Religions and new outlooks for inter-parliament cooperation, possibly within
the framework of “The Group of the Wise”, are presenting themselves.

Issues of ethnic policy and interethnic relations are of special importance for the Republic of
Kazakhstan owing to the variety of ethnic groups living there. Representatives of 130 nationalities
live on its territory. According to information from the latest population census in Kazakhstan
(February 2009), 67% of the population is ethnic Kazakh.

All the historical wealth and uniqueness of cultures and languages of nations of the Republic of
Kazakhstan make up the common property of Central Asia, the CIS and all of mankind. Interethnic
relations in the Republic of Kazakhstan in whole are characterized by stability and sustainability,
which is explained on one hand by reasons of objectiveness and historicity and, on the other hand,
by subjective and political reasons. As a result of the centuries-old interaction of Turkic, Slavic and
other nations on the territory of the Republic, settled traditions of mutual respect and tolerance have
been formed. However, interethnic peace and harmony is continuously sustained by the reasonable
national policy of the governmental authorities of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

It should be noted that there are situations when some representatives of ethnic groups turn the
crimes and administrative offences committed by individuals of other nations into the category of
interethnic collision and exaggerate such facts by means of mass media, concealing the essence of
the crimes themselves.

The Government does not try to assimilate all nations into some kind of uniform nation and
refuses any kind of artificial separation of the non-native population. Kazakhstan advocates that
every nation should live a full life, revive its traditions, culture and language and that all the people
of Kazakhstan have equal rights and opportunities regardless of their nationality, language, or
religion and feel that they are citizens of independent Kazakhstan and are proud of this. Today,
the positive experience of our Republic in the preservation of interethnic harmony is supported
and studied by a number of CIS countries, the Baltic countries, Eastern Europe and other foreign
countries.

According to the results of the sociological studies conducted by the Association of Sociologists
of Kazakhstan within the framework of this National Human Rights Action Plan, 56.8% of
respondents positively evaluated the protection of the rights of national minorities in Kazakhstan
and 14.8% of respondents think that the rights of national minorities in Kazakhstan are poorly
protected. 28.5% of respondents found it difficult to evaluate the situation in the field of protection
of the rights of national minorities.

In harmony with the Constitution and the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Governmental
Service” (further referred to as “the Law”), the citizens of the Republic including representatives
of all national minorities have the right to equal access to governmental service. Requirements
for candidates of governmental servants depend only on the nature of job responsibilities and are
stipulated by the Law.

9

In accord with Paragraph 1 of Article 12 of the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On
Governmental Service”, the right to hold administrative governmental office belongs to citizens of
the Republic of Kazakhstan. The administrative governmental office is competitive.

However, equal access to governmental positions is granted on the basis of competitions, which
include a series of consecutive phases: the publication of the announcement of the competition in
the Kazakh and the Russian languages, an examination with regard to knowledge of the legislation
of the Republic of Kazakhstan in either the Russian or in the Kazakh languages and an individual
interview.

In conformity with the provision of Article 12 of the Law On Governmental Service, no
restrictions are permitted for employment in governmental service with regard to gender, race,
nationality, language, social origin, property status, place of residence, attitude to religion, beliefs,
membership in public unions, or any other circumstances.

The main condition for employment and realization of governmental service by citizens of the
Republic of Kazakhstan is their compliance to the Standard Qualifying Requirements for offices
approved by the order of the Chairman of Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for governmental
service.

It should be noted that on August 20, 2004, during the 65th session of the UN Committee on
the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, a report by the Republic of Kazakhstan
on implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination was discussed with the participation of a Kazakhstan delegation. In whole, the UN
Committee positively evaluated Kazakhstan’s report. Experts of the UN Committee emphasized
that necessary conditions for the peaceful co-existence of various ethnic groups and religious have
been created in Kazakhstan.

The joint fourth and fifth regular reports on the implementation of the International Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination by the Republic of Kazakhstan were
approved by the Enactment of the Government of RK of July 17, 2008 No. 701 and through the
Ministry of the Interior were sent for consideration by the UN Committee on the Elimination of
All Forms of Racial Discrimination.

Thus, in the Republic, all necessary conditions have been created to satisfy the needs of
representatives of all national minorities and to balance interethnic relations. Measures for the
protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the national minorities of
Kazakhstan comply with the standards of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging
to National, Ethnic, Religious, or Linguistic Minorities and the CIS Convention concerning the
Rights of Persons Belonging to National Minorities.

With the purpose of securing the rights of national minorities guaranteed by the Constitution
of the Republic of Kazakhstan and international legislation, we recommend that the Government
of the Republic of Kazakhstan implement the following activities into practice during the years
2010-2012:

1. In an effort to implement the requirements of Article 4 of the International Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopt the special Law of RK “On
Counteraction of Racial (National) Discrimination”, or legislatively determine the administrative
and criminal liability of individuals promoting racial (national) or ethnic superiority or displaying
racial discrimination against other individuals.

2. In 2012, ratify the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All

Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families.

3. Consider the possibility of including the history and culture of national minorities in the list

of compulsory disciplines in the curriculum of secondary public schools.

4. Ratify the CIS Convention concerning the Rights of Persons Belonging to National

Minorities of October 21, 1994.

92

Legal Education of the Population

The effectiveness of governmental rights protection mechanisms directly depends on the level

of public legal awareness and legal education of the population of the country.

The objective of legal education is to educate a free personality who is conscious of his/her
legal interests and is able to require the firm political and legal guarantee of their realization. Only
in this case is it possible to achieve a sustainable receptiveness of the law-enforcement system of
the country to public needs, the responsiveness and rationality of all its levels. The active position
of the individual is manifested not so much during periods of election campaigns as in everyday
life when in various situations an individual faces a choice of behavior and methods of solution of
problems that have arisen.

In conditions of a low legal awareness, a favorable environment for corruption violations and

crimes is created.

Activity in the sphere of formation of higher legal awareness should take place in two directions,
oriented toward the improvement of the quality of education of professional lawyers and the legal
education of employees of governmental agencies and the legal education of the population.

It is necessary to admit that the general increase of the number of institutions and faculties of
law, which often do not have adequate teaching staff and relevant training of logistics specialists,
has resulted in the oversaturation of the market of legal services with unqualified specialists and a
general worsening of quality of legal service of the population.

An important form of implementation of legal policy in the field of human rights is the
organization of the education of lawyers who will staff new formations for the protection of human
rights and freedoms of citizens. This course is promising, since it aims at the personal capacity of
legal policy in the aspect of its formation.

The given course for the improvement of the effectiveness of judicial and law-enforcement
activities is the basis of a Concept of Reformation of Higher Legal Education in the country, which
should be approved by a Decree of the President of RK.

Governmental expenditures in the sphere of legal education should be sufficient and reasonable
from the point of view of the government’s interests and for the formation of civil society and the
protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals. In other words, the structure for the education
of lawyers should be scientifically based, justifiable and predictable.

Special attention should be given to the quality of education of lawyers in institutes of higher
education and colleges and to the problems of licensing and certification of educational institutions,
the establishment of courses for professional development and the probation of young lawyers. It
is advisable to introduce a compulsory probation of individuals who have obtained an advocacy
license.

Today, many problems of the government and society in the legal sphere to a large extent can
be explained by the lack of purposeful training of lawyers for the resolution of real-life problems.
It is extremely important to motivate institutions of higher education to train lawyers in
particular specialties. Along with the objective of employment in law-enforcement agencies, it
is also necessary to emphasize the education of legal specialists for advocacy, legal offices of
governmental and commercial structures, banks, etc.

For instance, while there is general growth the number of lawyers being educated, there is
no specialized training of military lawyers or prosecutors. For such legal specializations, there
are no opportunities for continuous education, i.e. initial training, retraining and professional
development.

In an effort to raise the level of legal awareness, to improve the forms and methods of legal
explanatory work and to enhance the efficiency of legal education, “The Program for Legal
Explanatory Work, Increase of Legal Awareness, Legal Education and Training of Citizens for
the years 2009-2011” was developed and approved by the Enactment of the Government of the
Republic of Kazakhstan of November 29, 2008, No. 1116.

9

This program provides for the development of suggestions regarding amendments and additions
to legislation regulating issues of legal explanatory work of governmental agencies and officials,
development and implementation of rules for the procedure for legal education of the population,
development and implementation of compulsory minimal legal education of certain categories of
people and other activities aimed at the cultivation of respect for human rights.

With the purpose of explanation of the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan, on November
27, 2008, the Cooperative Order of the Prosecutor General and the Ministry of Justice concerning
interaction for the explanation of the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan was adopted.

In addition, briefings of mass media for explanation of current legislation and by-laws of
the Republic of Kazakhstan are held. Thus, in 2008, briefings for explanation of the Law “On
Amendments and Additions to Some Legislative Documents Concerning the State Registration of
Legal Entities and Accounting Registration of Branches and Representative Offices” were held.

A survey conducted by experts of the Association of Sociologists of Kazakhstan in the
framework of the project “Human Rights in Kazakhstan: The General Opinion” revealed that
52.6% of respondents out of 1,500 believed that in Kazakhstan there is no information on human
rights and opportunities to protect them. Only one third of respondents (30.7%) are satisfied with
the information content on human rights and opportunities of their protection, while 16.7% of
respondents found it difficult to answer. The results obtained allow the conclusion that there is a
need for legal education of the population and creation of affordable centers of legal information.
The Digital Library for human rights may become one such affordable information center for
human rights.

On September 27, 200, in Astana, the Digital Library of the Human Rights Commission
under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan was launched, which ensures free access
to legal information for the population of Kazakhstan. Support of the Digital library on the
territory of the country is entrusted to the National Academic Library of the Republic of Kazakhstan
(NAL RK). The documents of the library are accessible through http://hrc.nabrk.kz in the Kazakh,
Russian, French and English languages.

The creation of the Digital Library is a part of the preparation of the National Human Rights
Action Plan. It was created jointly with the UNDP in Kazakhstan, the UNESCO Cluster Office in
Almaty and the Human Rights Commission under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

It should be noted that the digital library of the Human Rights Commission is an
innovative step by the Baltic countries, Eastern Europe, the CIS and Central Asia towards
the improvement of access to legal information and education in the field of human rights for
everybody by means of open public services.

Important characteristics of the digital library are: many languages, usability and volume
(more than 1000 documents chosen on the basis of complaints of the population to the Human
Rights Commission Secretariat with regard to violations of human rights).

The foremost target group is rural communities and the most vulnerable sections of the
population – the persons with disabilities, pensioners, women, children, the poor and those groups
of the population that do not have the access to legal information. For this purpose, there is a “How
to” section of the library which includes over 70 conceptual categories systematizing human rights
knowledge. Each of the categories includes frequently asked questions.

The Digital Library can greatly increase the human rights awareness of the population and

become an effective educational tool.

The open-source software Greenstone, developed by the University of Waikato, New Zealand,

was provided to UNESCO http://www.greenstone.org.

There are two possible modes of access to the digital library:
- On the Internet – online,
- Offline – at a local computer or through a local computer network.
The Digital Library does not require professional skills in the field of information technologies

and has built-in open-source mapping and development tools.

94

On a vast territory with a small population, information and communication technologies are

the most effective way of dissemination of information.

The digital library is distributed in district, regional and village libraries by means of the
library network of the Ministry of Culture and Information by the National Academic Library of
the Republic of Kazakhstan. It is also a center for free access to legal information, ensuring the
updating and support of the digital library on its server.

By now, the Human Rights Digital Library of the Akimat and Maslikhat of Almaty has been
successfully launched with the support of the Human Rights Commission, the UNDP and the
UNESCO Cluster Office in Almaty.

With the purpose of increasing the awareness of the population of their rights and duties
as well as the level of legal awareness and education of the population, we recommend that
the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Akimats of districts and the city of
Astana to implement the following activities during the years 2009-202:

1. Develop and adopt the Concept of Reformation and Improvement of Higher Legal Education

in Kazakhstan.

2. Develop the schoolbook “Human Rights in Kazakhstan” in the state and Russian languages

for secondary public schools, colleges and institutes of higher education.

3. Regularly highlight in mass media the essential issues concerning the protection of human
rights and publish booklets on human rights in case of detention, arrest, conclusion of agreements,
entrance to institutes of higher education, employment, dismissal, etc.

4. Regularly hold “round tables” with authorized governmental authorities and courses on the

subject “Legal Education as an Obstacle to Corruption”, highlighted in mass media.

5. Regularly hold seminars and training in the field of human rights for criminal prosecution

employees as well as for other governmental agencies.

6. Amend the Program “The Program for Expository Work, Increase of Legal Awareness,
Legal Education and Training of Citizens for the year 2009-2011”, approved by the enactment
of the Government of RK of November 29, 2008 No. 1116, to include measures aimed at the
information and technical support of the function of the Digital Library of the Human Rights
Commission.

7. We recommend that the Ministry of Culture and Information assist in the establishment of
data receiving centers of the Digital Library in all cities, regions and rural localities by means of
the library network of the country.

8. We recommend that the Ministry of Justice jointly with the National Academic Library
ensure the continuous updating of the Digital Library database, located on the web-site of the
National Academic Library RK: http://hrc.nabrk.kz with legislation by thematical division or title,
in the state and Russian languages.

9. We recommend that the Ministry of Culture and Information jointly with the Human Rights
Commission under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan continue the work on dissemination
of the Digital Library of the Human Rights Commission under the President RK in all regions of
the country.

10. We recommend that the Akimats of districts and the city of Astana take necessary actions

on creation and launching of a regional Digital Library in the following order:

No.

Rights of Individuals in Socially Protected Sections
of the Population to the Receipt of Free Qualified Legal Assistance

When discussing the problem of the ineffectiveness of the judiciary system, the mass media and
the public usually name such reasons as corruption, insufficient financing of courts, imperfection
of legislation and others. At the same time, they forget that one of the aspects of this problem is
the fact that not all citizens have the possibility to protect their rights in the court or to go to court.
Rarely do pensioners win legal trials on housing disputes and claims of incorrect computation of
pensions. These are the most complicated disputes, which require a qualified lawyer during the
course of filing of a statement of claim and during the process itself. However, such lawyers are
not affordable for the majority of the population and there is no the system for the provision of free
legal assistance in civil cases as stipulated by Paragraph 3 of Article 13 of the Constitution of the
Republic of Kazakhstan; and although there are legislation and institutes for the securing of the
human right to qualified legal assistance, there is no mechanism for its implementation.

To implement this constitutional provision, it is necessary to adopt an individual Law “On
Provision of Free Qualified Legal Assistance” which would establish certain standards with
regard to the allocation of budgetary funds to the advocates, since currently, legal assistance is not
reimbursed on time due to the imperfection of the legislation.

It is necessary to give attention to the provision of free qualified legal assistance to needy
citizens and first of all in rural localities. This was stated by the President of the Republic of
Kazakhstan at the 4th Congress of Judges. In this regard, it is necessary to support the idea of
the creation of Centers for Legal Consultations (CLC) in all regions and the cities of Astana and
Almaty. This will not require the adoption of a special law. Its implementation is possible with an
enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Resolution of this problem is the
responsibility of the Committee of Registration Service and Legal Assistance to the Population
of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan, since according to the Provision it is in
charge of implementation and supervision in the field of the organization and provision of legal
assistance to the population. So, it is possible to indicate in the Provision that the main function
of the Center is the provision of qualified legal assistance to the population by advocates working

9

for legal consulting offices of the region (city) or district and to stipulate that the government, per
agreement, should pay for free legal assistance, transferring the sum from the government budget
to the legal consulting offices which would account for the allocated money.

In addition, based upon the experience of Lithuania in the provision of the legal assistance
to needy citizens, we recommend that the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan establish
special departments for free legal assistance in the departments of justice of the districts and cities
of Astana and Almaty, which would conclude agreements with the advocates for the provision of
free legal assistance to socially vulnerable sections of the population. It is necessary to stipulate
the budget financing of free qualified legal assistance, the procedure for the provision of legal
assistance to socially vulnerable sections of the population and the monitoring of the provided
assistance in the Law “On Provision of Free Qualified Legal Assistance”.

The Improvement of the Status of Lawyers

Bringing legislation regarding the practice of law into harmony with international standards
requires that everyone is in agreement that the activity of lawyers is considered as qualified legal
assistance provided on a professional basis by individuals having received the status of lawyer
according to the procedure established by law, provided to physical and legal entities with the
purpose of protection of their rights, freedoms and interests as well as the provision of access to
justice. The bar is a professional community of lawyers and as an institution of civil society does
not belong to the system of governmental authorities and management. It operates on the principles
of legality, independence, self-government, corporatism and equal rights.

Unfortunately, the legal status of lawyers has almost not changed at all since the time of the
former Soviet Union. Until now, lawyers are not able to collect evidence in criminal cases and
their petitions and complains are often ignored by agencies of investigation and prosecution and by
the courts. The general accusatory trend prevailing in the activity of the court in most cases turns
the efforts of lawyers to protect the rights of their clients and principals into a senseless waste of
time.

In this regard, it is necessary to raise the legal status of lawyers by taking the following

measures:

Legislatively prohibit the criminal, civil and administrative prosecution of lawyers for actions

taken by them during the course of their professional work on certain cases.

Legislatively prohibit investigation with regard to lawyers concerning their fulfillment of
professional duties as well as the confidential cooperation of lawyers with agencies involved in
investigation.

Impose a ban on the violation of the inviolability of correspondence, documentation, telephone

conversations, offices and homes of lawyers.

Legislatively cancel the ban on the participation of lawyers not having so-called “special
permits” from agencies of national security in cases related to government secrets, as this restricts
the constitutional right of citizens to protection.

Establish a special procedure for the filing of a criminal case against lawyers providing

additional guarantees against pressure and illegal prosecution.

Provide lawyers with free access to the facilities of law-enforcement agencies and courts,

during the course of their professional work and revoke bureaucratic restrictions.

With the objective of improvement of legal assistance at the expense of the government
budget, organize the direct financing of such assistance by means of a single authorized agency,
the the Ministry of Justice and revoke the transfer of money to lawyers by agencies of criminal
prosecution and the courts.

It should be noted that presently, there are not lawyers to ensure legal assistance in court. In
order to increase the number of lawyers and improve their status, it is necessary to revoke the
licensing of lawyers by a governmental agency and to entrust the issue of qualification of lawyers

97

to a board of experts of the bar association, which would comply with international norms and
standards.

In an effort to secure the rights of individuals in socially protected sections of the population
to the receipt of free qualified legal assistance, we recommend the Government of RK implement
the following measures during the years 2009-2012:

1. Secure the right of each individual to the receipt of free qualified legal assistance regardless

of the nationality of the individual that needs such assistance.

2. Based on the principles of humanism, competitiveness of parties and presumption of
innocence, legal assistance in criminal and administrative cases should be provided freely to any
individual who petitioned for it. We believe that in civil cases, it is necessary to provide free legal
assistance of a certain extent to definite categories of people such as the persons with disabilities,
poor, pensioners, mothers of many children and single mothers and also to determine the types of
civil cases for which it would be possible to provide legal assistance at the expense of the budget,
for instance, disputes with governmental agencies, labor disputes, etc.

3. Develop and adopt the Law of RK “On Provision of Free Qualified Legal Assistance”
before October 1, 2011; the developer of the draft law should be the Ministry of Justice of the
Republic of Kazakhstan.

Human Rights in the Stage of Preliminary Investigation and Inquest

A review of supervisory activities and law-enforcement practices including issues regarding
complaints of illegal actions by employees of law-enforcement agencies shows that until now,
violations of the constitutional rights of citizens are widespread, such as: illegal detention,
unwarrantable entry and search of homes and unlawful methods of investigation such as the use of
violence and other degrading treatments.

As was mentioned earlier, the existing violations are the result of a poor system for the

assessment of the activities of law-enforcement agencies.

Other important factors are the issue of selection and placement of personnel and the insufficient

logistical support of criminal prosecution agencies.

Experience shows that often, violation of the constitutional rights of citizens is permitted due
to the inadequate fulfillment of job responsibilities, a low level of professional training of officers
of criminal investigation and sometimes their lack of elementary knowledge of criminal procedural
legislation and international legislation ratified by Kazakhstan.

These disadvantages lead to so-called “procedural oversimplification”: collection of evidence
for criminal cases is not handled properly and investigation is surrounded by red tape, which
results in illegal procedural decisions and as a result, violation of the rights of citizens involved in
a criminal case.

It is necessary to develop and implement an effective system of professional development of
law-enforcement employees, the priorities of which will be professionalism, compliance with law
and a feeling of obligation and responsibility to citizens and the government.

The supervision of the public prosecutor over the of observance of the constitutional rights
of an individual begins at the moment when a citizen and agencies of criminal prosecution enter
into a relationship, i.e. from the moment when these agencies receive information regarding crime
that is intended, is being committed, or has been committed, or the moment when a charge by an
individual has been filed.

Experience shows that violations of citizens’ rights in the sphere of criminal investigation are
mainly related to the infringement of constitutionally provided guaranties such as the inviolability
of private life, privacy of correspondence, telephone conversations, telegraphic communications
and post, as well as the right to inviolability of the home.

9

In this regard, prosecution agencies act as the only authority, which, in accordance with Article
83 of the Constitution, ensures the supervision of the observance of the rights and freedoms of
citizens by law-enforcement agencies during the course of criminal investigation.

Due to the uniqueness of criminal investigation activity, existing methods for monitoring the
observance of human and civil rights are not always applicable and governmental control is limited
by departmental control. The issue of protection of citizens’ rights is also problematic due to the
lack of opportunities and the right to access to the records of investigation departments.

An effective way to suppress and prevent violations of the right to personal freedom is regular
inspections carried out by public prosecutors and the Human Rights Commission of the legitimacy
of detention of individuals and their stay in temporary jails or official buildings. Such inspections
are carried out unexpectedly, including during the night, on holidays and on weekends.

As a result, in recent years, instances of the illegal detention of citizens on the basis of Article
132 of CCP RK have been reduced in the country. On the other hand, more instances have been
uncovered of the illegal arrest of individuals and their detainment in official buildings, including
offices, basements and gymnasiums.

In 2008, public prosecutors have released 850 individuals who were illegally arrested and
detained in official buildings of the criminal investigation authorities. 44 criminal cases were filed
with regard to instances of violation of the constitutional rights of citizens and 24 of them were
brought to suit.

As a result of 39,255 inspections done during the last period, 1,317 individuals were released
from temporary jails due to the absence of reasons for application of such restraint, 31 were released
due to the unconfirmed suspicion of committing a crime and 17 were released due to the violation
of provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure during the course of arrest.

The statistics regarding crime detection (detection of the crimes stipulated by Article 347-1 of
the criminal Code of RK) prove that there is an urgent need to implement the recommendations of
the UN Committee against Torture in legislation and law-enforcement practice.

Presently, the majority of the recommendations of the Committee are not yet implemented:
• There is no efficient mechanism for the swift, impartial and complete investigation of claims

or complaints of torture and cruel treatment;

• In practice, the complete observance of the principle of inadmissibility of evidence obtained

by application of torture and cruel treatment is not guaranteed;

• There is no independent inspection of places of preliminary imprisonment and no judicial

control of the duration and conditions of preliminary imprisonment;

• Recommendations of the UN Committee against Torture are not publicized.
In whole, the review of the situation in the field of preliminary investigation and inquest
reveals that there is a need for further improvement of legislation and law-enforcement practices
with the objective of the enhancement of security of the rights and freedoms of an individual and
citizen who came to be involved in criminal legal proceedings.

It is necessary to specify in detail the actions of investigators and operating officers during
the course of the detention of individuals suspected of a crime, their delivery to the agencies of
internal affairs (National Security Committee, financial police, etc.), imprisonment in a temporary
jail and initial questioning. It is necessary to establish stricter requirements and intensify the
responsibility of individuals carrying on a criminal lawsuit regarding timely explanation to the
suspected (accused) of his procedural rights including the right to the receipt of qualified legal
assistance and the information of relatives of the fact of detention (arrest).

In order to prevent abuse and exceeding the bounds of authority during the course of preliminary
investigation and inquest, it is necessary to legislatively establish the right of the arrested, suspected,
or accused individual to an independent medical examination.

It is necessary to take all required procedural actions for the effective protection of the rights

of victims and witnesses of crimes.

99

The survey conducted by experts from the Association of Sociologists of Kazakhstan revealed
that 38.4% of respondents negatively evaluated the governmental mechanism for the protection
of the rights of crime victims and 18.0% of respondents found it difficult to answer the question:
“How do you evaluate the situation in the sphere of protection of the rights of crime victims?”. The
given results of the sociological survey allow the conclusion that there is a need for improvement
of the mechanism for protection not only of crime victims, but also of witnesses.

It is necessary to elaborate a governmental program for the implementation of the Law of
RK “On the Governmental Protection of Individuals Involved in Criminal Procedure” which
would stipulate financial and organizational provisions and effective mechanisms for their
implementation.

It is necessary to intensify the liability of officials for illegal detention of individuals outside
temporary jails, in offices and other inadequate facilities. Temporary jails should be handed over
to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice of RK.

In an effort to secure the human rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic
of Kazakhstan and international legislation, we recommend that the Government of the
Republic of Kazakhstan implement the following measures during the period of 2009-202:
1. It is necessary to clearly define in criminal procedure legislation the concepts of “arrest of
suspect” and “the moment of actual arrest”, because the three-hour period of arrest stipulated by
Article 134 of CCP RK starts from the moment of actual arrest, during which period the protocol
must be filed that indicates the reasons and motives for arrest, place and time of arrest (indicating
exact hour and minute), results of personal search and the time of the drawing up of the protocol.
2. Criminal procedure legislation of the country should be supplemented with provisions
obliging the employee of a law-enforcement agency who made the actual arrest of the individual
to inform him/her without delay, at the minimum, regarding the following:

- Reason for arrest;
- Classification of the crime of which he /she is suspected or accused;
- The right to a lawyer (defense) of choice including the right to free legal assistance and a

confidential meeting with the lawyer before the first questioning;

- The right to keep silence (the right not to testify against oneself);
- The right to judicial appeal of arrest;
- The right to the immediate information of relatives about the arrest.
It is necessary to specify in criminal procedure legislation that failure to inform the individual
of the above-mentioned rights is a violation of the procedural rights of the suspected or accused
individual that can afterwards lead to the termination of prosecution of the individual.

3. We recommend that the authorities carrying on criminal lawsuits guarantee the observance

of the principle of presumption of innocence.

4. Hand over temporary jails, which are currently under the authority of the Ministry of the
Interior, to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and to empower public watch commissions to
inspect these jails without prior warning.

5. Oblige the management of investigative jails to release the accused upon the expiration
of the established time in the absence of judicial notification regarding the prolongation of
arrest. In case such a notification has been received, a copy of it must be immediately given to
the suspected or accused individual.

6. There is urgent need for the Ministry of the Interior and other authorities involved in inquest,
investigation and arrest to adopt a Code of Conduct of their employees that would be a code of
rules for their professional ethics. In Europe, there exists such a Code of Conduct of policemen,
adopted in 1976.

The Right to Freedom from Torture and
Other Cruel or Degrading Treatment or Punishment

Since the date of its independence, the Republic of Kazakhstan has taken a number of systematic

measures in the field of combat against torture and other cruel treatment and punishment.

These measures were implemented both in legislation and the institutional and practical

fields.

Thus, in the sphere of legislative reform, it should be noted that on June 29, 1998, the Republic
of Kazakhstan ratified the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading
forms of Treatment or Punishment (further referred to as “the Convention against Torture”).

On March 30, 1999, the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On the Procedure for and
Conditions of Custody of Individuals Suspected and Accused of Crimes” was adopted, which
stipulated a number of guarantees of the rights of the arrested individual, including the right to
protection against torture.

On December 21, 2002, some amendments and additions were made to the Criminal Code, the
Code of Criminal Procedure and the Criminal Executive Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Thus,
to the Criminal Code of RK was added Article 347-1 stipulating criminal liability for application
of torture. Criminal procedure legislation was supplemented with a provision stipulating the
inadmissibility of evidence obtained by the application of torture.

On November 21, 2005, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was

ratified.

In 2008, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture was ratified and statements

were made as to Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention against Torture.

On July 10, 2008, the Supreme Court of RK made a statutory decision on the application of

the provisions of international treaties in judicial practice.

On February 11, 2009 Kazakhstan ratified the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, which allows citizens to lodge individual complaints with the UN
Human Rights Commission.

In the field of institutional reforms:
On September 19, 2002, the position of the Human Rights Commissioner (Ombudsman) of

RK was instituted by the Decree of the President of RK.

In the years 2001-2002, it was decided to transfer the penal system and the system of
preliminary imprisonment (investigative jail) from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior to
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and the implementation of this decision began on January
1, 2003. However, this reform has not been completed, since the temporary jails remain under
the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior and the investigative jails of the National Security
Committee still have not been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice.

On January 16, 2006, jury legislation was adopted, which became an important step towards

the improvement of the justice system.
In addition, positive steps include:
- Creation of the system of public watch commissions in the years 2004-2005 which would

inspect places of custody.

On December 29, 2004, the Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On Amendments and
Additions to Some Legislative Documents of the Republic of Kazakhstan with Regard to Agencies
of Justice” (further referred to as “the Law”) was signed, which stipulates the arrangement for
public control of the observance of the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of individuals
retained in institutions and agencies for criminal penalty.

Public control is realized by public associations in an effort to assist individuals in correctional
institutions and investigative jails regarding exercising their rights and legitimate interests as to
the conditions of their custody, medical and sanitary provisions, labor organization, spare time and
training as stipulated by the legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

0

The Enactment of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan of September 16, 2005
ratified the Rules of establishment of district (cities of state importance) public watch commissions
for public control.

In addition, in pursuance of Paragraph 11 of the Development Program of the Criminal
Executive System (CES), the Committee of the Criminal Executive System of the Ministry of
Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan has developed and sent to all public watch commissions the
Recommendations on Control of Observance of the Rights and Legitimate Interests of Suspected,
Accused and Convicted Individuals.

Public watch commissions (PWC) were established in almost all regions of the country and

include representatives of law-enforcement organizations.

However, the status and activity of these commissions are not stipulated in the law and they

have no right to the unexpected access to institutions of confinement.

- Creation of the work group for prevention of torture under the Human Rights Commissioner
of RK (Ombudsman) with the participation of representatives of law-enforcement organizations.
The functions of this group include visits to places custody and the preparation of recommendations
on the model and procedure of establishment of national preventive mechanisms. In October 2008,
the work group made the first visit to custody institutions;

- Creation of the public council under the Ministry of the Interior and implementation of the
pilot project in Almaty in 2008 for the establishment of a monitoring group of representatives
of human rights NGOs for monitoring of observance of the rights of arrested individuals. This
group has the right to unexpected visits of police stations and temporary jails that are under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. The project is being implemented upon the initiative of
the Ministry of the Interior and will be expanded to other regions of Kazakhstan.

Despite these positive steps, the situation in whole causes serious concerns due to the scope of
illegal methods of inquest and investigation including torture and other cruel treatment and due to
the inefficiency of the fight against them.

So, in 2001, Kazakhstan presented its initial report on the fulfillment of the Convention against
Torture. At the same time, the human rights non-governmental organizations of Kazakhstan
presented an alternative report on the fulfillment of this Convention. On the basis of the results
of the consideration of the official report of the Government of Kazakhstan and considering the
provisions and recommendations of the alternative report, the UN Committee against Torture
made 16 recommendations. According to information from the non-governmental organizations
of Kazakhstan, by 2008, the Government has implemented only 5 of the recommendations.

The existing problems can be divided into two groups.

. Legislative problems.
Despite the inclusion of Article 347-1 into the Criminal Code of RK in 2002, which defines
such crimes as “torture”, the definition given in this article does not fully comply with the
definition contained in Article 1 of the Convention against Torture. There is no provision in this
article according to which the role of officials in torture can be, not only active actions, but also
instigation, tacit consent, or deliberate inaction. In addition, this article is not applied in practice,
since during all the years since its consummation only few criminal suits were brought to court on
the basis of this article.

No other legislative actions for combat against torture have been taken except for this article,
the provision in the criminal procedure legislation regarding the fact that evidence obtained by
means of torture is inadmissible and the poorly defined statutory decision of the Supreme Court of
RK on the application of the standards of international covenants. No other legislative provisions
have come into force with regard to independent agencies for investigation of torture reports, no
procedural provisions related to the effective investigation of reports of torture, etc.

Moreover, important documents such as the Rules of Custody of Individuals in Investigative
Jails of National Security have the stamp on them “for service use”, i.e. it is closed for publicity. This

02

is violation of the Constitution of RK, which prohibits the application of unpublished legislation
related to human rights and freedoms.

2. Institutional problems.
Despite the recommendations of the UN Committee against Torture, no significant institutional

improvements have been made.

No independent agencies for the effective investigation of reports of torture have been
established. The creation of the Office for Proper Security under the Ministry of the Interior,
intended for the investigation of reports of torture did not change the situation, for the obvious
reason of interdepartmental privacy.

Moreover, despite the transfer of the system of investigative jails of the Ministry of the Interior
to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice, the investigative jails of the national security have
remained under the jurisdiction of the National Security Committee of RK.

The position of the Human Rights Commissioner (Ombudsman) instituted in 2002 does not
comply with the Paris Principles related to the status of national human rights institutions, since it
was established by means of by-law and not by Law and is restricted in competence and powers.

According to the international standards determined by the UN and the recommendations
of the OSCE, the activity of the Ombudsman should comply with the Paris Principles, which
establish general criteria of independence and efficiency of function of the national human
rights institution. National institutions established in nonconformity with the Paris Principles are
considered dependent and do not enjoy the confidence of the international community.

In this regard, the institution of Ombudsman should be established in compliance with the
Constitution or individual Law, i.e. it should be independent, with clearly determined jurisdiction
and powers. However, the assignment of Ombudsman should be realized according to the Law
with the participation of the Parliament of the country. The current legislation of Kazakhstan
ensures the equal participation of the President and the Parliament in the assignment of the Human
Rights Commissioner without alteration of the Constitution and allows the adoption of a Law on
the Ombudsman. For instance, the candidacy of the Human Rights Commissioner (Ombudsman)
could be proposed by the President of the country and be approved by the Majilis of the Parliament
or the Parliament as a whole, which would comply with the commonly acknowledged UN Paris
Principles and OSCE recommendations.

The necessity to adopt the Law of RK “On the Human Rights Commissioner in the Republic
of Kazakhstan” has been repeatedly emphasized in the final documents of the international
conferences on human rights held by the Human Rights Commission under the President of the
Republic of Kazakhstan jointly with international organizations and brought to the attention of the
authorized governmental agencies.

Presently, in view of the forthcoming chairmanship of the Republic of Kazakhstan of the
OSCE in 2010, there is an urgent need for the development and adoption of the Law of RK “On
the Human Rights Commissioner in the Republic of Kazakhstan”.

Adoption of such a Law would allow the improvement of the status of Kazakhstan’s Ombudsman
in harmony with international standards and he, as an “advocate of the people” would protect
the violated rights of certain individuals who believe they are victims of the unfair actions of
governmental authorities and their officials or other organizations. It would also prevent the criticism
of Kazakhstan’ Ombudsman institution by international and human rights organizations.

Offices for Proper Security, which investigate reports of torture, working under agencies
of the Interior and prosecution offices, which sanction the investigation and prosecute in court,
are interrelated agencies in regard to privacy and their functions, which structure does not allow
independent and effective investigation of reports of torture. In addition, there are no independent
medical services for the independent examination of victims of torture and medical and sanitary
stations at institutions of confinement and preliminary custody belong to the penal system and
agencies of the Interior.

0

In November 2008, the UN Committee against Torture considered the second report of the
Republic of Kazakhstan on fulfillment of the UN Convention against Torture. The non-governmental
human rights organizations of Kazakhstan submitted their alternative report.

The Final Remarks of the UN Committee against Torture on the results of consideration of
the second report of the Republic of Kazakhstan with due account to the alternative report contain
more than 20 recommendations related to the legislative, institutional and procedural aspects of
prevention and effective combat of torture:

- Openly and explicitly denounce torture in all its forms by addressing such denunciations first
of all to the employees of police and prisons and clearly warn that any individual committing such
actions or otherwise participating in torture will be held personally liable for such actions and will
be punished in criminal procedure in proportion to the weight of the crime;

- Bring the definition of torture into full conformity with Article 1 of the Convention against
Torture, so that all officials would be subject to criminal prosecution on the basis of Article 347-1
of the Criminal Code and differentiate between torture carried out by the official, by his instigation,
with his knowledge or tacit consent, or by any other person acting as an official;

- Make an amendment in the first part of Article 347-1 of the Criminal Code so that all
punishment for acts of torture would be in proportion to the weight of crime in line with the
requirements of the Convention. Individuals suspected of torture should without fail be dismissed
or transferred to other position until the end of the investigation and individuals given disciplinary
punishment should not be allowed to remain in their positions;

- Ensure the prosecution of all acts of torture on the basis of the corresponding article of the
Criminal Code and avoid the classification of such as crimes of small or medium weight. Ensure
appropriate sentences and compulsory continual training of all judges, prosecutors and lawyers for
the sake of observance of new laws and amendments;

- Take actions to practically ensure the timely, impartial and effective investigation of all
statements with regard to torture and maltreatment and the criminal prosecution and punishment
of guilty individuals, including employees of law-enforcement agencies and other individuals;
however, such investigations should be done by an absolutely independent agency;

- Take timely effective actions so that an individual would not be arrested privately and
so that all arrested suspected individuals would be provided with all principal legal guarantees
during the entire time of their custody. Such actions in particular include: starting from the actual
moment of custodial restraint – the right to access to a lawyer, the right to an independent medical
examination, the right to inform relatives and the right to be informed of one’s rights at the moment
of arrest including information with regard to the accusations as well as the right to appear before
the court in a timely manner. All arrested individuals should be guaranteed the right to effectively
and quickly dispute the lawfulness of their arrest on the basis of Habeas Corpus;

- Make an amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure of RK to ensure that no exceptional
circumstances could be used to deny an arrested individual the right to inform his relatives of his
location;

- Ensure the publication of all rules and guidelines related to the custody, arrest and questioning
of individuals undergoing any kind of arrest or detention and from the moment of arrest, ensure
that every arrested individual is able to exercise his right to access to a lawyer, to an independent
doctor, to relatives and to other legal guarantees in order to provide effective protection against
torture;

- Ensure the training of employees of law-enforcement agencies with a view toward their
professional development for work with teenagers. Ensure that custodial restraint including
detention until court proceedings will be as short as possible and develop and use alternative
measures to custodial restraint;

- Change the system of interrogation of investigators to remove any incentive to the receipt of

recognition and take additional measures to familiarize employees of police with human rights;

04

- Adopt legislation regulating the procedure for deportation, return and extradition that would
fulfill the obligations stipulated in Article 3 of the Convention against Torture. Ensure that the
provisions of the Convention would have priority over any other less comprehensive bilateral
or multilateral covenants on extradition and guarantee the opportunity of individuals who were
refused refuge to appeal. Ensure complete fulfillment the obligations in Article 3 of the Convention
in all cases of deportation, return and extradition, ensure that no one will be deported, returned,
or extradited if there are sound reasons to believe that he/she may be threatened with torture and
ensure that individuals whose petitions for refuge were refused will be able to lodge an appeal for
suspension of the decision made;

- Approve a program for further development of the criminal and correctional system similar
to the one that was being implemented during the years 2004-2006 in order to bring it into full
conformity with the UN Standard Minimal Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners;

- Continue to train specialists of the penal system and ensure that all individuals having contact
with prisoners are familiar with international standards in the field of human rights protection and
treatment of prisoners;

- Reduce the number of prisoners at places of custody, including by means of construction of

new penal institutions and the application of legal alternatives to imprisonment;

- Restrict the use of isolation as an extreme measure to the shortest possible period under strict

supervision and with an opportunity to review the decision in a procedure for judicial review;

- Determine the causes impelling prisoners to commit such acts of despair as mutilation and

secure proper measures of protection;

- Establish a health protection service that would be independent from the Ministry of the
Interior and the Ministry of Justice for the medical examination of individuals at the moment of
arrest and release, both regularly and by their request and ensure that judges take into consideration
evidence of application of torture and cruel treatment of prisoners and that they prescribe
independent medical examination or send back cases for additional investigation;

- Ensure the timely, independent and comprehensive investigation of all cases of death during
custody and ensure the criminal prosecution of individuals who were found guilty in any such
death as a result of torture, maltreatment, or willful negligence;

- Provide public watch commissions the unrestricted right to make inspections of all places of
custody in the country without warning and ensure that arrested individuals who contact members

The Right to a Fair Trial

The right to a fair trial is a combination of other individual rights, the security of which during
the course of administration of justice makes it possible to determine whether the trial was fair or
not. The right to a fair trial can be divided into three elements grouped by the rights consisted in it:
1) pretrial rights, 2) rights during the trial, 3) post-trial rights.

The right to a fair criminal trial arises from the moment of involvement of a given individual in
a criminal procedure. Depending on the circumstances of the legal case, this moment may coincide
with the moment of detention, arrest or arraignment. In this way, guarantees of a fair trial should
be secured in the process of commencement of the criminal case, preliminary investigation and
inquest, as well as during the course of trial itself, including judicial actions with regard to possible
appeal.

As is well known, the right to a fair trial is a fundamental human right. It is one of the
common principles, which are cornerstones of the international rights protection system. Since the
year 1948, the right to a fair trial, acknowledged by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), became a legal obligation
of all countries as a part of common international law.

The right to a fair trial was acknowledged and specially stipulated by other numerous
international and regional treaties and norms adopted by the UN and regional intergovernmental
agencies. These standards for the protection of rights were developed so as to be applicable to all
legal systems of the world with due consideration to the great variety of legal procedures: they
contain the minimum guarantees which should be granted by all systems.

For instance, OSCE documents stipulate necessary conditions, which member countries
should create in order to secure the right to a fair trial. Among them are: independence of judges
and impartial functioning of the governmental judicial service; judicial authorization of arrest
or detention due to a charge of crime; fair and open investigation by a competent, independent
and impartial court established on the basis of the law; opportunity of the unimpeded receipt

07

of qualified legal assistance including free assistance in case of insolvency of the prosecuted
individual; presumption of innocence; supremacy of law and independence of the judicial system.
In conformity with the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan, only the court may exercise
justice. The judicial system is comprised of the Supreme Court and local (district and regional)
courts.

The judicial system is the central governmental mechanism for the protection of rights, the main
governmental institution for restoration and protection of human rights that have been violated and
is independent from the legislative and executive branches of governmental authority.

Kazakhstan consistently takes measures to develop the judicial system, to enhance the efficiency
and impartiality of the legal procedure, to ensure the maximum openness and transparency of
judicial procedures and to implement its goals with regard to the human rights, freedoms and
legitimate interests of its citizens.

In particular, the Constitutional Law of RK of November 17, 2008 “On Amendments and
Additions to the Constitutional Law of RK “On the Judicial System and Status of Judges of the
Republic of Kazakhstan” significantly reformed the judicial system. Appeal authority is established
at district courts and their equivalents. The highest judicial agency of the government, the Supreme
Court of RK, will have only supervision authority. Specialized courts will act as military, financial,
economic, administrative, juvenile, etc.

A draft law, intended for the amendment of provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and
the Civil Code, is under consideration by the Majilis of the Parliament of RK. These amendments
are the result of reformation of the judicial system and a need to determine the jurisdiction of
criminal and civil cases.

Social and economic conditions are changing, financial and industrial legislation is changing
and law-enforcement practice tests the efficiency of procedural legislation and reveals its defects,
inefficiency and gaps. The Republic is actively integrating into the world community, becoming a
member of multilateral and bilateral international legal agreements.

Moreover, positive trends in the development of the judicial system of the country are

still far from perfection.

An accusatory tendency continues to prevail in criminal investigation. Indirect proof of this is
the extreme rarity of “not guilty” verdicts and the cautious attitude of judicial employees to these
instances.

There are cases of corruption and the violation of statutory requirements and the Code of

Judicial Ethics in the judicial system.

The most important criterion used to assess fairness of a judicial hearing is the observance of
the principle of equality of authority of the defense and the prosecution. The equality of authority
during the course of the entire trial suggests the equal application of procedural actions toward
the parties. It is impossible to list in detail all the violations of this principle. These violations
may include failure to provide sufficient time to the accused individual and/or his lawyer for the
preparation of his defense, or attempts to prevent the access of the accused individual and/or his
lawyers to the appeal judicial hearing of the case in the presence of the prosecutor.

The legislation and law-enforcement practices of the Republic of Kazakhstan reveal that the

equality of authority of the defense and the prosecution is not yet achieved.

Paragraph 1 of Article 14 of ICCPR also guarantees the right to require a public judicial
hearing as the most important component of the concept of a fair trial. The principle of the publicity
of a judicial trial suggests openness of both the judicial hearing (but in no way does it suggest
the openness of any other judicial or investigative action) and the judgment on the given legal
case. This right is enjoyed by both parties involved in the lawsuit and by the general public in
a democratic society. The right to require a public judicial hearing means that the trial is carried
out face-to-face and publicly without any preliminary applications submitted by the parties. The
court must in a reasonable time inform the interested parties of the time and place of the judicial
hearing and provide required facilities for the general public wishing to be present during the

0

trial. However, it is necessary to mention that the press and the public may be excluded from a
trial in harmony with the statutory requirements contained in Paragraph 1 of Article 14 of ICCPR;
however, such actions should be based on a court decision delivered in compliance with the current
procedural provisions.

The public may be excluded from a trial “for reasons of morals, public order or national
security in a democratic society, or when the interest of the private lives of the parties so requires”.
Besides, the public can be excluded from all or part of a trial “to the extent strictly necessary in
the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests
of justice”. When considering criminal cases related to sexual offences, “reasons of morals”, as
a rule, are sound reasons for the exclusion of the public from the trial. The term “public order”
in this context is understood as the maintenance of proper order in the courtroom. Reasons of
national security are used when it comes to the confidentiality of military and governmental
secrets. However, in both cases, restriction of the access of the public to a trial should be in
harmony with the legal principles of democratic society, which are the foundation for efforts for
the non-admission of arbitrariness when making judicial decisions. “The interests of the private
life” (including the interests of family members and relatives) of parties may also be sound reason
to restrict the access to a trial. An example of such a situation is the hearing of a custody case
when openness of the trial can only damage one of the parties. And finally, the access of the public
to a trial can be restricted for the sake of justice, which is done only in exceptional cases and is
thoroughly justified by a corresponding court decision.

Although the list of circumstances requiring a closed hearing is quite extensive, as a rule, they
do not cover the stage of reading of the judicial decision. According to Paragraph 1 of Article 14
of ICCPR, judgment rendered in a criminal case “shall be made public” except where the interest
of juvenile persons otherwise requires or the proceedings concern matrimonial disputes or the
guardianship of children. In this way, exceptions to the rule of a public judicial hearing can be
determined in detail. The judicial decision is public if it was read in the courtroom or published in
press, or made public by both methods at the same time. In either case, the determining factor of
openness is the accessibility of the judicial decision to all interested parties.

Basically, the legislation of Kazakhstan regarding observation of the principle of publicity

conforms to the above-mentioned international standards.

However, it would be advisable to legislatively establish the openness of trials to representatives
of the press, public, etc. in order to prevent the free interpretation of these principles of fair trial
by judges.

As a rule, the mechanism for securing the right to a fair trial for any criminal case is the
hearing by a competent, independent and impartial judge, acting in harmony with established
legislation (Paragraph 1 of Article 14 of ICCPR). The goal of this provision is to avoid arbitrariness
or subjectivism during the course of consideration of criminal cases by political or administrative
agencies of authority. The court must be competent and act within the limits of the law. Both of
these requirements are inseparably linked. Although issues regarding the competency of the court
are usually linked to issues of court jurisdiction, any court must function within the limits of
established legislation. The main goal of this provision is to create a legal environment in which
criminal cases would be considered by legislatively established courts regardless of the nature of
the lawsuit or offence.

Independence implies the division of authority and the protection of judicial agencies from
illegal interference in their affairs by agencies of executive authorities and to a lesser extent by the
agencies of legislative governmental authorities.

Speaking of impartiality of the court, it should be noted that prejudice (or its absence) is
considered the main criteria of impartiality of a judge. The impartiality of a judge immediately
comes under doubt if he has already participated in the given trial in one capacity or another, if he
belongs to any political party, or if he has a personal interest in the trial.

09

Theoretically, all these principles in a declarative sense are implemented in the legislation of

the Republic of Kazakhstan.

According to Paragraph 2 of Article 14 of ICCPR, “everyone charged with a criminal offence
shall have the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law”. Being the main
component of the right to a fair trial, the presumption of innocence means that the burden of proof
in the course of criminal trial is first of all the responsibility of the accuser the accused person is
presumed innocent. In addition, the presumption of innocence should be applied not only to the
accused during the course of the trial, but also to the suspected or accused during the course of
pre-trial investigation. Responsible officials of law-enforcement agencies and representatives of
authorities are obligated to do everything possible to comply with the presumption of innocence by
“abstention from pronouncing any preliminary judgments on the trial under consideration”.

Despite the fact that the principle of presumption of innocence is a provision of the Constitution
of RK and criminal procedure legislation, it is often neglected in practice. It suffices to state that
the judge hearing a criminal case familiarizes himself with the criminal records submitted by
the prosecution before the trial. Despite the fact that criminal procedure legislation obliges the
agency that carries out the preliminary investigation to search for both accusatory and excusing
evidences with regard to the suspected or accused person, this is disregarded. In practice, agencies
of inquest and investigation collect evidence of guilt, believing that the evidence of innocence or
any other evidence in favor of the accused person will be collected by the defense. Thus, in the
majority of cases, judicial records represent thoroughly collected evidence supporting the opinion
of the prosecution and a guilty verdict. These records are submitted to the judge who, during the
course of familiarization with them, is inevitably inclined to the opinion of prosecution. As a
result, usually the defense cannot advance their opinion and defend it, but can only call into doubt
some of the evidences provided by the prosecution. This procedure requires cardinal changes in
order to secure the principle of the presumption of innocence in practice.

Introduction a jury trial had a positive impact; however, it is impossible to rely on it for the
complete resolution of this problem, due in part to the limitation of the categories of criminal cases
that can be judged with the participation of a jury.

Paragraph 3 (b) of Article 14 of ICCPR states that in case if a person is charged with a criminal
offence, he has the right “to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defense
and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing”. The right to require the adequate time
and facilities for the preparation of his defense covers both the accused person and his counsel.
The given legal provision must be complied with at all stages of the trial. The idea of “adequate
time” depends on the character of the trial and circumstances of the case. In this case, factors
are considered such as the complexity of the lawsuit, access of the accused person to testimonial
evidence, the due date of certain judicial actions in compliance with the domestic legislation, etc. The
term “facilities” in addition implies the access of the accused person or his counsel to appropriate
information, files and documents needed for preparation of his defense and the provision of the
required technical means to the accused person for confidential communication with his counsel.
The right of the accused person to communicate with counsel of his own choosing is the most
important component of the right to adequate conditions for preparation of the defense.

As a whole, the provisions of Kazakhstan’s criminal procedure legislation contain these
guarantees. However, it is necessary to exclude the dependence of the lawyer on the investigator
with regard to the opportunity to meet with the accused person under arrest at his discretion.

The right to the assistance of a lawyer at the pre-trial stage in the course of the criminal
investigation is directly connected with the right to protection during the course of the trial as
stipulated by Paragraph 3 (d) of Article 14 of ICCPR. This provision states that each person has
the right “to be tried in his presence and to defend himself in person or through legal assistance
of his own choosing; to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right; and to have
legal assistance assigned to him, in any case where the interests of justice so require and without
payment by him in any such case if he does not have sufficient means to pay for it”. In the latter

0

case, the accused person who does not have sufficient finances is exempted from the liability to
pay for legal assistance. This legislative provision assumes the following rights:

• The right to be tried in one’s presence. This provision has many interpretations. A literal
interpretation of this provision excludes the remote trial. This interpretation is shared by the majority
of international non-governmental human rights organizations as well as by the International
Criminal Court. However, in the opinion of the experts of the UN Human Rights Committee,
a remote trial is acceptable only in the case when the state makes “sufficient efforts in order to
inform the accused person about the forthcoming trial and in such way allows him to get prepared
for his defense in advance”;

• The right to defend oneself in person;
• The right to defend oneself through legal assistance of his own choosing;
• The right to be informed, if he does not have legal assistance, of this right;
• The right to the receipt of free legal assistance.
According to the prevailing interpretation of the basic provisions of ICCPR, the right to the
receipt of legal assistance covers all stages of the trial including the preliminary investigation and
pre-trial custody. The assignment of a lawyer by the court contradicts the principle of a fair trial in
case the accused person has the opportunity to use the help of a lawyer of his own choosing. The
assigned lawyer should be able to effectively defend the interests of the accused person using to
this effect all his experience and professional skills.

Basically, these rights of the accused are guaranteed by Kazakhstan’s legislation. Nevertheless,
in practice it is necessary to secure the right to a lawyer of one’s own choosing. In addition, it is
necessary to significantly improve the system of qualified legal assistance at the expense of the
state budget.

“Everyone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being
reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law” [Article 14(5) of ICCPR]. This right is aimed at
the provision of at least a two-level trial where the second level is represented by a higher court.
A review of any judicial case is substantial in itself, which in addition means that the higher
court considers not only the question raised in the appeal but a wider range of questions. Appeal
procedures should be timely. A direct consequence of the right to appeal is the fact that the court
has to suspend the execution of any judicial decisions made by the primary court until the end of
the review of the case by the court of appeal. This principle ceases to apply only if the convicted
person voluntarily accepts the decision made by the primary court. The right to appeal is enjoyed
by all persons convicted of crimes regardless of the weight of this crime and the decision made by
the primary court. The guarantee of a fair trail should be observed without fail at all stages of the
appeal procedure.

The right to the appeal is stipulated by the current legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
However, it is necessary to improve legislation directed at the complete security of the rights
of convicted individuals with regard to the court verdict taking effect. Quite often, the human right
to be heard in a court and the right to the receipt of qualified legal assistance are violated at this
stage.

“When a person has by a final decision been convicted of a criminal offence and when
subsequently his conviction has been reversed or he has been pardoned on the ground that a new or
newly discovered fact shows conclusively that there has been a miscarriage of justice, the person
who has suffered punishment as a result of such conviction shall be compensated according to law,
unless it is proved that the non-disclosure of the unknown fact in time is wholly or partly attributable
to him” [Article 14(6) ICCPR]. However, it should be noted that compensation for miscarriage of
justice is possible only in the case when the court made the final decision on the case. A judicial
decision can be appealed regardless of the weight of the crime committed. To secure this right, the
following three conditions have to be observed: 1) the miscarriage of justice should be officially
recognized and confirmed by the revocation of the judicial decision or by a pardon; 2) the delayed
discovery of relevant facts should not be attributable to the convicted person; 3) with regard to the



convicted person, the final decision should have been made as a result of miscarriage of justice.
The phrase “according to law” means that the government must compensate for the damage in
harmony with the procedure established by current legislation.

The right to compensation for miscarriage of justice is stipulated by the current legislation of

the Republic of Kazakhstan.

As stated above, legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan regarding the security of the right
to a fair trail contains a series of fundamental guarantees that correspond to international standards.
Almost the entire list of human rights and freedoms during the course of a criminal trial are in one
way or another established in the criminal procedural and criminal executive legislation of the
Republic of Kazakhstan.

However, a comparative analysis of the provisions of current legislation and law-enforcement
practices shows that there is a need to strengthen the current guarantees of personal freedom and
safety as well as of other pre-trial, trial and post-trial human rights.

In parallel, a necessary condition for securing human rights in the field of justice is the
availability of truly independent judicial branches of authority and a qualified and highly
professional association of judges who treasure their honor and social status.

In an effort to secure the rights of citizens to a fair trial, we recommend the Government
of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the
Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan and other authorized governmental agencies
implement the following measures during the years 200-202:

1. Apply measures for the openness and transparency of judicial procedures and activities of

agencies of judicial authority.

The achievement of these goals will be possible, first of all, by the implementation of objective
methods of recording judicial procedures such as compulsory audio or video recording of the trial.
At present, the only means of more or less reliably recording the proceedings is the court record.

Legislation on administrative offences does not stipulate compulsory record keeping at all and
the right of the party to use audio and video recording may be realized only with the consent of
the presiding judge. Therefore, to avoid possible disturbance of the trial, it is necessary to make
appropriate amendments to the procedural laws.

This suggested innovation will make the trial transparent, will result in practical implementation
of the principle of publicity and openness of the trial and will contribute to decisions made only on
the basis of evidence investigated and recorded in the protocol and audio and video records, which
will facilitate an objective trial and improve the quality of judicial decisions.

It is necessary to consider the issue of wider use of electronic communication technology. For
instance, at the initial stage it is possible to implement videoconference communication for remote
trials, in particular, for the reconsideration of existing judicial decisions.

2. The achievement of a high level of publicity and transparency will also be possible due to
the regulation of relationships of the court with other governmental agencies, the press and the
public.

Information with regard to the progress of the case should be made transparent and judicial
records should be made accessible. Citizens and organizations should freely receive information
on the activities of the courts, on selection of candidates for judges, etc. This would allow the
full implementation of the principle of publicity and transparency of justice in the Republic of
Kazakhstan and will promote successful reformation of the judicial system.

3. The quality of justice depends first of all on the professionalism and competence of judges.
Problems with the quality of the judicial force are evident. To a great extent, this is the result of
poor and biased selection of candidates for judges. Therefore, there is need for a more transparent
procedure for the appointment of judges. With a view toward resolving this problem, it is necessary
to publish in advance, in the press or on the Internet, lists of individuals submitted by the Chairman
of the Supreme Court for the appointment of judges and heads of courts and tribunals of all levels
so as to make it public.

2

During dialogue regarding candidacy for the appointment of judges, it is necessary to consult

with civil society including professional associations related to the activity of the courts.

4. Consider the issue of governmental support for trainee-candidates for judges and of

introduction of the position of judges’ assistants.

5. Take measures to improve the specialization of courts and judges – develop juvenile courts
in the regions of Kazakhstan and study the relevance of the establishment of tax, labor and other
courts.

6. Issues regarding the disciplinary liability of judges require regulation. The Constitutional
Law “On the Judicial System and Status of Judges of the Republic of Kazakhstan” stipulates the
basis for disciplinary liability of judges, one of which is the violation of the law during consideration
of a trial.

However, Paragraph 3 of Article 39 of the above-mentioned Constitutional Law states that
the cancellation or alteration of a judicial record in itself does not entail the liability of the judge,
provided that there were no gross violations of law, as recorded in the judicial records of the higher
tribunal.

Thus, the legislator in fact made the liability of judges dependent on the will of the higher

tribunal.

In practice, judges of the higher tribunal, when discovering gross violations of law made
by a judge during the course of a trial, do not mention this in their records, which prevents the
possibility of holding the judge to disciplinary account.

It would be proper to legislatively specify for which violations of law the judge may be brought
to disciplinary responsibility. It is advisable to examine the possibility of appealing a decision of
the Republican Disciplinary Board of Experts and of the Jury Court by interested individuals to
the Supreme Judicial Council.

7. It is necessary to improve the provisions related to time limits for consideration of civil
cases and the establishment of a mechanism for compensation for damage made during the course
of the trial and execution of the decision. In particular, it is necessary to regulate all issues related
to the consideration of cases in excess of the time limit established by law and the provision of
the right to compensation for damage incurred in connection with the courts’ violation of the
established term for consideration of cases.

The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Republic of Kazakhstan (CCP RK) do not
at all provide for a mechanism for the procedural regulation of compensation for damage incurred
by employees of the court in harmony with Article 923 of the Civil Code of RK. The only article of
CCP, which concerns the filing of a claim with the court, does not ensure the interested individual
the opportunity to achieve his objective and practice reveals that such claims are widespread and
are not being addressed.

In this regard, it would be advisable to consider the issue of expanding the list of participants
of Constitutional proceedings and to include citizens in it by giving them the opportunity to appeal
to the Constitutional Council for the protection of violated constitutional rights.

8. During an extended period of time, giving consideration to the particularities of social and
economic relationships, more attention was given to the development of the civil and criminal
branches of law in practice, on paper and in the creation of legislation. Meanwhile, administrative
relationships are one of the most dynamic. Any social, economic and political change in the
government is reflected in the content of the provisions of this branch of law.

Law-enforcement practice in the field of administrative relationships shows that the
administrative courts established in 2004 significantly reduced social tension when resolving
administrative cases, improved the protection of the interests of citizens against mistakes and abuse
by authorized individuals and provided certain guaranties of a fair consideration of administrative
cases.

Moreover, current legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan does not stipulate the judicial
consideration of administrative cases as an individual form of trial. The Code on Administrative



Offenses of RK replaces the term “administrative trial” with the evasive term “procedure for cases
of administrative offences” inasmuch as cases of administrative offences are also investigated by
authorized governmental agencies.

The poor development of the administrative process and the absence of the branch of
administrative procedure law in the legal system have resulted in the fact that it currently is a
combination of individual elements of judicial procedure and administrative procedure.

A natural step in the development of the administrative judicial procedure should be the
adoption of the Code of Administrative Procedure of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Currently,
the provisions of administrative procedural legislation that regulate the procedure for consideration
and settlement of public disputes with the participation of citizens and organizations are fragmentary,
which complicates the everyday law-enforcement activity of the executive authorities and the
activities for the protection of rights of governmental and judicial agencies. It is necessary to
codify these provisions.

9. It is necessary to legislatively improve the status and procedural opportunities of lawyers,

with the objective of the achievement of procedural equality with the prosecution.

10. It is necessary to exclude the practice of criminal investigation with regard to employees
of the same department. The conditions for the objective investigation of such criminal matters
should be the exclusion of the investigative jurisdiction of law-enforcement agencies with regard
to their own employees.

11. In an effort to strengthen the independence of judges, it is necessary to legislatively establish

the election of chairmen of panels of judges by the judges of corresponding courts.

12. Introduce the position of Justice of Peace (Biev) by legislatively establishing the election of

these judges by the population of the country.

13. Revise the current procedure of preliminary consideration of administrative appeals, which
significantly restricts the rights of the participants of the lawsuit and makes their position unequal
to the prosecution, whose notice of appeal does not require preliminary investigation.

Administrative appeals of lawyers, convicted individuals, victims and other participants
in the trial submitted to the reviewing court should be handled in the same manner as appeals
by the prosecution – immediately, by the supervisory board, for the adoption of procedural
decisions.

14. Abolish the preliminary consideration of administrative appeals by three judges, since
this is an infringement on the rights of citizens to the objective consideration of their appeals.
Presently, the reviewing tribunal consists of two levels: the preliminary consideration of the case
by three judges whose decisions may not be appealed; and the final consideration by 5 judges who
consider the case only if the suit was commenced at the stage of preliminary investigation. This
mechanism causes justifiable discontent of citizens and legal entities. One court cannot have two
tribunals (appeal and supervisory) since the chairman of the appeal tribunal is directly subordinate
to the chairman of the supervisory tribunal; and this causes distrust of citizens and legal entities of
the objectivity of the trial. Legal and physical persons who do not agree with the decisions of the
primary tribunal will be able to appeal only once to the district court. With the view of their full
trust, their appeal petitions should considered by a panel of judges. In the case of their disagreement
with the decision, the appeal may be lodged with the Supreme Court, in which there should also
be no preliminary consideration. With due consideration for the opinion of the European Court
with regard to non-recognition of the supervisory court as a tribunal and the Rome Convention
regarding legal definitiveness, the Supreme Court of RK should become a supervisory court which
would conduct the final consideration of an appeal. In this way, the entire judicial system would
consist only of three tribunals, which would facilitate the access of citizens and legal entities to
justice and conform to international standards of openness (transparency) of the judicial system.

15. Legislatively regulate the issue of the right of lawyers to obtain upon demand documents
constituting governmental, commercial and other legally protected secrets. The law should stipulate
the conditions under which the documents demanded may not be provide to him.

4

16. It is necessary to legislatively establish issues related to the procedure for conducting
interrogations and recording of information obtained as a result of an interrogation and the
procedure for the evaluation and acceptability of such evidence. Establish a legal basis for the
expansion of the right of lawyers to collect evidence, documents and other information, i.e.
to legislatively settle the issue concerning the presentation of evidence by the lawyer during the
course of a trial from the standpoint of its admissibility.

17. Abolish the death penalty as a form of criminal sanction and ratify the second Optional

Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Human Rights in the Execution of Judicial Decisions

The execution of judicial decisions is the stage of the legal procedure in which actual realization

and restoration of the violated rights of the citizens take place.

Assurance of the timely fulfillment of executive orders is the responsibility of the Committee
for Judicial Administration under the Supreme Court of the Republic of Kazakhstan (further
referred to as “the Committee”).

In 2006, in an effort to improve the legislative basis for the execution of judicial decisions, the
Law “On the Introduction of Amendments to Some Legislative Acts on Issues regarding Executive
Procedure” was adopted. The norms of the law are aimed at the implementation of the provisions
of the Concept of Legal Policy of the Republic of Kazakhstan that concern the unification of
the activities of judicial executors and officers of justice in a single system and the expansion of
application of procedural judicial control of the execution of judicial decisions.

This Law also contains provisions that improve the executive procedure of judicial decisions.
For instance, it contains the provision for access for judicial executors to secret tax
information, which is should significantly simplify the procedure of the establishment of
the material situation of a debtor.

In addition, with the purpose of quick obtainment of more complete information about debtors,
amendments have been made to the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan “On the Equity Market”,
“On Credit Partnerships”, “On Microcredit Organizations” and “On Notary Institutions”.

The Code of Civil Procedure was added to with articles such as “Appeal of the Action (Inaction)
of Judicial Executor” and “Protection of the Rights of Other Individuals in the Execution of
Decisions”. In addition, the Law “On the Executive Procedure and Status of Judicial Executors”
was supplemented with articles that stipulate the procedure for representation and succession in
executive procedures and the procedure for the discharge of a judicial executor.

The mechanism for the partial withdrawal of money from accounts of debtors on the basis of

collection orders from agencies of executive procedure was improved.

Nevertheless, the adopted Law does not contain principal provisions allowing radical changes

to the mode of execution of judicial acts.

An analysis reveals that low figures of actual execution prevail in certain categories of executive
documents, the execution of which is a long-term (periodical) nature or is difficult due to its basic
reasons.

For instance, the collection of alimony is of long-term character – alimonies are collected
periodically, as a rule, until the child attains legal age. The figures of actual execution for this
category are very low, amounting to nearly 40%. This does not mean that court decisions are
not being executed. Out of documents remaining in residuo in 2006, 46,276 documents on the
collection of alimony are being executed on a periodical basis.

A very low figure of actual execution is observed with regard to executive documents concerning
the collection of money per court sentences. As a rule, in these cases, the amount for damage
caused by the crime is collected. The debtors are mainly convicts with a poor material and social
situation. In addition, they are not employed in institutions of confinement, so it is impossible to



withdraw the debt from their salary. The low level of execution for these categories of executive
documents to a great extent reduces the figures of actual execution as a whole.

An analysis of information received shows that judicial executors allow the violation of the

rights of both the individuals to whom the money is due and the debtors.

The survey held by experts from the Association of Sociologists of Kazakhstan within the
framework of the project “Human Rights in Kazakhstan: the General Opinion” among 1500
respondents revealed that only 12.0% of respondents believe that the decisions of the court of the
Republic of Kazakhstan are executed in full measure. 51.1% of respondents believe that judicial
decisions are executed partially and 33.3% of respondents found it difficult to respond.

46,8% of respondents think that the reason for non-execution of judicial decisions is the
corruption of judicial executors, 16.6% of respondents named the low qualification of judicial
executors as a reason for non-execution of judicial decisions and 7.9% of respondents associate
the non-execution of judicial decisions with the insufficient authority of judicial executors. The
results obtained prove that there are serious problems related to the violation of the rights of
citizens to the proper and timely execution of judicial decisions.

The low quality of execution, failure to execute judicial decisions within the established time
and corruption crimes and offences are the direct result of the low legal and social status of
judicial executors, lack of qualified and experienced specialists, as well as the absence of a valid
mechanism for the execution of judicial decisions.

Until now, the number of judicial executors does not meet established levels, which entails an
excessive load on them and the fluctuation of personnel levels. The low salary and the absence of
social security also affect the appeal of this profession.

The implementation of a mechanism for an incentive system for judicial executors would

facilitate the solution of this problem and this is proved by successful international experience.

In the governmental execution system of France, Poland, Slovakia, the Baltic countries,
Germany, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Byelorussia and Moldova, judicial executors in addition to a fixed
salary receive a bonus depending on the collected sums at the expense of the debtor for each
execution.

This pattern of remuneration in Germany allowed the achievement of almost one hundred
percent of execution of the judicial decisions. In addition, none of the judicial executors incurred
criminal liability.

Implementation of a similar mechanism in Kazakhstan will allow the improvement of the
quality of judicial execution personnel, the increase of revenue to the republican budget and the
reduction of governmental expenses for the maintenance of judicial executors and will solve the
problem of corruption in executive procedure agencies.

It should be noted that the implementation of this mechanism will improve the quality of

execution and will eliminate the need to assign judicial execution personnel.

Unfortunately, the mechanism for the criminal and other accountability of debtors for evasion

of execution of judicial acts still remains ineffective.

It is necessary to further reform the executive procedure agencies. The efficiency of protection
of the rights and freedoms of participants of executive procedure directly depends on the clear
definition of the legal status of the executive procedure agencies and the control mechanism for
the execution of judicial decisions.

On September 28, 2006, within the framework of the expanded meeting of the Human Rights
Commission under the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, issues regarding the improvement
of the executive procedure were considered. Therefore, it was admitted that it would be advisable
to transfer the executive procedure agencies to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and to
incorporate them into the structure of the Committee of the Criminal and Executive System and to
name the latter the Committee for the Execution of Judicial Acts.

The baseline report on the human rights situation which was prepared in 2007 by a group
of independent experts under the coordination of the Human Rights Commission suggested the



supplementation of Article 236 of the Code of Civil Procedure with Paragraph 6, which would
oblige the judicial executor to inform the court upon the execution of the executive order or the
expiration of the period to submit a written note regarding the reasons for non-execution of the
order. It was suggested to make a provision in that same article for the right of the court to demand
a necessary explanation from the judicial executor with regard to reasons for failure to provide
such information.

We believe that the implementation of the above-mentioned measures will allow the
improvement of the efficiency of the execution of judicial decisions, will strengthen the power of
the judicial authorities and will enhance the confidence of the population in the court, since the
failure to execute judicial orders, negligence and inactivity of the executive procedure agencies
seriously damage the reputation of the judicial authorities and of the government as a whole.

It is necessary to investigate the possibility to elaborate and adopt the Code of Execution of

Judicial Orders, which would regulate the procedure for execution of all categories of orders.

It is worth noting that foreign experience in the field of application of indirect coercive
measures to the debtor so that he would fulfill his obligations and in the field of implementation of
the concept of astrente (continuously increasing fines) will result in good discipline of the debtors.
In addition, it is possible to investigate the opportunity to legislatively stipulate the obligation
of the debtor to declare his assets upon request of the judicial executor and to grant the judicial
executor the right to judicial recourse with regard to the invalidation of real estate transactions of
the debtor made in an effort to conceal his property.

With a view to the improvement of efficiency of the executive procedure and more
complete security of human rights in this regard, we recommend that the Government of
the Republic of Kazakhstan jointly with governmental agencies implement the following
measures during the period of 2009-202:

1. Develop and implement a mechanism for the payment of social governmental benefits to
claimants, especially to single mothers, during the period of insolvency of men paying alimony
and convicted individuals who have not reimbursed the damage incurred by their crime. Moreover,
establish the legal claim for regressive compensation for expenses incurred by the government
from the debtor;

2. Transfer the inquest of crimes related to the non-execution of judicial orders from the

Ministry of the Interior to executive procedure agencies.

3. Based on study of advanced international experience, develop and implement a mechanism

for the material incentive of judicial executors.

4. Consider the possibility of including executive procedure agencies in the structure of the
Committee of the Criminal and Executive System of the Ministry of Justice and to re-name the
latter the Committee for the Execution of Judicial Acts.

5. Supplement Article 236 of the Code of Civil Procedure with Paragraph 6, which would
oblige the judicial executor to inform the court upon the execution of the executive order or the
expiration of the period for submission of a written note regarding the reasons for non-execution
of the order. In the same article, grant the court the right to demand the necessary explanation from
the judicial executor with regard to the reasons for failure to provide such information.

6. Change the procedure for execution of judicial orders by governmental agencies and
institutions financed by the republican and local budgets. For this purpose, it is necessary to
establish in the budgetary legislation a provision that would oblige governmental agencies, when
planning their budgets for the impending financial year, to budget finances for the repayment of
their debts related to judicial orders.

7. Legislatively determine the liability of the higher managers of governmental agencies for

non-execution of judicial orders.

8. Taking into account the efficiency of the practices of foreign countries in the field of coercive
execution, it is necessary to stipulate in the legislation on executive procedure of the Republic
of Kazakhstan the use of indirect coercive actions to force the debtor to fulfill his obligations;

7

these actions are absolutely different from direct coercive actions and allow the expansion of
the scope of executive procedure. For this it is necessary to introduce the concept of astrente
(continuously increasing fines), which will contribute to strengthening the effectiveness of justice
and the protection of the rights of the individuals involved in executive procedure.

9. Legislatively establish measures for the social security of judicial executors. Take necessary

actions to sustain the activity of judicial executors including the provision of service vehicles.

Rights of the Convicted

Correctional institutions of the Republic are under the jurisdiction of the Committee of the
Criminal and Executive System of the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan (CCES
MJ RK).

Current criminal and executive legislation of the Republic of Kazakhstan corresponds to the
majority of international standards protecting the rights of individuals taken into custody and
imprisoned by decision of the court.

The legal status of individuals on whom the penalty of confinement was imposed is the most
restricted in comparison with other categories of convicted individuals. This situation corresponds
to the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan and to the criminal and executive legislation.
Human rights may be restricted only by law and only to the extent that is necessary with the
view of protection of the constitutional order. For instance, in accordance with Article 33 of the
Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan, convicted individuals have no right to vote, to be
elected, or to participate in the republican referendum. In addition, they are restricted with regard
to their rights to freedom of movement, choice of residence, etc. However, the convicted, being the
citizens of the Republic of Kazakhstan, retain their natural rights possessed by every person; such
as: the right to life, protection of health, education, freedom of conscience and religion, respect for
human dignity, use of native language, etc.

According to statistics from January 1, 2009, in the criminal and executive system there are 73

correctional institutions and 20 investigative jails.

During previous years, within the framework of the implementation of legal reform, consid-
erable improvements of the criminal and executive system have been made in the Republic of
Kazakhstan.

The transfer of correctional institutions and investigative jails which formerly belonged to
the Ministry of the Interior to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice and activities regarding
humanization of criminal and criminal-executive policy have made Kazakhstan an absolute leader
in the reformation of the penal system in Central Asia.

In the context of improvement of the criminal-executive system, on August 6, 2007 the Gov-
ernment of the Republic of Kazakhstan adopted the Program of Further Development of the Crimi-
nal and Executive System of the Republic of Kazakhstan during 2007-2009 No. 673 (further re-
ferred to as “the Program”).

The Program is aimed at the improvement of the management of the Criminal and Executive
System (further referred to as “the CES”), the improvement of conditions of confinement of indi-
viduals in institutions of the CES, the increase of the efficiency of execution of criminal sanctions
and security of employment for the convicted.

With the view of public control of the security of the rights of the convicted, beginning in the
year 2005, public watch commissions (PWC) started to function in all regions of the Republic.
These commissions were established on the initiative of public unions and associations.

The convicted are provided with the opportunity to render worship in specially designed facili-
ties in compliance with religious traditions. They are allowed to have and to use religious litera-
ture and religious items of personal use. To provide spiritual assistance, the invitation of religious
ministers is permitted.



Presently, in all the correctional institutions of the Criminal and Executive System there are
36 mosques and churches and 168 meeting houses of various religions. The number of believers
amounts to 9,508.

Comprehensive studies arranged in the institutions of confinement ensure a link with the edu-
cational system in the country, which allows the convicted to receive further education after their
liberation.

In the institutions of the Criminal and Executive System there are 52 comprehensive schools

in which are studying 6,252 convicts who do not have a secondary education.

One of the most important activities in the organization of the educational work with the
convicted and in the re-socialization of the convicted and their return to the civil society is the
development of psychological services. Positions of psychologists are instituted in all facilities of
the CES. The total number of psychologists amounts to 224.

Nevertheless, despite the work already accomplished, there are serious problems in the penal

system with regard to human rights that need to be resolved.

On the basis of statistical information on the prison population of the Republic of Kazakh-
stan provided by the CCES MJ RK on January 1, 2009, the International Center for Prison Stud-
ies under the London University (ICPS) has updated the information in the worldwide sheet of
prison system development trends. According to ICPS estimates, in January 2009, the Republic of
Kazakhstan, with a prison index of 382 prisoners per 100,000 population, ranked 17th place (for
comparison: in 2008 – 18th place, in 2007 – 23rd place, in 2006 – 25th place), i.e. during the last 3
years there is a stable trend of the increase of the number of convicted. On January 1, 2009, 50,394
convicted were serving their sentence in the penal system of Kazakhstan (in 2005 – 44,076).

There have been instances of the illegal placement of the convicted into penal jails and cell-
type facilities and the imposition upon the convicted of unwarranted disciplinary penalties. The
administration of the institutions have allowed the illegal impedance of the right to the grant of
parole, transfer to a prison colony, or the application of an order of amnesty.

The nature of appeals of the convicted testifies to the low level of knowledge of the procedure
and conditions for the granting of parole, including due to sickness, the procedure and time limit
for appeal of denial of parole and also the right to the appeal of penalties imposed by the adminis-
tration of institutions.

There are cases of violation of the rights of the convicted to the access to the court in the

course of investigation of the grant of parole.

To the question: “What do you think, has the situation of the convicted in correctional institu-
tions been improved after the transfer of the functions of the MI to the Ministry of Justice RK?”
which was asked of 1,500 respondents by experts of the Association of Sociologists of Kazakh-
stan, 2.4% of respondents confirmed the improvement of the situation of the convicted, .4%
found it difficult to respond and 20.2% of respondents believe that the situation was not improved.
The results of sociological studies prove that there are serious problems with regard to the security
RK and Kazakhstan’s inter-
�� RK and Kazakhstan’s inter-
of the rights of the convicted guaranteed by the Constitution, the CE�� RK and Kazakhstan’s inter-
national obligations in the sphere of human rights.

The right of citizens serving a sentence in an institution of confinement to the protection of
health is not secured in full measure. Opportunities for medical consultations and examinations by
medical specialists of civil health care institutions are limited in penal institutions. The securing of
medical assistance is adversely affected by the lack of medical personnel and the low level of their
salaries, due to which the majority of them is poorly motivated to properly fulfill their duties.

For instance, currently, the death rate among the convicted is a serious problem.
According to data from January 1, 2009, there are 4,347 tuberculosis patients in correctional
institutions (according to data from January 1, 2008 – 3,460). The death rate among the convicted
has increased from 268 (during 2007) to 328 (according to data from January 1, 2009).

9

The growth of the death rate is caused not only by the fact that in the regions mentioned there
are tuberculosis treatment institutions, but also by the fact that medical commissions do not certify
the presence of seriously sick people in a timely manner and management does not submit records
to the court for early liberation due to sickness in a timely fashion.

Inspections have revealed numerous violations of law by institutions with special regimes.
Thus, the overcrowding of such institutions and reduction of financing for sustenance of the
convicted have become the main reasons for violation of the rights of the convicted guaranteed
by criminal and executive legislation and by the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of
Prisoners, adopted at the first UN Congress in 1955. Moreover, the convicted were forced to stay
in unfavorable conditions, which contradict sanitary and hygiene standards.

It should be noted that the condition of the majority of buildings and facilities does not meet the
International Rules, which clearly determine that the convicted should be provided with sufficient
space, air supply and illumination in order to preserve their health. The majority of correctional
institutions are located in buildings constructed during the 30s – 60s of the twentieth century.

As a rule, the convicted live in barrack type hostel buildings (100-150 people), which

significantly impedes the reformation of the convicted and the insurance of their safety.

Overcrowding of places of confinement leads to the deterioration of sanitary and hygiene con-
ditions, deprives the convicted of an opportunity to be alone, causes a great overload of services
systems, in particular, medical care, to a great extent hinders the realization of program activities
and inevitably results in tension of relationships between the convicted themselves and between
the convicted and personnel, which increases the risk of violence.

In closed institutions, the risk of cruel treatment of the convicted increases.
In April 2007, there were instances of the torture of the convicted serving their sentence in the
institution LA-155/8 of the Administration of the Committee of the Criminal and Executive Sys-
tem (further referred to as “the ACCES”) of the Almaty region and in Prison No. 1 of the city of
Arkalyk of the ACCES of the Kostanay region. In a protest against illegal actions of the employees
of these institutions, more than 30 convicts organized a mass mutilation. Owing to the efforts of
the Prosecutor General’s Office, an objective investigation of the commencement of criminal pros-
ecution of the convicts who organized the mass mutilation as a sign of protest was carried out. On
the basis of the Enactment of the Constitutional Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan of Febru-
ary 27, 2008, the first and the fourth parts (with regard to determination of the qualifying features
of the first part) of Article 361 of the Criminal Code were admitted as unconstitutional.

On the basis of the Enactment of the Constitutional Council of February 27, 2008, the court
of the city of Kapshagay of the Almaty region halted the criminal procedure with regard to the
convicts who participated in the mass mutilation in the institution LA-155/8.

The convicted find it problematic to receive qualified legal assistance guaranteed by Article 13
of Part 3 of the Constitution and by Article 10 of the Criminal Executive Code. Legal services for
the convicted is not included in the list of free legal assistance; and when an accusatory conviction
comes into legal force, the convicted, if he has no money to pay for the services of the a lawyer, is
deprived of the right to the receipt of qualified legal assistance.

***
A special concern of the Human Rights Commission is the protection of the rights of minors

in correctional institutions.

In the territory of the Republic, there are 5 correctional institutions that contain convicted

minors.

Violations of the right of the children to the receipt of survivors’ benefits and other social bene-
fit payments were discovered in all correctional institutions. According to the Law of the Republic
of Kazakhstan “On Marriage and Family” children left without the support of parents and staying
in educational, medical, or other institutions have the right to the alimonies, pensions, allowances
and other social benefit payments due to them.

20

According to information from the Prosecutor General’s Office, out of 437 convicted minors
living in correctional institutions, there are 122 orphans and children left without the support of
parents.

However, the administration of the correctional institutions did not take action to secure their
rights to the receipt of state social survivors’ benefits, which is a violation of Article 108 of the Law
of RK “On Marriage and Family”.

Thus, the right of 122 convicted minors to the receipt of survivors’ benefits and other social
allowances guaranteed by Article 28 of the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan was vio-
lated.

In an effort to secure the rights of the convicted guaranteed by the Constitution, the
CE�� R�� and international documents in the field of human rights�� we recommend the �ov�
R�� and international documents in the field of human rights�� we recommend the �ov-
�� R�� and international documents in the field of human rights�� we recommend the �ov�
ernment of the Republic of Kazakhstan jointly with the authorized governmental agencies
implement the following measures during the period of 2009-202:

1. Provide the institutions of the Criminal and Executive System with competent and qualified

personnel.

2. Create the organizational and legal conditions for the expansion of application of kinds of

criminal penalty alternatives to imprisonment.

It is necessary to establish probation services and renew the fixed assets and production fa-
cilities of criminal and executive institutions, which would contribute to wider application of all
kinds of criminal penalty alternatives to imprisonment, the more complete employment level of
the prison population and the successful re-socialization of liberated citizens.

3. Provide safe and adequate conditions of life for the convicted in institutions of

confinement.

Continue the construction of the necessary number of institutions, which would conform to the

Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.

4. We recommend that the Ministry of Justice jointly with the Committee of Criminal and
Executive System and the Republican State Enterprise “Yenbek” take the required actions to
increase the employment of the convicted, which would contribute to the timely repayment of
suits and the realization of their right to grant of parole.

5. Develop a governmental program aimed at the increase of awareness and legal competence of

the convicted and employees of correctional institutions with regard to issues of early liberation.

6. Develop clear criteria for the assessment of reformation of the convicted; for instance,

starting to reform, is clearly on the path of reform and has proven to be reformed.

7. Legislatively establish a procedure for the provision of qualified legal assistance to the

convicted.

8. Correctional institutions and investigative jails should be open to the maximum possible
extent for control by agencies of civil society. The activity of correctional institutions and
investigative jails must be made public. The closing of these institutions to the public creates ideal
conditions for torture and violence.

In 2012, adopt the individual Law “On Public Control of the Observance of Human Rights
in Institutions of Confinement” which would regulate the procedures for independent public,
medical and other control and the forms and methods of interaction between the administration of
correctional institutions, investigative jails and psychoneurological health care centers with NGOs
and the mass media.

9. Before the adoption of the individual Law “On Public Control of the Observance of Human
Rights in Institutions of Confinement”, legislatively grant public watch commissions the right to
the unexpected visit of correctional institutions, investigative jails and jails for temporary custody
in order to monitor the observance of human rights.

10. We recommend that the Human Rights Commission under the President of the Republic
of Kazakhstan and the Ministry of Justice take necessary actions to give the members of public
watch commissions an opportunity to freely visit correctional institutions and investigative jails.

2

11. Establish Adaptation Centers for individuals who served their sentence in institutions of
confinement, since the current conditions of their confinement in criminal and executive institutions
of Kazakhstan cripple their physical and psychological health, so that they typically are not capable
of joining normal society life for an extended period.

12. We recommend that the Ministry of Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan take measures
to exclude violations of the property and social rights of the minors living in the correctional
institutions of the Committee of the Criminal and Executive System.

Conclusion

Despite the evident progress in the sphere of human rights protection, law-enforcement

mechanisms of the Republic of Kazakhstan need significant adjustment.

Human rights have not yet become the absolute priority of governmental policy and the
activity of governmental authorities. So far, in the country there is no adequate understanding and
coordination of the activities of all branches of authority with regard to the security and protection
of human rights and freedoms. The recommendations and measures suggested in the National Plan
are aimed at the improvement of legislative, institutional and control mechanisms in the sphere
of human rights. It is necessary to use more fully the law-enforcement potential of institutions of
civil society, to give detailed attention to the role of legal education and the formation of a socially
active individual able to protect his rights and to require of other participants of legal relationships
(first of all of governmental authorities and their officials) the adequate attitude toward his rights
and obligations.

Implementation of the measures of the National Plan will contribute to the cultivation of
a developed human rights culture in society and to the development of effective methods of
interaction between governmental authorities, NGOs and other participants during the course of
implementation of the approved recommendations.

During the course of improvement of the national legislation of the country it is necessary to
create all necessary conditions for the full involvement of representatives of civil society in the
discussion of draft laws and other legislation related to human rights and freedoms.

The practicality and magnitude of the work done on the National Plan includes the fact that it
may become not only the necessary starting line from which begins the development of the goals
and objectives of the new Concept of Legal Development of Kazakhstan, but also a criteria for the
success of subsequent measures for the improvement of the mechanisms of security and protection
of human rights and freedoms.

In the course of preparation of the National Plan, the experts sought to consider international
experience to the fullest extent possible, in particular the experience of the development of a
National Plan in Lithuania, Sweden, Australia, Spain, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Indonesia, Singapore
and the Philippines.

The work group under the coordinating role of the Human Rights Commission under the
President of RK had an opportunity to discuss the intermediate results of their work in the round
table format. It is necessary to note the constructive viewpoints of all participants of the project
which, in the framework of intensive dialogue, allowed the overall assessment of the situation and
the elaboration of recommendations on improvement of law-enforcement practices aimed at the
practical implementation of the constitutional postulate of the highest value of the human and his
life, rights and freedoms.

One of the results of the implementation of the National Plan may be the development of optimal
methods of interaction between legislative, executive, judicial and non-judicial, supervisory and
public agencies in the uniform rhythm of governmental and legal life. It may possibly become the
primary achievement of the National Plan.

22

The National Plan will allow uniting of the efforts of governmental authorities and non-
governmental and international organizations in the realization of a uniform strategy and the
development of general approaches and methods to legally regulating of relationships between the
authorities and the opposition.

In addition, implementation of the National Plan should be oriented at the achievement of the

following results:

- Implementation of international standards for human rights in the national legislation and

law-enforcement practices;

- Improvement of governmental and public mechanisms for the protection of human rights;
- Consolidation of non-judicial human rights institutions including the institution of

Ombudsman;

- Development of institutions of civil society and their interaction with the governmental

authorities;

- Provision of effective protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the

human and citizen;

- Implementation of a special program for security of the rights of socially vulnerable sections

of the population;

- Ensuring of the transparency of the activities of governmental authorities and institutions of

civil society;

- Achievement of a high level of public awareness of commonly acknowledged human rights

standards and of their value for each individual and society as a whole (human rights education);

- Enhancement of the legal culture of the population;
- Reduction of the risks of social tension and potential social conflicts.
Eventually, the implementation of the National Human Rights Action Plan will make it possible
for Kazakhstan to achieve further success in the formation of a legal government, the strengthening
of governmental and public mechanisms for human rights protection and the establishment of a
developed civil society at the level of commonly acknowledged international standards.

The work group for the National Human Rights Action Plan expresses gratitude to the UN
Development Programme in Kazakhstan, to the office of the UN Development Programme in
Bratislava, the OSCE ODIHR, governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations of
the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Association of Sociologists of Kazakhstan, other institutes of civil
society of Kazakhstan, international organizations accredited in Kazakhstan (the OSCE Center
