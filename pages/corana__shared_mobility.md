> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

In Quito (Ecuador) there are approximately 700,000 vehicles that travel daily through the streets and avenues of the city, resulting in high rates of GHG emissions and chaotic traffic (it is estimated that the average occupancy of private cars is 1.2 users/car ). The "Carona, shared mobility" initiative seeks, in its first stage, to discourage the use of private cars and promote shared mobility through an application where it is possible to "match" between the routes of each person. In this way, it is intended that there is no longer practically 1 person per vehicle and the use of streets is optimized as well as generating community and interaction between inhabitants of the surrounding areas (neighborhoods, housing complexes, parishes, valleys, etc.)
