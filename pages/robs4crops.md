> Description of the solution

Project set up by the European Union in three European countries by implementing three different types of robots: 2. Autonomous robots/tractors with a sensing of environment, localisation and navigation that are able to communicate with smart implements. 3. Planning and scheduling software. The Farming controller uses Digital Twin technology for pro-active and reactive planning and scheduling. They have so far run projects on mechanical weeding in vineyards, table grape spraying, apple orchard spraying, and mechanical weeding in arable crops.
