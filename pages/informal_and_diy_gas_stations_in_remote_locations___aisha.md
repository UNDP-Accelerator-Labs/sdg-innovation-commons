Informal and DIY gas stations in remote locations

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Throughout my daily route, I have come to notice the proliferate existence of small scale gas stations, or 'Pertamini' as they are called here in Indonesia, as a word play from the national energy company's name, Pertamina. These mini gas stations initially started as a collective initiative from various communities throughout Indonesia, utilizing jerry cans or reused bottles (such as those from alcoholic drinks), and are stacked in a wire rack by the side of the road, typically in remote locations. As the years go by, more modern products are developed and sold in the market, entitled 'Pertamini' or mini 'Pertamina' boxes, mimicking the large scale gas stations with their tubular storage, digital display and hose. As seen in the photos enclosed, currently there is a wide array of models available for purchase and usage, displayed in smaller roads. The main target market for these informal gas stations are mostly motorcycle riders, which travels covers to the utmost remote locations of Indonesia.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

The sporadic initiative of utilizing jerry cans or used bottles in the early establishments of these small scale gas stations stemmed from the unmet need of fuel coverage for remote locations in Indonesia. As the biggest archipelago in the world, Indonesia is riddled with issues of increasing inequality, not limited to that of infrastructure and development. Thus, despite the unprecedented rate of urbanization, majority of its population still travels to remote locations to fulfill their daily necessities utilizing cars, motorcycles, and other types of vehicles. As the national energy company, Pertamina, only focuses on constructing large scale gas stations in various cities, it is challenging to cover rural areas with limited access and infrastructure. In order to further support daily activities of its population, several creative entrepreneurs started to purchase gas in jerry cans in order to include in their shops' range of products. They then gain profit from increasing the price slightly compared to that of the large gas stations and reaching the outskirts of cities. 

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

What started out as a seemingly scattered initiative to increase microentrepreneurs' profit, has turned into a collective movement that evolves in an accelerated pace. From employing available materials in the neighborhood, with the healthy competition among other business owners and growing need from the informal market, this particular innovation has even instigated 'proper' the importance of product design as a means to reach customers. This model has proven to be successful with the vast replication throughout Indonesia, with more developing advanced versions of the 'Pertamini' gas station. By accommodating basic mobility needs for majority of the population, this grassroot innovation has supported developments in different areas such as providing access to accessible transport systems, contributing to road safety, enabling access to school and healthcare, among others. If other communal pain points that span over the entire country's population can be identified and adeptly tackled, then the replication process could potentially occur naturally and its impact could be as in-depth as in this case study.
