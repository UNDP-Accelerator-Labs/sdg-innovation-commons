Description: It is a method to filter any type of water. The straw can filter from the water coming out of the jet, to water from river, lake or wells. It is ideal for communities that do not have access to piped water and the bodies of water to which they have access are contaminated.

Interesting feature: It is portable, so it can be taken to very remote communities.
