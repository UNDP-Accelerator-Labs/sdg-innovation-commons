acceleration health facilities to meet clients needs as an innovation

> Brief description of the innovation

innovation in the health sector including access to digital tools is set to deeply modify its traditional organization and practices.  it will reinforce access to medical knowledge for patients and healthcare professionals. contribute  to finding new knowledge and let our organizations adapt to new needs linked to the population aging process or the increase of chronic disease for instance, it will also provide solution  that fit our  current human and financial constraints. our evaluation method must improve  and adapt to new solutions regarding technology, organization skills and professional practices, regulation and funding models must involve in order to implement and expand these solutions. There is also a new reflection for us to adopt on our health system- which we must consider as a value which will create jobs and wealth. if this project is supported it will create more than 5o jobs for health professionals as well as security guards, hospital 
 cleaners, clearks and accountants and secure there future through this programme. will also work hand in hand with the food and drug development of zambia on the procurement of commodity and strengthen the supply chain management to insure constant supply of the drugs for better health .

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

first and foremost I believe that a health nation is a wealth nation, making a private clinic  will generate income from clients and patient who will come  to seek medical attention once it begin to operate fully  with the help of investors and also create jobs for others thereby creating an impact on the community and lessen the burden of the government of the day. 
       prototyping and testing innovations in a clinical environment
  all devices, services and pathways require evidence to support their introduction and must show superiority to what is currently available, ideally at a lower cost. however, this evidence is difficulty to acquire without access to patients and clinical facilities to develop and test prototypes.
  another important development is the creation of the new care model of the patient to meet clients satisfaction, this will bring together partnerships of my company with local government, voluntary, community, and other organizations in order to move from fragmented care to integrated care in communities. There is already an evidence that that partnership is improving local services while reducing pressure on government and accident and emergency services.
  the is just on the ground and at community level as well as within the region and therefore such incentives offer valuable and 0pportunities for companies across the world to innovation at a scale in zambia.

> Technical Feasibility

my innovation is designed as follows . removing the barriers from the nurse station ,getting rid semi private patient rooms, making the window the room larger and lowering its height .creating family zones in patients room, locating the patient room bathroom in the headwall, placing  distributed nurse stations on patients units, providing access to to positive distractions art, nature, music etc, replacing long corridors on patient units with a p0d concept.    
       challenges of innovation in healthcare 
 budgets are limited -we have to make an efficient savings to close the esmated of 70000-100000 us dollars funding gap between patients needs and resources. demand is increasing- over population is living longer than ever before , often with multiple comorbidities. the front line is under increasing pressure, new ways of doing things are often the first casualty .  public expectation are rising.
    propsed implementation plan 
  once given this chance will have an improved health facility in place, we have seen an overwhelming response the current in my area in kawama clinic is packed with patient and the pressure cannot been handled effectively. so we will make an innovation challenge prizes, clinical excellence awards, healthcare small business research initiatives, the national institute for health and care excellence including the implementation collaboration, medical innovation briefings,medical technology evaluation programme.

> Anticipated Social Impact

it will make an impact in the community and the nation in the sense that clients will be attended to according to their needs and all the workers will be given good salaries and the response on the market is overwhelming because this lucky of  health facility in ndola where patient travel more than 12km just to access medical attention.
