## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. When working with SMEs, digitalization can be a challenge. In our process we have understood certain barriers that stand in the way of adding an invisible platform into their sales cycle. Often, they will need to see and feel the intangible to get its value. 2. In our analysis of the waste characterization, we have identified some low hanging fruits in order to reduce the production of no-recyclables wastes such as plastic and foam. A regulation change in the market could be an easy win, that is where top-down support is needed. 3. Public markets are an amazing platform to study and test sustainable social challenges because they are places where multiple systems intertwine. Are work as led us to draft a range of solutions that vary from food systems to community-based tourism. 4. Our work is not linear, we knew it. New solutions have emerged as we were starting prototyping the mapped ones, and some are scaling on their own. It is important to keep track of those emerging trends. 5. Our hypothesis proposes a change of human/social behavior through the portfolio of actions we are currently undergoing, yet our research has also shown that other external factors affect our system's dynamics (such as poor urban accessibility to the market for example). We anticipate such factors will remain relevant, and we will have to learn to discern their impact and how they will affect our results.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Our main barrier so far has been related to keeping up with the expected times of the cycle. In that sense, most bottleneck we have faced have been when working with third parties.

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

This stage was mostly focused on developing the experiments, and, although most of them did not get started, the process of user journeys (for market vendors) for digitalization; as well as prototyping of a separation device and the socialization process with market vendors to rescue food waste have been key to preprare the conditions to develop these pilots.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The assets mapping (Solutions Tree activity) provided us with various observations that were considered to develop the portfolio of experimental solutions to bring us closer to achieving the objective of adopting ideas and projects that allow it to be a model of the circular economy for solid waste management. From this perspective, we add the opinions and ideas of the internal allies of the market in order to generate ownership of future projects. Similarly, for the co-creation and collective were used for the same reasons.
## Partners
****

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Fundacion Rescate de Alimentos - Creation of a food rescue alliance that includes the creation of recipes or flagship products with food surpluses from the market in collaboration with local chefs and cooks.

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We did not work directly with any academic partner or institution at this learning cycle.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Pedidos YA - Digitalize the offer of product of SMEs present in the market.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Municipal Market Unit - Main ally for all the coordination, approval of project, logistics within the market and relationship with tennants (SMEs).

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Both PedidosYa and Fundación Rescate de Alimentos could be considered unusual partners for UNDP, as we have not worked with them before. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

FAO - Follow up on the implementation and scaling of a composting system within the market.
## End
****

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The interplay of the methods and partners we have worked with throughout this process has allowed us to have a panoramic view of the system and has shed some light to unexpected influencing factors. We were able to understand some of the motivating reasons and values that people see behind this work. This kind of information and our interpretation of it through the rest of the process will have a crucial role in the appropriation of the solutions and the long-term value we can create.
