## Overall goal

Build accessible knowledge about the air quality of Villa Inflamable along with the community for the promotion of policies and programs for sustainable environmental co-management of the territory with a focus on the reduction and mitigation of health risks. 
## Specific goals

Co-design and scale up air quality monitoring devices. 

Identify the protective measures carried out by the community of Villa Inflamable regarding odors, gases, and smoke to which it is exposed. 

Create collaborative management tools for air quality facilitating the participation of the community, local government, and university. 
## Description of citizen participation

Air quality control devices were co-created with the community of Villa Inflamable to jointly carry out measurements. Citizens view the data on the device displays. Based on the data collected, workshops are held with the community where graphics and visualizations are shared to facilitate the process of interpreting measurement results, with the help of academic researchers and the acquisition of scientific-technical skills.
