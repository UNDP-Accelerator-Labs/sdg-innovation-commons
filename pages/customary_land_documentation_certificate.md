> Title of the innovation

Customary Land Documentation Certificate

> Brief description of the innovation

Zambia has two types of land tenure systems which is state land and traditional land system. At the moment the state land accounts to an average of 20% while traditional land accounts for 80% of Zambia land. State land has had progressive systematic land registration system while traditional land does not have a systematic progressive land registration system and as a result there's poor documentation of land tenure security on traditional. 
Customary Land Documentation is a service project that will provide a capacity for traditional chiefs to issue out Land tenure certificates for their respective chiefdoms to individual land owners and also generate a general Chiefdom map for developmental planning purposes. The presence of proper documentation in the customary land sector will eliminate threats of dispossession, multiple land sales, boundary disputes, unclarity of the land rights, loss of investments, among others. Tesco will have Consent and a Memorandum of understanding with the chief which will enable Tesco to offer the services in the chiefdom

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This project will generate revenue by collecting service fees from each land owner for the systematic documentation of one’s respective Customary Land certificate at an affordable cost. The customary land certificate will be affordable to an average villager in the rural village. 
This Project will promote investments in traditional chiefdoms and also enhance existing business through the provision of Land tenure security.
The target market is individual traditional land owners. As we extend the services to other chiefdoms the challenge prize will help Tesco to increase its capacity by providing employment to locals and engage more chiefs and operate in many chiefdoms and also will help subsidise costs for individual land owners who will not be able to pay for the service fee

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed by first generating a general Chiefdom map which will entail Tesco mapping village boundaries in the chiefdom and also mapping all existing features/structures which is common lands such as grazing, burial sites, farming areas, schools, health centres, road networks, Zesco network, markets and social facility centres. The chiefdom general map indicating all mentioned items will be produced and also used as a guide in mapping individual parcels of lands.
Mobile devices will be used with open source data collection tools like kobotool box, google sheets, ODK Collect and SWMaps.
The proposed implementation plan is as follows
1.	Obtain consent from the chief
2.	App and Questionnaire Development
3.	Chiefdom General Map development using existing information from Ministry of lands and natural resources
4.	Physically mapping of all existing features/structures
5.	Recruitment and training of data Collectors
6.	Training of Village committee as Adjudication committee
7.	Mapping of Individual Land Owners
8.	Public display of collected data for verification
9.	Generation and Production of Land certificates 
We have completed step one and now we are working on step 2 and 3. We plan to have the generation and production of Land certificates by the end of September

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve people’s lives by providing land tenure security for individual land owners. This will help youths and women in securing their land and also sustainability in their family generation. It will also help resolve boundary disputes. It will also help or promote developmental activities in chiefdom like smart agriculture and sustainable development like individual land owners preserving tress on their land
