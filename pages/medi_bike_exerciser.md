Rehabilitation Units may face insufficient equipments problem for patients with muscle weakness, paralysis and imbalance and coordination problems. This increases the treatment time for patients and slows their discharge process. Medi Bike Exerciser was innovated to able exercise activities for upper and lower limbs to be carried out simultaneously, reducing the treatment time by 50% .  The bike has four pedals- two four hands and two for feet, enabling patient to move their upper and lower body simultaneously. The MBE can be adjusted to the patient's height and position, maintaining an ergonomic body posture. The flexible shape of the bike allows patients to cycle easily from various locations such as beds, wheelchairs and chairs. Made of strong and stainless steel, the MBE weighs only 6.7 kg and is also equipped with wheels for easy transfer. It is also equipped with rubber on the base to reduce slippage. The bike is an affordable alternative and does not require electricity. With this price, patients can afford to own and rehabilitate in their respective homes without having to commute to the hospital.
