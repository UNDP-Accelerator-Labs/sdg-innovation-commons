> Title of the innovation

Climate Change and Agriculture

> Brief description of the innovation

We are into fruit tree🌲planting to mitigate climate change as well as producing hundred percent fruit juice drinks, jam processing, soap ,creams and hair growth oils as a means of income generation. To mitigate Climate Change  the evergreen trees will be planted On agriculture we are targeting crops like mornga oleifera for nutrition, water purification using the seed, castor  and processing oil,tomato, to produce tomato sauce and paste , sunflower for cooking oil production and sunflower cake for  feed, and cayenne pepper for chilli sauce.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The growing of moringa is completely organic and we train our farmers to use organic fertilizer and pesticides which will restore the nutrients in the soil. . The products will be processed from source meaning value addition is key, therefore, the income will be higher than selling the unprocessed products. It will also aliviate poverty from our communities because everyone will be productive. We hope to extend our markets beyond our borders that is to our neighbouring countries. Tomato sauce, Tomato Puree, Tomato Paste, and other agricultural products. Instead of people cutting trees to burn charcoal we will train our people to use alternative ways to produce charcoal cheaply and easily.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently we share knowledge among ourselves, although there's need to have a grinding machine to process the moringa leaf into powder, a Yenga Pressing Machine to extract oil for moringa seed, castor and Sunflower seed. Blenders and juicers for soap and hair oil processing. If the following machines can be provided for us , it is our hope that our vision can be realized and many people will benefit from this Project.
We are already working on the Homemade Soap and Cosmetics but these other agricultural products we are depending on the weather that is during the rain season.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will enable the women and the youth to operate from within their homes and fields which is easily accessible to them.. Every household will have enough food and income to meet other financial needs within the family. This innovation enables people to acquire skills and be self reliant. The innovation has a price list for the products which the members can market through and get paid without struggling to market their products on their own.
