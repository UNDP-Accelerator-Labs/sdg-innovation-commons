> Title of the innovation

Anhydrous Pre-Cooked Beans requires no refrigeration with long shelf life and shorter cooking time and  low energy use. The results is an anytime anywhere bean meal created for  versatile recipes such as salads, snacks, soups , sauces, filling and can be added to meat stews directly and other mashed dishes.

> Brief description of the innovation

The business case is a food value addition undertaking with a focus on Cooked dried beans. While beans is a nutritious cheap source of protein, fibre, and essential minerals, its consumption is challenged by long cooking times, energy-intensive and indigestion side effects. 
This unique precooked beans concept considerably reduces cooking times, has a longer shelf life does not require refrigeration and as such makes very it energy efficient. Because of zero planning required, it increases bean consumption for the well being of consumers who have busy schedules such as students, backpackers and food preppers who wish to stockpile long term to increase food security resilience. It can impact food waste reduction and contributes to food security through portion control management and hence contribute to responsible consumption.
The project can be replicated by way of deploying sustainable technology and training for on-farm processing to serve food nutrition and value addition extended to other food products such as tubers, fruits and vegetables.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The pre-cooked bean market for ready-to-eat has predominantly been canned beans until recently when our traditional local prepared bean packaged and frozen type has appeared on the market for the urbanites. The anhydrous precooked bean offers a competitive alternative with unmatched features such as longer shelf life and requiring no refrigeration. It has the potential to:
    1. enter the regional market through the free trade areas (FTAs), 
    2. Access the supermarket chain store
    3. Upcycling into other products of higher value
    4. produce a market effect for sustainable and export quality orientation.

To realise the potential, the strategy will include:
    •  Revenue generation/potential: Direct sales, wholesale, contract, and export markets.
    • Marketing strategy; marketing and advertisement; social media presence nutrition promotional campaign to increase product visibility.
    •  Leverage Unique selling proposal: Ready-to-Cook beans traditional, natural, and NO additives, controlled portion and no wastages,  versatile recipe, reduced side effects of undigested sugars, and a longer shelf-life.
    • Target market: Learning institutions / Backpackers/ Food preppers and with potential chain supermarket off-take to meet city lifestyle trends.
    • Core Investment: Cooking, drying, and packaging technology procurement to Scale the production efficiency and meet the demand-pull anticipated.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation lies in the new way of making ready-to-prepare of one popular but difficult dry bean food pulse. Making the final food product  involve the following processes: 
    1. Procurement and logistics: Aggregate sourcing of specific bean types and later contracting out-grower schemes in order to control the quality from the seed-soil management and harvest.
    2.  Preparation: Sorting/cleaning/soaking
    3. Production: Cooking/drying/savoury process control
    4.  Packaging: marketing and distribution supported by warehousing and requisite staffing at each stage..
    5. Promotion and marketing
The main five stages all require different equipment, technology, human and financial capital for administration and management to support the business processes competitively. The third and fourth stages are technology and capital intensive for procurement of special food-grade equipment required to scale production of the dried cooked beans that have successfully passed the proof of concept stage.
While the business case proposed high-tech machinery to scale the production to meet the quantity and market demand, adaptive solar-based models can be deployed at the farm level for pre-processing of food crop harvest to avoid spoilage as the proof of concept has shown.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The business case when implemented at scale, will contribute to the economic and social well-being of all stakeholders given the five-stage process mention above. The impact may come in form of :
    • Environmentally friendly and sustainable production, through increased efficient processing and food products development.
    • Value addition and agribusinesses that benefit small-scale farmers-women and youth groups inclusive of differently-abled persons given the various increased processes.
    • Food security by entrenching food prepping culture to other farm produces 
that support responsible consumption and prevent post-harvest losses.
  
Anticipated industry collaboration and markets will increase growth prospects,  create employment and improve the socio-economic well-being of all stakeholders in the value chain.
Thus the project identifies with UN SDGs goal 2,9 and 12 how this innovation leads to responsible consumption( nutrition education for well being; sustainable development and climate change conscious) and contribute to the big question of the Food problem: in the world of plenty and food wastage, people still go to bed hungry.
