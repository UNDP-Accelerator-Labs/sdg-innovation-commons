## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Depopulation Portfolio
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that adapting to demographic change requires system transformation and whole-of-society approach. Turning a new narrative, which defines trajectories for action and an extensive landscape of possible interventions, into an actionable portfolio.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Depopulation is a long-term trend for many countries, with Serbia among the fastest-shrinking in the world. It is a complex challenge with multiple root causes and several aspects moving at different speeds. Current situation: The Accelerator Lab has reframed the challenge and proposed an alternative approach, currently captured in a draft proposed portfolio for the CO and partners.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Recent birth data suggest government fertility measures are not generating results. Covid-19 has changed the lens through which migration could be viewed, with at least short-term potential for reverse trends. It has also affected our views on healthy ageing, the significance of intergenerational solidarity and social capital.  The SEIA for Serbia suggests depopulation significantly affected the ability of local governments to respond to Covid-19.

The Accelerator Lab ran a depopulation data challenge, combining alternative with official sources of data to delve deeper into the issue and gain new insights.  The solutions developed provide insights into migration dynamics (including reverse migration during Covid-19), in-country movements, and a range of new indicators for assessing risk of depopulation:  https://depopulacija.rs/ https://measuring-depopulation.org/  https://poslovi.infostud.com/undp-report  https://pop-insight.biosense.rs/   Other recent texts on the frontier challenge:  https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/08/20/the-balkans-are-getting-short-of-people https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/01/28/how-the-pandemic-reversed-old-migration-patterns-in-europe  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aWDyk8Bc3g

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Tackling depopulation is a strategic bet made by management for the entire CO, with the Accelerator Lab leading the work. The Lab has been engaged on the issue since its establishment in Serbia, reframing the challenge, exploring different aspects, testing ideas, establishing new partnerships, and designing a portfolio around depopulation. The approach employs “bleeding edge” thinking on tackling complex development problems. The Lab is uniquely positioned to take this work into its next stage, including partnership building, operationalization within the CO, further learning to articulate and refine the entry points, and supporting a new Government team to lead the portfolio into its management stage.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Responding to a declining population means prioritizing human development. Demographic change requires adaptive policies and new development approaches that help us learn about complex systems.
