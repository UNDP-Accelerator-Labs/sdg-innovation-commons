INTRODUCTION, SCOPE and METHODOLOGY
At present, large-scale reforms are being executed in the public health sector of Uzbekistan.
Establishment and development of the rural health clinics (RHC- primary health care) is the
priority of the national policy.

The rural health clinics need reliable and uninterrupted supply of power and heat to provide
up-to-standard medical services. Improving power and heat supply appears to be a key for
Rural Health Clinics (RHC) being operational during working hours. This objective was
defined by the Ministry of Healthcare of Uzbekistan within the framework of the ‘Health-2’
World Bank (WB) Project which is focused on helping poor families to improve their health
by developing health care system, providing family members broad and good access to health
care services as almost the entire population is living within two kilometers of a rural health
clinic.

Within the framework of the UNDP’s “Improving Power and Heat Supply Reliability in
Health Rural Clinics of Uzbekistan” Project (2007), technical and economic assessment of
options in order to equip the rural health clinics with Energy Efficient (EE) and Renewable
Energy (RE) systems, notably the plants that transfer solar energy to electric and thermal
power that can be integrated into existing conventional energy infrastructure to improve
reliability of power and heat supply, has been implemented.

The options proposed have been adjusted to the relevant budget resources available in rural
health clinics and to the budget for medical equipment. They have to ensure efficient use and
saving of energy and fuel, to be coherent with budget available and to be replicable at a large
scale.

representative

The ongoing UNDP Project “Piloting Energy Efficient and Renewable Energy Solutions in
Rural Health Clinics of Uzbekistan” have tested and demonstrate the EE and RE solutions in
four
(UMAROV, BAYMUKHAMEDOV,
clinics
DJEYKHANABAD, and JUZIM-BOG) and have identified their feasibility and viability in
order to recommend solutions to be replicated at a large scale in rural health clinics in
different provinces of the country within the WB Health-3 project.

health

rural

Considering that almost 90% of rural health clinics are connected to the grid, the first
objective of the project was to identify how many hours (frequency and duration) the medical
equipment is out of operation due to power failures. Second question was about energy
efficiency: in order to limit the substitution to grid failures, it seems necessary to have an
energy management approach and check on possible replacement of equipment intensively
consuming power with more energy efficient equipment.

The second objective/condition was about heating and how to avoid limits of medical
equipment operational due to lack of heating during winter season. As there is also lack of
natural gas (mainly low pressure on the grid) there is lack of heating and hot water in the rural
health clinic during winter season, therefore, the staff in rural health clinic is unable to work
properly. Different solutions have been tested: insulation, replacement of doors and windows,
thermal regulation, new gas burners, new gas boilers, solar thermal collectors.

After 4 seasons of monitoring results are now available and have confirmed but also
invalidate some solutions, so it is now possible to recommend various solutions depending on
specific conditions of the different RHCs: geographic/climatic, type of RHC, connected or not
to power and gas grids, etc using the selected criteria defined during the feasibility study.

The national and international consultants have launched procurement of equipment and
metering, supervised their installation and followed monitoring of pilots in four rural health

clinics covering all seasons: collected data from November 2008 till October 2009. These
data have been summarized in specific reports prepared by National Consultants (refer
appendix).

In accordance with the terms of reference this final report includes a short analysis of
monitoring results and lessons from this 12 months experience.

Then recommendations have been prepared from a technical point of view, for following
actions in the four selected RHCs and for replication of the optimal solutions in other RHCs
or hospitals in the country.

The last part of this report is more focused on financial and economic assessment of selected
solutions for further dissemination.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The solutions identified to improve power and energy efficiency and their reliability in the
four selected rural health clinics confirm that problems can be solved with different technical
equipment depending on each rural health clinic peculiarities and medical equipment already
installed or to be installed during next three years.

In order to choose between the various solutions, reliable information was required: power
cuts duration and frequency, lack of natural gas or low gas pressure duration periods and
frequency. Unfortunately, such information was not available and depends on sources. Same
difficulty about electricity and gas consumption: data collected from various sources were not
coherent, and expenses for electricity and gas consumption do not correspond to real
consumption. After 12 monitoring months, some of these questions do not find acceptable
answers due to the uncertain representativity of the four selected RHCs (power cut off during
17 days in June for Umarov RHC!), to a lack of reliability of some meters and for some
equipment such as UPS.

For power supply, installation of batteries/accumulators and uninterruptible power supply
(UPS) seemed the simplest and cheapest way, but according to the results, it may be
preferable to install small photovoltaic (PV) systems which present the advantage of
providing a good quality of power and autonomy for medical equipment during more than 8
months a year. In remote areas were maintenance could be difficult, it is also preferable to
install photovoltaic (PV) systems. The diesel generator installed in Djeykhanabad presented
good results and is convenient for rural hospitals linked with RHC. In order to find an answer
to long period of power cuts off (longer than 2 days), it could be possible to buy a mobile
diesel generator available at district or regional / province level.

Considering the power demand side, the main action has to be undertaken concerning
lighting: replacement of incandescent bulbs for low consumption energy efficient lamps. Due
to comparison between RHCs, management of equipment can be improved, such as using
centrifuge device after grouping several analyses (for one run of device) instead of using
device per one analysis.

Heating demand and supply recommendations focused on energy saving (demand):
installation of thermal regulation (temperature inside the buildings), improvement of
insulation (ceiling, walls and floor, pipes), improvement (or replacement) of windows and
doors (in order to increase their air-tightness), replacement with efficient gas burners or
boilers, including thermal regulation.

Water demand seems limited for cold and hot water, so solutions tested were over-
dimensioned and solar collectors does not correspond to the needs. If it is necessary to install
something new, electrical water heaters seem the appropriate answer.

BACKGROUND
At present, large-scale reforms are being executed in the public health sector of Uzbekistan.
Establishment and development of the rural health clinics (primary health care) is the priority
of the national policy.

The strategy for the primary health care reforming is focused on improvement of quality and
effectiveness of the medical service provided to the population, and is based on integration of
modern medical technologies, preventive health care, training of general practitioners,
strengthening of financing and management of primary health care.

For this improvement, the rural health clinics need reliable and uninterrupted supply of power
and heat to provide up-to-standard medical services. Improving power and heat supply
appears to be a key for Rural Health Clinics (RHC) being operational during working hours.

To carry out the reform, in 1998-2004 the Government with assistance of the World Bank
implemented a pilot project (Health-1) in five provinces of the country: Fergana, Navoiy,
Syrdarya, Khorezm and Karakalpakstan. The objective of the project was to examine and test
how the primary health care system in rural areas can be reformed. The ‘Health-1’ project
proposed and tested restructuring of the multi-stage health care system to the two-stage, by
that reducing the maintenance costs of medical institutions. In addition, the project introduced
a system where people get the first medical aid from a certified physician rather than from a
medical attendant’s assistant.

Positive results of the project persuaded the Ministry of Healthcare to develop a new ‘Health-
2’ project. A grant from the Japanese Government funded the project preparation work. The
Health-2 project aims to extend and deepen the scope of the primary health care reform across
all regions of Uzbekistan. In line with the Agreement on Development Financing signed
between Uzbekistan and International Development Association (IDA), Health-2 project was
launched in 2004. This project will provide 2,200 rural health clinics with up-to-date medical
equipment. Other components of the project will focus on making medical products more
accessible, continuous medical education and improving quality of medical services. The
project will also distribute best practices and lessons learn on financial and general
management received from piloting during Health-1 project.

The Uzbek Government and international donor organizations have allocated substantial
funds into rural health care infrastructure. However, the majority of rural health clinics have
faced certain problems with power and heat supply during the recent years. The reasons are,
in the first place, interrupted heating and hot water supply caused by problems with unstable
natural gas and power supply to medical facilities (low gas pressure and frequent power
failures), especially in winter season. Moreover, some problems with reliable cold water
supply occur in summer season. These and other factors have made a negative impact on
quality of medical services provided, medical equipment operation and capability of
emergency medical aid.

Development and implementation of all possible options of uninterrupted and reliable power
and heat supply to the rural health clinics, including integration of modern energy efficient
and renewable energy systems (e.g. use of solar energy for electricity generating and water
heating needs) into existing conventional energy infrastructure, provides the potential for
more efficient and effective use of the medical equipment and more comfort conditions for
physicians operation and patients treatment.

However, rural health clinics in Uzbekistan have some peculiarities. They are rather well
equipped with various medical equipment such as emergency aid, laboratory equipment for
medical tests, sterilizers, dental and physiotherapy equipment etc, which consume quite
significant amount of energy. The average electric power required for this equipment
operation is varying in the range of 7-13 kW, and average thermal power is in the range of 16-
50 kW. Moreover, rural health clinics differ in premises size and facility design as some are
located in the buildings built specifically for medical purposes, others in premises adapted for
medical needs. They also range in scale (large regional health clinics and small rural posts).
Rural health clinics are located in various climatic zones such as foothills, mountain areas,
deserts, and valleys. They also differ in the water, power and heat supply infrastructure; most
of rural health clinics are connected to the grid but heating is provided by boilers firing the
natural gas coming from gas pipelines.

Within the framework of the UNDP’s “Feasibility Study on Improving of Power and Heat
Supply Reliability in Health Rural Clinics of Uzbekistan” Project 2007, technical and
economic assessment of options have to be implemented in order to equip the rural health
clinics with Energy Efficient (EE) and Renewable Energy (RE) systems, notably the plants
that transfer solar energy to electric and thermal power that can be integrated into existing
conventional energy infrastructure to improve reliability of power and heat supply has been
implemented.

The options proposed have been adjusted to the relevant budget resources available in rural
health clinics and to the budget for medical equipment. They have to ensure efficient use and
saving of energy and fuel, to be coherent with budget available and to be replicable at a large
scale.

Developing the options for reliable power and heat supply has take care that rural health
clinics are equipped with a quite big number of medical equipment that requires substantial
amount of electric power. It is also necessary to have enough power for lighting,
communication, and in many cases for reliable cold water supply. Therefore, a combination of
conventional and EE and RE systems has been considered. Thus, photovoltaic systems may
be used for off-grid power supply for lighting and emergency equipment operation in case of
power failure. Solar collectors can be used for autonomous hot water supply in summer
season as well as for pre-heating of water for space heating needs in winter season to reduce
natural gas consumption. Moreover, some local and foreign manufactures of PV and solar
water heating systems licensed and certified according to national standards are available in
Uzbekistan. These companies are able to meet the future demand in such equipment, and
provide full cycle services such as installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance,
and after-sale service. The options proposed have been adjusted to the relevant budget
resources available in rural health clinics and to the budget for medical equipment. They have
to ensure efficient use and saving of energy and fuel, to be coherent with budget available and
to be replicable at a large scale.

The UNDP Project “Piloting Energy Efficient and Renewable Energy Solutions in Rural
Health Clinics of Uzbekistan” has been testing and demonstrate the EE and RE solutions
proposed for the four representative rural health clinics (UMAROV, BAYMUKHAMEDOV,
DJEYKHANABAD, and JUZIM-BOG) and will prove their feasibility and viability with a
sound justification to replicate these optimal solutions at a large scale in rural health clinics in
different provinces of the country within the WB Health-2 project.

1. ANALYSIS OF MONITORING RESULTS 11/2008 – 09/2009:

To prepare the provisional recommendations, the International Consultant has been supported
by several reports from National Consultants on monitoring:
- 4 seasonal reports about power supply and power consumption of 4 pilot RHCs ;
- 4 seasonal reports about heat and hot water supply and management, including solar water

heating systems of 4 pilot RHCs ;
- 4 seasonal reports about economics.

- These reports are available in Russian and English and have not been enclosed to this report

in order to focus on the main recommendations.

- Specific conclusions have been selected to explain recommendations:

1) Power supply and power consumption: (for more details refer to the reports of the

National Consultants R. Golovizin , P. Pozichanyuk and E. Bikeyeva)

1.1) Power cut off:
-Frequency: The number of power cuts off depends on the season and on unpredictable events
such as in Umarov RHC in June 2009. Based on monitoring data, as a result of emergency
situation occurred in June, duration of power cut off from regular power network made up
more than two weeks, and with consideration of total number of power cuts off for a whole
summer period – more than three weeks.

Except this problem, the maximum number has been observed in winter and represents from 5
to 15 power cuts off per month, mainly during daytime. There were only once or twice a week
during day time in November with exception for Djeykhanabad RHC, where there were also
many cuts off during night time. This number was growing during winter season, 2 or 3 times
a week, quite every day some weeks, during daytime (maximum 8 hours several times) and
also during night time in Juzim-Bog and Djeykhanabad clinics.
For Djeykhanabad RHC, during winter it has been registered an average of 8 cuts off per
month during daytime and 11 cuts off per month during night time. For Juzim-Bog clinic, the
maximum number was registered in spring, but limited to 8 power cuts off per month (5+3).
Monitoring confirms the importance of power cuts off, but do not allow dimensioning
alternative solutions due to scattered figures and unpredictable arrival (cases of cuts off). The
information collected gives a better idea of alternative needs of power during cuts off periods.

-Duration: The average duration of power cuts off was less than 3 hours for Baymukhamedov
and Umarov clinics and approximately 4 hours for Djeykhanabad and Juzim-Bog RHCs. But
maximum duration during daytime can reach 7 or 8 hours. It happens several times in spring
for Juzim-Bog RHC. For dimensioning, we propose to keep these figures: average duration
4 hours, maximum 8 hours during daytime.

1.2) Power/electricity consumed during regular period (without power cut off):
Data on power consumption varies from 1.1 to 7.7 kWh during daytime and from 0.85 to 6.4
kWh during night time. So the average consumption per day varies from 1.9 to 11.5 kWh.
Some consumption must be identified in order to limit consumption especially during nights.
Daily dispersal of power consumption is limited and less scattered for priority medical
equipment: from 200 to 700 Wh per day.

10 months monitoring has confirmed low electricity consumption with an average of 3 to 7
kWh per day depending on season (and RHC). Maximum 7 kWh/day in winter reduced to 3
or 4 kWh in spring and summer for all needs, including energy consuming equipment.
It seems that part of power consumed is used for lighting and heating with electric radiators in
winter which explain the difference. Considering the energy consuming equipment
(autoclaves, distillers, etc), it may be possible to let them working during night times,
wherever power cuts off are more frequent during daytimes than during night times.
Another reason of higher consumption in winter is lighting: pilot RHCs have been provided
with low consumption bulbs (power saving fluorescent lamps-PSL)), but these were installed
on a specific grid (backup power supply system) to be used during power cuts off, so there is
no energy saving registered. Considering an average number of 18 energy saving light bulbs
in each RHC (supplied by the Project) which consume from 5 to 6 kWh/day in winter, the
power saving potential is 800 to 1000 kwh per year for each RHC, by replacement of
filament lamps with the energy saving ones for lighting, potential economy will be: 45 000
Soums (30US$) for each RHC.

Based on the feasibility study, replacement of filament lamps and tube fluorescent lamps
could become economically sound and rational. Even the cost of electricity in Uzbekistan is 5
times lower than in Europe, replacement of filament lamps with power saving fluorescent
lamps (locally manufactured) is economically viable after 3,000 hours (2 years) and
replacement of tube fluorescent lamps with power saving fluorescent lamps is viable after
6,000 hours (4 years).

1.3) Power produced by PV systems (Baymukhamedov and Juzim-Bog):
Monitoring did not allow identification of electricity produced by PV systems, but only the
electricity produced during power cuts off. So in winter, less than 10 kWh/month have been
used in Baymukhamedov RHC and 12 kWh/month in Juzim-Bog clinic compared to the
potential of production (production output) from PV Systems of 30 kWh /month; in spring
respectively 6 and 7 kWh/month compared to the potential of 50 kWh/month. The difference
is even higher in summer: 1kWh/month in Baymukhamedov RHC and 2.3 kWh/month in
Juzim-Bog RHC compared to a large potential: 60 to 90 kWh/month!

In Baymukhamedov RHC, the backup power supply system has been used as the source
replacing /substituting the regular power network even without any cuts off. Staff of the clinic
explains this regime of use of backup power supply system because its use for operation of
EKG device is quite effective and “provides quality results of analysis”. Such assertion needs
to be confirmed and may represent a real opportunity to effectively use the electricity
produced by PV systems all the year round without any consideration of power cuts off.
It will be better for operating PV systems and considering annual production of 600kWh/year,
the saved power will represent an economy of 30 000 Soums (20$) per year for each PV
system installed.

Power produced by UPS in Umarov:
UPS works properly until the long power cuts off in June 2009. It should be noted that
installed equipment as a whole, functioned in normal regime, which did not require additional
costs for repair of devices. Except the faulty operation of accumulator batteries installed in
Umarov RHC (registered in summer period). Thus, in Umarov clinic, which was in
malfunction in June month (‘grid power’ was not supplied from 13.06 till 30.06.2009, i.e.
during 17 days) and the backup power supply system was switched on (from 17.06.2009),

which uninterruptedly supplied the clinic with electric energy during 12 days. When energy
was supplied back again through regular power network, and consequently, when accumulator
batteries charging system was switched on to the charging mode, the latter was disabled, as it
was not designed for charging of almost completely discharged accumulators. In this
situation, the supplier company of backup power supply system made a decision on
modernization (increasing its maximum capacity/load) of charging device and inclusion of the
whole line of protective and blocking devices to its composition, which in future, during
force-major circumstances, would not bring to malfunctioning of the system’s separate
component parts (abstract from the monitoring report of the national consultant Ms. E.
Bikeyeva).

1.4) Power really consumed for RHC emergency equipment during power cuts off:
During the feasibility study, 5 medical equipment were considered with a priority 1 and were
supposed to consume 2kWh/day + 1.5/4 kWh/day for the refrigerator. During the installation,
only diagnostic equipment has been connected to a specific grid (connected to PV system or
UPS) and it seems that electricity consumption was over dimensioned:

- Equipment for analysis: average consumption is from 100 to 300 Wh/working day, except

in Juzim-Bog clinic (500 to 700 Wh/working day).

- EKG: average consumption is from 10 to 20 Wh/working day.
- Physiotherapy equipment: average consumption is from 100 to 400 Wh/working day.

So, for this priority equipment, the average consumption was from 350 to 800 Wh/working
day. There is not a big difference in energy consumption for conducting analysis and
diagnostic equipment in 4 pilot RHCs.
Adding a minimum energy consumption for lighting in the medical care services rooms (5
PSL, 20W used during 4 hours represent 400Wh/working day) will provide us approximate
need in energy from 500 to 1000 Wh /working day, depending on the season.

1.5) Temperature regime in equipment storage rooms
Data analysis on temperature regime in equipment storage rooms shows that temperature was
acceptable during winter, from 6°C to 20°C in Baymukhamedov and Umarov pilot clinics.
No data for Juzim-Bog RHC.
Negative temperature in the batteries storage room is dangerous for storage and capacities of
accumulator batteries (risk of freezing of electrolyte and destruction of batteries).
For Djeykhanabad RHC, the lowest temperature registered in the rooms of the clinic was
+8°C on the 10th of January and remained cold (12°C to 15°C) during the other days. Due to
the risk of freezing of diesel fuel in diesel generator storage room, the place of the generator
has been changed. There is a risk of freezing cooling liquid in the cooling system of diesel
generator.
No real problem occurred during the other seasons.

1.6) Analysis of operation of diesel generator in Djeykhanabad:
During the winter period, the diesel generator worked during 19 hours, which represent
consumption of 35 litres of diesel fuel. The generator automatically switches on when when
the power is cut off from the grid. Considering the cost of this consumption, the chief of the
clinic decided to limit the working time of the generator, so the clinic used it only when there
was a real need for this and the fuel consumption decreased and was limited to 1 hour 50
minutes in summer, and fuel consumed equalled to 5,5 litres. It seems that there is no

agreement with the hospital in order to provide power to it during power cuts off. So this
installation is also over dimensioned.

*** Additionally, as a recommendation, there is a necessity of having mobile electric generator with capacity of 1-2 kWt (on petrol or diesel fuel) for a group of
relatively closely located RHCs (price of the equipment is from 300– 500 Thousand Soums in prices of June 2009, Chinese production). This solution will
maximally utilize the resource of accumulator batteries and improve reliability of medical treatment process, which depends on equipment operation.

of the project national consultants Mr. A. Shaislamov and Ms. E. Bikeyeva).

2.1) Gas supply analysis: cuts off and low gas pressure; Coal supply

It appears from monitoring, that there was no real problem during this winter, may be due to
the “warm” winter. There were just some problems in Juzim-Bog clinic in April which was
quite after the heating season.

Gas supply has been stable and satisfactory during the monitoring period in Baymukhamedov
(only one day gas cut off registered in December) and Umarov RHCs.

The situation was also stable during winter and March month in Juzim-Bog RHC, but there
were a lot of problems in April and May: in April 2009, full gas cuts off were observed during
8 days and sudden gas pressure drops occurred during other 12 days. In May 2009, full gas
cuts off have been observed during 13 days, and sudden gas pressure drops occurred during
other 11 days. The stable gas supply was observed in May of 2009 during only 6 days! One
can make conclusion from this, that the gas supply in Juzim-Bog RHC during spring season
was extremely unstable and unsatisfactory.

Djeykhanabad clinic has two coal boilers. One can make conclusion from primary resource
materials presented that, coal supplies in winter until March was stable and in sufficient
quantity and interruptions with coal supply were not observed. On the contrary, the quality of
coal was not good so the efficiency of coal boilers was limited and even with high coal
consumption the temperature in the clinic’s rooms was quite low: 15°C. 31st of March was
the last day of heating season and operation of heating system. Provision of the clinic with
coal, other materials as well as payment of salary to a ‘boiler man’ was stopped till the
beginning of the next heating season.

2.2 ) Consumption of natural gas and coal by pilot RHCs:
The outside temperature was clement during this winter, so the consumption registered does
not reflect the needs during a standard winter.
On the other hand, there is a problem of reliability of measures. How can we explain the
difference of consumption during winter between Baymukhamedov RHC (3,670m3) with
huge insulation and Umarov RHC (2,200m3) without a lot of saving measures? The outside
temperature registered seems either not coherent due to close location of these two clinics.
There might be some problems with reliability and registration of measures, because average
daily consumption is quite the same: 32.6m3 and 32.3m3 accordingly.
Daily dispersal of gas consumption is also surprising: from 7 to 152 in Baymukhamedov
RHC, 4 to 100 in Umarov clinic, but limited from 45 to 100 in Juzim-Bog clinic during the
same climatic period!
Consumption of natural gas must be confirmed through the gas invoices.
For Juzim-Bog RHC, total consumption during three winter months was 5,225m3, which
corresponds to an average daily consumption of 58m3. Such consumption seems important
with regards to two previous ones, but the chief of the clinic told us that the gas consumption
decreased for 50% due to the new gas boiler! Such information must be confirmed through
gas payment invoices, but it shows that a simple replacement of a boiler with manual gas
pressure regulation allows a large gas saving: about 4,000m3 for Juzim-Bog RHC, which
represents 250,000 Soums (170US$).

For Djeykhanabad RHC, total consumption of coal during winter was 10.5 tons with an
average daily consumption of 120 kg. For the heating season, total consumption of coal is
estimated to 18 tons for a total cost of about 450,000 Soums.

2.3 ) Energy saving potential:
Considering the results in Baymukhamedov and Juzim-Bog clinics, the following parameters
can be accepted as preliminary analysis and for replication:
•

average annual consumption of natural gas makes up approximately approximately
2,000 to 5,000 m3 after replacement of gas burners or boilers;
energetic efficiency of local boilers makes up 60-70% (20 to 30% energy saving);
energy saving potential from automatic or manual gas pressure regulators can be
estimated from 20 to 25%, especially during nights and non working days.
economy through the ceiling, walls and windows insulation makes up 20-30%.

•
•

•

The comparative analysis prepared by Elvira Bikeyeva shows, that the pay-back period due to
gas saving is less than 1 year for automatic gas pressure regulators, 7.1 year for thermal
insulation and 9.9 year for new efficient boilers. It seems possible to reduce this last pay back
period (from 5 to 6 years) for gas boilers by replacing only one boiler instead of two, like we
have done, installing a new efficient boiler with a larger capacity 40 kW instead of 23 kW.

2.4 ) Water (hot and cold) consumption and assessment of temperature:
Cold water was a problem in Baymukhamedov and Umarov clinics where they have to store
water in a small tank. The installation of tanks inside the boiler room prevented from freezing
and is convenient. Staff has been used to save water, so they consume low quantity of cold
(from 10 to 30 liters per day) and hot water. In Juzim-Bog RHC, which is connected to the
water grid, they also have a low daily consumption of 100 liters per day. Djeykhanabad clinic,
which is supplied by water from a mountain source, uses more, not only for medical purposes
but also for gardening!

Hot water consumption is in the same range and clearly limited, solar collectors have been
over dimensioned and are not very useful. I will not recommend their installation for
dissemination. Indeed, consumption of hot water was in the range of 10 litres per day, except
in Djeykhanabad clinic, where it uses 100 litres per day from the solar collector.
So, for dissemination and depending on the source of cold water, it could be possible to get
hot water from electrical heaters with a capacity from 10 to 50 litres.

Main conclusions from monitoring:

The real period for monitoring was less than one year, from 1st November 2008 until end of
September 2009. During this period some information is missing, some data are not coherent,
some meters were not reliable or not at the best place (such as temperature of hot water in
Baymukhamedov); some figures given by RHCs’ staff were wrong; some tables prepared by
NCs must be confirmed. Monitoring during another winter would be useful due to previous
warm winter as well.
The average duration of power cuts off can be considered as 4 hours per day especially in
winter, except in Karakalpakstan, where it happens more frequently in spring.
The problem of quality of power was not considered during this monitoring phase, but it
could be necessary to check on voltage and frequency of power? What is the real role of
stabilisers installed concerning quality of analysis and getting results from medical
equipment?
Power consumed by priority medical equipment during power cuts off has been
overestimated and it can be provided easily by the 3 systems tested, with exception for UPS,
if the duration of power cuts off is more than 2 or 3 days.
Energy saving especially from lighting is preliminary to other action concerning power.

The relative softness of the last winter may explain small number of gas failures. Reliability
of data collection from gas meters has also disturbed monitoring and comparison between
RHCs consumption. Gas boilers and burners replacement have shown their efficiency with
a capacity to work with lower pressure of gas than previous one.
Another source of energy saving is installation of regulators with a pay back period lower
than one year. Insulation of buildings especially ceilings has to be realized when RHCs are
refurbished, for the other one, the first and simple action is to ensure air tightness from
windows through injection of silicon or equivalent in the interstice between walls and
windows frame.

Monitoring has confirmed low consumption of water (cold or hot), except in Djeykhanabad
clinic, where it is “free” (mountainous water). Installation of solar water heaters is over
dimensioned and not really useful.

2- RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE RELIABILITY OF POWER AND HEAT
SUPPLY

2.1)

Power reliability and supply

Monitoring shows that there were a great number of power cuts off whatever was the RHC,
from this information we must identify a solution, which can provide electricity for
priority medical equipment during 4 hours in winter.
Such solution is consistent with UPS or Photovoltaic (PV) systems, but UPS has shown its
limits during a long period of power cuts off. So if costs (investment and operating costs) are
not so different, I recommend installing PV system with a low capacity (500W would be
convenient with electricity consumption of priority medical equipment and security lighting).
Considering the investment cost of such system: approximately 7,500US$ including
installation and training, it is obvious that such equipment cannot be installed in every RHC.
So I recommend selecting some of them (one out of ten or more depending on the density of
RHCs and population, giving priority to those which have to be refurbished) and install PV
system during Health-3 project within 100 RHCs or more. The experience
in
Baymukhamedov RHC has shown that population accept to go in a more removed RHC for
diagnostic and analysis if emergency during power cuts off.
For specific RHCs, located close to a rural hospital like in Djeykhanabad clinic, I recommend
a diesel generator, cost of which will depend on the size of the hospital: investment costs
about 8,000 to 10,000US$ + operating costs, diesel fuel (2 litres/hour) and spare parts, such as
filters. But operating and maintenance (O&M) may be a problem for small RHCs; so we do
not recommend a diesel or petrol generator for each RHC, especially in remote areas; another
solution is proposed where no regular power infrastructure is reliable.
Considering petrol or diesel generator, operating and maintenance seems difficult for staff of
RHCs, we (a national consultant confirmed by myself) recommend to each MoH District to
buy mobile (portable) generators operated by qualified personal that could be installed
for few days in RHCs, where power cuts off duration is more than 2 or 3 days. Every district
could buy 2 or 3 generators (investment cost: 200 to 350 US$ per generator) and assumed a
qualified service to RHCs which will request for. In order to assume transportation, operating
(mainly fuel) and replacement of spare parts, every RHC requesting for such service will have
to pay a lump sum per day or per working hour (2 to 5 US$ per working hour).

2.2)

Optimization of power consumption

The average consumption varies from 3 to 7 kWh per day depending on RHC, with an
important dispersion during day and night times, of which lighting represents more than
one/third in winter period. Even it does not represent a huge consumption for the whole year,
lighting is necessary and not efficient especially in winter, so I recommend replacement of
incandescent bulbs with low consumption bulbs. Depending on the number of lamps (from 15
to 25 per RHC) investment cost will be from 100 to 200 US$ for each RHC and a pay back
period of approximately 5 years, to be compared to a lifetime of more than 10 years.
A first action to be recommended is to save energy through replacement of incandescent
lamps with energy saving bulbs (energy saving potential estimated to 800 to 1000kWh per
year for each RHC).

Second action could be changing some practice of RHCs’ staff in order to optimize the usage
of power especially for energy consuming equipment (autoclaves, etc). Example: using
centrifuge device after grouping several analysis instead of using it for each analysis.

If it is confirmed that power cuts off are less frequent during nights than during day time
(except in Djeykhanabad RHC), it could be possible to organize/programme the usage of
autoclave and other energy consuming equipment during nights. The cost of a programmed
plug is 3 US$ and 2 or 3 for each RHC seems enough, so the investment cost could be less
than 10 US$ per RHC.

For sterilization, it is possible to save energy by using a solar parabolic concentrator, which
can provide 600°C or more, which is sufficient for destruction of bacterium. I recommend
testing such solution, which will represent cost of raw material (including large parabolic TV
receiver), realization and implementation in Uzbekistan. Estimated cost: 300 to 500 US$.

For priority medical equipment, daily dispersal of power consumption is limited: from 200
to 700 Wh per day. Indeed, priority medical equipment has been optimized and each RHC
team has just to optimize the usage of them, especially during cuts off period in order to limit
power consumption. These figures have been confirmed during 4 seasons, so we may agree
with an average daily consumption of 500 Wh, which can easily be assumed by 3 new
systems tested during this demonstration phase.

Concerning refrigerators, it seems that replacement is not necessary, indeed their efficiency
is good enough and their inertial capacity is consistent with the average duration of power
cuts off (except during long period of power cuts off as it happened in Umarov RHC in June).

2.3)

Heating supply

Analysis of existing data showed that the gas supply in Baymukhamedov and Umarov RHCs
was stable and satisfactory during past winter (2008-2009). Was it due to a “warm” winter?
Only few low gas pressure cases with limited impact due to installation of new diffusion
burners.
In Juzim-Bog RHC, gas cuts off were more frequent, extremely unstable and unsatisfactory,
mainly in November and during the spring period, when the heating season was over. From
this fact, it can be proposed to add a liquid fuel burner which can replace gas burner,
when gas cuts off occur during the heating season. This recommendation concern
Karakalpakstan Republic and Province(s), where power cuts off are more frequent.

For Djeykhanabad RHC, 2 coal boilers were not working efficiently due to the low calorific
value/quality of coal. The hospital located next to the RHC has installed a locally made
“rustic/robust” coal boiler, which seems more efficient and cheaper. There was another
problem due to the heating network, so we cannot recommend replicating identical solution
where there is no gas. Appropriate solution must be identified considering specific conditions.

Experiences during this demonstration phase show that if the main event is gas pressure
decrease, it is possible to reduce the impact by replacing injection gas burners (already
installed in heating boilers in RHCs) with diffusion gas burners.
“Indeed, two types of gas burners – diffusion and injection ones - are used for heating boilers.
In diffusion burners, clean gas comes out from nozzles of burners and air-gas mixture is
formed in the boiler’s furnace, which is then burned out. So the lowest limits of gas pressure
by which diffusion burners may work sustainably makes up 50-80 Pa.
In injection burners, due to discharge created by gas, the discharge is formed in the burner,
which contributes to injecting of the air into mixing cell of the burner. Thus, the air-gas
mixture, ready for burning, comes out from nozzles of burners. The lowest limits of gas
pressure, by which injection burners may work, should sustainably make up more than 150

Pa. Higher values of the lowest limit of gas pressure for injection burners are related to their
operation principle, that air-gas mixture ready is formed inside the burner that is ready for
burning. And by very low gas pressures, there might be effect of skip of fire inside the burner,
which may bring to emergency situation” (Source report of NC Mr. A. Shaislamov).
Considering the information collected to date, it seems necessary to provide each RHC with a
new diffusion and efficient gas burner(s), especially while refurbishing the RHCs, connected
to gas network.
For other RHCs, not connected to gas supply network, installation of coal boilers is
recommended taking into account the quality of coal, in order to optimize the consumption in
the boiler.

2.4)

Heating demand management

In order to reduce gas consumption and expenses, first action recommended is to install
thermal regulation and programming, where it is possible. During the demonstration phase
the regulation was manual, added to the change of burners, gas saving represents
approximately 50% of past consumption! Investment cost for regulation is limited - from 50
to 100 US$ - so the payback period is less than 1 year.
In order to increase the inertial capacity of the RHC building and reduce the speed of
decreasing inside temperature during gas cuts off or low pressure, it has been tested insulation
of building in Baymukhamedov RHC. Insulation of ceiling, replacement of windows and
doors, installation of a “tambour” entrance door unit, is quite expensive, and the pay back
period is about 7 to 9 years. To date, several RHCs are using plastic sheets for reducing heat
losses and air leakage from the RHC.
The first and simple action recommended is to ensure air tightness of windows through
injection of silicon or equivalent in the interstice between walls and windows frame. For
refurbishment, it is recommended to replace all windows and doors with efficient double
glazing units. Specific attention must be given to the gynaecologist room where it is
recommended to keep a temperature of 20°C.

Considering the large number of RHCs all around the country, it could be useful to train at the
national level, the persons in charge of RHC maintenance, so that they can prepare/estimate
thermal diagnosis of RHC when they are on site, and determine priority actions concerning
insulation of the building, especially before refurbishment.

2.5)

Cold and hot water supply and demand management

Consumption of cold water was very low during 10 months of monitoring period, so it does
not seem necessary to organize a specific management for cold water; RHCs staff is aware of
this. The installation of a new tank inside the building (like in Umarov RHC) is just necessary
in order to avoid freezing during winter period.

Hot water consumption is limited and do not need a specific solution. Usage of hot water is
limited to washing hands and boiling a water of tea (clinics use gas cooker for this purpose).
Solar collectors tested in Baymukhamedov, Juzim-Bog or Djeykhanabad RHCs were over
dimensioned.
Small electrical water heaters could be envisaged if it is possible to find from 10 to 50 litres
capacity on Uzbek market. Estimated cost is from 100 to 150 US$, including installation on
hot water network.

3- COMPLEMENTARY COMMENTS.

Before further dissemination and replication of selected solutions, it seems possible to get more
information and testing new technical solutions prior implementation of “Health-3” Project.
Such extension is detailed within conclusions. So there is no chapter dedicated to
dissemination and replication in other Rural Health Clinics.

As requested in the terms of reference, a lot of reports have been prepared by National
Consultants and especially the last report from national expert on energy economics Mrs E.
Bikeyeva. Refer to her last report for:

•

•

•

•

Report on assessment the technical solution implemented and justifications on their
financial viability prepared;

Report on assessment the financial benefits received as a result of reduction in fuel and
natural gas consumption prepared;

Report on options how potential benefits can be reinvested into sustainable operations of
the innovative energy equipment in rural clinics prepared;

Report on justification why and how the implemented technical solutions meet the
demands of rural clinics in uninterrupted and reliable supply of energy, based on the
monitoring program results prepared;

Some personal complements and comments are added here:

3.1)Comments on potential for CO2 emission reduction due to introduction of EE and RE equipment in
rural health clinics and potential of CO2 emission reduction after dissemination in other rural health
clinics (3,000) located over the country developed;

Considering CO2 emission factors used for the feasibility study, and results from monitoring,
the main potential for CO2 emission reduction comes from energy saving for heating
(estimated potential 4,000m3 of gas per year = 45,000 kWh per year), and next one comes
from substitution with photovoltaic system to generate electricity (600 kWh per year) and
power saving using low consumption bulbs (900 kWh saved per year).

So the potential for CO2 emission reduction for one RHC can be estimated as shown below:

Table 3. Annual potential of CO2 emissions reduction in rural health clinics of type 2

1 New burners and regulation
2 Using PV systems
3 Lighting with PSL

16 300

If all RHCs are refurbished or equipped with new burners, PV systems and low consumption
lamps, the total potential of CO2 emission reduction can be estimated to 50 000 tons.

3.2) Socio – economic consequences of realization and dissemination of demonstration
projects
The project success criteria are reduction of medical risks and improvement of quality of
medical care services. Other factors are also not negligible such as:
-

Influence for employment of population;

- Expansion of human services (non-manufacturing business), small business and
development of social-production infrastructure. (For more details please refer to the
report of Mrs. Bikeyeva.)

-Employment:

With an average of 15 persons working in each RHC, this means that to date, about 50 000
persons are working in RHCs all over Uzbekistan. The reliability of medical equipment is
supposed to increase the number of patients in each of them and probably the creation of 1 or
2 job places in each RHC, which represent a potential of 6 000 working places mainly for
women (about 90% of RHCs working staff).

-Development of small business:

Dissemination of demonstration projects will make positive influence not only for
development of industrial potential of local producers of equipment at the national level, but
also development of small business in the country. Introduction of energy saving technologies
and devices on improvement of energy and heat supply reliability will inspire additional
impulse for development of this branch not only in the Health sector.

-Gender aspects:

An important part of RHCs’ activities are dedicated to women and children (gynecology and
pediatrics). So RHCs are influencing improvement of health of women and children.
Provision of uninterrupted work of medical equipment and a whole system of energy and
heating supply of rural health clinics comes forth as one of the main factors of improvement
of quality of rendered medical services, restraining a tendency of worsening of woman’s
health, cutting down the cases of maternal and infantile mortality, and as a result, reduction of
regional differentiation by health status indicators. The proximity of RHCs is also important
for girls’ health (cases of anemia, absence of knowledge on contraception, low level of
warning medical services or abortion). Improving the reliability of RHCs will also improve
women and girls’ health.

CONCLUSIONS

Alternative power supply during cuts off:
Optimal solution to provide 500 Wh per day seems to be PV system (with capacity of 500W),
but as such system represent an important investment cost, it is recommended to install only
one out of 10 or more RHCs.
To complete such solution and provide an alternative to other RHCs during long duration
(lengthy) power cuts off, it is proposed to incite each district to buy and put mobile generators
at disposal of requesting RHCs.
For specific RHCs, not connected to the power grid, PV systems seem more appropriate (with
capacity of 1000 to 2000W) associated to energy management and saving in the RHCs,
especially during winter period and lighting demand.

Power consumption, demand side management:

Considering the demand side, the main action has to be undertaken concerning lighting:
replacement of incandescent bulbs with low consumption energy efficient lamps.

Changing practice using energy consuming equipment may be another good opportunity for
energy saving. Usage of parabolic solar heater for sterilization could also be tested.

Heating supply and saving:

Several solutions have been recommended depending on availability and reliability of gas
supply: new efficient gas burners with regulation, liquid fuel burners adapted for replacement
of gas burners, coal boilers.

On the demand side, priority must be given to thermal regulation and programming in order to
reduce the inside temperature (and heat losses) during nights and non-working days. Thermal
regulation and programming can be replicated in a large number of RHC for an investment
cost less than 100 US$ and a payback period of one year.

Another energy saving potential is reduction of air leakage through windows, insulation of
RHCs buildings and pipes, checking efficiency, controlling and regulating the temperature
inside the buildings. Insulation can be envisaged for ceiling/roofs and/or windows (double
glazing units), depending on the quality of existing materials. Training local staff in charge of
RHCs maintenance on thermal diagnosis could be the first step in order to identify priorities.

Global conclusion and recommendation concerning future and project extension

In order to confirm which equipment may be replicated in RHCs by “Health 3” Project, I
recommend taking advantage of delay to extend the demonstration phase in 2010 with a
limited number of actions, which may confirm results of this first phase:

The monitoring period last only 10 months, due to “warm” winter and lack of reliability of
in 4 pilot RHCs (comparison of results between Umarov and
some measures
Baymukhamedov RHCs is not available due to wrong timing in data collection by local staff),
it could be a good opportunity to extend the monitoring during next winter in order to get
information during at least 12 months and 2 winter seasons.

Some solutions tested during this demonstration phase do not convince with their
effectiveness (solar collectors, PV systems, diesel generator are over dimensioned; UPS was

not adapted to long cuts off periods), so it could be useful to test new solutions in one or two
RHC(s) close to Tashkent (as Baymukhamedov and Umarov clinics):

- Small PV system (500W) used in winter, during power cuts off and rest of the year for

priority medical equipment and lighting. Measurement of power saving.

- Petrol or diesel generator at disposal of RHCs during long period of power cuts off under
responsibility of MoH Tashkent District. Test of feasibility and estimation of operating
costs.

- Replacement of incandescent lamps with energy saving lamps and measurement of

effective saving.

- Change of practice for management of energy consuming equipment, just training costs.

- Conception and testing a parabolic solar heater to reach 600°C for sterilization.

- Replacement of injection burners with diffusion burners: Confirmation of their utility

even with gas low pressure.

- Buying a liquid fuel burner appropriate to replace gas burner during gas cuts off.

-

Installation of thermal regulation manually managed and measurement of energy saving.

- Test of silicon (or equivalent) injection in the interstice between walls and windows

frame and between windows sides for all windows of the selected RHCs.

-

Installation of small electrical water heater (20 litres) if RHC is connected to water
network.

Rough estimation budget for this extension:

- Referring to the synthesis table, investment cost and installation may represent: 10,000

US$

(7,500 +300 +150 +400 +400 +250 +50 +50 +100 = 9,200$) + unexpected costs 800$.

-
- Procurement fees and installation to be checked by national consultants.

- Monitoring extension (using previous meters and loggers) data collection and analysis by

national consultants;

- Training and checking RHC staff by national consultants and Chief of maintenance

department in the Coordinating Unit of MoH.

Fees for Project Manager, National Consultants and International Consultant have to be added
to investment cost:

- 6 months extension for Project Manager:

- 3x10 weeks for National Consultants:

= 6,500 US$

= 7,500 US$

- 2 weeks for International Consultant + travel and per diem: 6,000+2,000$ = 8,000 US$

So, rough estimation budget for 6 months extension is 10,000 + 22,000 + travel /facilities
4,000 + miscellaneous and unexpected costs (6%) 2,000 = 38,000$.

BACKGROUND/OVERVIEW:

Project of Government of Uzbekistan “Piloting Energy
Efficient and Renewable Energy Solutions” supported by
UNDP
International Consultant/Expert on Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy Systems
Supervising and overseeing the piloting the Energy Efficient
and Renewable Energy Solutions in four rural health clinics,
monitoring of the their operation, and development of a Final
Report included recommendations on dissemination and
replication of the optimal solutions in other rural health
clinics or hospitals in Uzbekistan
Tashkent, Uzbekistan
17 calendar months (01.02.2008 – 30.06.2009-approx.), 30
working days
SSA (full time for 30 w/d)

At present, large-scale reforms are being executed in the public health sector of Uzbekistan.
Establishment and development of the rural health clinics (primary health care) is the priority of the
national policy.

The rural health clinics need reliable and uninterrupted supply of power and heat to provide up-to-
standard medical services. Improving power and heat supply appears to be a key for Rural Health
Clinics (RHC) being operational during working hours.

Within the framework of the UNDP’s “Improving Power and Heat Supply Reliability in Health Rural
Clinics of Uzbekistan” Project (2007), technical and economic assessment of options in order to equip
the rural health clinics with Energy Efficient (EE) and Renewable Energy (RE) systems, notably the
plants that transfer solar energy to electric and thermal power that can be integrated into existing
conventional energy infrastructure to improve reliability of power and heat supply has been
implemented.

The options proposed have been adjusted to the relevant budget resources available in rural health
clinics and to the budget for medical equipment. They have to ensure efficient use and saving of
energy and fuel, to be coherent with budget available and to be replicable at a large scale.

The UNDP Project “Piloting Energy Efficient and Renewable Energy Solutions in Rural Health
Clinics of Uzbekistan” will test and demonstrate the EE and RE solutions proposed four representative
rural health clinics (UMAROV, BAYMUKHAMEDOV, DJEYKHANABAD, and JUZIM-BOG) and
will prove their feasibility and viability with a sound justification to replicate these optimal solutions
at a large scale in rural health clinics in different provinces of the country within the WB Health-2
project.

OUTCOME OF THE ASSIGNMENT

The end result of assignment will be a Final Report on piloting the Energy Efficient and Renewable
Energy Solutions in four rural health clinics that will include

• Testing and demonstration of Energy Efficient and Renewable Energy technological

options selected for each of four rural health clinics;

• Monitoring of pilots in four rural health clinics covering all seasons.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
for realization of the Demonstration Project “Piloting Energy Efficient
and Renewable Energy Solutions in Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) of Uzbekistan”.

Situation Analysis
1) Priority medical equipment and devices for rendering emergency medical care (such
as EKG, laboratory analysis) do not work during the power supply cuts off from the
power network

2) Power cuts off bring to spoilage of medical reagents (for example, general blood test
etc.), as a result of frequent power supply cuts off, storage of analysis in required
conditions (for instance, in refrigerators at corresponding temperature) is not ensured,
which may bring to mistaken diagnosis and as a result of this – an incorrect treatment
of patients;

3) Sterilizing devices do not work during power supply cuts off, which may bring to
infection of medical instruments and materials; some medicines and vaccine are also
kept in refrigerators, power supply cuts off also bring to loss of their quality because
of not provision of proper conditions, which decreases/excludes their medical
effectiveness.

4) Some medicines and vaccine are kept in refrigerators, power supply cuts off lead to
their worthlessness because of not provision of proper conditions, which results in
material losses, spent for their procurement, or additional costs occur for procurement
of new medicines instead of worthless ones.

5) Some of the technical solutions and equipment on renewable energy (for example,
solar photovoltaic systems) for improvement of reliability of power supply of RHCs
are currently expensive (with long pay-back period) because of unequal tariffs for
energy carriers (subsidized or noticeably smaller compared to the world prices for an
energy)

6) Use of energy efficient, energy saving and renewable energy equipment of foreign
production poses certain problems with after-sale warranty service, supply of spare
parts, and at the same time, existing local production sometimes loses foreign models
in quality and design of the equipment, although the equipment of local production is
better adapted to local conditions and peculiarities (quality of power, water, gas
supply, qualification level of personnel/workers)

7) Actual consumption of power and heating energy in RHC exceeds national and world
standards, necessary heating and hot water supply is not provided, heavy heat losses
from RHC building are still there, inefficient energy consumption leads to overcharge
of natural gas, which negatively effects the environment and makes its contribution to
the climate change.

2.3 Heating system

Energy production:

Heating system:

Automatic control:

The sources of energy supply are two self-made boilers installed in
a separate room. The boilers work by nonvolatile scheme. Heat
supply of the building is carried out without taking into account the
operating running regime of the building. At night hours, as well as
weekends and holidays, the automatic regulation of heat supply is
absent.
Heating system – well-type (single-pipeline) radiator
type,
basement distribution. In boiler room the pipelines of heating
system do not have thermal isolation. There is no leaking in the
system, but, as expected, system is not balanced.
Automatic control system and heating control system is absent

2.4 Hot water supply system (HWSS).

Thermal
production/output:

power

water

Hot
system:

supply

Automatic control:

The source of hot water supply is one self-made hot-water boiler
tank located in the boiler room. Hot-water boiler was switched off
during the monitoring because of low gas pressure.
HWSS – well-type (single-pipeline), blind (dead-end type) Dу=20
mm. Number of draw-off points – 7. HWSS pipelines in boiler
room do not have thermal isolation. There is no leaking in the
system.
Automatic control system and heating control system is absent.

3. Power consumption

The region of the RHC location is gasified, however during the heating season/period
the gas supply is extremely unstable. During the heating season of 2007-2008, because of low
gas pressure, the power supply was maintained with the help of firewood (since the boilers
design/construction allows burning firewood). During the energy research period and further
monitoring process, the water temperature in feeding line of heating system was approx. 40
0С, because of low gas pressure.
