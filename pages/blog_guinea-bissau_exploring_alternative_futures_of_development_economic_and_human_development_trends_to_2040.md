GUINEA-BISSAU: Exploring Alternative Futures of Development Economic and Human Development Trends to 2040
MARCH 21, 2022
The report provides an integral overview of the national development trends and prospects. It focuses on a base case scenario to project the ongoing economic and human development trends. It provides a mixed outcome on the projected economic and human development progress in the next 20 years by simulating how different economic growth trajectories can help promote SDG achievements across development sectors. The aim is to prioritize decisions on the multi-dimensional development challenges and understand the interconnectedness between development goals and the acceleration of human development. In addition, understanding current trends will provide a background against which to assess the effectiveness of green growth and alternative development paths in future reports.
