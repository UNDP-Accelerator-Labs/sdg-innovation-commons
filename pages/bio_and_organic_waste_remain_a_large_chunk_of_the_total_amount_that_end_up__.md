## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Bio and organic waste remain a large chunk of the total amount that end up in the landfills with proven economic benefit in several areas   2. The transformative power of bio-waste in North Macedonia has not been explored in depth by the business community, the civil society sector nor the national institutions.  3. We have tested the nexus between the academic community and their hypothesis with the feasibility of their claims on the market.  4. Designing the ecosystem around the circularity of the bio-waste would require activation of multiple options such as the systems around waste generation and waste collection, but also provide opportunities to explore on new and innovative products and services in the market   5. Bio-hacking movement would be able to provide space for education as well as generating startups with employment of highly skilled profiles.

North Macedonia's Accelerator Lab team, as part of the City Experiment Fund (CEF), embarked on a journey to create a dynamic learning portfolio that will address some of the burning issues facing the capital city of Skopje. This blog series documents  our journey to understand how circularity and zero-waste can be achieved in the City of Skopje https://www.mk.undp.org/content/north-macedonia/en/home/blog/Working-with-complex-systems.html https://www.mk.undp.org/content/north-macedonia/en/home/blog/Rethinking-Biowaste.html

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

There were no major barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system. One bottleneck that impacted the system was that there is no communication between different sectors that are working with bio-waste such as the academy, industry, Civil society organization.   On the other hand, we were pleasantly surprised that all actors were more than happy to share their thoughts and visions in the deep listening process that we initiated at the beginning of the process. The Transcript that is shared as part of this feedback loop should be considered as classified but is a valuable resource in creating micro-narratives that can be used not only in this portfolio but in other portfolios in our CO.  A conclusion can be made that UNDP can also serve as the glue in such a situation to get all the different actors involved for the greater good.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

At the beginning of the process, we used deep listening methodology to understand the complexity of the system, in our case the city of Skopje, and try to understand how different parts of the system interact with each other. A report of the deep listening process is attached. The report is confidential and not to be shared. The deep listening process was useful for the System thinking and strategic innovation processes  that help us see the whole (holistic approach) and not simply the parts of the system and to better understand and recognize the roles of culture, identity and behaviors and integrate them better in portfolio design. We used portfolio approach methodology to better intervene with the system and we created and implemented 7 intervention by using a set of interconnected probes, which are coherent with the overall direction (no biowaste in the landfills).  

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We used portfolios and system thinking to simultaneously address different leverage points in the system. One of our frontier Challenges focuses on the sluggish economy which is hard to be accelerate if there is no ecosystem in place to support any intervention we are planning to make to create new and better paid jobs.  Portfolios helped us produce that ‘learning’ what ecosystem is most viable to be unpack and by continuous monitoring (deep listening) we learn about the impact that our interventions will have in the system. This made us adapt to the interventions based on this information. For example, at the beginning of the deep listening process we focused on 4 thematic areas, where we wanted to create interventions, around transportation, waste, Roma integration and tourism and ended up with biowaste as a key actor in city level transformation interventions and biohackers as a job position that can create high paid jobs for youth people.  
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We worked with multiple civil society organizations who were engaged in data collection as well as knowledge generation for our portfolio. In the portfolio design we used the example of Go Green and Redi Recycle model for plastic waste transformation, the solution is mapped in details on the solution mapping platform, as a starting point for creating one intervention in a different area, in our case biowaste.    With one civil society organization ZMAI we created a feasibility study for the financial potential of transformed biowaste products, produced in the organic laboratory at the faculty of Technology and Metallurgy. Furthermore, we did a GAAP analysis of the biowaste ecosystem.  

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We used Academic research and knowledge generation for the products that can be developed from bio-waste. In the process of portfolio design on multiple sensemaking and co-design session we invited professors from Technology and Metallurgy, which is the place that should be leading bio-waste transformation in the country, to feed our portfolio with information. Two of the interventions were closely related to this Faculty and some of the prototypes of bio-waste products were created in the organic laboratory in the faculty that we supported with the intervention.  In addition we created the first waste valorization index that gave insides on how bio-waste can be valorized by the industry for commercialization. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In the deep listening process we had more than 12 meetings with various private sector contra parts that were working in the area of biowaste. Some of the findings was included in the portfolio design sessions and were more than useful for creating the interventions. We also mapped various private sector partners that can serve as the champions in the system. One private sector partner had shown interest in partnering with UNDP in order to co-design and co- develop program for a biohacking laboratory, which was another option and intervention that we made with this learning cycle.  

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

  No government partners were involved in the work. This was done due to the fact that local elections were scheduled to take place in October, and we had to  activate the portfolio by the end of August. As soon as the new Major is sworn in office we will share our learning with them and hopefully partner in some additional interventions.  

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

UNDP has long history in working with the private sector in a capability as tasks giver whereas for this project we acted more as an organization that is looking for partners in creating the portfolio. We acted more as a glue in the process than a donor. The "most special " partner with whom we are collaborating in establishing a biohacking lab, and who was pointed out by international consultants as a champion in the system who can lead the change that we want to make in the system, is a serial entrepreneur with numerous genetic laboratories who is interested in partnering with UNDP to open and lead a biohacking laboratory. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

After the conclusion of the project we concluded that opening a biohacking laboratory in the city of Skopje can be beneficial to the whole system. We had multiple discussion with other colleagues from various portfolios where we presented “pitched” the idea but some ideas need time and resources to come to a fruition. One such partner UNCEF saw the potential of the idea and together with them at the moment we are preparing the application for the Green Shark UNDP – UNICEF competition. We know that the competition is stiff but we have a winning proposal =) 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The first city Biowaste audit enabled us to collecting primary data on the production of bio-waste in the city of Skopje   The Mapping the bio-hacking movement in Europe and all EU related projects in the bio-waste area enabled us to know how the future would look like and what we should aim for.  The Deep listening enabled us to collect primary data on citizens’ perceptions of the core challenges of the city
