HOPEVINE HEALTH SHOP

> Brief description of the innovation

Hopevine Health Shop is a registered business name whose main objective is to provide alternative source of cheap and quality pharmaceutical products in the rural district of Mumbwa. Our services will be a source of hope to most people in a highly populated area  of Kamilambo as the distance to the nearest Chemist/drug store  is 30 kilometers away,at Mumbwa Boma.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income both for me and the employees through sales of the pharmaceutical and cosmetic products to the rural population of Mumbwa. Our innovation will assist in improving operations of existing business by providing curative drugs to the local population who will in turn maintain their health status thereby continuing to contribute to the overall national development as the population will be kept healthy.Our target market are the under priviledged rural population of mumbwa district. The value addition for our innovation is that we are climate friendly in that our business does not temper with the ecosystem in anyway.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is increasing access to quality and affordable Pharmaceutical products to the rural population of Mumbwa District in Kamilambo Village. At the moment,all the work has been completed and the Health Shop is fully furnished,legal compliance too has been attained and we are only remaining with stocking the Shop with Drugs,Cosmetics and other related medical and surgical supplies. The proposed implementation plan is that. Once I am considered for CAPITAL,I will immediately purchase drugs,medical and surgical supplies and cosmetics and stock the shop.Then engage a pharmacy technologist as sales personel. All this will depend on the funding,and if funded;all this will take place within a week of receiving the funds as only the capital is delaying the process.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation will have serious impact on the local population as the people in Kamilambo are now covering about 30km in order to find the nearest pharmacy/drug store. Therefore, with the opening of this new drug store, I sincerely feel that there will be a positive impact on the general health of women and children as there will be ready and cheap access to both over the counter and prescription medicines.
