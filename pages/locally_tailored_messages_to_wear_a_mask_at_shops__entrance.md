Formal messages from the Ministry of Healthcare do not really speak to the stakeholders. Unlike the shop assistants who know how to make their customers wear a mask with a local accent and debunking excuses from their customers.

"There is no way not to wear a mask in a shop. Even if its for a second, for a quick, a little bit or if you will just stand in the corner. There is no way at all!"

"We do not serve those without a mask.



The following arguments do not work
- I forgot it;
- I am just here for a second;
- Masks do not protect;
- I am an insider (I'm local and to be trusted);
- I'm not sick;


Do not pretend to be blind!!!
Keep your resentment to yourself!
Keep the distance and stay healthy!!!


Thank you for understanding!!!"
