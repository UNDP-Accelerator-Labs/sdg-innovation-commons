Standards Frameworks for digital transformation
DECEMBER 28, 2023
Standards play a crucial role in shaping the digital transformation process, as they provide a common framework for digital technology applications. They also complement regulations and laws, contributing to digital transformation governance. Adoption of standards fosters compatibility and interoperability among services, products, and processes, while guaranteeing minimum levels of quality and safety. Furthermore, standards can serve as accelerators of change as they promote innovation, and they can ensure the successful scaleup of digital solutions to confront common problems.
This knowledge product covers areas such as effective utilisation of information technologies, cybersecurity, data privacy protection, cloud computing, infrastructure, etc that can contribute to the digital transformation of the participating countries’ public sectors.
