Launched in 2021, the KRES Network, operational in Angola and Mozambique, is a collaborative initiative involving partners from the Netherlands and World Vision. Serving as a decentralized service provider, it has 250 smartphone users and 2,800 basic phone users.

The primary objective is to empower farmers through regenerative agriculture, utilizing digital advisory services and market linkages with voice bots, chatbots, and geodata/AI.

The network aims to create Rural Agri Entrepreneurs, acting as intermediaries, and employs innovative digital/e-learning tools, including chatbot-based drills, to enhance the capacity of remote Rural Agri Entrepreneurs. Smart advisory services leverage data-driven insights and technologies such as sensors, satellites, drones, big data analytics, and AI to provide tailored information on agro-climatic and crop-specific conditions.

KRES Network offers weather information and digital tools for climate-smart advice and pest and disease management accessible via mobile applications or USSD. Agri-record keeping tools, like the Plan &amp; Activity Tracker, help farmers view farming as a business, with an accountability tool for tracking expenses and revenues to demonstrate creditworthiness.

The network is developing Liquidity Financing solutions involving FADA, BNI, BDA (Angola), and HUB, Casa do Agricultor (Mozambique). KRES facilitates the sale of agricultural inputs and produce through a Smart Digital Agent approach, emphasizing a holistic approach rather than functioning as a marketplace. The inception of the KRES Network traces back to the Mavo Diami project in Angola.
