> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I will supply this Product in bulk to Agro dealers who are my primary target through out Zambia. The Agro dealers will retail the product to small scale farmers who are the end users. The small scale farmers will use the product and produce more food to sale through out the year to super markets and marketeers. This kind of value chain will enable me to generate income, the agro dealers will generate income, the farmers will generate income and the super markets and marketeers will generate income. The challenge prize will help me get more stock from my manufacturer in India and in turn increase revenue. The product is enviromentally friendly as it can be recycled after 6 years of use.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is designed to help small scale farmers irrigate their crops efficiently and effectively reducing energy and labor costs whilst increasing yields. A prototype exists and we have been selling the product for the past 2 years now.

> Anticipated Social Impact

I have marketed the innovation very well to small scale farmers and other stake holders. Agro dealers, small scale farmers and marketeers lives will be improved due to generation of more income. Agro dealers will have new product to sell to sell to farmers, small scale farmers production will be enhanced and they will be able to produce through out the year and super markets and marketeers will always have fresh produce to sell at all times through out the year. 

The Zambian agriculture sector is currently yearning for innovations in agriculture in order to produce more food for the country and the region. The current market has responded very well to the innovation.
