[[ai_summary:Jamila Mohammed, head of experimentation for the Accelerator Lab in Nigeria, is working to position innovation hubs and accelerators to support Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Nigeria. The country is far behind achieving its SDG targets, and Mohammed's team aims to involve entrepreneurs with the right capacities and platforms. They conducted a systems mapping exercise to identify gaps in development, particularly in the northern regions, where poverty and unemployment are prevalent.

# Accelerating Innovation Hubs in Nigeria: Jamila Mohammed's SDGs Acceleration Efforts

### [[0:00]] The battery, your name, your title and that you consent to this interview\.

My name is Jamila Mohammed, I'm head of experimentation, Nigeria\. I consent to this video recorded\.

### [[0:15]] Hi, could you tell me about a research and development activity you would like to share?

[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
OK, So the Accelerator Lab in Nigeria, we are working to position innovation hubs, accelerators and incubators for SD GS acceleration\. As you know, we are far behind in achieving the sustainable development goals\. And we thought it was about time we involved the entrepreneurs because over time it's been the public sector, it's been the non governmental organizations that are pushing the SD GS\. But now we think there's a place for entrepreneurs if they have the right capacities and the right platforms\.

### [[1:05]] How did this come about and where did you start from?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
OK, so we looked at the country and we looked at the development issues and the gaps\. We did a systems mapping where we found that there are gaps even within the regions in the country\. So for example, where you would have the South, highly intellectual, highly innovative, you find you find the North being behind\. And so the North was faced with a lot of development challenges, poverty, unemployment, not that the South doesn't face those issues, but just that it's more prevalent in the North\. And so we decided to concentrate on the innovation ecosystem in the northern part of the country\.

### [[2:02]] OK, so what was the development issue that you were addressing?

Oh, so it's unemployment, it's poverty\. Trying to see how we can get young people out of intergenerational poverty, trying to place young people in positions where they can actually be of benefit to themselves, to the society\. Give back in a way, trying to build the capacity of a generation of young people who don't have to sit and rely on government, but to go out there and be able to sustain themselves\.

### [[2:41]] So what did the situation look like?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
Oh, it was the situation was there\. It was bad in a way, because so the country churns out thousands of graduates yearly and this young people come up, no jobs, no businesses, nothing to do\. And so it was we were circling poverty\. Yes, it was a cyclical activity\. But then we, we noticed that we still had a young group of young people who were trying to push out of that, who were hustling hard, who were building this accelerators, who were coming up with new ideas, innovative ideas, But they lacked resources, they lacked platforms, they lacked partners\. And we thought this is the point of intervention\.

### [[3:36]] So who was involved in your journey and what was their role?

The innovation ecosystem, the players\. So there's no way as UNDP, we would claim to know the problems or the terrain more than the people who are in that space\. After all, the people closest to the problem almost always have the solutions, right? The answers to those problems\. So we went direct to them, to the young people, the ones in that space and try to map who's doing what's where, how, what are the challenges, what are the strengths and what are the opportunities\.

### [[4:13]] So what tools or methods did you use to do what you just described and why?

Oh yeah, first co\-creation\. We had to sit with the young people to create a plan because it cannot be just a UNDP initiative\. It had to be a partnership with them so they can own the process\. And then there's the mapping, because we need to know who's here, what's there\. We need to map the ecosystem, map the stakeholders\. We need to engage with the stakeholders right from the beginning just so that they're on board with the initiative\.

### [[4:48]] So what? What ethical considerations or principles of inclusivity, equity or sustainability guided your research and development approach?

So it's about gender, it's about people with disability, it's about people usually neglected people in rural communities\. So we made intentional efforts to reach out to the atypical people, people that are most often left out of projects like this\. So we got them involved right from the beginning\.

### [[5:20]] Great\. So what was the outcome of your research and development journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
So right now we have been able to co\-create a plan, a framework, a road map in a way for the strengthening of the ecosystem\. Because if we want to position them to be able to achieve what we want them to, we need to strengthen them before because we found that they needed that capacity\. So now we have a plan co\-created with them and they're leading in that process\. We've had stakeholder engagements, we've had capacity building for smaller innovators in the space\. And we're building, we're building, we're building a live map, which will continue to change as it evolves, trying to strengthen this ecosystem\.

### [[6:11]] So what would you do differently if you had to start again?

[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
I would say have some funds before I start engaging with young people because these are people who are trying hard to survive in a society that doesn't really offer them anything\. And so they're coming out with their ideas, they have prototypes, they have all this fantastic solutions\. And then you reach out to them as UNDP and they have this expectations\. But then our job is to manage their expectations because we're not there to as a donor\. We're there to build their capacity to, to strengthen their platforms, to provide them some technical expertise in how to position them to be able to address development challenges\.

### [[7:01]] Thank you so much\.

You're welcome\.

### [[7:05]] You could do that fast because you've already done\.
