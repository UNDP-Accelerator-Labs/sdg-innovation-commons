## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Establishing an open biohacking lab in North Macedonia that will contribute to bringing science closer to the community of entrepreneurs, and will enable the design of durable solutions for the complex environmental challenges of the society, with a special focus on biowaste transformation; 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our hypothesis is that starting such biohacking initiative and opening a biohacking lab will encourage a shift in narrative and act as a system transformation initiator that will inspire young people to shift their focus of interest to STEAM research and in near future create economic opportunities including start-ups, spin offs that will employ highly skilled labor, especially youth and high school students.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Biowaste in North Macedonia accounts for 45.6% of all waste produced in the country. Most of that waste, approximately 95% ends up in open landfills and dumpsites, emitting greenhouse gases, and contributing to a range of environmental challenges for our society. The system [educational, civic, business] has been sluggish to foster innovation in reusing and/or repurposing bio-waste. Public institutions have also done little to tap into the transformative potential of this type of waste. Entrepreneurs are yet to tap into the potential of biowaste while a significant reduction of the number of students enrolling in technical studies is an indication that youth does not recognize the business and career potential in working on this or related environmental solutions.

Waste in North Macedonia is a structural systemic challenge, and we recognize that there are no silver bullets for solving complex challenges, however by activating a portfolio of options to tackle these challenges we might enable systemic change. The citizen-driven bio-hacking movement, which aims to democratize science and make it more open to the public, is one of these options we trust will improve the situation in our country and will accelerate change. This movement, despite some stigma attached to it, is now being recognized as one of the solutions to some of society’s growing list of complex problems. The next generation of biohackers has set their sight on solving global problems. Some good examples are: tackling urban pollution by using homebrew biological systems, using bacteria to clean oceans, or transforming biowaste into viable products. The movement is spearheaded by the, so-called, Do It Yourself [DIY] laboratories[1]. Many of them are referred to as biohacking laboratories, where based on “de-skilling” approaches, participants are creating open-science innovations or for-profit startup businesses. “De-skilling” is primarily undertaken by individuals with extensive research training from academia or corporations, who then mentor and oversee other DIY biologists with little or no formal training. The biohacking laboratory is nothing different from “Lego” laboratory that has all the equipment needed for an amateur innovator. Under the eye of supervision of a professional technician, they can make for example synthesis of orange biowaste and transform that polymer into an essential oil that they can sell on the open market for profit or present it to an investor.

At the moment, North Macedonia does not have a biohacking space where innovators, entrepreneurs, students, or teachers could test ideas, learn, and experiment. Furthermore, there is no space for experimental learning, science co-creation, or out-of-the-box thinking when it comes to scientific experiments. The biohacking movement is almost? nonexistent; however, we have already mapped pioneers from both the academia and business sector who can spearhead the change.

The establishment of the biohacking lab will have a direct impact on how we manage biowaste in our country, but also on how we perceive waste and the transformational potential it has. Ecosystems for bio-waste transformation are complex networks involving a variety of stakeholders, including start-ups, established businesses, research organizations, laboratories, and other infrastructure. To develop this ecosystem a BioHacking Lab will be fully equipped that will serve as a central point where the community of startups and innovators will be built. Startups are one of the leading organizations that develop new solutions and products through transformative bio-waste processes. As a result of a report done by the UNDP City Experiment Fund, an ecosystem mapping of the players in the biowaste ecosystem around Europe. Most of those startups are coming from the western part of Europe, most predominantly UK and Denmark. Furthermore, the analysis showed that one-third of the mapped startups use the waste from agricultural production as resource/input for their product, followed by coffee and food leftovers. Except for some startups that are at an early stage in business model development no registered startups have been mapped in the territory of NMK. Even though North Macedonia is an agricultural country no startups or businesses are working with agricultural or other biowaste transformation methods.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Biohacking lab is going to address these issues by becoming a Hub for innovators, entrepreneurs, students, teachers, and young scientists, to experiment and prove a principle in biology for waste transformation (composting, contamination of biowaste etc) or develop MVPs minimum viable products coming from biowaste 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The BioHacking lab will serve as a prove that democratization of science in the name of environmental impact is possible. The idea is to make science accessible to the general public in the same way computer programing become accessible to the general public in the 1970s.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The UNICEF-led program on the Science Learning Network (SLN) was a logical step for the joining forces with UNDP in this jointly managed intervention. The Science Learning Network is a network of members I.e., science institutions across the country that offer an educational programme for schools on experiential learning and science experimentation to advance the environment and climate change education. The members of SLN are committed to sharing resources and knowledge, collaborating and engaging with schools, providing rich experience and experiential learning that are not possible within the school, and supporting the educational outcomes on science by developing and delivering programs in line with the curriculum. The SLN is flexible in including more science institutions as members and reaching vulnerable communities, areas affected by poverty, and rural communities.
