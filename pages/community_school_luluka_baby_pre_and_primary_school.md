> Brief description of the innovation

Am a teacher by profession. I started offering tutorials during the closure of schools due to covid 19 . Due to the overwhelming demand from parents I decided to open a school at home with a few pupils in January 2021.Now the whole house is a school with about 70 pupils and employed 4 teachers. We need to expand on the classroom and build rather than renting.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

By offering quality education we will have more pupils coming and in turn empower more teachers by employing them and other support staff.it will help the community by offering quality education at an affordable price.This is also going to compliment government efforts in providing  affordable and quality education as close to the community as possible

> Technical Feasibility

The school covers baby Pre and primary School. The school started in January 2021 and goes up to grade 4 at the moment.we hope to reach grade 7 by January 2023 when we build our own classes and not renting.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It is going to create employment , provide quality education and at the same time compliment government efforts in providing education and employment
