The Symptom Monitor solution automates the process of monitoring the health status of persons in self-isolation by competent persons and institutions. On a daily basis, registered persons receive questionnaires (on different types of devices) that enable checking the symptoms characteristic of Covid-19 and thus help the medical staff to monitor the health condition of patients in a quality and timely manner. The solution was fully developed by the Novi Sad company MI-Systems and is willing to provide it to our authorities free of charge.
