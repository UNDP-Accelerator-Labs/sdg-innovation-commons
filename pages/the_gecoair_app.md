> Description of the solution

A mobile application designed to help car drivers reduce the environmental impact of their journeys. It acts as a barometer of clean mobility by providing real-time feedback on emissions (CO2, NOx, fine particles, carbon monoxide) and offering guidance on eco-responsible driving practices. The app encourages the use of sustainable transport modes and has achieved significant engagement with over 40,000 downloads and 80 million km tracked, showing a potential 20% variation in CO2 emissions based on driving habits.

> Socio-economic effects

By encouraging eco-friendly driving habits, Gecoair contributes to reduced environmental impact and potential cost savings for users. It also supports public health by aiming to decrease harmful emissions in urban areas.
