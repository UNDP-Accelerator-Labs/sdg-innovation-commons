Graphene is a carbon based material that has attracted attention of governments, scientists and industries globally due to its unique chemical and physical properties. Dr. Muhammad Mahyiddin Ramli from UniMAP, began his research that focuses on the utilisation of oil palm tree wastes, such as oil palm trunk (OPT), empty fruit bunch (EFB) and palm kernel shell (PKS) to produce graphene. Some applications for graphene have been identified by the UniMAP team, including gas sensors and biomedical sensors. They have also collaborated with Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) and Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) in utilising their graphene for electronic applications such as biosensors and organic thin film transistors (OTFT).   UniMAP also works closely with Felcra Berhad, as the company is the main source of the oil palm tree wastes. This effort is in line with FELCRA's goal to ensure environmental conservation and biodiversity are included in the company's operations towards a sustainable future. Apart from turning waste into wealth and getting rid of oil palm tree wastes, graphene applications can potentially provide new solutions to existing problems. This amazing material has unique properties, which can be used to detect toxic gases and also to detect cancerous cells through biosensors. Moreover, it can be used as organic solar cells to rival the traditional silicon solar cells.
