EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The UNDP Accelerator Labs (AccLab) is a learning network to explore

the role of innovations to solve complex sustainable development

challenges. It comprises 90 Lab teams covering 115 countries, of

which the UNDP Viet Nam (VN) Accelerator Lab team is among the

first Labs, with the aim to enable businesses, policymakers and

communities to move towards sustainability, through a culture of

experimentation, exploration, and solutions mapping for innovation.

The AccLab in Viet Nam, like the other Labs, was set up to explore

and experiment with a culture of learning and innovation within

UNDP’s global network, embed this exploratory and innovative way

of working in programs as well as program teams at the country

office in Viet Nam, and contribute to innovation in the ecosystem

in VN through public and private sector partnerships and this new

way of working.

Life-Cycle Review Objectives and Timelines

A life-cycle review was undertaken for VN AccLab’s work over the last

five years – since its inception in 2019, to 2024. The main objectives

of the life-cycle review were to understand and reflect on:

■ Organizational impact: Impact of AccLab’s work on VN Country
Office (CO) program team and to UNDP’s organizational capacity

at the global and national level

■ Ecosystem impact: Impact of AccLab’s work on Viet Nam’s public

and private sector innovation ecosystem

■ Way forward: Reflecting on successes and gaps, to plan future

strategies for AccLab Viet Nam

The review and report development was conducted over a period

of eight months between Jan 2024 and August 2024, by a team of

independent evaluators.

Methodology and Sample Selection for the
Review

Given the complex and systemic nature of impact anticipated from

the work of the AccLab, two complexity-aware frameworks were

used for the review. A hypothesis-based framework developed by

Luminate was used to define an overarching hypothesis and learning

questions for the review. A systems-change lens (based on the FSG

Water of Systems Change framework) was further used to analyze

the evidence for the review. Evaluation questions and components

were framed differently from what they would have been under

the OECD DAC Framework of relevance, coherence, effectiveness,

efficiency, impact, and sustainability - however the essence of the

components was covered using Luminate and FSG’s frameworks,

which were found to be a better fit for conducting VN AccLab’s life

cycle review using the lens of systems change. Evidence collection

was driven by ‘narratives of change’ and questions intended to draw

out drivers of those changes, challenges faced in trying to create

impact, and AccLab’s ‘contribution’ to those changes.

Evidence collection happened through document reviews and key

informant interviews with relevant stakeholders. This included rep-

resentatives from AccLab VN’s own team, regional AccLab teams

that AccLab VN had collaborated with, VN Country Office staff and

program teams that AccLab VN had worked with to deliver public

and private sector innovation approaches, and public sector and pri-

vate sector organizations that had received innovation support from

AccLab directly or indirectly. A total of 30 interviews were conducted.

Interviewees were selected based on projects and initiatives they

were a part of. Initiatives and projects were selected purposively,

and the factors considered for sample selection of initiative were

as follows – type of project partner for AccLab (AccLab VN CO pro-

gram team, public sector, private sector), duration of initiative (short

one-time engagement vs long-term repeat engagement), Initiative

period relative to AccLab’s maturity as an entity (early, mid, late),

initiative budget (relatively high or relatively low, as initially planned

before starting the initiative), outcomes (successful or unsuccessful,

as perceived by the AccLab team), and initiative type (big bets or

exploratory initiatives , subjectively assessed by the AccLab team).

Findings from the Review

To understand AccLab’s contribution to complex systems change in

the innovation ecosystem in Viet Nam, to the program teams and

organizational capacity in the Viet Nam Country Office, as well as to

the organizational capacity of UNDP globally, the life-cycle review

focused on finding successful stories of change from representative

samples, as well as learnings from sample unsuccessful outcomes,

to extrapolate the the levers and drivers of those changes, and

exploring the challenges faced in creating impact.

A snapshot of AccLab Viet Nam’s contribution to enabling innova-

tion within the UNDP’s global network, VN country office, and at the

ecosystem level in VN is given below:

Further, AccLab VN showed significant outputs against UNDP’s

global framework for innovation.

■ It used 25+ new data sources across different initiatives, including
data from citizens, local government, tourists, public servants,

end-users of public administration’s services, online portals, and

innovation agencies.

■ It used 30+ diverse types of data across different initiatives,
focusing on qualitative data, quantitative data, experimental

data, observational data - from both primary and secondary

data sources.

■ It used 18+ innovation methods, such as participatory
ethnographic research methods, policy experiments, collective

intelligence from stakeholders, horizon scanning, driver mapping,

visioning, systems thinking, design thinking, design sprints, and

visual thinking & mapping.

■ It formed 7 new partnerships with government departments and
innovation institutes, who can potentially be innovation partners
for the larger UN CO in Viet Nam in the future

Using these different data sources, data types, innovation methods,

and partnerships, AccLab’s work was associated with a number

of impactful initiatives in the innovation ecosystem. Based on the

interviews of selected representative samples of AccLab’s work,

some of the most significant examples where mindset shifts in

stakeholders were noted and initiatives were initiated, scaled or

replicated are as follows:

■ For UNDP’s organizational capacity at the global level, AccLab
Viet Nam has contributed to UN’s thought-leadership and

knowledge curation by contributing to the global For Tomorrow

Documentary, showcasing grassroots innovation from Viet Nam

that are contributing to the SDGs. AccLab Viet Nam has also played

a pivotal role in developing the National Innovation Ecosystems

toolkit. This is a toolkit of adaptable resources developed by

the Accelerator Labs in partnership with the UNDP Chief Digital

Office, to support UNDP country offices and regional bureaus,

particularly in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, in promoting

innovation through collaboration between governments and civil

society. AccLab Viet Nam’s contribution drew upon its expertise

in supporting the design and strategy of the NIC and NATEC for

a robust National Innovation Ecosystem.

■ For UNDP’s organizational capacity in the Viet Nam Country
Office, AccLab has contributed to the organizational innovation

culture by conducting monthly WeLearn peer to peer knowledge

sharing sessions for staff members, focusing on innovation

technologies and trends; developing the Innovation Corner in

the office which has generated strong interest especially among

younger staff members who use it as a collaborative space

for operational activities to enable innovation thinking; and

developing a Knowledge Management System to archive UN

project learnings over time.

■ Among CO program teams, UNDP Governance and Participation
Team (GPT) has applied AccLab's human-centered methodology

used for Hue municipal’s public service portal, to further develop

governmental portals for Quang Tri and Ha Giang. Similarly, the

UN Viet Nam start-up inclusive business (SIB) team found AccLab’s

stakeholder engagement methods useful, and mentioned that it

influenced corporate partners to see themselves as a part of the

ecosystem to support the start ups in Viet Nam.

■ In the public sector, National Innovation Center, under Viet Nam’s
Ministry of Investment and Planning, has enhanced understanding

of policy innovation and methods for innovating within the public

sector. It has begun disseminating this knowledge by training

other provinces across Viet Nam. In Hue city, the Institute of

Development Studies has adopted AccLab's experimentation

approach to independently study a tourism railway service

between Hue and Da Nang. Moreover, as a result of its work

with AccLab VN, DNES Business Incubator - a pioneer in public-

private partnerships in Viet Nam - has carried forward various

capacity building activities focusing on the circular economy.

Changes in the mindset of DNES leadership has also led to

significant structural changes in how training methodologies

and curricula are customized to meet the specific needs of

businesses operating within a circular economy.This includes

training trainers, organizing boot camps, and running incubation

programs utilizing modules and formats introduced by AccLab, as

well as embracing an approach to experimentation. Additionally,

AccLab’s waste segregation experiment with Da Nang DONRE

officers highlighted the significance of experimentation and

leveraging community intelligence as essential tools for identifying

solutions for social development challenges. They highlighted

that they have shifted from top-down communication to more

round-table communications, where they are listening to people

to harness community knowledge. Furthermore, the Danang

Institute of Social Economic Development (DISED) experienced

significant changes in knowledge and skills while working together

with AccLab on the Circular Economy Roadmap. DISED adopted

an innovative policy making approach from the AccLab, which

involves testing key hypotheses about policy impacts early in the

process before formalizing the policy. This method proves to be

more efficient than the traditional approach, where policies are

often created based on untested assumptions, with assessments

of their effectiveness occurring only years after implementation.

Besides the notable examples of mindset changes, there were also

improvements in knowledge, skills, and awareness, especially for

training curriculum, training practices, enablement of innovation,

and problem-solving. This has especially been true for public sector
partners, academic institutes, and research think tanks.

On the other hand, despite its best efforts, some initiatives or inter-

ventions didn’t go as planned. These initiatives however, were learning

opportunities for AccLab. For instance, the initiative for Da Nang

City Lab helped in learning what not to do when bringing aCityLab

like model to Danang (or other Global South cities). It ran into the

issue of “isomorphic mimicry”, where development organizations

try to build institutions and processes in weak states to look like

those found in functional states but without their core underlying

functionalities. This initiative was inspired by the CityLab move-

ment, where the local government seeks to create an inclusive safe

space for citizen participation in policy-making through innovation

approaches. Despite bringing best international expertise to advo-

cate for a creative CityLab model in Danang to spearhead innovative

initiatives inside the city, it wasn’t a good timing for adoption due to

the absence of necessary enabling conditions, such as leadership

commitment, institutional innovation capacity, and arrangement of

budget for experimentation, for this model. Additionally, the CityLab

model was not initiated based on any needs assessment done with

citizens, but was introduced by the UNDP management with the

hypothesis that an innovation model that had successfully worked

elsewhere could potentially work in Danang too. The impact of the

initiative was therefore less than what was expected, and it further

reinforced the premise of using collective intelligence for localizing

innovation initiatives.

Impact of AccLab’s work and their contribu-
tion to change

The sample stories of change highlight that AccLab was most suc-

cessful at creating impact by influencing mindset change in many

of its innovation partners by demonstrating the value-add of

experimentation and collective intelligence for innovation, and by

increasing knowledge, skills, and awareness about innovation

approaches and tools for the partners it worked with.

While innovation in the Viet Nam Country Office or complex change

in the innovation ecosystem in Viet Nam cannot be attributed to

AccLab’s work alone, it is clear that in the stories of change we came

across, AccLab contributed in the following ways:

■ Introduced a new concept of social innovation (i.e. innovating
in the public service area to address social challenges and

through the contribution of local communities) to inspire

an innovation mentality among partners. This influenced

partners, especially public sector partners, to identify

innovation opportunities and improve the delivery of products

or services to communities

■ Introduced new innovation methods and types of data to use,
to design effective solutions, such as lean experimentation to

pilot interventions and then influence policy, or use of collective

intelligence from end users through stakeholder consultations

to build ownership of processes among stakeholders for

sustainability. AccLab also demonstrated how data could be

innovatively generated and used (such as using satellite data

on waste disposal) but more often, through knowledge that

already existed in communities e.g. by conducting Hackathons

with civil servants, or mapping out existing solutions that could

be used in Viet Nam’s context.

■ Provided support for development and dissemination
of innovation approaches and tools, such as Public sector

Innovation Playbook and Public Sector Innovation framework

which helped the public sector to navigate and innovate in

operational internal management and provision of public

services to the city.

■ Enabled access to a network of national and international
experts, for its innovation partners to acquire new knowledge

as well as tools for either innovating the organizational work

or enabling other actors to innovate.

Levels of systems change observed

The life cycle review highlighted that AccLab has been able to impact

mindset-level change for many partners, particularly for public sector

partners, who have seen value in AccLab’s methods and replicated

similar methods for other initiatives . For instance, Hue IDS applied

AccLab’s experimentation method used in a previous initiative to

conduct a study on the new railway services for tourism between

Hue and Da Nang. Mindset-change has also reinforced structural

changes, especially in the form of new or different processes being

used by partners, such as running incubation programs or training-

the-trainer programs by DNES Business Incubator.

Drivers of change identified

The life cycle review highlighted some of the main drivers of change

that AccLab used and can continue to leverage more for its work in

the future, and that can also be used as guidance for working in the

innovation ecosystem in Viet Nam by other actors:

■ Selection of the right partners: Organizations like NATEC and
NIC, which are responsible for innovation in Viet Nam, were

good partners for AccLab’s work and vision for innovation

due to mission alignment. Even for partnerships within the

country office, high impact programs or initiatives that AccLab

could contribute to were those which included partnerships

with CO team members who were aligned to the approaches

used by AccLab.

■ Engagement with decision-makers who are open to
change: Even after selection of the right partners, or even in

the absence of ideal innovation partners, choosing to work

with a decision-maker who was open to taking risks for change

and dealing with ambiguity for creating value helped AccLab

to overcome some of the structural barriers that could have

stymied innovation.

■ Right stage of entry in programs / initiatives, and effective
collaboration through program/ initiative life cycle:

Successful programs or initiatives had strong collaboration

between AccLab and the innovation partner through the

life cycle of UNDP existing programs / initiatives, right from

co-design of the innovation, to implementation, to closure.

Entering the programs or initiatives at the design stage proved

helpful, especially when goals, work plan, and resources for

the program or initiative were being thought of and innovation

capacity building was needed.

■ Alignment to existing priorities and plans of partners:
High impact initiatives also happened to be those innovation

12

Life Cycle Review

13

partnerships where AccLab’s work was aligned to existing plans

and priorities of its partners. E.g. AccLab’s work with Danang

Institute of Social Economic Development to develop Da Nang

circular economy roadmap, which was aligned to the circular

economy priorities promoted by the central government in

Viet Nam, or its work with Hue’s municipal government on

a public service portal when Hue’s priorities were to have

effective portals for its users.

■ Reframing problems and finding new ways to solve them,
through introduction of innovation approaches or methods:

The most positive feedback about AccLab’s contribution to

change came for two innovation approaches that AccLab

used - experimentation and stakeholder engagement /

consultations for collective intelligence. This highlighted that

not all innovation approaches need to be disruptive or things

that partners have never heard of, but rather they are lean

and easy to implement methods which can show visible impact

(such as, input into policy making after experimentation) or

sustainable ownership of processes by stakeholders (after

consultations or collective intelligence sessions). These

innovation methods also helped to reframe problems in a

different way, that could encourage thinking of a different

way to find solutions for them.

Access to a pool of experts and innovation tools from the UN system:

Acclab provided its partners with access to the right experts, par-

ticularly those with international recognition, and to innovative tools

which were crucial for AccLab's partners to gain new knowledge

and opportunities, that they might have overlooked due to limited

networks and systemic knowledge gaps.

Main challenges faced by AccLab Viet Nam

While AccLab’s work over the last 5 years has been able to demon-

strate some significant stories of change, there were some challenges

that may have made it difficult to create even more impact. Transfor-

mational systems change needs structural changes in the system, as

well as mindset change of actors in the system. For mindset change

to take place, partners need to see value in the approaches proposed

by AccLab, however bandwidth, budget, or time constraints for

partners like CO program teams have sometimes made it difficult

to work on new approaches, and demonstrate the value that could

lead to such mindset change. In some other cases, some CO pro-

gram teams or public sector partners have been convinced of the

value of such approaches, leading to change in mindset about inno-

vation approaches; however they have had to deal with structural

barriers like donor expectations to deliver successful outcomes in

limited time, or systems that don’t encourage experimenting with

public funds if there is a possibility of unsuccessful outcomes. Such

expectations or barriers can act as deterrents for innovation. Addi-

tionally, AccLab has to operate within the UN system and service

a wide range of competing expectations from its management ,

partners, citizens and donors - all of whom may not always be the

right innovation partners who are ready to take risks or encourage

learning from failures.

RECOMENDATIONS
for AccLab Viet Nam

PROVIDE CLARITY about service
oﬀerings and specilizations:
AccLab may need to provide more
clarity about its specilizations,
service oﬀerings, and beneﬁts of
services.

1

2

SELECTION OF PROGRAM TEAM DONORS
or initiatives with an appetite for risk and
experimentation, and openness to
change - even if this requires working with
new partners or funders directly and not
via CO program teams: AccLab may need
to consider selecting more donors or
initiatives - even new ones to work with
directly - who have an appetite for innova-
tion, experimentation, risk-taking, and
openess to learning from failures.

4

SET EXPECTATIONS FOR OUTCOMES
and RESPONSIBILITIES: At the start of
each engagement or partnership, Acclab
can choose to lay out a simple but clear
theory of change and RACI or RASCI chart
(Responsible, Accountable< Support,
Consulted, Informeed) to set expecta-
tions for intended outcomes, as well as
roles and reponsibilitoes between AccLab
and partners they are collaborating with.

5

ENSURE COMMUNICATIONS ARE
‘contribution-focused’ and
Jargon-free: AccLab may need to
simpliify their work terminologies to be
more locally accessible, and modify
their work terminologies to be more
locally accessible, and modify their
written and verbal communications
about their work and impact to be
more ‘contribution-focused’ instead of
‘attribution-focused’

3

PIORITIZING DEPTH over
breadth of engagement:
Acclab may choose to do
fewer initiatives with limited
partners in-depth, instead of
a lot of activities with many
teams breadth-wise.

6

DELEVOP A BUSINESS PLAN:
AccLab can consider developing
a simple business plan for some
of the feedback and insigns
emerging from this review,
particularly around service deﬁni-
tions, partnership selection, adn
decision-makering for the time,
depth and number of enagements
it may choose to work on.

Recommendations

Actionable recommendations based on the findings and feedback

from the life-cycle review are aimed at two levels: recommendations

for AccLab Viet Nam and recommendations for UNDP Innovation

Network / AccLab Global teams.

RECOMMENDATIONS

RATIONALE FOR RECOMMENDATIONS

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCLAB VIET NAM

Provide clarity about service offer-
ings and specializations: AccLab
may need to provide more clarity
about its specializations, service
offerings, and benefits of services.

Selection of program team donors
or initiatives with an appetite for
risk and experimentation, and
openness to change - even if this
requires working with new partners
or funders directly and not via CO
program teams : AccLab may need
to consider selecting more donors
or initiatives - even new ones to
work with directly - who have an
appetite for innovation, experimen-
tation, risk-taking, and openness to
learning from failures.

The review highlighted that multiple stakeholders are not clear about
the services of AccLab or what their specializations are, since innova-
tion is a large and cross-cutting area of work. More clarity about what
AccLab’s services are, and what value it adds would enable partners
both within the Viet Nam (VN) country office (CO), as well as external
public and private sector partners to clearly understand AccLab’s value
add and what they can approach AccLab for.

Such partners would also be more likely to be aligned to AccLab’s ways
of working, which could facilitate an easier partnership or collaboration.

The review highlighted that partnerships where the decision-makers
were open to change and taking risks, were the type of partnerships
where AccLab has created most impact in influencing awareness or
mindset change, which resulted in further roll-out of new or scaled up
initiatives.

Furthermore, feedback from some stakeholders was that AccLab may
need to adopt leaner approaches that might take less time or money,
while also being mindful of expected deliverables and deadlines for the
donors of these partners.

While adapting to the needs and limitations of its partners and donors
is important, it might also suggest that AccLab needs to select initia-
tives and donors with an appetite for risk, experimentation, and failures
- all of which are crucial for innovation. Such donors and initiatives may
be different from those that want to deliver pre-set goals for a planned
program with limited scope for ambiguity.

AccLab may also need to venture out of the current pool of donors and
initiatives that can be accessed via the CO program teams, to directly
engage with partners who are open to experimentation and taking
more risk. This could also help to establish new partnerships directly
initiated and nurtured by AccLab in Viet Nam, which could then serve as
an expanded base of new partners for VN CO as a whole.

RECOMMENDATIONS

RATIONALE FOR RECOMMENDATIONS

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCLAB VIET NAM

Prioritize depth over breadth of
engagement: AccLab may choose
to do fewer initiatives with limited
partners in-depth, instead of a
lot of activities with many teams
breadth-wise.

Set expectations for outcomes
and responsibilities: At the start of
each engagement or partnership,
AccLab can choose to lay out a
simple but clear theory of change
and RACI or RASCI chart (Respon-
sible, Accountable, Support,
Consulted, Informed) to set expec-
tations for intended outcomes, as
well as roles and responsibilities
between AccLab and the partners
they are collaborating with.

Ensure communications are ‘con-
tribution-focused’ and jargon-free:
AccLab may need to simplify their
work terminologies to be more
locally accessible, and modify their
written and verbal communications
about their work and impact to be
more ‘contribution-focused’ instead
of ‘attribution-focused’.

The review highlighted that initiatives with in-depth support provided
by AccLab were found to be very impactful. Feedback from some stake-
holders on such impactful initiatives was also that they wanted more
in-depth support from AccLab. Given the lean team size of AccLab,
choosing fewer initiatives with a limited number of the right type of
partners may enable AccLab to contribute more in-depth to its selected
initiatives, and therefore create more impact, rather than spreading
itself too thin over multiple initiatives and contributing more at an
activity-level.

The review highlighted that at times, it was unclear to the stakeholders
that AccLab was collaborating with, on what outcomes to expect from
AccLab’s work in the larger initiative, or how the roles and responsi-
bilities (R&R) would be delineated between AccLab and the partners
/ stakeholders (e.g. expecting heavy implementation support when
that may not be feasible). Expectation-setting using a theory of change
and RASCI chart could reduce expectation mismatches about R&Rs in
partnerships, and also clearly demonstrate how AccLab’s activities and
pathways of change contribute to the intended outcomes of the pro-
grams or initiatives.

Feedback from multiple stakeholders interviews was that AccLab’s
communication about its work may need to focus more on how they
‘contributed’ to the overall impact of initiative they engaged with, since
it is difficult to ‘attribute’ complex systemic impact to any one team
or intervention alone. There was also feedback about simplifying the
language of AccLab’s work and making AccLab terminologies more
accessible in the local language.

FOR LEADERSHIP
TEAM AT VN CO

STRUCTURAL INCENTIVES like
‘voluntary stretch goals’ or ‘moon-

experimentation for innovation by
program teams in CO

RECOMMENDATIONS

RATIONALE FOR RECOMMENDATIONS

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCLAB VIET NAM

The review indicated that AccLab can potentially create even more
impact than it has currently demonstrated by making some changes to
the types of partners, donors, or initiatives it chooses to engage with,
and the time-period, depth, and number of its engagements. A busi-
ness plan can help to reflect on and consolidate these potential new
ways of planning its work for the next few years.

Develop a business plan: AccLab
can consider developing a simple
business plan for some of the
feedback and insights emerg-
ing from this review, particularly
around service definitions, partner-
ship selection, and decision-mak-
ing for the time, depth, and
number of engagements it may
choose to work on.

RECOMMENDATION FOR LEADERSHIP TEAM AT VN CO

Structural incentives like ‘voluntary
stretch goals’ or ‘moonshot goals’
for embracing risk and experimen-
tation for innovation by program
teams in CO: Leadership team at
the UNDP Viet Nam Country Office
could consider building some
structural incentives for program
teams in the CO to embrace more
innovation, ambiguity, or experi-
mental approaches in their work,
possibly in the form of voluntary
stretch goals.

The review highlighted that while engaging with AccLab, CO program
teams face constraints on bandwidth and deadlines, as well as donor
expectations for successful outcomes, which can make adoption of
innovative or experimental approaches suggested by AccLab risky.

In addition to existing key performance indicators or goals that CO
program teams currently have, leadership teams at VN CO could create
more structural incentives for CO program teams to engage in at least
a few experimental or innovation approaches with higher risk. These
structural incentives could be in the form of ‘voluntary stretch goals’
or ‘moonshot goals’ which would not be mandatory for CO program
teams, but would be encouraged.

This may help to integrate the work of AccLab more seamlessly with
that of the CO program teams, create a more enabling environment
for CO program teams to work on innovation methods or pilots with
AccLab without fear of failure for these voluntary goals, and further
advance Viet Nam Country Office’s contribution to UNDP’s overarch-
ing goal of embracing innovation methods and approaches in day
to day work.

(1)  UNDP Accelerator Labs “What We Do”

SECTION 2.1 Methodology, Frameworks,
and Sources of Evidence

Given the complex and systemic nature of impact anticipated from

the work of the AccLab, two complexity-aware frameworks were used

for the review, along with the principles of ‘contribution analysis’,

adapted for AccLab’s context.

Development of the learning questions for the review:

A hypothesis-based framework developed by Luminate was

used to define an overarching hypothesis for the review, fol-

lowed by development of assumptions, learning questions,
and sources of evidence to answer the learning questions.(2)

Figure 1: Luminate’s hypothesis-based learning framework

HYPOTHESES

If-then statements which link our entry points (planned
activities) to our priorities (team-level outcomes)

ASSUMPTIONS

without evidence

guide our evidence collection

SECTION 2

METHODOLOGY

The learning questions were framed to be able to explore the dif-

ferent levels of change or impact that AccLab contributed to, to be

able to get a holistic picture of complex organizational or ecosystem

change. A systems change lens based on FSG’s Water of Systems

Change framework was considered during the development of the

26

Life Cycle Review

27

(2)  Luminate’s Learning Framework

learning questions.(3) The framework can capture systemic change
that happens through interactions at different levels, and for both

internal systems (e.g. AccLab and Country Office of UNDP in Viet Nam)

and external systems (the national innovation and policy landscape

in Viet Nam). The interactions between these levels can be mutually

‘reinforcing’ (e.g., a change in the mental model of a government

official may trigger a policy change), or ‘counteracting’ (e.g., scaling

effective practices may be hard if mental models of decision-makers

in the community or government or organization are not changed).

Shifts in systems are more likely to be sustained when working at
all three different levels of change. (4)

Evaluation questions and components were framed differently from

what they would have been under the OECD DAC Framework of

relevance, coherence, effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sus-
tainability (5) - however the essence of the components was covered
using Luminate and FSG’s frameworks, which were found to be a

better fit for conducting VN AccLab’s life cycle review using the lens

of systems change.

Identification of the sources of evidence: Given the complexity of

measuring systems level impact (both at an organizational and an

ecosystem level), evidence collection was planned to be of two types

– ‘confirmatory evidence’ (to confirm things that AccLab may know

and want to verify) as well as ‘exploratory evidence’ (to help uncover

things that AccLab may not know about due to the complexity of the

system). Accordingly, three sources of evidence were identified to be

able to triangulate insights - document reviews, AccLab team interviews,

and interviews of teams that AccLab has worked with or impacted

through its work.

Conﬁrmatory
Evidence

Sample selection: Sample selection was done on a purposive basis,

for programs or initiatives that AccLab had worked on over the last five

years. Interviewees for stakeholder or key informant interviews (KIIs)

were selected based on projects they were a part of. The following

factors were considered for sample selection of projects, to ensure a

diverse and representative sample:

Primary stratification of samples

Project partner type for AccLab (AccLab VN CO program team,

public sector partners including academia and think-tanks, & private

sector partners)

Other factors considered for sample selection

■ Duration of projects (short one-time engagement vs long-term

repeat engagement)

■ Project time-period relative to AccLab’s maturity as an unit
(early or 2019-2020, mid or 2021-2022 including Covid years,

late or 2023-2024)

■ Project budget (relatively high or relatively low, as initially planned
before starting the project. This did not include final budget for

a project, which may also have included other components like

funds raised externally)

■ Project outcomes (successful or unsuccessful, as perceived by

the AccLab team)

■ Project type (‘big bets’ or ‘exploratory’ initiatives, subjectively

assessed by the AccLab team)

A minimum of 6 sample projects were selected per ‘project partner

type’, since there is evidence that suggests that 6 qualitative samples

each from a homogeneous group can cover 70% of findings likely to

be identified in the wider group.(6) The aim of the sample selection

process was therefore to get heterogeneous samples of projects, from

homogeneous types of project partners.

A total of 30 KIIs were conducted in all, from sources 2 and 3 described

in Figure 3. The KIIs were as follows:

■ 4 with Viet Nam AccLab Heads & Associates, 3 with UN Viet Nam

representatives

■ 5 UN Viet Nam CO program team members

■ 10 with public sector, think tank, academia partners

■ 4 with private sector partners

■ 2 with other AccLabs

■ 2 with selected representatives in operations and evaluations in

the country and global teams

(Refer to Annexure 1 for the organizations and teams from which stake-
holders were interviewed for KIIs)

Development of interview tool: The KII tool was developed using the

principles of conducting ‘contribution analysis’, (7) and from a sample

questionnaire (8). However, it was adapted for AccLab’s unique context,

in consultation with the AccLab team.

■ Questions were structured to explore both known and unknown

impacts of AccLab’s work

■ Questions were not leading, to reduce bias in how the stakeholders

could respond about AccLab’s contribution

■ The flow of questions was designed to understand the contribution
of AccLab’s work to organizational or ecosystem change, while

also acknowledging that there may have been other factors for

the change in a complex system.

■ All questions, except two, were semi-structured and open-ended.

(Refer to Annexure 2 for the base questionnaire that was used. It was

further contextualized as need for each interview that was conducted)

Summary of the review framework: The final review framework along

with its sources of evidence was as follows:

SECTION 2.2 Data Collection, Management,
Protection, Analysis and Validation

Data collection and ethical protocols: Interviewees were approached

via email to request 60-minute KIIs that would be conducted online

or in-person, in English or Viet Namese as per the preference of the

interviewee. They were notified about the purpose of the interview

i.e. it was being conducted to understand perspectives and obtain

insights of AccLab’s collaboration with them on specific programs

or initiatives, and gather feedback that would be helpful to plan the

work of AccLab going forward.

Once they consented to being contacted for the interviews, KIIs were

scheduled for 1-3 stakeholders per project. Permissions for taking

notes and recording audio, if possible, were taken at the start of the

KIIs. Respondents were notified about anonymity about organization

names, quotes, and insights upon request, and assured that insights

would not be directly attributed to individuals, either in the final

report, or in internal notes.

Data management and data protection: Interview notes of KIIs

were stored on a private cloud server with restricted access, and

was accessible only to the independent evaluators. Data was not

stored with names or personally identifiable information of individ-

uals, but only with names of teams or organizations that they were

associated with.

Data analysis: Key informant interviews (KIIs) were translated to

English if they were conducted in the local language i.e. Viet Namese,

and were coded, thematically analyzed, and triangulated with differ-

ent sources, to identify patterns and nuances. No special software

was used for analysis, other than coding in MS-Excel.

Data validation: Insights from KIIs and document reviews were

validated with the AccLab team in an ‘evidence validation session’ to

understand them in context of the programs or initiatives to which

the interviewees belonged. Both confirming and disconfirming evi-

dence that came up against the assumptions and learning questions

were validated in this session, to analyze AccLab’s ‘contribution’ and

develop the final impact narrative.

SECTION 2.3 Limitations of the review

While all attempts were made to select and interview a diverse and

representative sample of partners and stakeholders for AccLab’s

work and understand AccLab’s impact on the innovation ecosystem

in Viet Nam, the review did have the following limitations:

■ ‘Contribution’ to systemic change, instead of ‘attribution’:
AccLab’s work was on systemic change for the innovation

ecosystem in Viet Nam as well as innovation in the organization

(globally or at the VN country office), where a number of other

systemic factors could also have impacted the outcomes of

programs, initiatives,policies, practices etc. The review has

therefore been conducted by keeping in mind that all change

cannot be ‘attributed’ to AccLab’s work alone. Instead, for stories

of change or impact that emerged, AccLab’s ‘contribution’ to the

change was analyzed.

■ Limited interviews with private sector partners: Since most of
AccLab’s work with private sector partners was through the VN

CO teams or public sector partners, outreach for private sector

partners was limited. We could only secure 4 interviews for private

sector partners. As a result, we do not have specific insights

for the impact of AccLab’s work on private sector innovation or

partners. The partners who did respond though, had worked

on initiatives with the public sector stakeholders or VN CO

teams that AccLab worked with, and the private sector insights

were therefore analyzed in the context of the CO / public sector

partnerships instead.

■ Potential non-response bias for initiatives or partnerships
that were not as successful as planned: Our KIIs drew a lot of

helpful feedback about things that AccLab could do differently or

do better, in addition to what AccLab did well. However, for most

of the initiatives that were selected as samples of ‘unsuccessful’ or

‘unexpected’ engagement / outcomes, participants did not respond

to our request for an interview. Insights about such initiatives

could therefore only be obtained from the AccLab VN team or

the VN CO program team in such cases. Other perspectives, such

as those belonging to the partner organizations, could therefore

not be incorporated or synthesized for this review.

INSIGHTS
FROM THE REVIEW

AccLab’s efforts have driven significant changes in the working

methods of its partners across three levels: Global UNDP, UN Viet

Nam (with VN CO teams), and external partners in both the public

and private sectors. These changes vary among partners: some

partners have experienced deep mindset shifts, while others have

seen improvements mainly in awareness, knowledge, and skills.

A snapshot of AccLab Viet Nam’s contribution to enabling innovation

within the UNDP’s global network, VN country office, and at the

ecosystem level in VN is given below:

SELEX MOTORS

■ Selex offers battery exchange services for electric motorbikes
and is engaged in collaborations with the UNDP on various

initiatives, including topics such as carbon credits, grants for

electric vehicle drivers, and comparative tests between electric

and petrol motorbikes in partnership with AccLab. The comparison

study between electric and petrol vehicles was conducted by

AccLab using Selex's electric vehicle for delivery services.

■ Through the collaboration, Selex adopted the experimental
methodology introduced by AccLab, noting a significant

difference from their previous cost-focused comparisons. The

test conducted with AccLab was more rigorous and professional,

examining multiple aspects such as driver behaviors, perspectives,

and the overall ecosystem for drivers. Moreover, the involvement

of experts in the testing process offered valuable insights, which

Selex typically did not seek in their independent evaluations - “We

did this comparison on our own before but only focused on the
cost factor. The test with AccLab was much more professional

and thorough; it looked at multi-facets of issues - e.g.driver

behaviors, driver's thoughts, and ecosystem for the drivers;

In addition, some experts participated in the test - usually,

we would not seek for experts’ opinions.”

3.2.5 Contribution to private sector innovation: Private businesses - improved practices
in various ways and enhanced knowledge of the circular economy.

AccLab provided indirect support to private businesses primarily through partnerships with local entities

such as DNES or Hue IDS. These local partners then executed activities using the methods and tools

introduced by AccLab. Various changes were observed in different businesses as a result of these efforts.

MINH HONG COMPANY

■ Minh Hong established their business in 2016 with a focus on
processing organic waste for various applications, such as soap or

washing liquid. In 2023, the local government enlisted Minh Hong

to partake in a training initiative conducted by DNES and facilitated

by AccLab, DNES's partner. Leveraging technical guidance from

AccLab, the training methodology became more tailored to

address the precise challenges and requirements of businesses

like Minh Hong's - “In the previous training, for example, the

Incubation course by the Da Nang government brought in
many successful businesses to share with us their success

stories but I was confused and could not remember anything;

Other courses were in a class of many students, so my specific

challenges could not have a chance to be discussed.”

■ The training heightened Minh Hong's understanding of
professionalism and specialization in business management,

particularly pertinent to businesses transitioning from the startup

and survival phases to the initial stages of growth - “Previously

I expected one person to be multitasking, but now I tried to

specialize in the jobs within the company.”

FUWA COMPANY

■ FUWA’s business is in recycling (making detergents from waste)
and refilling services to reduce the use of bottles for packaging

liquid products like juices. The business received support from

AccLab in its refill initiative at schools in Da Nang. The support

was delivered by DNES to build capacity (mentoring, coaching) for
businesses in the circular economy. The idea of 'refill' by groups

of students in schools was initiated by the company.

■ In the training, FUWA acquired knowledge about a new model
of circular economy business. This model is different from the

traditional business model canvas that is profit based, but circular

economy model is not necessarily profit based and go beyond in

adding value to society and environment - “The initiative showed

us an approach to developing an ecosystem for a circular

economy (working with related stakeholders, as opposed to

targeting only some single stakeholders); the philosophy of

'circular economy' was the most important lesson from the

training for me. This philosophy still accompanies me and

my business now.”

SECTION 3.3 Case studies of unexpected outcomes

While the KIIs drew a lot of helpful feedback about things that AccLab could do differently or do better

in addition to what AccLab did well, partners of initiatives that were selected as samples of ‘unsuccess-

ful’ or ‘unexpected’ engagement / outcomes did not respond to requests for interviews. Insights about

such initiatives could therefore only be obtained from the AccLab VN team or the VN CO program but

are missing other perspectives, such as those belonging to the partner organizations. With this review

limitation in mind, these case studies focus primarily on learnings that emerged from these initiatives.

KEY LESSONS FROM THE UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES:

■ Readiness assessment: This case highlights the need for a more
comprehensive evaluation of the partners' readiness to adopt

the innovation. The government of Da Nang expressed a strong

willingness to implement the CityLab model, but they were unable

to do so due to the lack of enabling conditions. It is important to

note that while political will is necessary, it alone is not sufficient.

A thorough readiness assessment should consider various factors

that contribute to the sustainable adoption of an initiative. These

factors include committed leadership, a supportive legal frame-

work, operational governance structures, and adequate budgets.

Additionally, exploring alternative partners, such as Hanoi or

other cities, may be worth considering as options to Da Nang.

■ Expectation management: It is important to acknowledge that
part of the perceived level of failure stems from inadequate com-

munication about the project, leading to unrealistic expectations

among the involved parties. Therefore, expectation management

should strive to strike a balance between the projected outcomes

and the emerging reality on the ground.

with local partners.

KEY LESSONS FROM THE UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES

■ Management mechanism: The innovation methods introduced
by AccLab were novel to the general public. Besides the inherent

resistance to change, the lack of established management

mechanisms to implement these methods posed significant

challenges. This underscored the critical importance of engaging

deeply and over a sufficient time span with partners to build trust

and foster understanding of these new concepts.

■ Partner selection: This case underscores the significance of
strategic partner selection for AccLab. Not all potential partners

may be receptive to innovative approaches. Unless there are

substantial resources available to dedicate to inspiring potential

partners or developing long-term collaborative strategies, AccLab

should prioritize partnering with organizations whose approach

aligns, to some extent, with its own.

■ Engagement: Leveraging direct partnerships is found to be
more effective for AccLab, as demonstrated in the case of the

partnership with AED through the IGU team. Indirect partnerships

may pose operational challenges that impede the innovation

process. However, when third parties are involved in innovation

partnerships, it is essential for all parties to actively engage in the

process. In the AED case, if IGU had a better understanding of

the AccLab process, particularly in terms of time requirements,

it could have facilitated a more effective collaboration for AccLab

(for example, by coordinating with AED at times when they were

informed about the AccLab approach and time constraints were

less of an issue).

AccLab, along with other UN teams, actively col-

laborated to drive forward the circular economy

agenda by fostering teamwork among various

CO teams. The concept of the portfolio approach

aligned well with the overarching One UN objec-

tive. Initially, AccLab partnered with teams that

has yet to be accomplished.

KEY LESSONS FROM THE UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES

■ Bridging the Gap between Concept and Implementation: The portfolio approach highlighted a
significant disparity between theoretical concepts and practical execution. While collaboration among

teams offers potential synergies in theory, translating this concept into reality requires certain critical

success factors aligning incentives between teams. These include strong hands-on support from

organizational leadership, a financial and management mechanism to ensure equitable rewards

based on contributions, and adequate financial resources to demonstrate and validate the concept.

■ Adapting Innovation to the Context: Furthermore, any proposed concept must be customized to
suit the specific conditions of the environment in which it will be implemented. In the case of the

portfolio approach, adjustments should have been made to align with the environmental factors,

including cultural considerations, in the context of UN Viet Nam.

The findings based on KIIs and document reviews
point to the following key takeaways:

SECTION 4.1 Levels of systems change ob-
served

In the light of the "water of systems change" model, the findings

from the case studies as discussed above reveal that the majority of

changes are concentrated at the structural and transformative

levels. At the structural level, the observed changes predominantly

revolve around the reformation of work practices and the flow of

knowledge and information. Examples of this are: the integration

of ‘anticipatory governance’ theme in the teaching curriculum of

National Economic University or the improved research practice of

DISED by using the AccLab tools, such as problem space or consid-

eration of ethnography factors, to identify problems. This indicates

a concerted effort towards enhancing efficiency and adapting to

new insights. Simultaneously, transformative changes have been

witnessed, specifically in altering the mindset and approach of indi-

viduals, resulting in the initiation of entirely novel endeavors. A good

example of this is the case of Hue IDS applied the AccLab research

method to conduct a study on the new railway services for tourism

between Hue and Da Nang; this change was strongly attributed to

the change in the mentality of researchers in the organization.

The alterations in relational dynamics (changes at the relational

level) appear subtle and somewhat indistinct, as evidenced by

entities like NATEC or NIC advancing within the innovation ecosystem

through enhanced capabilities. This might be attributed to the time

needed for stakeholders to grasp the importance of reevaluating their

engagements. This analysis offers valuable perspectives on the evo-

lution and spread of transformations within the system, underlining

the potential for AccLab to implement a more comprehensive strategy

that integrates structural, relational, and transformative changes.

SECTION 4.2 Drivers of change

4.2.1 Right partners

Identifying suitable partners was crucial for success. Successful cases

often involved partners whose needs aligned well with what AccLab
offers, such as innovation training, coaching in methodologies like

multi stakeholder mapping, system design, or hackathons to foster

and identify initiatives.

SECTION 4 :

However, in reality, this process was not straightforward, as AccLab

had to collaborate with partners who might not always align perfectly

with its objectives. Generally, the impact tended to be smaller when

AccLabcollaborated with partners for individual activities within

larger projects composed of multiple activities. The review found

that most successful cases typically occurred when AccLab directly

collaborated with partners rather than indirectly through other

projects in the country office.

4.2.2 Effective partnership management

Successful projects showed strong partnerships. This underlined all

stages from pitching to implementing and wrapping up and beyond.

In the cases where changes were realized, there are robust evidence

of effective partnership management, reflected through the part-

nership attributes as in the below:

NO

EVIDENCE

Agree to a shared pur-
pose, allow for partner

Co-create activities,

sion-making and part-
nership leadership

Contribute resources,
commit to shared
accountability.

NATEC and NIC are good examples of this. Both organizations have mis-
sions that align closely with AccLab's innovation focus. NATEC is focused
on tech solutions to enhance support for Viet Nam's startup ecosystem,
while NIC seeks to professionalize innovation approaches and explore
new areas for innovation. AccLab's offerings, including social innovation
and policy experimentation, align well with the needs and demands of
both NATEC and NIC.

The most successful cases are characterized by the practice of co-cre-
ating activities supported by strong leadership. For instance, in the EV
transportation testing initiative, AccLab collaborated with a private com-
pany (Selex) and Hue IDS to design activities using AccLab's innovative
methods and approaches. Besides yielding insightful findings from the
study, Hue IDS also gained capacity-building benefits through practical
experience, involving its research staff in the design and implementa-
tion of these activities.

Partners demonstrating shared resources and accountability indicated
a high level of commitment to achieving success. A clear example of
this was seen in the collaboration with the Hue government, where the
government mobilized necessary resources and was dedicated to devel-
oping a user-friendly portal for its citizens. AccLab, in turn, provided
technical assistance through a human-centric approach integrated with
a hackathon to identify initiatives for the portal, which was highly appre-
ciated. This approach has also been adopted by the UNDP Governance
and Participation Team for similar projects in Ha Giang and Quang Tri.

Over and above activ-
ities and vision, pay
attention to the process
of partnership

Paying attention to the process was crucial for partners to grasp the
innovation methodology. This is exemplified by the Studio Lab model,
which was proven effective in capturing NATEC's attention. Additionally,
governmental think tanks and research organizations such as HueIDS
or DISED, which emphasize strong research methodologies, also greatly
appreciated AccLab's multi stakeholder and human-centric approach.

However, challenges persist in achieving effective partnership man-

agement. These include securing support from leadership and

ensuring partners understand the value of AccLab.

4.2.3 Alignment to the partners’ business/activity plan

This aspect was integral to effective partnership management,

emphasizing the importance of shared goals between AccLab and

its partners; for instance, collaborating with Da Nang to promote

the concept of circular economy that was already mandated by the

central government, or partnering with Hue to develop an effective

user portal, which was something the Hue municipal was planning

to work on. Where such alignment is not strong, AccLab had to invest

significant effort in advocating for the value of its innovation methods

and data. However, because AccLab faced resource constraints, such

investment was difficult.

Partners collaborating with AccLab on initiatives outside their initial
plans often requested long-term support to ensure the innovation

progresses from prototype to sustainable implementation. If activi-

ties were not aligned with partners' plans, there was a considerable

risk that they would only adopt the innovation to a limited extent

going forward.

4.2.4 Right entry points

This is reflected by AccLab's innovation value being maximized when

it participated in the right stage of the project management cycle

(e.g design phase) or it selected the right partners (e.g. NATEC or

NIC) who appreciate AccLab’s approaches.

For instance:

■ The value of AccLab's methodology was highly appreciated by
CO teams during the project design phase. At this stage, CO

projects are flexible and open to innovative ideas, unconstrained

by delivery deadlines. However, when it comes to implementing

specific activities within ongoing projects, the influence of

AccLab's values was overshadowed by competing priorities unless

significant disruptive impacts are achieved.

■ The transformations were most noticeable in organizations
focused on innovation or research, such as NATEC, Hue IDS,

DISED, and NIC. The extent of these changes largely depended

on their ability to sustain the use of AccLab's innovations after the

collaboration ended, which poses a significant challenge. These

organizations have expressed interest in strategically partnering

with AccLab over the long term.

4.2.5 Other key drivers of changes

64

Life Cycle Review

65

■ Access to networks of relevant actors in specific sectors: for
example, connecting startups with experts in circular economy,

and facilitating partnerships with research institutes and local

governments for Selex, a private company involved in EV battery

charging services to advocate the findings of the study on EV

transportation.

■ Generation of added values: introducing new innovation
methods like reframing issues, experimental approaches, collective

intelligence, and stakeholder consultation. These methods are

not necessarily disruptive but are often novel or applied in a

systematic manner for the first time by partners. Successful

implementation of these methods requires ongoing support.

■ The AccLab team’s attitudes were energetic, enthusiastic,
and trying to create values. These were also believed to inspire

partners to innovate, contributing to capacity building as well.

■ Support from AccLab Global's back office in terms of accessing
the innovation knowledge base served as an implicit driver.
AccLab Viet Nam's efforts to tailor innovation knowledge and tools

to the specific contexts of local partners were crucial complements

to this support.

measurement framework employed primary, secondary, qualitative,

and quantitative data.

Over the years, a variety of innovation methods (18+) were also

employed, increasing in complexity and number. In 2023, eight

methods were used, including horizon scanning, driver mapping,

visioning, visual thinking and mapping, system thinking, design

thinking, design sprints, and collective intelligence. In 2022 and

2021, the focus was on three methods: participatory ethnographic

research, collective intelligence, and policy experiments. In 2020,

four methods were utilized: ethnographic research and interviews,

behavioral insights, analysis of ongoing activities, and collective

intelligence for in-depth problem exploration and solution gathering.

Finally, it is noted that 7 government partners of AccLab adopted the

lab methods. These are: National Innovation Center (NIC), National

Agency for Technology Entrepreneurship and Commercialization

(NATEC), Da Nang Institute of Socio-Economic Development (DISED),

Hue Institute of Development Studies (Hue IDS), NSSC (government

partners), National Economic University (NEU), Da Nang Business

Incubator ( DNES).

SECTION 4.3 AccLab’s contribution to change

4.3.1 Explicit contribution by AccLab

AccLab showed significant outputs against the UNDP global frame-

work for innovation.

In total, 26+ data sources were used in various activities of AccLab,

including contributions from citizens, local government, tourists,

public servants, end-users (such as people with disabilities), ship-

pers, clients, and online portals. Additionally, specialized input was

gathered from government innovation agencies like NATEC and NIC,

as well as national and international innovation organizations such

as NESTA. Insights were also drawn from ministries and academic

institutions, including the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the

Academy of Development Policies, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

The AccLab also used 30+ types of data. Its projects about the waste

segregation, research on informal waste worker, Circular Economy

Roadmap, the City Lab night-time economy experiment in Da Nang,

digital transformation in public service delivery in Hue, the electric

vehicle experiment for shippers, and the used household goods

fair in Da Nang all utilized four types of data: observational, exper-

imental, qualitative, and quantitative. The Innovation Government

Lab studios with NATEC and NIC relied on primary and secondary

data. The public sector innovation playbook incorporated primary,

secondary, and experimental data, while the public sector innovation

■ Acclab introduced a new concept of social innovation, for
example, to the NIC, NATEC, and Hue government. Two

significant focuses of this concept were on (a) innovating in the

public service area and (b) innovating through contribution of

local stakeholders. In the latter, opportunities and innovations that

address the opportunities were identified through engagement

of people in the community. Social innovation is considered as

‘new’ because (a) this domain is generally overlooked in Viet

Nam (b) to many people, the term ‘innovation’ is even denoted

to hard technologies, and (c) traditionally, new ideas are derived

from decision makers – for example, the human centric approach

helped show the sources of innovation could be from inputs from

users of the portal in Hue and initiatives from the Hackathon for

improving the portal performance.

■ Acclab introduced through training or direct coaching on the
innovation methods, and data/information (to a lesser extent),

for delivering the above concept.

ᵒ Innovation method: AccLab applied a range of different

innovation methods in different projects, including.

ᵒ Experimenting: Generating insights for policy-making or prac-
tice improvement (e.g., CityLab, EV transportation, government

portal to enhance online interaction between government and

66

Life Cycle Review

67

citizens in Hue). An exemplary case was the newly designed

waste bin in Da Nang. Experimentation with community waste

bin usage led to the development of a practical design that

continued to be used and replicated in Da Nang.

ᵒ New research techniques: Partners across AccLab projects

commonly highlighted two innovative techniques: (a) prob-

lem space exploration, which examines issues from multiple

perspectives, and (b) collective intelligence, gathering insights

and ideas from all relevant stakeholders. These methods are

considered 'new' compared to traditional Viet Namese research

practices, which often rely on input solely from perceived

experts in a field, potentially overlooking contributions from

less experienced individuals. A compelling example was the

identification of the significant role of informal waste workers

in Da Nang using these techniques; as a result, informal waste

workers were integrated into the city's waste management

plan—a development unlikely using traditional research meth-

ods for policy-making.

ᵒ

Innovation data generation: initiatives were sourced from

Hackathon, stakeholders, and experimenting. Scientific data,

such as satellite data on waste disposal in Da Nang, was also

introduced to local partners. However, a substantial portion

of innovative data stemmed from ideas and initiatives already

existing within the community. A notable example was the

adoption of robots in the healthcare sector. Rather than invest-

ing extensive time and resources in researching new robots,

the approach mapped out existing solutions that are suitable

for users in Viet Nam. This method proved financially efficient,

saving on investment costs associated with developing new

robot technologies.

■ AccLab provided opportunities for partners to practice the
innovation methods: Successful shifts in mindset were observed

among partners who actively engaged with AccLab's innovation

methods. Examples include DNES with circular economy startup

training, Hue IDS in EV transportation trials, and Mgreen using

empathy mapping and system thinking for marine plastic waste

studies. Collaborating with AccLab also enabled organizations

like FullBright to refine and apply their own innovation methods,

adapting them in conjunction with AccLab to better fit practical

needs. Many partners anticipated more opportunities to work

with AccLab to further enrich their experiences, enhancing their

organizational innovation capacities through continued method/

tool utilization.

■ Acclab supported development of tools for innovation: These refer
to specific tools tailored for the public innovation domain - Public

Sector Innovation Playbook and Public Innovation framework

68

Life Cycle Review

developed in collaboration with, and for, agencies and departments

under the Ministry of Investment and Planning.

■ AccLab provided partners with access to a diverse network of
stakeholders, including experts, government partners, and private

sector businesses in the innovation ecosystem: AccLab's affiliation

with AccLab Global and UN Viet Nam enabled it to assist both

public and private partners in bridging gaps in global knowledge

access and networking with international experts.

4.3.2 Implicit contribution

■ Foster innovation mindset across the UN and other system
actors: By training in new methods and directly coaching partners

on their application, the team demonstrated the feasibility of these

innovative approaches. A strong awareness about experimentation

tools to produce credible results for design or other activities is

observed to be strong in the project teams that collaborated

with AccLab.

■ Contribute to creating sustainable impact on innovation
capacity building: This was achieved through strategic

partnerships with key stakeholders at central and city levels

to maximize influence. For example, NIC with the Ministry of

Investment and Planning, NATEC with the Ministry of Science

& Technology, and research organizations in Da Nang and Hue

tasked with providing policy inputs will integrate AccLab's lessons

to support actors in their respective innovation ecosystems.

■ Contribute to developing innovation prototype in public
services: AccLab's model of policy experimentation and

stakeholder collaboration informs policy implementation and

enhances intelligence gathering from multiple stakeholders.

SECTION 4.4 Challenges faced

4.4.1 Contextual challenges

■ Governance constraint: AccLab operates within the overall
framework of the UNDP, which means it must cater to UNDP

Viet Nam customers/partners, some of whom may not have

established mechanisms for innovation interventions. For

example, a government agency was open to innovation but

lacked the necessary infrastructure for policy experimentation,

making them potentially unsuitable partners for AccLab. The

case of CityLab can be an example where the state management

mechanism was not in place to provide resources and rules for

undertaking the Lab model for policy experimentation. AED is

another example showing challenges in working with partners

of which the innovation (open-to-change) mentality is not the

69

strongest; in contrast, NATEC with mission to support startups

perfectly fit with AccLab’s focus on innovation, and so, it is looking

forward to developing a long term partnership with AccLab.

■ Unrealistically high expectation: the UNDP management views
AccLab as an R&D team, yet it was consistently articulated in the

interviews with UNDP staff that the expectations from CO projects

often demand significant impact or scaling up of AccLab's results.

This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the term 'acceleration'

in the AccLab's name, suggesting rapid advancement. However,

AccLab's capabilities are primarily suited for piloting purposes

rather than large-scale implementation.

■ Partners’ strong momentum to stay on with the traditional ways
– This challenge applied to both external and internal partners,

reflecting reluctance at the individual and organizational levels

to adopt new approaches or innovations. Individuals could be

hesitant or unprepared to embrace change, while processes

might hinder or delay the uptake of innovations, such as policy

changes needed to facilitate policy. As shared by the leaders

from NATEC and NIC, the levels of absorption for AccLab’s new

methods are varied across individuals in the organizations, and

this can be partially explained for people’s mentality to resist the

changes; the discontinuity of AED to pursue is another example

of a partner that is not open to new thing.

4.4.2 Strategic challenges

■ Communication of core values: AccLab needed to effectively
demonstrate and convince its target partners of its core values.

Many partners, including those from the project teams in the

UNDP, were unclear about the specific values that AccLab could

offer, leading to widespread confusion about its activities. Over

the past five years, AccLab has engaged in a wide array of themes

with diverse keyword names, including human rights, robotics,

business startups, circular economy, policy experimentation,

and public innovation. This diluted the communication message

about the AccLab’s focus. Complicating matters further, AccLab's

efforts to promote innovation methods and data were sometimes

misunderstood due to varying interpretations of the term

'innovation'.

■ Lab-in-lab situation: AccLab was perceived as a laboratory at the
country office (CO) level addressing the needs and priorities of the

CO, but it also operated under the umbrella of UNDP Global as a lab

within the network . This dual identity creates challenges at both

the operational and team dynamics levels, making it challenging

for AccLab to navigate short-term country office priorities and its

long-term global development vision effectively.

4.4.3 Operational challenges

■ Difficult to show visible impacts to develop solid and
sustainable relationships with partners. Some of AccLab’s

activities are activity-based within larger projects, not program/

project-based. This is challenging for AccLab to demonstrate

its contribution to final project outcomes and show its value

effectively to CO teams. What is more, the experimental nature of

AccLab's work introduced uncertainty in terms of results. AccLab

found it difficult to commit to delivering specific outputs that

partners typically expect, as the benefits often lied in learning from

the innovation process rather than immediate tangible outcomes

- experts from HueIDS and DISED shared that their understanding

of AccLab’s approach did not come in the beginning, rather it

was solidly established towards the end of the implementation

of AccLabs method.

■ Time consuming experimentation: Innovation requires
additional time and effort, which several partners, including

projects within UNDP Viet Nam, struggled to accommodate. It

was easiest for the AccLab to demonstrate its value during the

project design stage, like in the case of the ISEE COVID project,

when there are fewer constraints. Once projects are underway,

deadlines and budget pressures on project managers often clash

with AccLab's experimental approach, which requires sufficient

time and additional resources.

■ Inability to deliver innovation through the entire process: The
innovation journey is lengthy, spanning from idea generation to

prototyping, piloting, scaling, and sustainable implementation.

AccLab typically focused on the initial phases, such as prototype

production or piloting (proof of concept), due to constraints like

limited resources, time, and support from diverse stakeholders

with varying interests. Scaling up innovations remained outside

AccLab's current capabilities. The SDG Investment opportunity

mapping, the Danang Citylab, and the introduction of anticipatory

governance to National Economic University are examples of

work where AccLab can only exit at the stage of ‘proof of concept’

(Nighlab) or initial introduction of innovation (SDG Invest map

and Anticipatory Governance methodology)

■ Simplify the terminology: many external and internal partners
suggested to customize the methodology to local contexts

and simplify the language of terminology to make it more

understandable and communicable (e.g Hue IDS shared some

obstacles in applying the AccLab’s method in interviewing

stakeholders). Nevertheless, this may not be straightforward

because it can be hard to produce a one-size-fit-all set of tools

for all partners.

Life Cycle Review

71

Public sector partners especially suggested that more in-

depth programmatic support would be very helpful and more

sustainable, as opposed to support across a breadth of activities.

■ Adapting to the needs and limitations of partners: Multiple
members from the Viet Nam country office, including those who

were willing to try new approaches and appreciated AccLab’s work,

mentioned that AccLab may need to adapt its work and solutions

based on the needs and limitations of the teams that they were

working with. Since many teams were operating within a budget

or had bandwidth constraints, donor expectations, or deadlines

to deal with on their programs / initiatives, they mentioned

that AccLab’s approach required more time and money. Leaner

approaches or those that could demonstrate results for donors

in some cases could be considered instead.

■ Using simpler language: Many stakeholders across the country
office as well as government / public sector partners shared

feedback that language and terminologies used by AccLab may

need to be simplified or de-jargoned to make things easier to

understand. Additionally, their feedback also included suggestions

on making AccLab terminologies more accessible in local language

(e.g. “citizen-data”).

■ Other miscellaneous feedback about communication style,
access to more experts, and easier access to tools and

databases: There were suggestions from some respondents

that AccLab’s communication of its work may need to be more

‘contribution’ focused rather than ‘attribution’ focused; that more

access to a network of national or international experts would be

even more appreciated since stakeholders have found the current

access helpful; and that AccLab may consider having a database

or portal of resources for stakeholders, and offer more targeted

guidance on which tools or resources to use.

4.4.4 Resources

■ Budget constraints: The budget allocated to the team was
inadequate considering the scope of activities and the expected

impact. This also underscores the earlier point that while AccLab

can conduct experiments, scaling up results often falls to other

projects. Despite this, AccLab was still expected by many partners

to achieve significant impacts.

■ Limited human resources: The team consisted of three heads and
a program associate and sometime a Lab assistant. Meanwhile,

the team has to work on a wide range of themes, like circular

economy, public innovation, and startups.

SECTION 4.5 Feedback from stakeholders on
what AccLab could do differently

In addition to acknowledging how AccLab had contributed to a differ-

ent way of thinking or working towards innovation, stakeholders also

shared some feedback on things that AccLab could consider doing

differently, which could further increase the impact of their work.

■ Providing more clarity on AccLab’s role, specialization, and
service offerings: Multiple stakeholders across the country office

and the public sector, including those who shared impactful stories

of change of their work with AccLab, mentioned that they needed

more clarity about the core value-add of AccLab, especially in

terms of their role, specialization, and service offerings. Since

‘innovation’ is a broad field of work, stakeholders were not

always clear what they could specifically approach AccLab for.

Expectations or understanding of AccLab’s role varied greatly - as

a knowledge partner, as additional support for implementation,

as specialists for domains in which other stakeholders didn’t

have experience (e.g. acceleration or training courses on circular

economy), etc. As a result, expectations from AccLab also varied

significantly, such as, AccLab would support in activity-based

engagement like new ways of conducting sessions, or that they

would provide access to other networks of specialists, or that they

would help to scale an experiment that had been successful but

which may have needed further contextualization to be replicated

outside the pilot.

■ Considering more depth of work, as opposed to more breadth:
While some stakeholders spoke about AccLab’s support being

valuable through the design and implementation phases of

programs / initiatives, some other stakeholders mentioned

that engagement with AccLab is often more activity-based,

and interaction time may be limited for more in-depth support.

Life Cycle Review

73

Based on the key takeaways and feedback received from stakeholders

during the life-cycle review, the following recommendations may be

considered for planning the way forward by AccLab Vietnam at the

Country Office:

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACCLAB VIET NAM

Clearer positioning of AccLab’s specialization, service offer-

ings, and value-add: Multiple stakeholders, even those who

derived a lot of value from AccLab’s approach, mentioned that

they were not clear of AccLab’s core value-add, and therefore

were unsure of what to reach out to AccLab for, especially since

social innovation is a large field. AccLab can consider developing

clear pitches around its specializations and service offerings,

including types of ‘activities’ it can do with partners, ‘out of scope

activities’ to set expectations of what it does not do, ‘outcomes’
it can aim to deliver for partners, and the ‘added value’ that it

can deliver. This can ensure that partnerships for new projects

are not only relationship based or generated from outgoing

outreach, but that CO program teams or other partners are

clear on what they themselves can approach AccLab for, and

this can potentially generate incoming leads on work as well.

Consideration for doing fewer things in depth, instead

of a lot of activities with many teams breadth-wise:

Partners both appreciated in-depth support where it was

provided by AccLab, and also requested that AccLab con-

sider more in-depth support for sustainability of the new

approaches that were introduced. For instance, one of

the government partners said that instead of a one-time

training, if AccLab would help to train people periodically

or train the trainers and engage periodically, then the

training could trickle down to others in the department

and lead to more sustainable change. Given that AccLab

itself has limitations on its own time, bandwidth, and other

resources, working in-depth for sustainable change may

be feasible if AccLab considers adapting its work to focus

on a few programs or initiatives with limited partners,

instead of also engaging in multiple activities with too

many partners in breadth.

SECTION 5:

RECOMMENDATIONS

74

Life Cycle Review

Selection of program team donors or initiatives with an appetite for risk and

experimentation, and openness to change - even if this requires working with

new partners or funders directly or not via CO program teams: The review high-

lighted that partnerships where the decision-makers were open to change and taking

risks, were the type of partnerships where AccLab had created the most impact in

influencing awareness or mindset change, which resulted in further roll-out of new

or scaled up initiatives. Feedback during the review also highlighted that bandwidth

and budget constraints, pressure of delivering on deadlines, and donor expectations

for outcomes were among the main reasons that partners of AccLab, especially those

in the CO program teams, found it difficult to adopt or sustain some of AccLab’s

innovation approaches, even when they saw clear value in it during pilots or other

forms of engagement with AccLab. While adapting to the needs and limitations of its

partners and donors is important, it might also suggest that AccLab needs to select

initiatives and donors with an appetite for risk, experimentation, and learning from

failures to solve complex problems - all of which are crucial for innovation. Such

donors and initiatives may be different from those that want to deliver pre-set goals

for a planned program with limited scope for ambiguity. AccLab may therefore even
need to consider venturing out of the current pool of donors and initiatives that can

be accessed via the CO program teams, to directly engage with partners who are

open to experimentation and taking more risk. This could also help to establish new

partnerships directly initiated and nurtured by AccLab in Viet Nam, which could then

serve as an expanded base of new partners for the Viet Nam Country Office as a whole.

‘Contribution’ instead of ‘attribution’ focused communica-

tions about AccLab’s work: Some stakeholders felt that AccLab’s

written or verbal communication of its work may sometimes

‘attribute’ complex ecosystem changes or program outcomes

to AccLab’s engagement in a program / initiative, which is both

hard to determine for systemic impact, and can also lead to

expectation mismatches in partnerships. AccLab should consider

tailoring its communication about its work and impact to be
more ‘contribution’ focused (i.e. how it contributed to a larger

program / initiative or ecosystem change), rather than ‘attribu-

tion focused’, which can imply that AccLab ‘caused’ the change.

Development of a ‘Business Plan’ for AccLab: AccLab

could consider preparing a simple ‘business plan’ incorpo-

rating all of the other insights and feedback, to help revisit

its positioning on specializations and service offerings, tar-

geted partners to work with, a communications strategy,

guidelines for working in-depth and reducing focus on

breadth, and a guide for selecting programs / initiatives,

decision-making partners, and donors who are open to

risk-taking, experimentation, and innovation.

Clear theory of change and expectation setting for roles and

responsibilities in programs/ initiatives where AccLab starts

work: The review highlighted that at times there were expecta-

tion mismatches about AccLab’s role in some partnerships. While

some partners felt that AccLab just conducted some activities or

workshops in their program/ initiative without understanding

how it connected to their overall program goals, some partners

on the other end of the spectrum of expectation were happy with

successful pilots but mentioned that they would need to contex-

tualize things themselves if they wanted to replicate or scale the

work elsewhere. Specifically for each program or initiative that

AccLab works on, it needs to lay out a clear scope of work at the

outset to set expectations of partners. This can be done through

a simple or lean theory of change, that should include activities

it will conduct as well as those that are out of scope, and also set

out a pathway of change and associated assumptions on how it

thinks its activities will lead to the program’s or initiative’s intended

outcomes. AccLab can also further clarify that in experimental

programs or initiatives, activities like contextualization for rep-

licating or scaling the program / initiative beyond the first pilot

is a responsibility that will rest with program/ initiative owners

after AccLab enables their learning from the pilots. Clarity on

scope and roles & responsibilities can potentially lead to higher

satisfaction levels and more willingness to partner to derive value

from AccLab’s work.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEADERSHIP TEAM AT VIET NAM COUNTRY OFFICE

Structural incentives like ‘voluntary stretch goals’ or ‘moonshot goals’ for embracing

risk and experimentation for innovation by program teams in CO: The life-cycle review

highlighted that while many of the CO team members saw value in AccLab’s approaches

such as experimentation, they had constraints around bandwidth, pressure of delivering

on deadlines, and donor expectations around successful outcomes - all of which can

make innovation or experimentation risky to attempt. In order to integrate innovation

into the way of working of the CO, there may need to be more structural incentives for

the CO teams outside AccLab. In addition to existing key performance indicators or goals

that CO program teams currently have, leadership teams at VN CO could create more

structural incentives for CO program teams to engage in at least a few experimental

or innovation approaches with higher risk - these structural incentives could be in the

form of ‘voluntary stretch goals’ or ‘moonshot goals’ which would not be mandatory for

CO program teams, but would be encouraged. In addition to existing key performance

indicators or goals that CO program teams currently have, leadership teams at VN CO

could create more structural incentives for CO program teams to engage in at least a

few experimental or innovation approaches with higher risk. These structural incentives

could be in the form of ‘voluntary stretch goals’ or ‘moonshot goals’ which would not be

mandatory for CO program teams, but would be encouraged.
