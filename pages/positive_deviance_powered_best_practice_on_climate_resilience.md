> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Test the use of positive deviance to find villages that are doing exceptionally well on certain variables related to climate action

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we identified practices which helped identify villages which performed well in terms of climate resilience then we could scale the practices to other villages

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We partnered with Ministry of Indigenous Affairs to access their digital data which was analyzed through positive deviance methodologies and specific villages were identified.   

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

NA

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Data was provided by Ministry of Indigenous Affairs

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 month

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Data science consultant from Bangkok helped us with analysis
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

We could not follow up on the findings as the Ministry decided to disengage due to sensitivity issues around the data. We did the first round of analysis but did not receive interest from Ministry to move forward

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We need to minimize the risks of harms and maximize the positive impacts through clear guidelines on data access, use and sharing. We need to engage our government partner in the process to enable a relationship of transparency and trust. This is key because without their direction, intent, and commitment, we will never be able to leverage data optimally. This is also the precursor to moving towards an open data framework where multiple stakeholders, especially citizens could use the data for better civic planning building appetite for participatory governance and citizen science.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

1 month

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Approx 5000USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Not currently

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

NA
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Public sector actors are data owners but also regulators. They are skeptical of its use and worry about the possible backlash due to data sharing. This compels them to regulate its access and use, the most common way being to prohibit the sharing of data. In order to build trust and a long-term partnership with public sector partners, we need to acknowledge challenges and build for safeguards. Using existing UN Global Pulse’s Privacy and Data Protection Principles and similar guidelines can ease the process of working together. This can enhance buy-in and build capacity and appetite for data analysis especially in cases where there is little or poor precedence.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

All units can benefit

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Ministries 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

NA

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Better engagement with Govt partners

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

yes

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

NA
