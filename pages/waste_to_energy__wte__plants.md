> Type of the Solution

Infrastructure, Technology

> Affected Sector

Waste Management, Energy

> Description of the solution

Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plants are facilities that burn municipal solid waste (MSW) to generate electricity or heat. This process reduces landfill waste volume and diverts it from landfills. The generated electricity can be fed into the power grid, while heat can be used for district heating systems.

> Socio-economic effects

Reduced landfill waste volume, energy generation from waste, potential economic benefits through job creation and energy sales, potential environmental concerns around air emissions and ash disposal

> Type of Measure

- 1. active measures (direct measures for reduction of air pollution)

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- private sector

> Timescale of implementation

- long-term (5 and above)

> Other Notes

Public or Private Sector lead the solution (depending on ownership and operation model). The effectiveness and environmental impact of WtE plants depend on factors like waste pre-processing, emission control technologies, and overall waste management strategy.
