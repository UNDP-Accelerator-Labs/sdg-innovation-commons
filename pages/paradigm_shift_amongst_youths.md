Paradigm Shift Amongst Youths

> Brief description of the innovation

Why do we have high levels of addict's amongst youths? Why so high levels of unwanted pregnancies?
Welcome to paradigm shift amongst the youths. The opposite of addiction is not soberness instead it is meaningful connections. Martin Luther king said that, " Not everyone can be popular but everyone can be great. Greatness comes as a result of service."

We are all great and gifted differently there is no small work or great work. It is the breathe of life one puts in it, the passion, willingness to serve others with humility that great work is achieved. Through cooperating and working with everyone regardless of negative habits formed in the past with brotherhood attitude, I believe the more one find his/her services relevant to society. The more they find meaning to life and have the sense of purpose.

Paradigm shift amongst the youths can be intergrated in a similar social program which is designed to improve the welfare of the citizens. It can also work in isolation of, therefore there will be a proper structure and transparent systems which encourage decentralisation. 

Each established unit will have its own management subjected to the heard office to ensure accountability and competence remains by those charged with governance. 

Success of the movement implies alleviating of moral and work culture amongst youths, through, support services and consultancy which will enhance entrepreneurship and investment among the young people. Members will be encouraged to work because of their self respect, self worth and the contribution they bring rather than the pay cheque as the award.

This will be achieved through the insight and wisdom shared in the web of paradigm shift. Due to unfamiliarity of the movement and the activities involved it's probably that success can be achieved more in working environment as this is the huge target. Those charged with governance are likely to recommend and apply the concepts of the movement.

This will in return have the significance of improving morale and work relationships. Good morale implies that the individual will be conscious of the activities and more willing to work with integrity, competently and good attitude towards others. Therefore the quality of services provided will be improved.

The core principles which will be applied are worldwide accepted, due to moral decay which has recently impacted our society there is need to recycle old values and the sense of humanity.
