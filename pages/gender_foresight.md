## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Participatory Foresight on the Futures of Gender Issues for the National Gender Strategy
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our Challenge is that even though gender-related issues are a high priority for the government, its strategic planning activities are sometimes limited by a lack of capacities or a clear vision for eliminating gender inequalities and gender mainstreaming. With the support of international organizations, the government developed a broad National Gender Equality Strategy in 2021 with yearly Action Plans. However, these Action Plans are developed in an old-style rigid manner that does not consider flexibility and adoption to emerging crises and challenges. 

Annual Action Plans and amendments to the National Gender Equality Strategy should be developed in a participatory manner, applying appropriate expertise and tools. Against this backdrop, a nationwide future study on gender issues may generate insights and inputs for the National Gender Strategy.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

During the last several years, the government in Uzbekistan has continued making efforts toward equal rights among women and men by ensuring equal participation in political and social lives, supporting women and girls in different areas of social activities and education, and protecting them from all form of gender-based violence. 

To effectively achieve gender equality and ensure the provision of equal opportunities, the government in 2021 adopted the National Strategy for Achieving gender equality in the Republic of Uzbekistan until 2030, with specific Action Plans for each year. 

Furthermore, the Uzbek government is open and turned toward new approaches in the work of gender equality to explore critical challenges, eliminate biases, identify blind spots, and gather innovative insights to address gender-based issues effectively by targeting actors who are in the most significant need of support.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The foresight method in Uzbekistan was explored and tested out by the UNDP AccLab team in exploring Green Transition Futures (findings and the report will soon be presented). Based on the early discussions with the head of the National Gender Commission, UNDP proposed to explore gender equality issues with the Foresight method and received positive feedback and willingness to participate in such an experience.

Using futures and foresight to explore the future(s) of gender equity and women’s empowerment in Uzbekistan provides not only a means to generate actionable insights but also a space to undertake a national dialogue, build capabilities and capacities in using these approaches within civil society and government, and strengthen ongoing and emerging reforms.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We would like to learn and explore the future of the complex topic and identify critical issue areas that drive continuity, novelty, and/or change on the questions of gender equality.  

We would like to learn and identify potential scenarios based on the outcomes and insights on gender equality issues in Uzbekistan.  

We would like to derive implications for different scenarios. 

We would like to generate inputs for the National Gender Equality Strategy.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Foresight - Foresight will be the main method used during this exercise. Increasingly, governments and development agencies are turning towards futures and foresight as an approach to explore critical challenges, illuminate biases, highlight blindspots, and seed anticipatory innovation toward generating actionable insights. 

Collective intelligence - Participatory foresight approach we want to use in this exercise will require usage of collective intelligence tools. 

Anticipatory regulation - Eventually, the work results should end up with policy impact, and we want to instill capacities of anticipatory governance within our national partners.

Drafting a domain map on the future of gender equity and women’s empowerment in Uzbekistan.+ Carrying out desk research and horizon scanning (initiated during this phase and more targeted seeking will continue into future phases). Convening the expert group for in-person workshops (two) to refine and finalize the domain map

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is no or limited data on gender issues in the country 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The findings and potential scenarios of the Gender Foresight exercise with add valuable updates to the National Gender Strategy and specifically will help in developing Annual action plans for the Strategy. Furthermore, it will influence the vision of gender issues among local professionals, as well as will increase their capacity on the issues of gender equality.
