> Title of the innovation

I love Moringa

> Brief description of the innovation

We are a small group lanting Moringa and processing it and using it as nutritional supplement for human consumption and Poultry feed.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Moringa is easy to grow but is very nutritious, with enough resources we will process some of it for making a poultry feed for the free range chickens, human consumption in the rural areas of Zambezi and sell at the local market first then export large quantities to neighbouring countries like Angola and Congo DR. This will also include the Fish as we also wish to grow and expand our aquaculture through better fish ponds, poultry houses and processing equipments, though everything is under the 'I Love Moringa' projects. This will create jobs for the Women and Youths, end hunger and improve health.

> Technical Feasibility

So far we only have very few equipments, no better/permanent infrastructures and no funding as we have just been doing it at small scale even though it seems very promising.

> Anticipated Social Impact

First target is improving the health of the locals by use and consumption of Moringa Supplement feeds and income levels of the local people and surroundings villages by encouraging vegetable growing, Aquaculture and Free range chickens rearing.
