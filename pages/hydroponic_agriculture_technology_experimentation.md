## 
****
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Grow plants without soil, using nutrient-enriched and recycled water, saving up to 90% water compared to traditional agriculture

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the participants in the experiment manage to improve their agricultural production, they will be able to easily feed their families, sell the surplus of their production, and consequently reduce their economic vulnerability.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Compare traditional agricultural production with hydroponic agriculture.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Quantity and quality of agricultural production

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Data collection through interviews

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 Months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
