Overall goal: Survey the number and type of road accidents that occurred in the city of Chacabuco, Buenos Aires, Argentina, between 2006 and 2011. Specific goal: Evaluate the effects of Chacabuco’s traffic layout design on the road accidents surveyed and develop proposals for improvement.

Description of citizen participation Participants -professionals from different disciplines and areas- collected local documentary sources, specifically from the ViveChacabuco website, where detailed information on the different road accidents was provided daily. In addition, they were involved in conducting interviews to local stakeholders to better understand the problem. The project's leader developed and conducted the interviews.

Time frame. 04/14/2007- 12/31/2016.
