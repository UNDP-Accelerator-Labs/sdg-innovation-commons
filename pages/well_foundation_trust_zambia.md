> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The WELL FOUNDATION TRUST ZAMBIA will generate income through FISHING AND POULTRY;
1. Introduction of fish farming and Poultry business to prospective customers in the whole of Lusaka areas. We will do this by handing out our business fliers and encouraging our friends  and family to make use of word of mouth to help us promote our business.
2. Place adverts  on business magazines,local newspapers, radio and television stations in Lusaka
3. Create a website for our Fish farming 
and poultry business and take advantage of the internet and social media platforms such as Facebook in promoting our business 
4. We will create special promotion and loyalty programmes to build a good customer base.

Our target market encompasses the following groups of people:
* Consumers
* Industries
* Distributors
* Agriculture merchants
 
The waste from this industry comes in form of manure which will be sold at a minimal price crop farms located at THE WELL FOUNDATION TRUST.  Strict hygiene standards as required under the Public Health Act will be adhered to. In addition once the chickens are de-feathered the feathers will be used to make compost.

> Technical Feasibility

The proposed implementation plan is to have a well informed nation on substance and Alcohol reduction programs by creating a rehabilitation center in Livingstone and build youth training centers, skills training centers bible schools and leadership training centers for the youth.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will benefit the community,as we will employ youths to work for our Foundation. The salaries that they will receive will trickle down to members of their families. For the slaughtering and cleaning of the chickens we intend on employing young women to the job. They will be given chicken intestines and heads as renumeration. This will contribute toward increasing food security in their households and diets.
 Neighbouring crop farmers will automatically have a closer source for the purchase of their monthly consumption of chickens.
The FOUNDATION will employ majority women and youth as it grows,and the plan is to empower more fish farming and Poultry business in Lusaka and across the nation.
We intend to buy more land in other areas of this country and continue with Fish 
and Poultry  production and meet the demand of this country. We also intend to diversify to other similar fish farming types and Poultry farming. In all these areas,we expect employment of young people, including women and youths.
