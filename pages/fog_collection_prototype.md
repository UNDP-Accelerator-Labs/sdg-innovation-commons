Description: This fog collection system was built as a prototype with the aim of testing the effectiveness of different fabrics for fog collection in rural areas of Colombia. The most positive result was obtained by the raschel mesh.  

Interesting feature: Although the raschel mesh had a better ability to capture fog water, the other two fabrics can also be used if only these were available.
