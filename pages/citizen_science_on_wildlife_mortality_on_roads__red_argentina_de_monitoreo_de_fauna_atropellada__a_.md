## Overall goal

Collaboratively map and analyze the impact of wildlife roadkill on Argentina's roads through an application for mobile devices, to put the issue on the agenda and promote both species conservation and road safety. 
## Specific goals

Identify, through collaborative mapping, vulnerable species and areas of the country with a concentration of roadkill (hotspots). 

Understand the impact of roads on wildlife and build knowledge aimed at improving road planning and promoting the implementation of effective mitigation measures (wildlife crossings, culvert improvement, speed bumps, and enforcement). 
## Description of citizen participation

Citizens participate in the collection of data on roadkill through an application for mobile devices that systematizes records using photographs and GPS location. 

The collected data is curated and published on a publicly accessible website. The initiative responds to specific requests, filters, exports, and sends data to decision-makers (both public and private) for the implementation of solutions or mitigation measures. 

The target audience of the initiative is public or private agents involved in the management of natural areas or wildlife (park rangers, wildlife rangers, officials of the National Parks Administration of Argentina and provincial wildlife offices) or the administration of roads and highways (provincial road technicians, National Highway Administration of Argentina, road concessionaires, etc.).
