## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

This learning challenge is part of a research study which we commissioned an international consultant (supported by Accelerator Lab) to do. Since the study has been delayed, we completed only the sensing part using desk review and iceberg analysis. The below insights are gained through these exercises.

- Beliefs about the role of women in the household, and her duty to contribute to the family and internal household management, are deeply held by both men and women. 

- This burden of unpaid and domestic/care work falls disproportionately on Cambodian women and likely has an impact on their ability to fully participate in society and the economy.
