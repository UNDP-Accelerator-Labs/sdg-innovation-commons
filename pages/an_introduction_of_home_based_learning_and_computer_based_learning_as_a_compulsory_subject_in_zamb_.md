> Title of the innovation

An introduction of Home based learning and computer based learning as a compulsory subject in Zambian schools

> Brief description of the innovation

Computer-based learning (CBL) is the term used for any kind of learning with the help of computers. Computer-based learning makes use of the interactive elements of the computer applications and software and the ability to present any type of media to the users. Computer-based learning has many benefits, including the advantage of users learning at their own pace and also learning without the need for an instructor to be physically present.It provides more learning opportunity for people from disadvantaged environments. People can learn at a pace comfortable for them, unlike in a traditional classroom. Users need to spend only the required time to learn the subject in the case of computer-based learning, and it is also available all the time. Computer-based learning is cost effective in many ways, as it reduces travel time and also the same application can be used to teach new students or users. The learning also offers safety and flexibility as well as helps learners to track their progress.

Home based learning is learning from home rather than at a campus where you attend classes. It gives you the flexibility to fit study around your other commitments including family, work or recreational activities.
Provides an opportunity for students to experience an alternative form of teaching and learning with the use of technology. Lesson packages are prepared by teachers and then uploaded online for the students to access from home. Home education is usually conducted by a parent or tutor.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will generate income for me as a teacher as I will have to be paid for to deliver my services to the particular student at home. It will attract extra charges as it will require me as a teacher to move from a particular school or home and go teach the learners thus generating income.  As a teacher who hasn't been deployed yet home based learning will generate income for me and the rest of the group members.

Home based learning can improve the operations of the existing schools as it will enable it to have extra money for the maintenance of the existing schools. The money can be used to maintain the school and in the case of undeployed teachers, they can generate income and make their own school on the near future.
An introduction of computer based learning even to primary schools can help me and my group to conduct extra lessons for computer which will enable the student to manipulate the computers on their own. Since not every family can manage to buy computers us as a group we buy computers and offer extra services at a fee so that it will be able to generate income for me.
The target market is a school both primary and secondary level and my potential off takers are the parents of the children who are in school.
The challenge prize will be first come first save and those who will show interest in wanting to learn. 
The value of the innovation that will add to the environment is that we are aiming at educating the national and help them become computer literate.

> Technical Feasibility

For the home based learning 
We have to make fliers and distribute to the people in town as a team 
And those who will be interested will be calling us to register them we go and teach the specific learn at their home place.
For the computer based learning, we need to have a specific place either a school or a rented apartment on the market so that learners should be coming to learn on specified times.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation can improve the lives of others in that they will get a job and have something to do rather than roaming around in the streets 
To students, they will be able to become computer literates has we are in the computer era everyone has to know how to manipulate programs.
To the learners lagging behind in the case of home based learning, learners will be able to learn at their own pace and thus catching up so that will we will be able to produce literates as a country.
