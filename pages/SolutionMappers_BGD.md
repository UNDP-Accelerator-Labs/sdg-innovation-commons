# Understanding social protection needs of climate migrants in urban settings in Bangladesh.

[[0:00]] So I'm Sarah Sabin Khan and I am the solution mapper with the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab\.

### [[0:06]] Thank you very much\. Sarah, are you OK to share with us your story?

Yes, I am\.

### [[0:13]] Thank you so much\. Please, Sarah, could you give us your R&D story that I wish to share with us?

Yes, sure\. So before I share my story, I just want to say that it's still a work in progress\. So it's something that we are currently working on\. So maybe whatever you want to get out of it, you have to pick from whatever we have done so far\. The title would be to understand the social protection needs of climate migrants in urban settings in Bangladesh\.

### [[0:45]] Thank you very much\. And please tell us more about your R&D journey\. Like what you did it, you know how you started it?

[[tools:Urbanist AI]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Yes\. So the starting was interesting because the accelerator Lab was focusing on the urban transformation agenda from the last year\. We started our focus more on the urban settings and this is because there is this we saw from one of our horizon scanning exercises that, you know, in Bangladesh now the majority people live in rural areas\. But by 2050, more than 56% of the population will be living in urban settings\. And this is also because a lot of rural to urban migration has been happening and the rate has been increasing over the years, but the country does not have many, very many urban areas that are very livable\. So with the few urban areas that are currently in the country, it's a lot of pressure when new migrants are coming in\. So we were looking at that\. Why are there? So what are the patterns of migration? Of course, there are many migrations are happening, economic migrations, but also a large part of these migrants are climate migrants, people displaced because of the impacts of climate change\. And for some of these migrants, it means that they have lost their livelihoods, their living conditions were not as good\. So that is why they kind of migrated\. But for a lot of these migrants, it's because they lost everything\. They lost land, they lost family and there was number other way to go\. So that's why they were going to this urban spaces\. So when we were looking at this trend, we wanted to really understand the kind of unique vulnerabilities of these climate migrants, especially specifically\. And we could not really find any good research or data or any kind of focused look on the climate migrants themselves\. So we wanted to kind of do a quick understanding of the situation of the climate migrants leveraging on the existing UNDP projects of Bangladesh that work in urban settings\. And we had this great program from UNDP Bangladesh that works across 19 cities of the country and periodically regularly collects data on low\-income settlers in those urban areas where the project works on their MPI indicator\. So that is multi\-dimensional poverty indicator\. So that is a rich database already\. So we wanted to leverage that and we talked to the projects and was what we started out was with like a tracer survey, tracer survey of how many of those informal, I mean, poor settlers in, in low income settlements in the cities are climate migrants\. We started there and we got a survey and it was extraordinary to see that it was a large, large number, a large number of people were climate migrants\. So then we wanted to really use the existing network of UNDP projects to get more data out of them because it's not easy, because identifying climate migrants, distinguishing them from normal economic migrants is not easy\. But since UNDP has a presence, we wanted to leverage that\. So we engaged a firm who did a number of household surveys on these kind of climate migrant households\. First they identified through the tracer survey who are these climate migrants\. Then then from there, we drew a sample and to the sample we went to kind of do a more elaborate survey on, you know, what are their needs, what are their kind of unique vulnerabilities? What are their social protection needs? Because it's very different from other people, because these people, like I said, have nowhere to really go back to\. So what then happened was from those data that we collected, it's a rich database\. Initially we did some very kind of descriptive analysis and shared with, for example, the database on Dhaka, our capital cities data with our city corporation, who also used it to kind of create some more awareness\. But now at this point, we're at a stage where we're thinking that it's such a rich database, it definitely needs more analysis\. So currently we're work trying to find someone from the academia, partner with someone from the academia who can really, you know, use this rich data and give us some very good analysis that we can use later to kind of inform our urban portfolio transformation, urban transformation portfolio that we are designing, but also with, you know, the city authorities\.

### [[5:34]] That's very yeah, yes\. So what skills were essential during your journey and why?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
[[skills:Data management]]
[[tools:Portfolio approach]]
I think for this I have to say that my skills that I brought in from my previous work as a researcher did was important to kind of understand the, you know, the power of data and the kind of, you know, this whole method of collecting the data\. I think that really helped\. But also I would say just trying to think more from a systems perspective because we started working on urban transformation, that is work that we are already doing, but we thought that, you know, we should also kind of feed that design of that portfolio with some more different or more nuanced perspectives\. So I think that integrated or holistic kind of coherent thinking is also important\. Also being able to kind of know how to leverage whatever is already there, you know, trying to make the most of things with the very limited resources that we have\. So I guess those were some of the skills that were important for this story\.

### [[6:48]] Thank you very much\. Did you experience any skills gaps? And, you know, if you can share, you know, what did you do to plug? It's the skills gap?

[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Trust]]
Yes, we realized that, you know, we had a lot of expertise when we were trying to find an partner from the academia\. When we were trying to find a partner from the academia, we realized that, you know, there were a lot of people working on climate change issues than separate people who have experience with urban\. But we couldn't find really someone who we couldn't find a lot of good names who had experience in both, who had studied both\. So that is a skills gap, I would say externally we faced and internally I can't think of any on the top of my head\. But yes, I guess the skills gap was more like subject matter expertise, I would say like because in the space we are, we are so become like we were, we work in a space where it's difficult to really focus on one issue for too long to have really that in depth knowledge that sometimes you require\.

### [[7:58]] Thank you, Sarah\. So where did you, you know, at any point where did you have you know, to pivot or change course?

[[principles:Data sharing]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
You know, yes, I think the pivoting point was when we really decided to kind of use the data we have and really partner with\. At first we thought whatever data we have, we'll use it for, you know, our own just a bit of advocacy\. But at one point we decided, no, we need more systematic analysis of this data\. So we pivoted a bit\. Now we are trying to engage with an academic partner who can really bring more some scientific results maybe out of it\. So that is the point\. I would say we pivoted the other No, I would say those are the kind of main words we pivoted for this from where from where we started off to now where we are\.

### [[8:51]] What do you consider to be, you know, very the kind of useful principles that you applied throughout the journey?

[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
I think the useful principle that you know, you have to understand that people have different layers of vulnerabilities, right? So you do not, you cannot paint them with the same brush\. Even when we are looking at poor communities in urban settings, they have different layers\. They're all vulnerable and there are multiple vulnerabilities, but there is a difference\. I think that is the lens we use because we saw that there is no specific specially designed social protection program around migrants who are climate migrants who have been displaced because of climate vulnerability\. So I guess that kind of lens or principles that you know, even you within vulnerable communities, some are unique and they have their unique needs\. That kind of understanding and trying to understand their uniqueness is I don't know if it's a principle, but it's important to understand that, you know, people have different needs\.

### [[10:00]] Sarah, let's talk now about the stakeholders\. Like if you can share with us, you know, the kind of stakeholders you were able to evolve throughout the journey and their role\. You know what their role was and you know how you are able to work with them\. And you know, what did you know what is it was a common interest for, you know, for both of you and your stakeholders\.

[[skills:Partnerhsip coordination]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
So here I would say the important stakeholders was of course the city corporation authorities or municipalities who, who, who the cities where we went for this enumeration\. So city corporation authorities, very important stakeholders\. I would say the academic partners, they're trying to partner with our important stakeholders who definitely have an interest, our project people, very important stakeholders\. And of course, at the end, the climate migrant communities, they are the important stakeholders\.

### [[10:54]] Yes, and yeah\. That's very insightful, Sarah\. And in terms of opportunities, I know you are able to discover a lot of opportunities along the journey\. Would you mind to tell us more about, you know, absolutely\.

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
I guess this is an area that is still underserved in the context of Bangladesh\. We'll talk a lot about climate adaptation and medication\. Some talks are happening about climate justice, and this is more related to climate justice\. So there are definitely a lot of opportunities in terms of, you know, making this knowledge useful to people who will be working on it in the ecosystem, but also policy makers\. They don't have that\. They don't even I they don't have that insight, but also the access or the leverage funds that we have as UNDP and its presence in the country for so long\. So I would say it has a lot of opportunities to kind of also design policies that are informed\.

### [[11:52]] Interesting\. And what do you consider to be the impact of your R&D journey in, you know, in SDGS or if it can help inform the design of specific social protection for these vulnerable group of people?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
I would say, and then of course can make that social protection needs accessible to these people, then I would say that is a good impact\. And also the impact through the urban transformation portfolio in terms of, you know, talking about catalyzing their fuse, you know what you have to say about South for this this specific journey\. The story I'm telling is about like mainly a knowledge product, but catalyzing would mean like doing a lot of advocacy around it, sharing the knowledge, you know, and informing policies\. I think that would be more catalytical for this kind of product and this kind of R&D\.

### [[12:55]] So if you are given a second chance to do what you have described\. So what would, what would you do differently?

I think what we would do differently and thank you for that question\. It's very important\. I would say that even from when we were designing it, engaging with more kind of different stakeholders other than our usual kind of just communities and just projects and just our, you know, our kind of, you know, people who think in our space, but also move to talk to a bit more with academia and people like that so that it could be more structured\.

### [[13:36]] Thank you so much\.

No problem, very useful\. Thank you\.
