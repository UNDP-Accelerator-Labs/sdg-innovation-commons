> Observation & Description: What is the innovation about? What need does it answer? What does it do?

More than just a cooking equipment, the renowned cauldrons serve another ingenious purpose.

Kakanins traditionally, after cooking are but displayed on Stands and trays. But as for Ate Suman (didn't want to mention her name), her big cauldrons serve as food warmer.

Her loyal customers would always want to buy her variety of suman pilit, balanghoy and tiktik served WARM round the clock.

keeping the delicacy inside the cauldron once cooked, but draining all the water from it, she proudly displays them on her stand. When customers buy, that's when she opens the lid and gets the desired number of kakanin to be bought.

Considering that they are cooked by 5AM, the freshness of the suman are kept for the entire day. Believe it or not, she's a genius!

> Insight(s): What does this observation mean?  What have you learned from the observation?

A. It utilizes the Cauldron, other than being a cooking ware to its optimum use by draining the water after cooking the suman, and displaying them in the store while kept inside it. The lid or cover is only opened once customers purchase the product. This is a deviation from the usual where the suman is displayed openly in stand and trays. The traditional way provides an open for the warmth of the suman to diffuse in the air.
.
B. It keeps the suman as though it's freshly cooked; hence providing greater consumer satisfaction.

C. It's also a very wise sanitary practice to keep them inside the cauldron since bacteria carried by flies and other insects, as well other microorganisms in the air cannot easily contaminate the suman, unlike when it is left in the open.
