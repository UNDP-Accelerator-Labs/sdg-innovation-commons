Freedom Square is one of the oldest informal settlements in Gobabis, Namibia and a pilot project for the implementation of the Flexible Land Tenure (FLT) system. This system allows for the creation of alternative forms of titling, which can eventually be upgraded to freehold titles. The pilot is a cooperation between the Municipality of Gobabis and the Shack Dwellers Federation of Namibia (SDFN), the Namibia Housing Action Group (NHAG) and the Namibia University of Science and Technology (NUST).  The project is motivated by an agenda of 'inclusive cities': through close collaboration with existing residents in the area, the process of land delivery is expedited and turned into an exercise of making inhabitants the drivers in the improvement of their living conditions.
