In Bangladesh, access to water is a severe challenge for the indigenous communities in the Chattogram Hill Tracts (CHT), who primarily depend on natural sources such as waterfalls, creeks, hill streams and other bodies for drinking and household use. These water sources are diminishing rapidly, primarily due to deforestation.  As a result, the communities are increasingly facing water shortages ever year especially during the dry season. The women and children are the worst sufferers as they are assigned to collect water for their families.  They have to travel far from their village to fetch water, and in some areas, they spend almost half a day in search for water.  Time spent collecting water means less time for work and education for the adults and the children. To tackle this issue, the UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with local grassroots organization Creative Conservation Alliance, is deploying a solution - HYDRAM or hydraulic ramp pump system - in a remote village of CHT to generate learning on whether the model works.  Hydram is a relatively low cost, low-maintenance water pumping system capable of lifting water up to 600 vertical feet from the water source to the village up the hill. This pump uses the natural power of water flowing downhill to lift the water and doesn’t require any external energy sources or electricity to operate, and hence is environmentally sustainable. The villagers can use the water for drinking, domestic chores and even for irrigation to grow crops during the dry season.
