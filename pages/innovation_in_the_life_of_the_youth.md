> Title of the innovation

Innovation in the life of the youth

> Brief description of the innovation

Youth Empowerment is to encourage youth by all means. It is an effort towards making a course for them to sustain and adapt as per the situations. It aims at improving the quality of life youth are living and bring Empowerment by giving them access to the resources which can help them to build confidence and work in the direction of attaining growth and transformation.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through having access to resources that is to give them jobs automatically generates income for the source of well being for me and others Many youth do not have things to do in lack of better term so they adopt what's in the presence society for example youth who live in Chibolya so to say they engage themselves to what's in the community and that is selling drugs, robbing people and vandalism.

> Technical Feasibility

I'd suggest that the government open up some employments by investing Money in the newly opened market or put more pressure on the foreigners since they own big companies that their effort must be provide skills to the youth.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This will bring about development in a country in such a way that there will be no cases like drugs trafficking, robbery, vandalism etc..as they will be concentrating on what the government is providing them this might ensure that there is Total control in a country cause youths might have access to own at least two or more things. When they're lacking this meaning there concentration would be having them by force. In this area that's why they found their self in activities that the government is not happy about all the community.
