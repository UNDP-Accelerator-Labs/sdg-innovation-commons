Farmers have for years been blamed for feeding the country on vegetables and fruits with abnormally high concentrations of herbicides and pesticides. Studies have shown that pesticides and herbicides used in agriculture increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. It is for these reasons that Stephen Njoroge has taken up rabbit farming not just for their meat but also for their highly concentrated urine. Mr. Njoroge collects 10-15 liters of urine from his rabbits everyday and sells the urine to firms that manufacture fertilizer. Rabbit urine has highly concentrated nutrients which improve soil fertility and crop production.
