Dabung Girl - A Social Impact Superhero


> Description of innovation

Dabung Girl is a superhero (dedicated to SDG goals) that inspires girls to find the hero within and boys to perceive the superhero in girls around them ('Dabung' is a Hindi word that means 'fearless’). She is India’s very own girl superhero for social impact and focuses on breaking stereotypes. She helps children (8 to 14 year-olds) explore SDG challenges and learn how to discover their own solutions. Research shows that superhero stories give wings to the imagination and confidence of children. Dabung Girl stories are currently primarily being shared through comic books. The recently released comic books include child protection themes of child sexual abuse, child trafficking, and child marriage.
