> Brief description of the innovation

EO Robotics is an educational tool that provides a learning platform for Robotics,Coding and STEM education to people from as early as 12 years old, our mission is to bridge the t gap between idealizing and creating by providing young people with a hands-on learning experience through robotics we believe Robotics can offer students many possibilities to develop 21st-century skills and to strengthen their numerous abilities for their future, in whatever future they decide for themselves. In a way, robotics can offer them a new way of thinking that will be useful regardless of the career path they will choose, we are happy to have taught robotics and coding to over 800 students in Zambia from the time we formed our EO ROBOTICS education tool.
EO Robotics  shall be implemented to enhance, improve, engage and stimulate the learning environment for all students to advance their educational experience and skills in order to prepare them to live and work in a global community. Therefore, the challenge of EO Robotics Zambia is to equip students with knowledge, skills, and values that will enable them to live effectively, productively, and enjoyably in our continuously changing world.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

WORKSHOP SOLUTION

EO robotics being an Education tool, learners will be asked to pay a fee per 6 six classes they attend, We can give an example on how private schools do it ( making their students pay for school fees per month or year ) but for EO Robotics it will be Per 6 classes,  EO robotics will also create a minimum number of employment to the trainers or tutors who willl be tutoring the students in robotics, computer programming and STEM Education.

APP SOLUTION

EO Robotics will be using ads to monetize apps and make money. An app owner just needs to display commercials inside their mobile application or opt for affiliate marketing and get paid from the third-party ad networks.

will be getting paid every time an ad is displayed (per impression), per click on the ad, and when a user installs the advertised app. Being a free version app, will also run ad campaigns to generate ad revenue for a specific period of time.

> Technical Feasibility

As technology becomes increasingly pervasive in our society, its role in the educational process is vital. Technology is an empowering teaching and learning tool. When integrated effectively, it can enable students to become proficient users in our electronic information age. This means students will be able to explore, evaluate and use technology to accomplish real world tasks, solve problems, accomplish tasks, express individual creativity, and apply legal and ethical standards.
yes there is a prototype that exist.
 Implementation Plan
As EO ROBOTICS  our technology provides students with easy to access information, accelerated learning, and fun opportunities to practice what they learn. It enables students to explore new subjects and deepen their understanding of difficult concepts, particularly in STEM, To thrive in the 21st-century workplace, students need to have more than a working knowledge of certain technological tools (electronic calendars, web pages, teleconferencing, electronic whiteboards, etc.). By integrating these technologies into the regular curriculum, institutions are ensuring that the students are prepared for the modern office.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Goals focus on increasing student achievement in programming, building, science and mathematics. These academic improvement goals can be realized by:

1.Utilizing technology seamlessly and appropriately to enhance productivity and student achievement.
2.Implementing technology standards for faculty and administrators.
3.Developing tools and resources for faculty to effectively integrate technology into the everyday classroom experience.
4. Engaging faculty and staff in sustained, on-going professional development related to technology integration.
