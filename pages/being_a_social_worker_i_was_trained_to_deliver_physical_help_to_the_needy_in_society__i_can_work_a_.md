> Title of the innovation

Being a social worker I was trained to deliver physical help to the needy in society. I can work as a probation officer, vulnerable, and as an officer in Dmmu at the office of the president,but due to the unemployment levels that the previous regime had it was not possible for some of us to be accorded such opportunities. With regard to this my education allows me to be an entrepreneur hence given an opportunity to be accorded the capital to run my own business I can do hardware business of which I had an opportunity to learn from Indians for 12 years. Therefore as a widower the government grants should be targeted to people like me for us to have the chance to sustain for the children.

> Brief description of the innovation

By doing hardware business with the experience that I have I believe this business will go Miles knowing that building Is inevitable for everyone living in the urban areas knowing that sustainable development can only be realized when massive infrastructure is built in this country. When this happens that will mean that jobs will be created for other Zambians in need those that have humble education background for a better citizenry for as to share the national cake evenly by virtue of being a Zambian citizen.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Since now we have a new government that came in on 12th August, 2021, our new government led by H.E hakainde hichilema has been promising us in his campaigns that every Zambian should will be given an opportunity to work either for the government of as an SME regardless of whether they are educated or not. Now when I get the grant to start running this business I will make sure that I run this business profitably by ensuring that whatever profit I appreciate I share it in three accounts.
1) For paying back the grant by specified period agreed.
2) banking for the wages of my employees.
3) Diversify the business into agriculture implement such that more employment  Is created in the other sectors.

> Technical Feasibility

This can only be realized after the business is in existence. For now what I need to do Is to look for a central place within town well located within reach by most of the clients that's when this can come to actualization. As for now I ran the shop then after making enough profit then that's when the main business that will stand a taste of time will be implemented be it agriculture implement then go and do the growing in the long run. Agriculture will be the business that will go on even passing it on to the next generation without people struggling to to put food on the table even ex export to neighbors coz Zambia will be the food basket for other countries.
Therefore the geographic features will be just having enough funds to buy a sub division farm land even cheaper ones from local chiefs to get started.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Looking at the support this government is about to give to it's citizenry, this means that with the availability of the resources the inflation levels will go down hence money will not only remain with only those who have it but everyone else therefore good's and services will balance for everyone in this country.
