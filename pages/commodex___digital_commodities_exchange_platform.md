> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

CommodX is designed to provide an avenue to track prices of commodities in Zambia, create an investment class for savvy investors and those seeking exposure to the commodities market as well as reflect physical commodity dynamics. Our total addressable market (target) is 86,898 platform users or subscribers in terms of customer volumes and K685,958.96 in terms of future platform revenue volumes. With an investment, we will achieve 100,000 in GMV and develop our product before our next round. We intend to invest 47.3% in people (staff), 16.5% in marketing, 25% in operations and 5% in trade financing. We require funding in order to solidify foothold in Zambia by building a strong team (COO, Engineers and Support roles), technology (Build Partner application and field application and licence business intelligence software) and increase our gross bookings. Additionally funds are needed for usr acquisition and marketing.

> Technical Feasibility

We have a working prototype and have thus far piloted our beta version on the Zambian market. We are still collecting data from surveys in our view to have a more understanding on the market and landscape. We have been able to establish key partnerships with mobile payments providers and banks for the provision of a seamless online payment infrastructure. We have 345 early adopters and customers seeking early access. In the last quarter, we managed to engage small holder farmers in rural areas and on-boarded 100 farmers on agricultural financing and inputs sourcing. This achievement is an important milestone considering the fact that we are still in pilot phase.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Digitizing post-trade processes for commodities could cut costs by up to 40% across operations, accounting, and settlements in Zambia. The Elimination of middle-men through platform directly benefits traders on platform by creating more value for them.
