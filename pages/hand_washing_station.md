ADEMA, an organisation led by Augusto, is championing waste management and sanitation in the Archipelago of Bijagos. The organisation developed this handwashing station in response to Ebola outbreak in 2014. Training was given to 11 islands to allow citizens to set them up. They use 5 litre bottles, a string and 4 sticks to create this, making it sustainable and easy to manage.
