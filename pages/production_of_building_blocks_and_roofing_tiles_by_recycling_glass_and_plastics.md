> Title of the innovation

Production of Building Blocks and Roofing Tiles by Recycling Glass and Plastics

> Brief description of the innovation

Production of Roofing Tiles and building blocks using glass and plastics is centered upon the concept of Recycling. This is a new phenomenon which is worth testing in Zambia. Plastics and glass are the major raw materials. When plastics are melted, the fluid is mixed with either sand and/or shredded glass bottles.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income by simply selling roofing tiles and building blocks made out of sand/glass and plastics mixture. The market is readily available as the construction industry keeps on growing. While the conversational way of producing building blocks and roofing tiles depends more often than not on limited natural resources, mainly, mineral ores, the innovation will sustainably embark on recycling notorious plastics and disposable glass bottles. Ultimately, the innovation will enormously contribute to sustainable ways of cleaning the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

Making roofing tiles or building blocks using plastics requires some mechanisation including an extrusion machine, a shredder and molds for either roofing tiles or building blocks.

The innovation can only be implemented once a shredder, extrusion machine and molds for roofing tiles and building blocks are put in place. Labour for collecting disposed of glass bottles and plastics can be solicited with incentives. Securing land for daily operations is cardinal.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation can improve lives of people by contributing to cleaning the environment and creating jobs to solid waste collectors. This is a relevant innovation to the current market in that it promotes generation of construction materials in an environmentally friendly manner rather than entirely depending upon limited natural resources as raw materials.
