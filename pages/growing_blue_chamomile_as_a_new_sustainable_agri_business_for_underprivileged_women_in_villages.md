Blue chamomile is also known as Moroccan chamomile since the plant is native to Morocco. Not well known by Moroccan, it has though a rare ability to sedate without depressive. Blue chamomile oil is obtained from the distillation of the flowering stems and has potent anti-itching, antihistamine and anti-inflammatory properties.

Blue chamomile oil is very effective in soothing the skin. It can thus be applied pure to the skin in the following cases:
 itching, such as allergic pruritus
 allergic attack, hives or rashes
 irritative redness, or inflammation in sensitive or irritated areas
