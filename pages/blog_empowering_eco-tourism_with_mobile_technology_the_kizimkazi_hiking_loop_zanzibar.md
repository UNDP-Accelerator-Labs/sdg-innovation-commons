Zanzibar, known for its vibrant culture and natural beauty, is taking a leap toward sustainable tourism with the Kizimkazi Hiking Loop—a 10 km eco-tourism trail in Southern Zanzibar. This innovative project, a collaboration between UNDP Tanzania, State University of Zanzibar (SUZA), and the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Zanzibar, combines technology with nature, promoting both cultural heritage and local economic growth.A Partnership for Sustainable TourismPart of the Bahari Maisha (Ocean Life) Project, an initiative by UNDP's Blue Economy portfolio, the Kizimkazi Loop supports Zanzibar’s Tourism Integrated Strategic Action Plan(link is external). The project draws on success from similar island nations, emphasizing community engagement, sustainability, and digital integration. Through the use of a dedicated mobile app, the trail enhances tourist experiences while ensuring local businesses—especially those led by women and youth—gain visibility and thrive.Highlighting Local BusinessesThe trail provides opportunities for small, locally owned enterprises such as cafes and artisanal markets to connect with visitors. Integrated digital tools will offer real-time updates on nearby attractions and businesses, giving these local entrepreneurs a chance to thrive in the growing tourism sector.Developing a Comprehensive Tourist AppThe project aims to create a comprehensive mobile app offering more than just navigation. It will feature safety alerts, cultural insights, and recommendations, helping visitors fully experience the region. By integrating with platforms like Komoot, the project is poised to reach millions globally, establishing Southern Zanzibar as a top eco-tourism destination.

Preserving Zanzibar’s Natural and Cultural HeritageDesigned with sustainability in mind, the trail includes eco-friendly infrastructure and educational signage promoting environmental awareness. As a commitment to preserving Zanzibar's rich heritage, the project ensures that tourism benefits both the environment and local communities. "This project embodies our commitment to sustainable tourism that benefits local communities and preserves the natural beauty of Zanzibar. The integration of mobile technology is a significant step forward in ensuring that our tourism industry is inclusive and forward-thinking." — Dr. Aboud Jumbe, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of TourismJoin the JourneyThis initiative exemplifies UNDP’s strategic Plan (2022-2025) of using digital technology for sustainable development. Together with local stakeholders, we invite tourists and communities to support and explore the Kizimkazi Hiking Loop as we build a more sustainable future for Zanzibar.Missed our previous blog?
