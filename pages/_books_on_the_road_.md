Meet Gaith Bahdoosheh, the pioneer behind Jordan’s traveling bookshop, “Books of the Road,” and founder of Madaba’s first ever bookshop. Inspired by his love for literature, 27-year-old Gaith made the bold decision to leave his corporate job back in 2015 to spread his passion for books and encourage a culture of reading in Jordan.  https://theculturetrip.com/middle-east/jordan/articles/meet-the-man-traveling-across-jordan-bringing-people-books/ https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/cruising-through-jordan-nancy-vintage-mercedes-covered-books
