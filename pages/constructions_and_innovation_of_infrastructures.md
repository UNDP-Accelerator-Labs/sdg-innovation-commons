> Brief description of the innovation

CONSTRUCTIONS and innovation of infrastructures is the building and up keeping of infrastructures in order to bring about total development in the society and in the country at Large.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

In our innovation we believe in the production of quality works so as to promote our business and marketing our selves. You know it pains a lot. Personally when I see our fellow citizens (Zambians) trusting a foreigner and giving big contracts to them rather than giving to a Zambian so as to improve and promote money  💰💰 💰  circulation.

> Technical Feasibility

Our innovation is designed in such a way that, If some one is skilful in one area , we promote him just to be teaching others  who are coming as new employees. If that person has raised two people who are skilled like him we realise that person so he may be working for himself. And this really helps us to create space and opportunities for others.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation can improve the lives of others by training atleast a good number of youths with different skills.
