> Title of the innovation

Interprenourship i actually want to start a business of selling Groceries and Cosmetics.

> Brief description of the innovation

I want to start my business which i will be dealing with Cosmetics and Groceries. And if possible i can have a hardware too.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

In such a way that i will be depending on my profit. I will be using a little from my profit to pays bills, rent and foods in the same as well as for clothing. You can only progress if you are productive in life. I will actually locate my business to an area where there are no people who will be dealing with the guds am going to be dealing with. People who exist from within an area and nearby placing will not be straggling for themselves to go a long way just to buy cooking oil and other staffs they will be in need of. So am trying to say that: the location of my business will help them save time and energy which they might be using to cover long distances to by those staffs. I will make sure i buy whatever they are desparately in need of each and everytime. This means that people will also be serving money which they could have being using for transport to go a long way to buy commodities and that money will be used differently depending on people lets take for instance one will use it to buy fertiliser preparing for next seanon's farming but again a different person will use it to start poultry farming while a fool will use it in a bar for alcohol taking which is not for free.

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation is actually meant to help vulnerable people and also to reduce poverty and dependent which in this case can work.  In a certain family there are five kids and the father of those kids die and only a mother remains who can not even afford to look after those kids left by their father because the woman is currently not working because her husband told not to work forgetting that there is death. That woman needs help as well as her children as needs support so how is she going to raise those children of hers. Put yourself in that woman's shoe that's when you will understand and help her immediately. His excellence President mr. Hakainde Hichilema said something like "we should learn to support each other no matter what circumstance you may find yourself into" even he who sees what happens anywhere anytime no matter how dark it could be that is GOD ALMIGHTY will be happy with you.

> Anticipated Social Impact
