Making Flexible
Work, Work:
Towards Better and
More Inclusive Work-
Life Practices

Foreword

by YB Datuk Seri M. Saravanan
Minister of Human Resources, Malaysia.

I am pleased to introduce this report which was jointly produced
by Talent Corporation Malaysia Berhad (TalentCorp) and United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Malaysia.

By highlighting the lasting impact of COVID-19 on the
workplace, this report provides a timely assessment of
shifting perceptions toward Work-Life Practices (WLPs) due
to disruptions caused by a global pandemic. It also looks at
critical lessons learned from the COVID-19 experience, and
the success factors that must be considered for the successful
implementation of WLPs. Most importantly, this report serves as
a roadmap for how Malaysian employers can and must take the
lead in preparing their workforce for the future of work.

This report dovetails with the Government’s focus on uplifting
the wellbeing of Malaysians, through the implementation of
measures and policies which ensure both public and private
sector employees benefit from a range of WLPs including work
from home (WFH) arrangements.

Further, as the agency under the Ministry of Human Resources
(MOHR) tasked to attract, nurture and retain the right quality
and quantity of talent to support Malaysia’s growth, TalentCorp
has actively and consistently advocated for the wider adoption
of Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs) in Malaysia since
2015. TalentCorp’s efforts in this area are also in line with
the Ministry’s agenda to develop a competent, productive,
responsive and resilient national human capital base.

Similarly, UNDP Malaysia’s experience and expertise in
accelerating structural transformations make them an excellent
fit for a collaboration of this nature.

I would like to commend the working group members and
everyone else involved in this project for their contributions
and hard work. With this report, it is my hope that we will see
greater recognition of innovative workplace practices as an
indispensable tool to drive productivity, boost organisational
performance and support the needs and demands of
tomorrow's workers.

Foreword

Resident Representative of
United Nations Development Programme
Malaysia, Singapore & Brunei Darussalam

A long while ago, in 2014, UNDP and the Ministry of Women,
Family, and Community Development published a study on
participation of women in Malaysia’s labour force. Recognising
that a majority of Malaysian women that were not in the
workforce wanted to work but are hindered by caregiving
responsibilities and other barriers, the study laid out a wide
range of recommendations for policy and practice, including
family-friendly work practices, many of which were adopted by
the Government in the 11th Malaysia Plan.

4

In subsequent years, Malaysia has seen a slow growth in the
female labour force participation rate (LFPR), from 53.6% in
2014 to 55.6% in 2019. Much of this rise is attributed to the
urban centres of Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, and Selangor,
where the female LFPR reached 67.7% in 2019. Younger
women are more likely than previous generations to return to
the workforce after taking time away for caregiving.

Unfortunately, a number of emerging signals from the
COVID-19 crisis suggest that the pandemic has threatened
these gains. Almost 100,000 working-age adults left the
workforce in Q1 of 2020, with a majority citing caregiving
and family obligations—reasons that Malaysian women have
historically given for leaving the workplace. By June 2020, the
female LFPR dropped to 55.1%, reversing more than a year’s
worth of progress.

However, the pandemic has also challenged established
norms and created potential for transformation of workplaces.
In a companion publication, How We Worked From Home,
UNDP explored the enforced Work From Home (WFH)
experience in the first two months of the Movement Control
Order (MCO) and found that this real-life experience had
generated large shifts in perceptions and attitudes towards
WFH arrangements, a shift that years of studies and
advocacy could not achieve. And, it showed if employers
and employees can make WFH work, certainly other less
disruptive arrangements can work too. Indeed, there has
been an increased openness to and demand for flexible work
arrangements (FWAs) and other family-friendly work practices.

Following the publication on Malaysia’s WFH experience,
UNDP has collaborated with TalentCorp in a number of events
promoting FWAs and gender equality in the workplace. I
am delighted to further this partnership with the Ministry of
Human Resources through TalentCorp via this report, as we
continue our endeavour to promote a future of work that is
accessible and sustainable for both women and men.

evelopments in our technological,
economic, and societal landscapes
are changing the way we live and work.

Internet and mobile connectivity mean that many jobs
can be done anytime from anywhere. The rise of dual-
income households means that employees are more
likely to shoulder substantial domestic responsibilities
even while holding a full-time job. The way we think
about managing our different spheres of life has
changed accordingly—from the neatly segregated
compartments of “work-life balance” to the fluidity
and flexibility of “work-life integration.” In light of
these shifts, the development of workplace well-being
is prioritized at the national level as a key contributor
to sustained socio-economic development.

At its best, work-life-integration can allow us to better manage
competing responsibilities and schedules. However, it can also
create ambiguity by blurring the boundaries between work and
home life. Therefore, at its worst, it can create an unhealthy
work culture that places undue pressure on employees who
are unable to disconnect from work and face ever increasing
demands on their time. Employers need to proactively
challenge existing models and ways of working to adapt to
current and future trends in order to maintain a healthy and
engaged workforce.

Talent Corporation Malaysia Berhad (TalentCorp) conducted the
Life At Work Survey in 2017 to understand the types of Flexible
Work Arrangements (FWAs) and Work-Life Practices (WLPs)
implemented by employers (Box 2).1 The survey showed a general
lack of awareness and preparation among Malaysian firms for
the future of work. While most firms recognized the benefits of
FWAs and WLPs and have some practices in place, these were
typically not formalized (Figure 2) and often very limited in use.
Implementation of family-friendly practices in particular fell short,
which may contribute to Malaysia’s lower female labour force
participation rate relative to the ASEAN region.2,3

Box 2: Type of WLPs

WLPs comprise of Flexible Work Arrangements, work-life
benefits and family-friendly facilities. These components
are described in detail below.

Box 1: Definitions1

Work-Life Practices (WLPs): Various forms of support for work-
life integration, including leave, support networks, facilities, etc.
This includes Flexible Work Arrangements.

Flexible Work Arrangements (FWAs): Flexibility in the time and
location of work. This includes Work From Home arrangements.

The top 5 FWAs in the Life at Work Survey were:
1. Flexi Hours (48%)
2. Leaving Early From Work (34%)
3. Staggered Hours (22%)
4. Job Sharing (19%)
5. Work-From-Home/Telecommuting (16%)

Work-From-Home (WFH): A subset of FWAs, in which
employees may work remotely some or all of the time.

Flexible Work
Arrangements
are arrangements that aim
to provide greater flexibility
in the following areas:
the workplace, scheduling
of hours worked, number of
hours worked and flexibility
of job roles.

Work-Life Benefits
are company-sponsored
incentives to support
employees in achieving
better work-life integration.

WLPs as a key strategy for addressing workforce
needs of the future (Pre-COVID-19).4

Figure 2: Extent to which WLPs are formalized in policy
by Malaysian employers (Pre-COVID-19).5

The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting Movement Control
Order (MCO) in Malaysia meant that Work-From-Home
(WFH) expectations were forced on both employers and
employees, whether or not they were prepared for it. WFH is
often perceived as one of the most challenging forms of FWAs
to implement. Even though two-thirds (66%) of employers in
Malaysia offer some flexibility in working hours, flexibility in
working location is much lower, with the adoption of WFH
arrangements in 2017 well behind the regional norm (16% vs.
50%).6 This low rate of adoption of WFH could be due to either
a lack of trust in employee productivity or an emphasis on
on-site collaboration and communication.

Despite the disruptive nature of the pandemic and the
unpreparedness of many firms, the UNDP WFH Survey shows
that most employers and employees were able to make WFH
work.7 The large-scale experiment in WFH due to the MCO
has shifted societal perceptions and ignited conversations
about what is feasible and desirable in terms of FWAs.
This experience is not only a proof of concept for FWAs but also
offers lessons for successful implementation. Employers that
are able to learn from this experience and adopt new ways of
working will reap benefits in employee engagement, satisfaction,
and productivity.

This document highlights key lessons from the Life At Work and
WFH surveys and other relevant work by UNDP and TalentCorp
to support implementation of FWAs in Malaysia.

2. Why Embrace FWAs?

Quality of Life and Productivity Benefits

FWAs, when implemented well, can improve both employees’
quality of life (QOL) and productivity. The Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes that
WFH benefits for employees include less time spent commuting,

fewer interruptions, and cost savings—which can translate into
productivity gains and increased engagement.8 Indeed, the 2020
Deloitte Global Human Capital Trends reports that many global
organizations have identified a variety of tactics to redesign
work around well-being including increasing remote work
(WFH) opportunities.9 In Malaysia, the Life At Work Survey
shows that employers cited improving employee's well-being as
the top reason for offering WLPs (76%), followed by improving
workforce productivity (65%) (Figure 3).

Box 3: Key lessons from TalentCorp’s experience in
supporting implementation of FWAs

1. FWAs improve business productivity. Employers that
have implemented some form of FWAs such as WFH
and staggered working hours report increased employee
productivity.

2. Employers can mitigate any perceived risks of FWAs,

such as abuse of flexibility, by piloting FWAs with targeted
employees, i.e. employees with high performance track
record, and women and men with children.

3. Employers implementing FWAs can improve their bottom
line with proper planning, consistent communication
and alignment between line managers and employees.
Flexibility can improve retention, reducing the need to
recruit and train new employees.

4. FWAs benefit not only women, but also men with

children, persons with disabilities (PWDs), millennials,
and even senior hires as flexibility allows for better
work-life integration.

5. Many employers started FWAs with informal practices and
moved to formalize them in workplace policy to ensure
positive impacts and consistency of implementation.

The WFH experience during the MCO confirms the benefits of
FWAs/WFH to employee well-being and productivity. During
the highly disruptive MCO period—a worst-case scenario for
WFH—both employers and employees nonetheless reported
that productivity was maintained or improved (Figure 4).

In the Life At Work Survey, employers perceived that the
employees who would benefit most from WLPs were women
with children, millennials, and people with caregiving
responsibilities (Figure 5). However, the WFH Survey showed
substantial QOL and productivity benefits were experienced
across gender, age, and childcare-giving categories.

In terms of Quality of Life (QOL), men and women childcare
givers were both more likely to report improvements

compared to their non-childcare giver counterparts;
interestingly, men caregivers were reported to experience the
highest benefits (Figure 6). The proportion of women caregivers
was similar to that of men and women non-caregivers to
report improvements in productivity; however, the proportion
of women caregivers that reported declines in productivity
was notably higher (Figure 7)—likely due to the combination
of school and childcare centre closures unique to the MCO.
Employees in the 35-54 age range were more likely than
employees below 35 to report improvements in QOL and
productivity (data not shown), though all groups experienced
net benefits in both categories.

These MCO experiences suggests that FWAs/WFH policies can
improve QOL and productivity for a wide range of employees,
including groups that are not normally prioritized in FWAs.
In addition to offering FWAs to target beneficiaries,
employers can consider incorporating FWAs as a norm
wherever the nature of the job permits. In addition to reaping
the benefits as a result of FWAs, this would also increase
buy-in for FWAs and reduce any stigma employees may face
for using FWAs.

The MCO experience has shifted employee perceptions
about what is possible and preferable in FWAs/WFH
practices. Despite widespread experiences of disruptions and
difficulties in transitioning to WFH during the MCO, a majority of
employees across all age categories reported a positive shift
in opinion toward WFH arrangements, with older employees
having the largest positive shifts (Figure 8). Almost 80% of
employees would like to WFH at least weekly, with almost half
preferring to WFH three or more days a week (Figure 9).

These shifts in perceptions toward WFH are changing
employees’ expectations of their employers. Employers appear
to be responding to these expectations, with 61% of employee
respondents to the WFH Survey reporting that their employers
already have, were considering, or may consider long-term
WFH arrangements.

Employees with childcare responsibilities were more likely
than their non-childcare giver counterparts to report that their
employers were actively considering WFH arrangements.
However, women were less optimistic than men about
employer openness to WFH; this may reflect worries by women
employees that they might face career penalties for making use
of policies on WFH or FWAs. In addition, single women were the
most likely to report that their workplaces are not suitable for
WFH arrangements or that their employers would not consider
WFH outside of emergencies (Figure 10).

Although large enterprises have historically been more likely
to offer WFH arrangements, in the WFH survey, employee
perception of employer openness to WFH practices was high
regardless of employer size (Figure 11). Similarly, although
higher-skilled and higher-income workers have historically
been much more likely to receive WFH accommodations,
the correlation between income and employee perceptions
of employer openness to WFH was small (Figure 12). These
findings signal a widespread shift in expectations. In the
Life At Work Survey, 64% of employers cited the retention of
high-performing employees as the reason for WLPs; however,
the increase in demand for such arrangements now appears
to be part of the new normal.

3. How Do We Get There?

Employer Spotlight

Employers are responding to the changes in employee
expectations and the lessons learned from the COVID-19
experience. Based on TalentCorp’s engagements with
employers, many employers are adopting a WFH Hybrid Model
—with employees working from home on a rotating basis.
Similarly, TalentCorp has seen an increase of organizations
seeking guidance on formalizing their WFH policies. There
are many alternative forms of WFH arrangements and
FWAs, providing viable and effective options for all types of
organizations across all sectors. Several major ingredients are
necessary for FWAs, including WFH arrangements, to work well.

Trust-based working time arrangements (TBW) are a
pre-requisite to WFH arrangements20 and many other FWAs.
TBW does not refer to blind trust, but a shift from monitoring
employee inputs (e.g. facetime in the office, perceived
concentration on work) to employee outputs (e.g. quantity
and quality of deliverables). When employers insist on
scrutinizing employees who make use of FWAs through
monitoring software or demanding the employees always
have their video cameras on, employees will experience
stress, feel penalized for using FWAs, and will be demotivated
by the lack of professionalism and trust.

Box 4: Recommendations for creating policies for FWAs

• Consider piloting FWAs with smaller groups of employees
to learn what works and what does not. An informal phase
allows for easier adjustments as you find what works for
your organization.

• Set and communicate the criteria about eligibility for various
FWAs according to the needs of job roles. Be innovative
and creative as technology will revolutionize business
practices and change the way employees perform tasks.

• Rethink how employee engagement and productivity is
assessed. Managing employees on outputs can be far
more productive than managing employees based on
the physical presence of “time in the office.” Establish
and communicate how productivity will be assessed
based on outcomes and quantifiable metrics.

• Set clear expectations of work hours, duties, obligations,

and applicable policies such as code of conduct,
health & safety, and IT and data protection.

• Performance issues stemming from FWAs should be

discussed openly between employees and managers.
Employers may revise, modify or suspend any employees’
FWAs to ensure employees are able to meet business and
operational requirements. However, this should not be done
lightly as an organizational culture supportive of FWAs is
necessary for its long-term success. Abuse of FWAs should
be addressed at an individual level if possible, rather than
through widespread withdrawal of FWAs.

Buy-in and support for FWAs are necessary at all levels.
According to the Life at Work Survey, the top factor supporting
the adoption and implementation of WLPs was support and
focus from top management.

However, this alone is not sufficient, as employers of various
sectors and sizes also agreed that successful implementation
also requires supporting values and belief within the
organizational culture and for middle management to adopt
a mindset that values flexibility. Top management will need
to clearly articulate the value of FWAs to the organization, be
involved in addressing implementation issues, and monitor
adoption of FWAs to ensure they are being promoted and used.

Closely related to creating workplace buy-in for FWAs is
the need for inclusivity in design and implementation.
As discussed above, results from the WFH Survey suggest
that women are more likely than men to perceive career risks
in asking for FWAs/WFH accommodations. The survey also
showed that while 83% of employers reported that they have or
would introduce WFH policies (Figure 13), a much smaller group
have active plans to make WFH accommodations for PWDs
and caregivers (Figure 14). To ensure inclusivity, employers
should prioritize employees with clear needs for FWAs, not
just “high-value” employees, in planning policies on FWAs.
However, FWAs also need be made available and promoted to
as wide a range of employees as possible, so that those who
use FWAs do not need to worry about facing career penalties
for being outside of the organizations’ work culture norms.

Finally, employers need to provide clear and well thought-out
policies that support use of FWAs. The WFH Survey shows
that those who received technical support (i.e. guidance
on work policies and telecommunications platforms) had the
highest productivity gains during the MCO (Figure 15). Without
clear guidelines, there will be mismatches of expectations and
supervisors may intrude upon employee boundaries. Indeed,
during the MCO WFH experience, many employees reported
that they were expected to be available and working well
outside of normal work hours, turning flexibility into a burden.
Likewise, material support (e.g. laptops, internet connectivity,
home office furniture) may be necessary for FWAs, especially
for WFH arrangements. Without adequate material support,

employees either have to bear the costs of work to make use of
FWAs or forego them altogether. Failure to provide appropriate
and adequate support will lower morale and undermine the
benefits of FWAs/WFH arrangements.

When these practices are implemented well, FWAs can
generate substantial benefits for employers and employees
alike, as observed in TalentCorp’s work with a wide range
of organizations across many sectors under its flexWorkLife
initiative (Box 5). These practices also increase organizational
resilience and adaptivity to workplace disruptions and
enforced WFH due to ebbs and surges in the present
COVID-19 pandemic.

This check-and-balance approach contributed to a 'win-win'
situation, where the organization recorded an impressive 73%
employee engagement score in 2014.

4. How Do We Get There?

Employee Spotlight

As employers extend FWAs, there are practices that can help
employees to make the most of FWAs for work-life integration.
Here are some of the most important practices:

Just as employers need to adopt and adapt to WLPs to adjust
the way they demonstrate productivity, a TBW approach works
best when employees take ownership and initiative for their
work. Employees will need to focus on outputs and outcomes,
and to manage their work time and priorities accordingly.

Communication with supervisors and co-workers is important
for FWAs. Employees will need to be aware of office norms
on when and how to communicate, especially when
co-workers may be on different schedules or working off-site.
Developing familiarity with digital communication tools will likely
be necessary. Employers will need to hear from employees
about the support, practices, and schedules that they need, in
order to be efficient while using FWAs. Both sides will need to
engage in constructive dialogue to find good solutions.

Employees with children at home undertaking substantial
WFH need to apply ground rules, so that their children
understand that they are working. If at all practical, create
a dedicated Work-From-Home space. If both spouses have
FWAs/WFH arrangements, equitable arrangements for
domestic responsibilities is critical to allow both parties to work
effectively.

It is important for employees to be familiar with employer
policies on FWAs and follow them. These policies not only
keep employees accountable, but also set limits that help
maintain boundaries between work and non-work spheres of
life. Employees should respect co-workers’ FWAs and should
also be clear about when they are and are not available.
This will help to ensure that FWAs enable work-life integration,
and do not to disrupt productivity, while still contributing to
employee well-being.

Box 5: Success Stories in FWAs from Leading
Organizations in Malaysia Across Various Sectors

Engineering Manufacturing Sector

Organization A launched a “Work-From-Home” programme
to encourage and promote a sense of greater work-life
integration amongst employees as well as to improve
employee engagement and retention.

This programme provides employees with the alternative
of working in their preferred working conditions away from
the office one day a week, with secured access to the
company’s server.

Since its implementation, the organization has been reaping
the benefits resulting in improvements in employee
engagement survey scores as well as improved attrition
rates from 14% in 2011 to 6.5% in 2015.

Manufacturing Sector

Organization B practices several FWAs that include the
creation of hybrid flexible work schedules, remote work or
connected work model, and flexible time-off options, both
formal and informal. These FWAs were offered to several
departments including teams supporting regional/global
clients, those leading regional/global teams or running
regional/global projects, support teams—where FWAs
make the most sense and enabled the most productivity
from employees.

The organization conducted an annual employee survey,
and found that 92% of employees surveyed felt that their
leadership team has given the flexibility needed for
work-life integration.

Software and IT Sector

Organization C has a vast array of FWAs from compressed
workweeks to shift swapping, all of which require a
conversation between the employee and his/her manager
to ensure that the selected FWAs practice is in the best
interests of both parties.

Such checks and balances put in place allowed the
organization to successfully implement FWAs, and keep
employee engagement high.

Information and Technology Sector

Organization D adopts a risk mitigating approach when it
comes to certain FWAs such as reduced/part-time work.
Their FWAs are only eligible to employees who have
demonstrated good performance and track record and
have shown the ability to work without close supervision.
