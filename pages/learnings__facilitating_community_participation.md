## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

How might third-party actors support local communities facing environmental challenges without creating dependency complexes and behaviour  

&gt; Utilization of human resources within communities of initial interventions and ‘train the trainer’ schemes ensure champions of interventions are primarily from communities affected by such interventions.  

How can communities be sensitised to environmental issues whilst being given the autonomy and freedom to accept or reject action on such issues   

&gt; Successful sensitisation of a real issue does not always lead to community action of such issue. As community resources are finite and action is also influenced other socio-economic priorities. Thus, lack of community action does not mean community sensitisation has failed.  

What processes can be put in place to ensure the objectives of third-party environmental interventions are aligned with the actual desires and interests of communities?  

&gt; Community monitoring and dialogue sessions are key processes to bringing to the surface the primary desires and interests of communities. Specifically dialogue sessions focused on critical reflection, utilizing non-traditional pedagogical approaches such as theatre, music and art.  

What (new) social contracts need to be in place between communities, community leaders, civil society institutions for community ownership of environmental interventions to occur 

&gt; Mandates and responsibility of community members to take primary action to both mitigate and adapt to environmental changes (across socio-economic dimensions) need to be established in replacement of inaction in the face of the  ‘natural phenomenon’ of environmental change.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

The Accelerator Lab will publish mapped solutions into a digital solutions catalogue. 

The Accelerator lab will work with UNDP GEF-SGP to design mechanisms to ensure catalogued community participation/ownership solutions are positioned to be adopted by grantee organisations of the SGP and utilised in the future implementation of SGP projects.
