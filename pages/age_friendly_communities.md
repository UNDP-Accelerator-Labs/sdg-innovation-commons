In order for specific communities to “work” to enable people of all ages to thrive -- including older adults -- every feature should be analyzed through the lens of aging. It doesn’t matter if there is a wonderful community center if there are no roads to reach it. Age Friendly Communities are guided by public-private councils of all the entities touching the lives of older adults. They conduct a comprehensive assessment of needs and desires through community consultations with older adults (using the WHO framework) and then audit the community through the lens of the needs identified. The council identifies top priority needs, and then encourages the partners to work together to fill them, offering seed funding to fill top priority gaps. This is a strategy to coordinate and integrate public and private sector strategies to meet locally-identified needs to successfully age in place.
