## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Anticipatory Governance in the Pacific Context  
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

How do we conceptualize and concretize anticipatory governance notably through the formulation of a rigorous framework and strategy to land the concept in the UNDP-Pacific context? 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The COVID-19 pandemic and Climate Change presents small island developing states in the Pacific with challenges to their existence and survival.  The pandemic has re-defined the international system, mobility, human relation, development, at an unprecedented magnitude, speed, and intensity. For the Pacific, the global COVID-19 pandemic is a tragedy within a tragedy, one that exacerbates the already vulnerable economies grappled by climate change, population growth, and economic pressures on their natural resources.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

COVID-19 is thought of as a black swan event but in reality, had been forecasted before but not acted on. It showed that our systems are fragile and need to be robust for the future.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Foresight is guiding UN and UNDP strategy. It is also a key component of the planning processes followed by SPC and PIFS – regional agencies who are doing consultations to future proof their strategy.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The experiment will add to:  a.       Designing key pillars of what should constitute an anticipatory governance process and framework to ensure shared understanding and starting points in the anticipatory governance space b.       Identifying insight points from current and previous initiatives that might feed into a UNDP anticipatory governance approach, including language and approaches that translate conceptual approaches to actionable steps c.       Identifying potential landing points of anticipatory governance within governance policy making and strategy cycles d.       Analyzing how shifting to long term and anticipatory thinking might influence different policy outcomes in the different Pacific contexts and which policy and programmatic options now might benefit from a shift to this approach e.       Conducting / supporting horizon scanning to inform the subject/policy areas

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Can anticipatory action help future proof governance initiatives? Acclab Pacific is finding ways to engage policymakers to use foresight in development planning.

Piloted a participatory futures methodology with PIANGO – Pacific Islands Association of Non-Governmental Organizations. As part of UNDP’s ongoing support, UNDP facilitated two-part foresight exercise in the PIANGO group retreat in December – one on anticipatory futures to elicit thinking on the future of civil society with focus on consensus building, and other to translate the vision into ideas for PIANGO’s strategy development as well as joint actions with UNDP’s Public Finance Management project over next five years.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How might we use futures tool to capture local narratives and utilize them in the design of future development which is inclusive, equitable and locally contextualized?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Ethnography  will entail telling richly detailed stories that will contribute to the understanding of social life related to post-covid- recovery world. It will offer a means of studying groups whose stories might not otherwise have been told. Co-creation and participatory design will help build interventions which are more aligned with community goals.  Solutions mapping will help bring to the fore solutions that the community is already utilizing and implementing. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Social network / media data will give us a sense of global narrative in the Pacific diaspora and also communities Ethnographic data, participatory observation and in-depth interviews will bring forth issues of the communities.

Foresight and future analysis will help understand interventions which need to be done in the present for the community. Design sprints will help develop potential interventions which can be implemented. Collective Intelligence and sensemaking will be used to gather all available data to understand best path forward for the country / community
