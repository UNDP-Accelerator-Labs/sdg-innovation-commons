## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Kunzang Wangmo 

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

19 July 2024

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Open innovation challenge and crowd sourcing for local solutions. 

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Supporting local innovators to support an inclusive innovation ecosystem 

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

Will the city bus app help address traffic congestion in the capital? Is there an behavioral change towards an increase use of the public transportation system incase a mobile app is designed to provide real time alerts on the whereabouts of the bus?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Private Sector

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

The City Bus Office

Thimphu Municipality 

Bus commuters 
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuly.**

> Hypothesis: IF... THEN....

If commuters had information on city bus schedule and is reliable then they will choose to travel with public transport. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> What is the object being tested?

We tested the Gakyid Ride mobile application and its different features namely 1) GPS to broadcast live location  2) community crowdsourcing option where commuters can share location of their phones and consequently of the bus and others and 3) both GPS and community crowdsourcing. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity?



two months 

> Describe the methodology of the experimental activity. For example, sample size and selection; data collection technique; collaboration; randomization technique; data analysis technique

Multivariate testing method was adopted to test the prototype. Six enumerators were hired and sample size was 120 commuters out of 9000 daily commuters in Thimphu City. 

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the resources required for this experiment?

1. Accelerators labs expertise in terms of identifying the idea/local solution, to test the prototype and to connect with partners and agencies   2.  Governance cluster's policy intervention to include the innovative idea in their CPD and workplan for scale up as part of digitization 3. An appetite from government agencies to give an opportunity to local innovators  4. Timely as Thimphu City introduced 27 additional buses and now we have total of 45 buses in Thimphu City in BHutan

## Review
**This section includes observations by peer reviewers**
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> What were the key results?



Commuters preferred GPS over the Community Crowdsourcing feature  which enabled app users to see the exact location of the bus. This also influenced their decisions to choose public transport over other mode of transportation.  

> What were the key insights of this experiment?

Around 60 percent of the city bus service users are students  and out of the 40 percent mostly were uneducated. Educated commuters were found to be young university graduates availing training/courses in the city.  "Word of mouth" was found to be the best advocacy medium as commuters preferred to walk up to the bus stops and ask conductors about the bus schedule. 

> Any observations about the methodology?

None 

> Time it took to implement

6 months to get the buy in from relevant partners. 

> Any additional comments?

Sought support from senior management and operation colleagues since this was the first time working with local innovators and implementing local solutions.
