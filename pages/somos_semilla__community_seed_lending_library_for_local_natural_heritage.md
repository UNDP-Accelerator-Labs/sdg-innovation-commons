SOMOS SEMILLA is a Community Seed Library that aims to offer the community access to seeds of crop varieties adapted to local conditions. The Library works on a “loan-return” system, provides education, and plays an important long-term role in our environment, as it safeguards our legacy generation after generation.

The initiative was born as a call from SOL SMA (A Sustainable, Organic, and Local Food Network) to the community of San Miguel de Allende to strengthen knowledge about seed conservation. The current coordinators, Jennifer Ungemach and Soledad Saburido, met at one of these meetings in February 2015, and agreed, along with other members of the community, to start a Seed Lending Library. The Library operates primarily with volunteers.
