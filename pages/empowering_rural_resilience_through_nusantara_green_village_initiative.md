> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



The development of Nusantara (the newly built capital city of Indonesia) has so far concentrated primarily in the core development area, leaving a significant gap in village development and rural resilience. Rural communities around IKN continue to face challenges (such as limited access to water and energy) which hampers agricultural and livestock productivity. Without adequate interventions, these challenges could be exacerbated by the influx of new residents, leading to increased income inequality, economic disparity, and potential conflicts over limited resources.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Indonesia is relocating its capital to Nusantara (IKN), situated in East Kalimantan and covers approximately 256,142 hectares of land and a marine area of 68,189 hectares.[1] It consists of three key development zones: the Central Government Core Area (KIPP), the Nusantara Capital City Region (KIKN), and the Nusantara Capital City Development Region (KP-IKN)—encompassing 51 administrative regions across six districts and 11 villages.

Although Nusantara aspires to become a sustainable forest city, its development has predominantly focused on the Central Government Core Area, leaving the surrounding rural areas underserved and persistently face challenges such as insufficient access to water and energy. If left unaddressed, these issues could intensify with the anticipated influx of new residents, potentially widening income inequality and deepening economic disparities.

To address this concern, the Deputy of Green and Digital Transformation of Nusantara Capital City Authority (OIKN) is planning some projects for the villages around the IKN area, including one known as Green Village, to bring the green and sustainability aspects to the IKN rural development. In particular, the IKN Green Village project aspires to promote cross-sectoral resilience initiatives encompassing various areas, including clean energy, clean water supply, sustainable agriculture, waste management, and green jobs for the IKN local communities. At the moment, these cross-sectoral initiatives are still at the planning level. 

In 2023, UNDP signed an MoU with the OIKN to develop joint initiatives for inclusive development, reinforcing the new capital's guiding principles. As a follow-up to the MoU, and in line with our shared commitment towards building a more equitable, resilient, and sustainable future, UNDP Indonesia, including through its Accelerator Lab, will further expand our partnership with OIKN in Green and Digital Transformation, particularly related to the IKN Green Village. The IKN Green Village initiative also serves as a continuation of the IKN Voluntary Local Review (VLR), a joint initiative among UNDP, UNESCAP, UN RCO and OIKN in 2023, to track the IKN’s commitment to the SDGs and the 2030 agenda, as well as ensure that the capital city is consistent to its vision.

Existing rural communities in IKN still encounter challenges around access to water and energy, which have implication on agricultural productivity and livelihoods / food security.

• Air temperature in Kalimantan has been getting drier in the 1991-2020 period – expected to extend to East Kalimantan in 2021-2050. Some areas in East Kalimantan go 20 to 60 days without rain.

• In most areas within Kalimantan, the Drought Hazard Index (DHI) range from moderate to high and very high.

• It is estimated that IKN population will reach 488,409 between 2022-2024 and 1.28 million between 2025-2029. This figure is projected to continue to grow and reach 1.9 million people by 2040-2045.

Without adequate intervention, existing issues faced by rural communities can be exacerbated by the influx of new residents, potentially leading to increased income inequality and economic divide.

The elements of intervention in the Fostering Rural Resilience through Nusantara Green Village Initiative are grounded in the insights gathered from a comprehensive community needs assessment conducted by the Accelerator Lab in Argo Mulyo Village. This assessment highlighted the specific needs, challenges, and opportunities faced by prospective beneficiaries of the IKN Green Village project. Key findings include:

- Agriculture: farmers struggle with limited access to fertilizers, compounded by prohibitively high fertilizer prices. Additionally, there is a notable lack of interest among the youth in pursuing farming as a livelihood, posing a challenge to the sector's sustainability.

- Water access: the community faces severe water shortages, exacerbated by climate change and increasingly unpredictable rainy seasons, which hinder both household and agricultural activities.

- Waste management: the absence of a local garbage disposal system has led to the accumulation of unmanaged waste, negatively impacting sanitation, public health, and the local environment.

These findings underline the critical need for targeted interventions to address these pressing challenges while also leveraging opportunities for sustainable development. Solutions such as promoting organic farming practices, introducing water-saving technologies, and implementing community-driven waste management systems will be integral to ensuring long-term resilience and sustainability.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



The learning question for this challenge is "how can we effectively empower rural communities in the Nusantara region to adopt sustainable agriculture and waste management practices, while simultaneously safeguarding the environment?"

To work on this challenge, we need to understand:

- The specific barriers rural communities face in adopting sustainable agriculture and waste management practices.

- What factors influence the long-term sustainability and scalability of these practices in rural settings.

- The potential impact of environmental factors, such as water scarcity and climate change, on the adoption of sustainable practices.

- How to integrate inclusive development strategies that address the needs of marginalized groups, such as women and youth, within rural communities.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



UNDP Accelerator Lab leverages ethnography to gain deep, contextual insights into the local challenges and opportunities faced by rural communities in Nusantara. By observing and interacting with local residents, farmers, and community leaders, the team can better understand the cultural and socio-economic factors that influence the adoption of sustainable agriculture and waste management practices. This method allows for capturing the nuances of local practices and behaviors that might not be immediately visible through conventional data collection methods. Situational Awareness is also necessary to understand the ongoing  environmental and socio-economic challenges and needs in the region, particularly regarding the water-energy-food (WEF) nexus and waste management practices.

System thinking helps us to map out the interconnectedness between agriculture, water access, and energy, as well as waste management -- enabling the development of integrated solutions for community's resilience and sustainable future. Finally, partnerships with local authorities, organizations like Ecoxyztem, and other stakeholders will help to pool resources, knowledge, and expertise, creating a more comprehensive approach to sustainable development.

These methods and tools collectively enrich the initiative by providing a holistic and adaptable approach to solving the complex challenges faced by rural communities in Nusantara.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The diverse data sources allow us to address the complexities of the rural challenges from multiple angles, adding greater depth and relevance to the learning question and ultimately supporting more effective and inclusive solutions. Traditional data collection methods often overlook the social dynamics and local knowledge that shape the effectiveness of sustainable practices. The participatory and collective approach ensures that we are not only gathering data but also involving the community in the data collection process, which increases the ownership and applicability of the solutions. Additionally, by integrating official government data with community-level insights, combining the quantitative and qualitative insights, we can fill gaps related to policy alignment and resource allocation. 
## Closing
