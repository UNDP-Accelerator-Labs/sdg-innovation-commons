## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

How can we spread resilient strategies to transform rural communities?


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to devise a plan or experiment on the transfer of grass root solutions we found practiced by Positive deviant villagers to other areas either to Negative villages or average categories. 



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The challenges is a continuation of the previous work we did on the data powered positive deviance pilot. The idea behind it was to find communities in rural areas in Somalia (especially the northern part) who were able through their own strategies, efforts to

We have done last year around 3 field visits where we collected different qualitative data on the positive, negative and average villages.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Droughts are a consistent occurrence in Somalia and from the start of our work on the challenge in 2020 while we worked on the qualitative part of the study we another drought hit by the end of 2021. This work if one right might be an answer if scaled correctly to change eat systems of adaptation towards droughts. 



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP paves the way towards climate adaptation through the scaling of positive grass roots solutions.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can we design a scale up of (grass root solutions) or combination of solutions in such a way that we will change the health of rangelands in drought susceptible countries such as Somalia?



> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

All these methods will be used to design a scale up plan for the grass roots solutions we found. 



> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There will always be gaps but at this moment nothing comes to mind. 


## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This work will be part of our plan to re-engineer the how communities adapt to climate change. During the scale-up plan we will be using multiple villages as initial peer groups then use these peer groups to
