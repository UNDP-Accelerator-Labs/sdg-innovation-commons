RESIN8 represents a near and long-term environmentally friendly solution where the plastic industry waste stream becomes the raw material and value stream for the construction and building industry. This technological solution represents circularity in action, where the concrete is eventually recycled at the end of its useful life. RESIN8 accepts any type of plastic waste (Resins 1-7), diverting it away from landfills or incineration. Plastic waste materials are converted into RESIN8, a visually benign lightweight Eco-Aggregate, which meets the needs of the construction industry while also extending the productive use of plastic waste. The unique thermal properties of RESIN8 make it an effective building insulation product, which contributes to the reduction of building energy use, and thus improves climate resiliency, and supports net-zero goals over time through accumulated energy savings. There is no leaching, abrasion, or micro-plastic release after utilization in concrete. As a recycled product, RESIN8, is fully circular at the end of its concrete life. It can be crushed and re-used and has a low embodied energy production footprint.

INTRODUCING RESIN8™ – CRDC Global

RESIN8 is the only material from plastic waste to improve the performance of structural concrete products and earn acceptance from the construction industry. Concrete applications using RESIN8 exceed ASTM standards which are the international benchmark for material performance. RESIN8 has been tested to demonstrate an increase in compression strength, flexibility, fire resistance, thermal resistance and acoustic properties. It can be used in structural* or non-structural* concrete applications, and “poured in place” concrete.

This solution is quite relevant for Samoa and is being implemented under the CERO waste project. In Samoa, with landfills at its full capacity, plastic is already leaking in the ocean. Also, sand mining for construction is another environmental concern. This solution not only provides a viable option for recycling plastic, it is also providing alternative for reducing sand use in construction.
