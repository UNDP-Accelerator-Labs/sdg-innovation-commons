> Title of the innovation

The effects of not using catalytic converters in automobiles

> Brief description of the innovation

My Innovation concerns not only the Zambian republican people but also most African Countries. 
Almost 3 quarters of automobiles in Zambia are running without catalytic converters due to the demand of them by recycling companies. Automobile owners have been selling catalytic converters from their machines as there hasn't been a law stopping them from doing so. 
Not using Catalytic converters has fatal healthy consequences.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The value of this innovation to the environment is reduction of global warming, having a healthy environment and the prevention of so many diseases and conditions like cancer, weak immune systems against pandemics like the Corona virus.
It should illegal for an automobile to move without a catalytic converter. Most people do not really know or understand the consequences of removing Catalytic converters. Hence, we ought to educate others about this and  save many lives by doing so. 
As we start a new chapter and developing our country, we shall no longer need to make money in ways that we put the public at risk.

Platinum, palladium, rhodium, alumina, and rare-earth-based materials which enhance catalytic activity are very expensive metals that are used this process and this should really show us why a catalytic converter is so important to an automobile.

> Technical Feasibility

Laws are to be put up against such acts or if there's any, there will be a need of serious implementation. 
A very fair Grace period is to be given to automobile owners to restore their catalytic converters before such laws are implementation though because it has not been all their fault as the health sector of this country is supposed to be aware of such things. And the level of education about catalytic converters and their importance.
And a program for educating people about Catalytic converters is to be launched as soon as possible.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Looking into this matter and implementation this plan won't only save lives but it will also save a lot of money being spent on medication being bought to treat illnesses caused by by the dangerous end products of fossil fuels will be greatly reduced. A very good research will be done as it will show the many illnesses being caused by this and how to avoid them.
