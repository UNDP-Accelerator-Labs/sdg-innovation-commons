Montserrat, often referred to as “The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean” and known for its breathtaking natural wonders and vistas, is boldly embarking on a journey towards a digitally empowered future. In February, the island hosted a pivotal workshop building upon the recently concluded United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Digital Readiness Assessment (DRA), a survey-based tool used to provide rapid, high-level insights into a country’s digital strengths and opportunities across infrastructure, government, regulation, business and people. This DRA initiative is a collaborative effort between the UNDP Accelerator Lab for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, UNDP’s Chief Digital Office, and the Government of Montserrat, which aims to chart a course for the island's digital transformation.

Participants engaged in insightful discussions, mapping the challenges that impede progress across various sectors, including the economy, government, and society. Through these discussions, a shared vision for Montserrat's digital landscape began to emerge.

A key highlight of the workshop was the exploration of A.I.'s potential in transforming various sectors on the island. Participants engaged in a thought-provoking exercise, identifying potential applications of A.I. in tourism and other key areas. While recognizing the immense possibilities, participants also acknowledged the challenges, including budget constraints, the need for capacity building, and the importance of ensuring equitable access to A.I. technologies.The workshop concluded with a visioning exercise, where participants, armed with the insights gained throughout the event, outlined a future where Montserrat thrives as a digitally empowered island. They brought their visions to life through compelling, AI-generated images - showcasing a future where technology seamlessly integrates with the island's natural beauty and rich cultural heritage.
