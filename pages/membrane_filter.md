Description: ROAMfilter Plus is a diaphragm filter with an intuitive design in the form of a bicycle pump. The filter cartridge has pores of size 0.02 μm. It is used by holding it with the feet and pumping with the handle to pass the water from the source through the filter and to the integrated tap. It can also be used in a gravity-driven installation. The device weighs 4.2 kg.  

Interesting features: The filtration flow rate is quite high compared to other filters. In addition, it is easy to transport to distant communities.
