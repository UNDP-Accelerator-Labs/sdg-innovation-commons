> Title of the innovation

Bubotu School

> Brief description of the innovation

Bubotu School is a project that I intend to establish in Simukanka village of Choma district in Southern Province of Zambia. I have not yet drawn a plan but I hope to use my paper that I have uploaded to get the project started once funds are available. 
This school will be running from Pre-grade to Grade 7. This is so as to accommodate most of the less privileged children in my village to attain quality education at a lower cost as opposed to those around. It will also assist teachers that are not employed by government to find employment.  I look forward to having 400 children and about 12 teachers.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This school will help the community by shortening the distance to school for the children and equipment them with quality education in a rural setup. Not only that, it will serve as a partner for the government in teacher employment to alleviate poverty in the country. 
On the part of income generation, the school will be dealing in poutry facing where we will be keeping village chicken and also venture into crop farming. Through this, we hope to have money which will cushion the little fees learners will be paying so that all the projects can be running.

> Technical Feasibility

The school will have two by three (2x3) classroom blocks, an ublution block, a hall, kitchen, staff room and two offices. Additionally,  it will have two store rooms. I hope to build it through donor funds by using local builders in a period of 18 months.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Knowing that education is a right for every child, this project will help people in my community by accommodating children who are less privileged.  This will in turn lead to an educated society and improved livelihoods.  This project is relevant in the sense that my village is lacking schools and many children are not learning due to high cost of school fees and distance to nearby schools. Therefore,  Bubotu School will really play a pivotal role in Simukanka village.
