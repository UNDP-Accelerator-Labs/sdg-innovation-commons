> Brief description of the innovation

Dotolo is a mobile app where users can easily find the closest available Doctors, Hospitals/Medical Facilites or Pharmacies at anytime of the day in one place. Dotolo has a real-time map which shows from actual location of the user through gps then shows the user available Doctors, Hospitals/Medical Facilites closest to them.
Dotolo is a mobile app both on Android and IOS devices where an end user can find:
1. Doctors near them and seek professional medical advice through chat, voice call/videocall and scheduling appointments.
2. Closest/Nearest hospitals or medical facilities of specific services
3. Online medicines to purchase which can be delivered to their doorstep.
Dotolo has a special mobile app for doctors and another for Pharmacies which makes them directly communicate with the users. The users can request a prescription and the doctors can issue prescriptions to purchase medicines on the app. The Doctors, Hospitals/Medical facilities and Pharmacies register for the app through the Dotolo Physical Office and only when approved by the Ministry of Health as official health practitioners will they appear on the platform. Doctors, Hospitals/Medical facilities and Pharmacies generate a revenue from users, hence making extra income for themselves. Delivery personnel also go through a training and testing on how to carry certain drugs to the user after an order is complete. Dotolo is having all your health care in your reach through your phone at all times.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will generate income for;
1. Me and my team through monthly subscriptions of the listed doctors, medical facilities/hospitals and Pharmacies.
2. Doctors when the users seek professional advice, set appointments, request prescriptions or treatment.
3. Pharmacies when the end users purchase the medicines.
4. Delivery persons when the end user requires delivery of bought medicines.
5. Hospitals and Medical Facilities when user requests appointment or treatment
This innovation will assist in improving the operations of existing hospitals/doctors by having clients seek professional medical advice/treatment from the comfort of their home and if need arises, a doctor or ambulance can be sent to the exact location of the patient thereby reducing on movement of people during this (Covid) pandemic to hospitals/medical facilities. It will give people quicker and easier access to professional medical help at any time of the day. My target market is anyone who is 18 and above who is seeking medical care and has a smartphone with internet. The challenge prize will help in developing the app fully for both Android and IOS, paying for reliable payment gateways, it will help in paying for hosting servers and app distribution on all possible app stores. The challenge prize will also help us create a database with the Ministry of Health of authorized and valid medical practitioners, medical facilities and pharmacies.

> Technical Feasibility

DOTOLO is designed to work work on all smartphones with internet capabilities both on Android and IOS devices. The end users will be able to download the app for free from all app distribution stores like Google playstore, Apple app Store, Huawei store and many other third-party app galleries. The app user interface is created on a flutter framework with dart language which uses one code base for both Android and IOS devices hence reduces time on development cycle. The back-end development is with Laravel and admin development with Angular. This innovation is designed to have 4 apps and 1 admin panel as follows;
1. User App
2. Doctors App
3. Pharmacy App
4. Delivery App
5. Admin Portal
All apps and components are designed to work together seamlessly

> Anticipated Social Impact

DOTOLO is perceived to have a positive social impact because our main focus is delivering healthcare to people in the most affordable and convenient manner. This innovation is relevant to the current market in because of the following reasons;
1. This innovation will encourage people to be to be more inclined to requesting help from professionals than self medicating without professional advice. 
2. With the current pandemic, users will be more comfortable being attended to from their homes in minor cases than moving about to medical facilities of which most are handling covid cases. 
3. This innovation will cut down on the time wasted waiting for a medical facility to be open or pharmacies for users to buy prescribed medicines. 
4. Appropriate advice can be sought on how to handle a patient prior to going to the hospital or before a Doctor or Ambulance arrives thereby saving lives.
5. It will create works for Doctors who are not in formal employment but are qualified thereby adding on to economic growth.
