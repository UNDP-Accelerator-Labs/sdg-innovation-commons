[[ai_summary:Ali Muntasir, Head of Experimentation at Accelerated Lab Sudan, discussed a partnership model aimed at creating food security and employment opportunities in Sudan. The model involved a closed-loop triangle of finance, production, and consumption among cooperatives and private sector companies. After understanding the system's issues, including middlemen controlling prices and ignoring consumers' needs, Ali and his team conducted research with stakeholders, including farmers, consumers, and financiers. They leveraged community finance, informal sector money, and microfinance to create a triangle of financing producers, who sell to consumers, who can then sell excess produce to neighboring communities. The model was institutionalized through contracts between stakeholders, and the country office supported the experiment, although not heavily involved initially. The experiment used an AB testing style, with one group receiving full knowledge of the partnership model and another group not being informed of its benefits or challenges.]]

# Sudan's Innovative Partnership Model for Food Security and Employment Generates Impact.

### [[0:07]] Yeah, tell me your full name, your full title and say I give consent to this recording\.

My name is Ali Muntasir and I'm Head of experimentation of Accelerated Lab Sudan and I give consent for this recording over to you for the R&D questions\.

### [[0:25]] So good morning, Ali\. How you doing today?

Good, good\.

### [[0:29]] It's a pleasure to be interviewing you\. So you know I'm thrilled to know some very kind of experimentations and I wanted to know more about your R&D activity\. So could you tell me about an R&D activity you would like to share?

[[skills:Partnerhsip coordination]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
Yes, thank you so much for the opportunity\. I would like to share an R&D activity that we've done back in 2021 and it was around a partnership model\. Or will you consider an innovative partnership model where we brought finance, production and consumption or consumption in a triangle on a closed loop for cooperatives and for the private sector to work together in order for us to create food security and to also enhance employment opportunities within these communities\. So the partnership model was based on, we all know that there is a public private partnership, but we wanted to kind of gain more of a community inside the community partnership\. So private sector and the community having worked together in order for them to create impact\. So this was the idea of the R&D genre that I would like to share and where this idea came from\. The idea came from there is we'd have a sort of an issue in Sudan which is that people are not connected, markets are not connected to each other in a sense\. There is also a domination for the market from certain Realtors certain what we'd call what's the word for, for it, we call them an Arabic samsar, but in but they're like they're like real estate agents or but these are for buildings, but these are agents that control markets for food, for goods and for essential goods\. And these is why we kind of tried to tackle this issue\.

### [[2:43]] OK, so this was a development issue you were addressing, I guess\. And how was the first step? Where did you start?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:Design]]
So I think we first we needed to understand the system\. We needed to kind of do a sense making exercise to kind of understand why how the market works and, and, and what are the issues in the market\. And we found out that one of the main issues is that when farmers produce foods, whether they're crops or vegetables or horticulture, they tend to not sell it directly into the market or to Realtors or to shops\. They actually sell it into someone in between and, and these and this in between it\. What they do is basically they take the production from the farmers in a very low price and they kind of store it and then they kind of control the prices of the market\. So they can jump those prices or they can reduce the prices based on their understanding of how other economic factors work\. So for instance, if the dollar is rising or it is devaluating, then you would think about storing it because then this is also connected to global markets\. So these, these middle men are the most, they kind of, they kind of look at the global markets, but also look at the local markets and try to see what benefits them more\. And then they kind of sell without looking at the consumer as at the end consumer and how it will affect their, their livelihoods basically\. So that's why we OK, so this is the system\.

### [[4:33]] So which was the first step in this activity\.

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Share your value upfront]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
So after we did the sense making of course and the research and we understand that part, we went into the next part which is communicating with stakeholders about why 1st, we talked to the end consumers understanding what type of consumption they take, like what are the type of crops they need on a daily basis, on a weekly basis\. And we kind of put the list and we looked at the prices and that it and how they change during certain months\. And we asked them about what is the necessary items that they can never not have in their households\. And once we did that research and we understood that fact, we went back up\. So we went to the productions, to the producers who are farmers and cooperative current cooperatives as well\. And we kind of talked to them about, OK, look, this is what people and the consumers are asking for, all right? And this is the months, this is the prices that this is the kind of income they have and what they can buy\. But also you can find that these are some of the items that they'll always need\. So if you produce this, there is always going to be demand on it\. So why don't you work on that? Why don't you do for this season, produce this amount and then we can bridge the gap\. So producers were like, oh, that's interesting, we'll do that\. Then we went, but we don't have money\. So then we went and we kind of looked at an interesting aspect\. So for finances, we, we leveraged two things\. One was community finance by we, we didn't do it like crowdfunding precise because crowdfunding has to have platforms and etcetera\. But this was kind of a community financing to these kind of issues\. What happened was we understand that 80% of the economy Sudan is informal\. So that 80% we took it\. We know that people have cash at home, they have savings, but never go into the banks and they never go into, and they're never formalized systems\. They don't go into taxes\. So this money is just sitting there and no one is utilizing it\. But how if they invest it and put it into this, into this production process and into and give and, and even lending it to consumers so they can buy right? And then, and then if they have overflow, they can sell it\. They can sell that overflow which they so because they will buy, they will buy like big demands from big supply, sorry from the producers and then they can sell it to neighboring communities and etcetera\. And this is what and this is how we kind of created this triangle that I was talking about\. So we have finance, financing producers but also financing consumers\. So they can actually buy from the producers and the producers can actually buy agricultural inputs and then look thing together\. And who was at the top of the triangle in the finance? So the top of course, we had two finances, 2 main finances\. We leveraged the informal sector like I said, but there was also banks and local banks\. And then they were like, and they had these microfinance and financing schemes that we kind of leverage as well to support this kind of work\.

### [[7:51]] OK\. So can you expand a little more about the stakeholders who, who they were? How did you get them engaged with this idea?

[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Yeah, So we, we have multilayer stakeholders\. So from the we have first of all the financiers because they have a cap that they need to finance especially the banks by the end of the year as like 12% of the whole or they generate throughout the year\. They need 12% to invest into projects and they generally do 3 to 4%\. So we're like, why don't you take this? And so this is our first kind of stakeholder and we kind of like had few banks that were interested in this\. The second stakeholders were farmers and they were diverse types\. There were small scale farms like smallholders\. They had like few Fedans or acres\. And then you have bigger farmers and these are kind of more organized and stuff\. And then with the last part is actually smallholder farmers organized together as cooperatives\. And this is the essential part organization kind of brings more impact\. The last part is we went to direct households\. We just knocked on doors basically and in and, and we did it in a random sampling way, like to understand like different areas, hey, what type of food you need? What are you able to purchase food? So these were kind of like our first stakeholders that we engaged because of their information that they had cool, which was the how could I say the, the frame or the institutionalization of this partnership?

### [[9:31]] How, how did you channel? How did you give shape to this new model of partnership?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[tools:Design]]
This was the interesting part\. So I think at the 1st we did not know exactly how to do it\. But basically what we did is we brought these, we institutionalized it by bringing building contracts between these various stakeholders\. Like for instance the banks would we would, would contract the producers\. But before that happens, the producers have to have a contract with the consumers because they need to know exactly the demands, the amounts they're going to produce and sell it to them\. And then the consumers would have two things like they would have their own consumption\. So they would take big bulks from the producers\. They would consume for themselves, but that overflow they would sell\. So they gain a little bit of profit for sustainability to the kid back\. And they can actually do that and they can pay back the banks for taking that loan to purchase it in the first place\.

### [[10:35]] So the UNDP in this context encourage partnership contract, Yes\. And so no, please\.

Yeah\. So not just the contract, but the whole model like you would engage them\. This is the institutionalization of it, the contract\. But UNDP kind of encourage the partnership as a whole to happen, like creating and fostering an ecosystem\.

### [[10:57]] This is, I think what we and which was the role of the country did that, did it buy it from the beginning? How did you manage to get the country symbol if you did?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:8 Elements (or Steps) for Policy Innovation]]
So I think we didn't get we when we were trying to experiment, we did not get the country office heavily involved, but we kept them informed, right? So we informed them what we're doing and kept them in the loop and because they wanted to see impact or they wanted to see if this is going to succeed, right\. And once we had like an initial report, they kind of actually said, hey, this is looks interesting\. We want to see how we can evolve this more because what we are trying to do in our contract office is look at new types of proposals to send to, to do resource mobilization\. So if this idea hits the right strings, it would bring and it would attract donors, they would be interested to do it\. So they got involved at a later stage once they kind of felt like this is something that they can utilize\.

### [[12:03]] And can you tell me a little more about the experimentation part, if you had or the testing part and what color methods you unfold or apply?

[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Sure\. So basically we did this in an AB testing style\. So we kind of got two different groups and basically we had the model that was kind of with various contracts with kind of looking and listening to what people need and then like the whole shaping the whole ecosystem\. This is the one that kind of this was the A group that had a whole ecosystem together\. And then the B group was kind of like letting, just introducing them together without kind of building in knowledge or building in capacity, without showing new ideas of how to kind of generate fundings like the cloud, the community funding element or the banks and kind of looking at the banking systems, kind of the funding that sits there\. We didn't like show them these opportunities\. We just told them, guys, you need to work together and see how this will unfold\. So this was the basically the testing style\. And I, I think the beast, the other group, I think we didn't really put effort into giving in the different kind of partnership model\. So that's why I didn't, I think it didn't work at all\. But the group that we had created in the ecosystem and kind of shaped very well\.

### [[13:40]] So the experiment may have not work, but the model did\.

Yes, yes, exactly\.

### [[13:47]] So the experimentation had a slight failure\. You know, I'm curious about the compliance part of this because we were kind of backing people who was supposed to comply to certain, I don't know to, to deliver this the quantity of the crop, but you know, to this family or for this shop\. How did you manage this? How could I say this aspect of the project?

[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tools:Design]]
Absolutely a good question\. We had community mobilizers in each of these areas and working coordinating with these partners and these community mobilizers or we can, you can say community champions, for instance, because they love the idea of what we're doing\. They ensured this compliance process\. They would come and sit down and because in the end, these are actual contracts that you would actually have severe consequences on, right? But in reality, sometimes these compliances don't go very far\. So what we did was we had focal points to kind of follow up on this\.

### [[15:06]] So what So what were your main outcome? So what do you think was the, the main impact of this project?

I think the main impact came from the that people kind of got better livelihoods, better purchasing power\. It created new employment without us even kind of noticing and brought up some interesting new savings schemes for these communities because once they people can buy and purchase lower priced foods, that extra amounts of money can be utilized in something else\. And surprisingly, some people invested it in farming itself\. So yeah\.

### [[16:05]] Yeah\. Was the government involved in any way in this model? Sorry, the government\.

The government was involved in the sense that it facilitated some aspect of this, right\. So it was facilitating that in the sense that the financing policies to be reshaped towards small scale farmers and that they can purchase, they can take higher amounts of funding because it they've, if you look at it, microfinance can only go to up to $5000\.

### [[16:42]] So did you get a bill reform?

Yes, we did\. We did actually support the bill reform on increasing the threshold for funds\. Huge catalyzation result really\.

### [[16:55]] I don't know, last question and yes, and I was going to ask her if the government took ownership of this, but they OK, so, but very quickly before we finish ending the government did take some form of ownership to theirs to what they feel like is their side right\.

So enhancing a policy about increasing search hold for financing and etcetera, but also they kind of took ownership of the element of trying to create food security within certain communities, right\. So allowing the accessibility for food security to happen among these communities\.

### [[17:43]] Thank you so much, Ali\. It was amazing to know about this project\.
