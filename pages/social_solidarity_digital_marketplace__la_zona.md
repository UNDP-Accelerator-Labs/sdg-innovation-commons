## 

E-commerce brings solutions and problems. It becomes a problem when wealth is accumulated in a few giants (like Amazon). In Catalunya, Spain, during January-March 2021, “La Zona”, a platform made up of local, climate and environment resposible, cooperatives and association businesses, will be tested. From May-July will be running. <br>
