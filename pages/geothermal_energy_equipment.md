> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

The purpose of the invention is to make geothermal energy generation available anywhere on Earth and to increase the efficiency of existing technologies. Existing technologies have two main limiting factors: the insufficiently high temperature of the geothermal source on the ground surface and the small volume of the hydrothermal flow. The number of sources of satisfactory indicators is limited and mainly localized in the places where tectonic plates join. That's why, despite its obvious advantages over all other types of energy generation, geothermal energy generation can't take its share of the total energy generation.  We decided to transfer the heat exchange process from the ground surface to the depth of the well (to use the natural temperature gradient) and to install the so-called "Impulse Accelerator". As a result, we would have constant access to a limitless supply of geothermal energy anywhere the earth's crust could be drilled or an existing well used. In the long run, nonrenewable energies will be replaced, and greenhouse gas emissions will be significantly reduced. The presented geothermal energy device contains upward (3) and downward (4) pipes fit as a continuous (joined) circuit from the ground surface (2) into the borehole (1).  On the downward pipe (4), on the ground surface (2), the pump (5) is installed. The upward (3) and downward (4) pipes in the depth of the borehole (1) are connected to the heat exchanger (6). Whole surface of pipes to the heat exchanger covered by heat-insulating material. The end of the upward (3) pipe on the ground surface (2) is directed to the condensation type steam turbine (7), which is connected to the electric generator (8). The power device contains an exhaust steam condenser (9) from a steam turbine (7), as well as the pipe for resupply of condensate to the pump (5). The end of the upward (3) pipe is equipped with a manageable valve (10) with its management (including possibly computer) device (not shown on the figures). The manageable valve (10) can be of different types, including electromagnetic or electromechanical types and can have the ability to be managed with a close-open duration / frequency regulation. Between this manageable valve (10) and the steam turbine (7), the steam nozzle is placed (11), which is performed as a “Laval nozzle.” The downward pipe (4) is equipped with a few (at least one) non-return valve (12) that allows the thermal agent pumped into the pipe to flow only in one direction (to the heat exchanger(6)). To prevent the loss of thermal water or/and atomization of associated harmful gases into the atmosphere, the borehole (1) is closed with a protective lid (13)
