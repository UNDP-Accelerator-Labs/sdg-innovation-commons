> Description of the solution

Professor Dai Jian-Guo, at PolyU and his research team, invented a method to make advanced coating materials for smart sub-ambient radiative cooling (ssrc) to cool buildings off while consuming zero electricity. The coating called 'UmiCool' is a multifunctional aqueous polymer, coating that can be painted on the exterior surface of buildings and infrastructure. It works by scattering sunlight, converting absorbed UV light to fluorescence emissions and re-emitting infrared radiation to outerspace.
