this Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment (SeIA) on the impacts of CoVID-19 in
Gandaki province, Nepal, was conducted jointly by the UNDP Nepal’s Accelerator Lab,
UNDP SURGe Data Hub, Country Support Management team, and UNDP Crisis Bureau
at the request of and in collaboration with the Policy and Planning Commission (PPC) of
Gandaki Province.

the study examines the socio-economic impacts of CoVID-19 on study populations;
namely, households, farmers, daily wage earners, and service sector enterprises (hotel
and transportation). the assessment presents key findings and recommends policy
measures to address the negative effects of CoVID-19 on the study populations. the
assessment attempts to reveal the extent of vulnerability experienced by those directly
impacted by CoVID-19 in Gandaki Province. Since the data collected for this assessment
only reveals the vulnerabilities of the study populations, we hope this assessment will lay
the groundwork for further comprehensive assessments in the future.

We would like to acknowledge with much appreciation, the crucial role of the whole
team of UNDP in preparing this report. A special thanks to PPC members Dr. Subash
Adhikari and Ms. Maya timsina, Secretary at the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Law Mr.
Kedar Nath Sharma, Secretary at the office of the Chief Minister and Council of Ministers
(oCMCM) Ms. Indu Ghimire, Secretary at the Ministry of Social Development Mr. Binod
Bahadur Kunwar. Special gratitude to former Vice-Chair of PPC Dr. Giridhari Sharma
Poudel, whose contribution in stimulating suggestions and encouragement helped to
coordinate this assessment. We express heartfelt acknowledge on account of former
members of PPC Dr. Bishnu Raj Baral and Dr. Bhima Dhungana who have supported us
directly or indirectly. We would like to thank the UNDP SURGe Data Hub team for their
technical insights and knowledge-sharing throughout the assessment, in particular, Mr.
Gentjan Cera, Mr, Arnold Njogu, Ms. Shea Mann, Mr. Hamed Sambo and Mr. Fabjan Lashi.
our deepest appreciation goes to all PPC officials for their coordination.

this assessment would not have been possible without support from Mr. Damodar
Gyawali, a senior statistics expert. Sincere thanks are due to him for his lead role in survey
design, tools customization, training to survey staff, and data analysis and report-drafting.
We would also like to thank Ms. Prakriti GC, Statistics Specialist for her support in every
stage of the assessment and data analysis.

A Report on Digital Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of COVID-19 in Gandaki Province, Nepal
EXEcUtiVE SUmmar Y

UNDP Nepal, in collaboration with the Policy and Planning Commission (PPC) of Gandaki

Province, carried out a Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment (SeIA) survey across 11

districts of the province, in 2021.

the main objectives of the survey were to:

(i) assess the socio-economic impacts of CoVID-19 on four sets of population,

namely households, including the vulnerable groups, such as, pregnant and

lactating women (PLW) and Persons with Disabilities (PWD); agriculture holders

(farmers); daily wage earners; and food and accommodation services (hotels,

restaurants and eateries) and transportation sectors;

(ii) generate socio-economic profile and evidence-base of the effects of CoVID-19 on

the study populations; and

(iii) recommend action points/policy measures to the Gandaki PPC based on the

study findings.

A direct personal interview approach was applied to collect data and information from

1,775 eligible respondents. Due to the lack of a sampling frame, time restrictions, and

resource constraints, the survey followed a purposive sampling method.

the household survey collected data from 684 households, many of them (41.7%)

receiving various forms of assistance provided by the provincial government and

humanitarian organizations since the outbreak of CoVID-19. According to the survey,

14.2% of households participated in cash for work, 13.7% got food subsidies, 8% received

cash transfers and 5.8% engaged in food for work, among others. Households were

found impacted by CoVID-19 in a variety of ways. the main effects included (i) decrease

in household income, (ii) increase in job losses or unemployment, (iii) short supply of

food and rise in market price, (iv) difficulties in accessing health services, both ANC and

PNC for pregnant and lactating women, (v) difficulties and near shortage of protective

items, such as, face masks, hand sanitizer, medicines, soap etc. (vi) young children

deprived of learning opportunity.

the farmers' survey collected information from 381 respondents. the vast majority

of farmers (93%) grew more than one variety of crops. Less than half of farmers (46%)

primarily produced for their household consumption. Among these 7% produced for sale

(selling 90% or more). More than one-third of respondents (38%) sold their produce in

the retail market and 16% in the wholesale market. About 61% of farmers visited markets

less frequently, 15% monthly, and 8% daily to sell their produce.

In the previous agricultural year, only 5% of farmers received subsidies, directly or

indirectly. Given the context of the CoVID-19 outbreak, 44.4% of respondents were able

to make use of their savings to bear the following week's living expenditures, 25.5%

would change the crops planted on their farm, 19.9% would borrow money, and 10.2%

would look to financial support from their family members. About 21% of respondents

(80) said that there was a shortage of agricultural labor as compared to the peak

agriculture months (mid-May through mid-August). the government support to farmers

– subsidies (5%) and cash transfers (2.1%) – was found to be nominal.

the main effects of CoVID-19 on farmers were: (i) reduced access to the market; (ii) labor

shortages amongst farming communities; and, (iii) difficulties in bearing daily expenses.

Furthermore, government subsidies and cash transfers were found to be nominal to

mitigate or cope with these impacts.

the daily wage earners' survey collected information from 275 respondents. With the

exception of those working two days a week, the average incomes of all respondents

registered a decline. the major assistance received by respondents included food

subsidies (39.3%), food transfers (28%), cash for work (26.9%), food for work (18.9%) and

cash transfers (11.6%).

the main effects of CoVID-19 on daily wage earners included: (i) increase in

unemployment rate; (ii) reduction in working hours; (iii) decline in average income;

(iv) fluctuation in living conditions; and, (v) rise in market prices of wide-ranging daily

commodities, including food, clothes, and transportation and health services, among

others.

the enterprise survey collected information from 435 businesses, with 159 (37%) of

them representing the transportation sector and 276 (63%) representing the food and

accommodation services. CoVID-19 forced enterprises to close for an average of more

than 6 months. travel was restricted amidst a nationwide lockdown, suppressing the

demand for goods and services, particularly in food and accommodation. Wage-earning

workers lost employment opportunities, or found their working hours reduced. this in

turn caused substantial reductions in their income, which, even in normal circumstances,

was barely enough to make ends meet.

the severe impacts of CoVID-19 on poor and vulnerable population/households, such as,

PLWs, PWDs, and daily wage earners, calls for a comprehensive social protection strategy.

the province requires more money to enhance budgets and ensure that the citizens

have access to high-quality health care.

•

Farmers should be provided with appropriate training, necessary agricultural

tools and equipment, and their access to the market needs to be improved.

• Women are a vulnerable group in Nepal, and all the more so in rural areas, mainly

because they lack financial independence and access to finance. the Kisan Credit

Card should target women working in the agricultural sector as the scheme can

be useful to them.

•

the Kisan Credit Card should also be implemented effectively and efficiently so

the intended users benefit to the maximum possible extent by enabling acccess

to required goods and services.

•

Provincial businesses have greatly suffered since the outbreak of CoVID-19.

Provisions should be made, ideally, for complete waiver on business loan

interests for the entire period of lockdown.

• Hotels should be reimbursed for half of their monthly rents by the provincial

government.

•

Seating arrangements and the use of hand sanitizers while traveling are two

most important safety precautions that the public transportation systems must

adhere to. the public transport should provide for and make available face masks

and hand sanitizers.

the PPC should review its existing CoVID-19 response. It is important to develop a

strong database system to track the affected population/sector with the support of local

governments. the PPC needs to conduct more scientific surveys/research with large

sample sizes.

INTRODUCTION

A Report on Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment of CoVID-19 in Gandaki province, nepal

1.1 Background

CoVID-19 brought unprecedented challenges to human life, ranging from public

health emergencies to socio-economic consequences all over the world. Vulnerable

populations, including, but not limited to, persons living below the poverty line, women,

children, and persons with disabilities, as well as daily wage labours and Micro, Small,

and Medium-sized enterprises (MSMes), among others, have been adversely impacted by

the pandemic.

this Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment (SeIA) of CoVID-19 in Gandaki Province,

Nepal, was conducted by UNDP Nepal’s Accelerator Lab and UNDP SURGe Data Hub,

Country Support Management team and Crisis Bureau upon the request of and in

collaboration with Gandaki provincial Policy and Planning Commission (PPC). the

study assesses socio-economic impacts of CoVID-19 on four groups of population (i)

households, including pregnant and lactating women and persons with disability, (ii)

farmers, (iii) daily wage earners, and (iv) the service sector MSMes (hotels/eateries and

public transport); and analyses the recovery requirements of the targeted population

based on the findings. the four groups were chosen for the assessment because, in

Nepal, they are among the most affected segments of the population. the quantitative

survey method was applied in the assessment covering all 11 districts of the province.

the field operation of the survey was conducted in April 2021 by Sayapatri Society, an

NGo based in Gandaki's provincial headquarters of Pokhara.

2.1 objectives

the main objectives of Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment (SeIA) were to:

(i) assess the socio-economic impacts of CoVID-19 on selected households,

including vulnerable members, such as, pregnant and lactating women

(PLW), Persons with Disabilities (PWD), agriculture holders (farmers), daily

wage earners, and food and accommodation services (hotels, restaurants and

eateries) and the public transportation service;

(ii) generate an evidence-base of the effects of CoVID-19 on the populations of

interest; and,

(iii) recommend action points/policy measures to the Gandaki PPC based on the

study findings of the affected populations in Gandaki Province.

2.2. Survey design and methodology

the survey used a direct personal interview approach to collect data and information

from eligible respondents. Four separate sets of questionnaire were developed to solicit

information from the samples, namely households, agriculture holders, daily wage

earners, and enterprises.

the minimum sample size required for each population group was determined based on

the following formula for unknown population,

n0 = Zα/2

2 *p*(1-p) /e2 where,

Zα/2 = 1.96 at 5% level of significance,

p = 0.5 (sample proportion)

e = 0.1 (margin of error): assumption. this gives

n0=271 for minimum sample size required for simple random sampling for infinite

(unknown) population.

For the known population, the minimum sample size (n) is

n=N/(1+n0/N) where N= population size of the known population.

It should be stated here that the sample size of all categories of respondents was

proportional to the size of population of each group. the following processes were

applied while determining the sample size of a particular group of the study population.

 the determined sample size of each group (proportionally) was based on the

respective group's known population by district,

 to capture the PLW and PWD through household surveys, the sample size

was inflated by 2.5 times of 271 (minimum sample size for normal household

survey for unknown population),

 estimated sample size for the daily wage survey was based on the minimum

sample size population for unknown populations (minimum requirement 271

persons), as there was no sampling frame on their population size.

 Determined sample sizes for farmers and enterprises survey was based on the

formula for known population,

 Determined sample size for enterprise survey was based on economic Census

2017/18 (Number of establishments of hotel and transportation sectors),

 Population census data (2011) and Agriculture Census data (2011/12) from

the Central Bureau of Statistics were used while determining sample size for

households survey and farmers survey.

 Selected representative sampling units from each group of population

covering urban and rural areas depending on the nature of the study

population covering all 11 districts of Gandaki Province,

 Followed national and international concepts, definition, classification, and

methodologies related to socio-economic analysis,

 ensured and maintained the confidentiality of the respondents as per the

Statistics Act, 2015.

i Introduction
A Report on Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment of CoVID-19 in Gandaki province, nepal

Note: This study collected data and information from the four groups of population

(households, farmers, daily wage earners and MSMEs from the hotel and

transportation sectors) covering 11 districts of the Gandaki Province on sample

basis. As the sample size of each group of survey was limited, the results shouldn't be

generalized within these groups and Gandaki province only. The rapid assessment

only captured responses meant to understand the real-time and immediate impacts

of COVID-19 on the study populations and, therefore, did not capture the full scope

of impact during the limited time. The assessment was mostly quantitative in nature,

as it was done through Kobo Toolbox for data collection. It should be stated here

that qualitative data collection methods were not administered to triangulate the

findings. The assessment followed purposive sampling with a limited sample size of

1,775 units due to time and resource constraints coupled with unavailability of the

sampling frame.

2.3

instruments, training and fieldwork

Mobile data collection was employed using Kobo toolbox, following rigorous testing and

refinement. enumerators were trained virtually on the concepts of the survey, key terms,

and variables, interview methods, and mobile data collection techniques. the survey

used a Purposive Sampling method due to the lack of sampling frame, limited time, and

resource constraints.

the data were collected over a period of three weeks between 2nd and 27th April 2021.

on-site supervision of data collection, regular follow-ups, and technical guidance was

provided to enumerators and research team members organized by Sayapatri Society for

the fieldwork in order to enhance the quality of collected data.

2.4 Data cleaning

Micro-data were cleaned and analyzed using Power BI, excel, and Statistical Package for

Social Sciences (SPSS).

the survey has disclosed some interesting results indicating varied impacts of

CoVID-19 on the sampled populations. Households, including children, pregnant and

lactating women; persons with disability; daily wage workers; farmers; and hotels and

transportation services, were found severely affected by CoVID-19.

Monthly incomes of the study population were found to have declined significantly,

causing difficulties in managing the regular household expenditures and piling debt

burdens on the respondents. Women felt, and faced, difficulties accessing health

services, both ANC and PNC, as they became reluctant to visit health posts/hospitals

for maternal check-up due to fear of possible transmissions. Across the province, the

people – not just the study population – ran out of daily items, such as, face masks, hand

sanitizers, medicines, and soaps etc. School-children could not attend school and had

difficulties coping with virtual classes because they did not have compatible electronic

devices (smart phones, tablets, desktop computers and/or laptops). Moreover, not all

students and teachers were connected to high speed internet, nor were they trained on

the basics of online learning.

i Introduction

A Report on Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment of CoVID-19 in Gandaki province, nepal

CoVID-19 affected farmers selling their produce – both seasonal and off-seasonal – in

the local markets for two key reasons: halt of transportation service and shortage of

farm labor. the farmers could not ferry the goods and services to the market due to the

lockdown and halt of transportation services and the migrant farm workers who had

returned home during lockdown were yet to return to the farm work. Many farmers said

they faced difficulties even paying for their daily expenses.

on the other hand, the daily wage workers lost their jobs and found themselves stranded

without work or pay as they faced difficulties in getting jobs in the market. their daily

incomes of respondents declined and the provincial unemployment rates went up.

those who still had the job found their working/employment hours reduced heavily.

Households were concerned that the quality of their livelihood had hit hard. Many

said they were not in position to repay their loans because they had lost their incomes

completely or because the incomes had declined significantly. Prices of groceries, basic

utilities and daily consumables, including food products, clothes, shoes, and energy and

transportation services, soared high. this hit the people hard across the province.

CoVID-19 has severely impacted business operations. Businesses closed for more than

6 months since what is known in Nepal as "the first lockdown" till the time of data

collection. Businesses and production units dealing with essentials heavily scaled down

their operations. the majority of MSMe respondents said they witnessed a decline in sales

value and volume of business transactions. Mixed-effects have been witnessed on the

prices of goods and services sold. According to entrepreneurs, the demand for products

and services decreased significantly in the food and accommodation sector.

Most businesses rolled out products and services far below their installed, usual and

actual capacity, forcing workers and regular employees to retire early.

the key results surrounding the impact of CoVID-19 on these populations are discussed

below. the detailed characteristics of sampled populations and the impacts of CoVID-19

on them are presented in the annexes.

Household profile

the household survey collected information from 684 households/respondents from

11 districts of Gandaki Province. of the total, 37% of respondents (252) were female.

Likewise, 47% households (323) were selected from the rural municipalities. Figure 1

below shows the number of respondents by urban/rural municipalities and gender.

the survey clearly showed that people are aware of CoVID-19. Almost all respondents

(99.7%) knew a thing or two about the pandemic, and claimed to be adhering to

safety protocols issued in 2020 by the federal government to protect themselves and

others from CoVID-19. the respondents used face masks (97%), sanitizer or soap for

handwashing (81%) and maintained social/physical distance (78%) in their everyday life.

there were 2,460 people residing in 684 households at the time of data collection,

indicating to an average household size of 3.6 persons. More than one third of

households (36.8%) were headed by females. A total of 240 households (35%) had at

least one member living abroad for employment and/or study reasons. there were

371 absentees living abroad. this demonstrates that for every 100 population (usual

residents), there were 15 people living abroad, in most cases, in pursuit of better

employment opportunities. An overwhelming majority (88%) of respondents had some

level of education, including non-formal education, while the remaining 12% had no

education. A sizable proportion of respondents (91.1%) were found to be living in their

own houses while 7.1% of them lived in rented houses.

CHAPteR 3 FInDInGS FoR hoUSeholDS

More than one-sixth of respondents (16.5%) were out of work and earned no wages

during the reference period of the last 7 days, indicating a high rate of unemployment

prevalence among the study population. the top five reasons as to why the respondents

did not work were: (i) medical reasons or illness (26.5%), (ii) seasonal work (8.8%), (iii)

childcare (7.1%), (iv) bad weather (7.1%), and (v) vacation and/or studying (6.2%).

two in every three respondents (69%) witnessed a decline in their monthly incomes due

to the CoVID-19 outbreak. Approximately 18.3% earned consistent monthly income

while only 0.6% – mere 4 out of 684 respondents – saw an increase in their monthly

incomes during the pandemic.. Quick income-generating activities can be instrumental

to decrease the negative impacts of CoVID-19 on the affected population. the detailed

status in the change of monthly income of respondents is presented in Figure 2.

the average monthly income of households was found to have declined by 29% from Rs.

45,000 in January 2020 to Rs. 32,000 in mid-December 2020. the decrease was witnessed

both in urban and rural areas. Further, the average monthly income of households was

found to be higher in urban municipalities compared to the households located in rural

municipalities. For example, households in urban areas had a 1.47 times higher income

than those in rural areas in January 2020, while it was found to be 1.43 times in mid-

December 2020. Figure 3 shows how the income of households decreased between

January 2020 and mid-December 2020 in the urban and rural areas due to CoVID-19.

About 42% of respondents said the food prices had gone up and the supply down,
causing short supply of food and other essential commodities.

About 5% of respondents stated they were without any income or savings to pay
for their major monthly expenses, including rents, utilities, food, etc. only 16% of
respondents said that they did have a cushion of some income or savings to take care of
regular expenses but that would be sufficient for less than a month or so. the perception

CoVID-19 has had a significant impact on pregnant and lactating women visiting

the AnC/pnC clinics. According to the survey, only 3.9% of households had at least one

PLW in their households. Approximately 19% of respondents with pregnant women

in their households did not receive ANC service at a clinic since March 2020, following

the CoVID-19 pandemic, remaining 81% received such service during the same period.

BEHAVIOURAL INSIGHTS AND IMPACT STUDY ON POCKET PARK

CHAPteR 3 FInDInGS FoR hoUSeholDS

When asked why pregnant women did not take the ANC service, 50.5% of respondents
said it was because of fears associated with CoVID-19. Apparently, they avoided visiting
the nearest health facilities for ANC service fearing possible risks of transmission.

When asked about the state of maternity care services, fewer than half of the
respondents (42.9 %) said that it had not changed as a result of CoVID-19. Likewise,
26.6% of respondents said the maternity care service had improved – exactly the same
percentage that said the maternity care service had not improved.

the impacts of CoVID-19 have been found on school education, especially on school-
going children. According to the survey, nearly half of the respondents (49.9%) had a
total of 518 school-going children in their households as of December 2019. of the total,
more than one-third (36%) of children (184) stopped attending school since the outbreak
of CoVID-19. According to respondents (39.2%), school-going children could not get to
join the remote/virtual classes during the lockdown period because they did not have
compatible electronic devices (desktop or laptop computers, smart phones, tablets
etc.) or reliable high-speed internet. During the same period, 61.6% of school-going
children had access to remote classes via online, radio, television, and other means.
It showed the negative impacts of the pandemic on school education for children,
particularly on attending school and even taking remote classes. It suggests planners
and educationists to plan, design, and implement easily accessible and affordable virtual
education considering the indefinite effects of CoVID-19.

the decline in monthly income, inadequacy of income to pay for monthly expenses
and debt burden on respondents demonstrated the impact of CoVID-19 on
households.

impact of coViD-19 on households and vulnerable groups

 Household income decreased

 Job loss or unemployment rate increased

 Market prices increased amidst short supply of food and other essential

commodities

 Difficulties in accessing health services, including ANC and PNC services for

pregnant and lactating women

 Difficulties in accessing daily items such as face masks, hand sanitizer,

medicines, soap etc.

 Children having difficulties attending school or accessing virtual classes.

the majority of respondents worked at or from home, thus cutting down on their

external mobility. of the total respondents (684), more than two thirds (70%) worked

at home and/or farms during the assessment period. only 9.1% of the respondents

said they worked for businesses located away from their homesteads. the remaining

respondents (20.9%) were found working in other/unspecified sectors.

Households took a number of steps within their capacity to cope with the hardships

savings a significant number of them (26.2%) purchased food on credit from the local

vendors. Some said they borrowed food (18.9%) and just about the same size (16.5%)

turned to otherwise less preferred and cheaper food items. of the respondents, 15.8%

said they were not sure as to what they precisely did to cope amidst declined incomes,

14.8% sought financial help from friends, relatives/family members and employers.

one tenth (10.2%) said they turned to and searched for alternative employment

opportunities, followed by 7.2% who said they consumed the seed stock kept for the

upcoming season. Relatively small number (4.4%) borrowed from banks and financial

institutes while some (4.1%) found themselves forced to sell their fixed assets – land,

house, livestock, jewelry or phone. the government help was so nominal, in that only

3.9% benefitted. So much so that the respondents living in the margins of society had

to cut the number and proportion of meals per day – (3.8%) and 3.7%, respectively.

CoVID-19 has given added impetus to social security and social protection more

than ever before. out of 684 respondents, less than one-third (30%) of had their

social security benefits covered by the security institutions. the various types of social

security covered included social security offered by the government, self-employment

organizations, and the retirement fund, among others. Nearly one-third (31.5%) had

their social security covered through government institutions. Apart from this, the

social security for 23% of the respondents was covered through their self-employment

organizations. Also, an important segment of respondents (20%) considered retirement

funds as a means of their coverage for social security and protection provisions, through

which it can be assumed that most of them are currently not employed or are elderly

adults and senior citizens. It implies that planners and policy-makers should give proper

attention to expand social protection programs keeping in view the negative effects of

the pandemic on vulnerable populations.

When asked whether one or more members of the particular household had symptoms

similar to that of CoVID-19, 15.9% of respondents said they did. the symptoms

included, but were not limited to, high temperature, dry cough, and/or tiredness. this

demonstrates the prevalence of CoVID-19 in the population, implying that there is

a huge possibility of more transmission in the community. the overwhelming share

of respondents (81%) considered CoVID-19 to be an important issue/problem facing

society. one-tenth of the study population (10.4%) said they had no knowledge about

the consequences of CoVID-19 while another 8.5% did not appear to take the pandemic

seriously. this segment of population would either dismiss any such thing as CoVID-19

or would typically subscribe to conspiracy theories

In terms of access to information, audio-visuals were the most popular and credible

sources of information on CoVID-19. An overwhelming majority of respondents (93%)

believed the audio-visual medium to be the most reliable source of information on

CoVID-19. Apart from this, about 55% and 52% of respondents, respectively, believed

that word of mouth and social/alternative media are the other two main sources of

information on CoVID-19

two-thirds of respondents (66%) said the CoVID-19 is expected to last for at least 12

months, causing long-term socio-economic repercussions on households, especially

the vulnerable groups. It recommends that the provincial government and related

organizations continue their efforts to offer appropriate relief and recovery support to

the impacted communities in order to help them take care of their basic needs.

Nearly two-thirds of the respondents (65.5%) were found ready to handle any long-term

challenges posed by the CoVID-19 pandemic. the remaining 34.5% said they needed

support to deal with challenges triggered by the pandemic.

Agriculture remains the topmost sector of employment, followed by the

manufacturing and household sector. Households produced goods and services for

daily domestic consumption. More than half of household heads (54.7%) worked

in agriculture, 14% in manufacturing, and 13% in households. the other sectors of

employment included services (8.5%), construction (7.2%), wholesale and retail trade;

repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (4.1%), and food and accommodation service

(3.9%). this provides the sector-wise evidence-base for the government in providing

support programs towards reducing unemployment.

on the one hand, the respondents did not have sufficient income or savings to pay for

their daily expenses. on the other, they were further burdened by the debt. It showed

that one in three respondents had some debt (loan and mortgage repayments).

While the monthly income of households sharply declined due to the CoVID-19

outbreak, the measures taken and support extended to the respondents apparently were

inadequate to help them cope with their livelihood needs. this shows limited livelihood

support to households. the quantity and quality of support should be expanded to

benefit in real terms.

one in every ten respondents (10.8%) thought they had no access to health centers,

health services, and medical supplies due to which they lived with a variety of untreated

infections, in many cases, illnesses. About 8.6% of respondents stated that access to

health centers, health services, and medical supplies had become more difficult during

CoVID-19 than before. Further, 5.8% respondents perceived that access to health centers,

health services and medical supplies were constrained resulting in some untreated

infections and illnesses. In this way, one in four respondents (25.2%) perceived some

changes (problems) in the level of access to health services since the outbreak of

CoVID-19.

Having health insurance is more important than ever during a catastrophe like the

present pandemic. only 28% respondents had health insurance coverage, according

to the survey. 15.5% of households had at least one vulnerable member in their

households. About 6.1% of households had at least one senior citizen – 60 years or

above. In addition, 5.8% of households had at least one person with physical disability,

1.3% with a developmental disability, 0.9% with a learning disability, 0.7% with an

unseen disability, and 0.4% with a sensory disability. Health insurance is even more

important for these families with vulnerable members.

Figure 5 shows the type of assistance received by respondents as part of their

livelihood needs in the context of the CoVID-19 outbreak. Major assistance received by

respondents included: 14.2% cash for work, 13.7% food subsidy, 8% cash transfer, and

5.8% food for work.

Lactating women, who were supposed to receive full PNC coverage, were also found to

be affected by the pandemic. two-thirds of pregnant women (67%) visited the clinic for

ANC more than three times while the remaining one-third did not receive the service,

as required. Approximately, 48% of lactating women visited the PNC clinic more than

once. Apart from assessing health services, respondents felt difficulties in obtaining daily

essentials, such as, face masks, hand sanitizer, medicines, soap, etc. (Figure 7).

the farmers’ survey collected information from 381 respondents. of them, 222 (58%)

were from the rural municipalities and 159 from urban municipalities. About 53% of

respondents (201) were female. of the total, 72% respondents were at the head of the

households. Figure 8 below presents the number of respondents by municipality type

Around 86% of respondents had some education, including non-formal education, while

the remaining 14% did not. During the reference period, 92% of agricultural holders were

cultivating crops or fruits, raising animals, or performing agricultural activities.

When asked if they used animal-powered equipment for agricultural production (crops

and livestock), nearly half of the respondents (49.1%) stated that they did not, whereas

the remaining 50.9% of farmers used animal-powered equipment in the previous

agricultural year. However, the use of machine-powered equipment for agricultural

production was found to be higher than animal-powered equipment. two out of every

three farmers (66.4%) used machine-powered equipment for agricultural production

during the same period. It is necessary to expand fee renting services for the remaining

one third of farmers to use machine-powered equipment for better agricultural

production.

In the most recent agricultural season, less than half of farmers (43.6%) used different

irrigation facilities, meaning that 56.4% did not have such access to their agricultural

areas. of the total agricultural holders having irrigation facilities, one third of farmers

(33.7%) employed surface irrigation systems in recent agricultural seasons, followed by

water hoses (33.1%) and floods (6.6%). Farmers also utilized sprinklers (6%), buckets/

watering cans (3.6%), and drip irrigation (0.6 percent). Figure 9 presents the different

types of irrigation facilities used by farmers. this demonstrates that more than half of

the farmers did not have access to irrigation facilities, implying that additional irrigation

investment in agricultural land is necessary.

Farmers were more likely to use their lands for crop production rather than other

purposes. More than half of the landholders (56%) used agricultural holdings primarily

for crop production, followed by crop and livestock production (37%), and livestock

production (7%). this provides the basis for investment on different agricultural activities.

the impacts of coViD-19 on farmers

When asked if farmers had difficulties in getting labor for their agriculture work, about

21% of respondents (80) stated that there was a shortage of agricultural labor compared

to the peak farming season. of the total respondents, 36.3% respondents pointed out

that the shortage of labor is caused due mainly to mobility restrictions in the face of

CoVID-19 pandemic. In nutshell, the main effects of CoVID-19 on farmers among others

are given below.

impact of coViD-19 on farmers

 CoVID-19 affected farmers selling their products in the markets,

 It caused, or contributed to, labor shortage for agriculture activities,

 Farmers faced difficulties paying daily expenses,

 Government interventions in the form of subsidies and cash transfers were

too nominal to tide over the crisis.

the vast majority of farmers (93%) planted multiple crops. only 6.5% of farmers have

planted one crop only. While many farmers cultivate a mix or a variety of crops on their

farms, crop diversification initiatives required expert support. A very small percentage

of farmers (7%) appeared fully committed to agriculture – 100% of the time. two-

fifths (42%) and one-fifth (19%) of farmers, respectively, invested at least 60% of time,

resources and energy on farming and less than half (40%) of their working time on their

farms. Figure 9 shows the time spent by the farmers in their holdings.

From an economic perspective, 34% of respondents raised livestock, mainly buffalo and

sheep/goats for meat, 25% mixed livestock (no real prevalence of livestock activity),

and 18% on milk production. the results showed that about 82% of farmers produced

agriculture products both for household consumption and for sale.

Farmers were more likely to sell their products in the retail market. For example, while

more than one-third of respondents (38%) sold their products in the retail market, 16%

of respondents said they sold in the wholesale market. Likewise, 15% sold in farmer's

markets and 5% offered home delivery services to their customers. Less than 5% had

marketing contracts. the retail market offered relatively better prices for agriculture

products as compared to the wholesale market. therefore, there is a need to expand and

strengthen the retail markets, ensuring the support prices of farmers’ products. About

61% of farmers visited markets less frequently, 15% monthly, and 8% daily to sell their

agricultural products in the market. CoVID-19 affected farmers going to markets less

frequently to sell their products. Figure 10 shows the frequency of farmers' visit to the

market to sell their products over the past 12 months.

change crops grown on their farm, 19.9% would borrow money, 10.8% would try to find

another job/occupation, and 10.2% would look to support from family members

Farmers were also found to be engaged in non-agricultural activities in order to

income in addition to their income from agricultural holdings. this might be due to the

lower returns from agricultural activities.

recovery needs of farmers

Approximately 93% of farmers did not receive any subsidies from any government or

state entity during the previous agricultural year. According to findings, 5% of farmers

got some form of subsidies while 2.1% got cash transfers for agricultural operations. It

shows that even during the epidemic, farmers had limited access to cash transfers. It

suggests that the provincial government should increase both agriculture subsidies and

cash transfers to a larger number of farmers.

Cash loans for agriculture-related investments were found to be less common among

farmers. In the previous year, around 4% of holders obtained such loans. the main

reasons for not taking such loans because the overwhelming majority of holders didn’t

request for loans (82.2%) while 15.6% lacked access to loans and/or banks and financial

institutes and 2.5% had their loan requests refused. In response to the next question

about whether or not cash loans were repaid, nearly 90% of holders said they were

unable to do so in the previous year.

Since the daily wage earners are required to be available for work physically, insurance

coverage is vital for them. During this critical health emergency, only 13.5% of

respondents had personal health insurance coverage. It is essential to have some form

of public health insurance scheme to support these already affected populations, whose

rates of earning fluctuated abnormally. Nearly half of the respondents (48%) were in debt

at the time of data collection. Among them, 16.7% could not afford loan repayment due

to CoVID-19. About half of the respondents (47.7%) said that they could pay off their

loan within one to six months. the remaining 35.6% had no idea how they would pay

back their loans or how long it would take.

5.2

the impacts of coViD-19 on daily wage earners

Given the situation of the CoVID-19 outbreak and employment losses among daily wage

earners, 74.5% of respondents expressed anxiety about their livelihood conditions for the

next three months. only 4.4% of those polled were unconcerned about it. the remaining

21.1% had no idea or were rather oblivious about their future.

impact of coViD-19 on daily wage workers

 the unemployment rate increased,

 Working time reduced,

 Average income decreased,

 Concerns aroused over the fluctuating livelihood situation,

 Problems in paying loan on time,

 Respondents perceived an increase in the price of essential items such as

hygiene items, clothes/shoes, energy, food items, transportation, and health

services, etc.

About one in every four respondents (23.6%) did not have enough money or savings

to afford their monthly expenses, such as rent, utilities, food, and health care. As such,

they worked every day to cover these expenses. only 52.4% respondents said they had

enough money or savings to cover these costs for at least a month. It means that daily

wage earners require quick assistance to cover their monthly expenses even for their

basic needs. the impact of CoVID-19 on employment status and working time of daily

wage earners was noticed in the survey results. For example, the unemployment rate of

respondents sharply increased from 7.6% to 27% between December 2019 and october

2020 (Figure 13).

the average weekly working hours of respondents were found to have reduced by seven

hours from 49.7 hours per week in December 2019 to 42.9 hours per week in october

2020. Reduced working hours meant reduced earnings. Interestingly, the results also

disclosed the fact that women worked more hours than men around the year – both

before and after the onset of CoVID-19. Generally, women respondents worked an

additional 7 hours/week than their male counterparts. this clearly shows the impact of

CoVID-19 on employment status as well as the working time of daily wage earners.

CoVID-19 had a greater impact on respondents who worked on a weekly basis. their

income nosedived from Rs. 8,765 in December 2019 to Rs. 4,426 in December 2020, a

drop of 49.5%. During the same period, income for other types of respondents who

worked on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis had fallen, too (table 3).

Since the emergence of CoVID-19, respondents have perceived increase in market

prices of hygiene products, clothing/shoes, electricity, food, transportation, and health

services. the outbreak of pandemic led to undersupply of products which in turn kicked

the overall market price up. Despite the fact that everyone was aware of CoVID 19, it

was found that 5% of respondents did not consider it to be a serious issue of concern.

that probably explained why roughly a quarter of daily wage earner-respondents

(24%) acquired symptoms identical to CoVID-19 but were never tested. this is a high

magnitude concern, which the relevant authorities should take seriously and reach out

to the communities with effective awareness programmes to educate the vulnerable

groups on the symptoms, safety and prevention methods, and step up CoVID-19 testing.

According to the needs of the daily wage earners, more than half of respondents

(50.9%) believed that a good health was their most important requirement in respect to

CoVID-19, followed by food security (22.2%) and financial assistance (15.6%). to meet the

needs of daily wage earners, 44.4% of respondents preferred assistance in the form of

34

cash for work, 22.5% food for work, 14.9% food subsidies, 10.2% cash transfers and 5.1%

food transfers from the government and other humanitarian organizations. About 3%

of respondents did not expect any assistance from any agency to deal with CoVID-19.

Similarly, they expected additional support to enhance their skills (84%), connect with

job providers (52%) and receive unemployment benefits (36%) to name a few. this

provides the evidence base for authority to create employment opportunities targeting

the job seekers.

coping strategies of daily wage earners

Respondents received various assistance from government entities and humanitarian

organizations since the outbreak of CoVID-19 (Figure 14). the major assistance received

by them were food subsidy (39.3%), food transfer (28%), cash for work (26.9%), food for

work (18.9%), and cash transfer (11.6%). Since this question had multiple-choice options,

a single person might have received more than one type of assistance. this indicates that

a large proportion of daily wage earners did not receive adequate livelihood support.

recovery needs of daily wage earners

the daily wage earners needed to be physically present for work. on the other hand,

the economic activities were limited in the market due to the CoVID-19 outbreak. the

daily wage earners, therefore, need adequate and immediate support to cope with such

crisis. By collaborating with federal and the local government the provincial government

35

i Introduction

A Report on Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment of CoVID-19 in Gandaki province, nepal

of Gandaki should expand such assistance reaching out to a wider group of daily wage

earners. For this, a real-time evidence-based automatic system should be developed by

the provincial government partnering with the local and federal government to assess

the income level of the vulnerable groups, including the daily wage earners, and provide

cash transfer to the affected group based on the income fluctuation.

About 89% of business establishments (386) were found to be registered with one or the

other government entity. Nearly two-thirds of establishments (65%) did less than one

million rupees of business transactions in 2018/19, while 32% had transactions worth

anywhere between one million and five million rupees. the remaining 3%, however, had

transactions worth five to ten million rupees in the same period.

the impacts of coViD-19 on mSmEs

the survey showed that the CoVID-19 had significant impact on businesses

operations, volume of transaction and the prices of goods and services sold. on

average, business establishments temporarily closed for more than 6.3 months due to

CoVID-19. only in mid-April did business operate with minimal impact.

the survey showed a decrease in the number of employees in the establishments

between December 2019 and october 2020. the number of persons engaged/employed

in 435 establishments decreased by 7.4% from 4,877 in December 2019 to 4,514 in

october 2020. this appears to be a clear effect of CoVID-19 on the employment status

of business establishments. the impact can be observed in all types of workers – waged/

salaried based and the self-employed. Further, it has equally affected the size of male and

i Introduction

A Report on Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment of CoVID-19 in Gandaki province, nepal

It was found that almost all business establishments (97.47%) temporarily closed due

to CoVID-19. on average, both types of businesses closed temporarily for about 6.3

months. About 81% of establishments were operating normally during the time of data

collection (mid-April 2021).

there was a decrease in sales amount of business establishments since the outbreak of

CoVID-19. About 80% of respondents (347) experienced decreases in their first half sales

(2020) as compared to the same period in 2019. 8% respondents witnessed increase in

their sales while 13% noticed no change in sales in the same period. Figures 17 shows

the number of respondents with their opinions regarding the change in sales of the

establishments.

About 29% of respondents experienced a decline in prices of sold goods or services of

establishments due to CoVID-19 when compared to the normal period. About 40% of

respondents experienced an increase in prices of sold goods or services in the same

period. However, about 28% of respondents did not experience any changes in the prices

before and during the CoVID period. this shows a mixed impact of CoVID-19 on business

in terms of sales values and prices. the perception of respondents about the change in

prices of sold goods or services in their establishments is given in figure 18.

the survey also investigated the capacity utilization of establishments in producing

output in the first half of 2020 (Figure 19). About 41% of establishments had produced

output far below their maximum installed capacity. only 7% of establishments produced

output in maximum capacity. Altogether, about 78.2% of establishments had produced

i Introduction

A Report on Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment of CoVID-19 in Gandaki province, nepal

CoVID-19 resulted in 358 persons losing their jobs in business establishments. they

included 82.1% full-time workers, 11.5% part-time workers, 6.1% temporary workers, and

0.3% disabled workers, all of whom were Nepali nationals. of every 100 workers who lost

their jobs, 33 were women, the majority of whom (97.5%) worked in the service sector

industry – eateries, restaurants, and hotels.

According to 72% of respondents, the monthly business operations hours dropped in

the first half of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. only 2.5% of respondents

reported total monthly hours in the business increased at the same time. total working

hours did not change over the reference period, according to 25.5% of respondents.

Clearly, reduced business operation hours meant reduced production resulting in short

supplies, reduced wages for workers and reduced tax collection, among others.

CoVID-19 hit the business establishments severely and their net incomes dwindled

heavily. the net income of establishments plunged by 62% from Rs. 38.56 crore during

January-December 2019 to Rs. 14.71 crore during January-December 2020. Similarly, the

average net income decreased from Rs.8.86 lakh to Rs. 3.38 lakh in this period. the food

and accommodation sector experienced more troubles from CoVID-19 compared to the

transportation sector in terms of percentage decrease in net income. Figure 20 shows

how total net incomes of both types of establishments decreased during the reference

period.

the role of government is vital in providing support to business establishments in

the time of a crisis like CoVID-19 outbreak. Respondents pointed out a variety of

government-led actions that would be beneficial to businesses in dealing with the

CoVID-19 situation (Figure 21). the top five measures preferred by the respondents

from government to cope with the CoVID-19 crisis included (i) fiscal exemptions or tax

reductions (43.4%), (ii) access to new credit (43.2), (iii) deferral of credit payments, rent or

mortgage, suspension of interest payments, or rollover of debt (40.5%), (iv) cash transfers

for business (35.6%) and (v) access to personal protective equipment to re-open business

safely. this provides the evidence base for the government to prioritize policy measures

while providing relief and support programmes for the businesses to reopen.

CONClUSION AND
RECOMMENDATION

45

i Introduction
A Report on Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment of CoVID-19 in Gandaki province, nepal

the present study demonstrates the impact of CoVID-19 and its subsequent effects on

sampled populations in varied ways. Based on the key findings, the following policy

action points would be instrumental in mitigating the negative impacts of CoVID-19 on

affected populations.

7.1 Households and vulnerable populations

i. Given the severe impact of CoVID-19 on poor and vulnerable people/households

with PLW/PWD and daily wage earners, it is critical to develop a comprehensive

social protection scheme. For this, it is important to increase the income security

targeting vulnerable groups through cash transfers and emergency employment

opportunities (eg. cash for work, food for work, etc.). Similar measures, such as,

old-age pension, single woman's pension, child grant, disability allowance, and

endangered ethnicity allowance, should be made accessible to the vulnerable

populations, at least for the duration of the pandemic.

ii.

emergency financial transfers should be made available to disadvantaged

households that have lost family members as a result of CoVID-19. Severely ill and

hospitalized people should also be provided with the emergency funds.

iii. With effective coordination, collaboration, and participation of local and federal

governments, it is important to establish door-to-door mobile public services,

including ANC and PNC check-up facilities. Physio-social counseling should be

incorporated with the delivery of such services. there is a need to ensure access

to quality health care by mobilizing extra funds to boost budgets as part of the

emergency response.

iv.

existing free health insurance programs for the poor and vulnerable should be

expanded to wider population. In light of the current 2nd wave of CoVID-19 and

the resulting uncertainties, there is a need to build adequate oxygen plants in each

district ensuring consistent supply of oxygen in all health facilities with federal

funding.

v. Make CoVID-19 vaccinations a top priority and guarantee that everyone has access

to them. With the help of the federal government, the province government should

speed up the process of obtaining vaccines and conducting mass immunization

programs in collaboration with local governments.

46

CHAPteR 7 ConClUSIon AnD ReCoMMenDAtIon

7.2 farmers

i.

Farmers should be provided with equipment, training, and market access. these

interventions alone will help them improve their living standards in the long run. It

should be noted that 67.5% respondents hired the same number of workers as last

year due to a lack of proper training and the hired workers needed assistance from

other trained farmers.

ii.

Since 92.7% of respondents said they did not get agricultural subsidies in the

previous agricultural year, the Kisan Credit Card (for both men and women) should

be implemented efficiently. this arrangement may be instrumental in uplifting the

farmers.

iii. Women form a vulnerable group in Nepal, more so in the rural areas. Agricultural

cards should be provided to women engaged in commercial farming. Such cards

should be beneficial to the card holders in several ways, such as, fee waivers in

health posts or hospitals and other public services. this survey shows 44.4% spend

all their earnings on living expenses, including health services.

iv. Coordination with the Central Bank is regarded as important in order to (a) expand

working capital, (b) farming and agricultural loans, and (c) deferral of interest

payments for farmers in the agricultural sector.

7.3 Establishments (Hotels and transportation sectors)

i. Provisions should be made for 100% interest waiver for the duration of lockdown

and 50% interest waiver for the remaining period until the situation returns to

normalcy (with regards to loan outstanding as of 1st May 2021). Similarly, the

government needs to provide the facility of deferment of loan repayment for at least

two years effective from the date of start.

ii.

For the duration of the lockdown, a 50% exemption from yearly taxes on public

vehicles and a 50% exemption from building rent for hotels, lodges, and restaurants

should be made. the provincial government should reimburse property owners a

half of the rent that has been waived.

iii.

For establishments affected by the pandemic, provisions should be provided for

bridging loans with low interest rates.

47

i Introduction
A Report on Digital Socio-economic Impact Assessment of CoVID-19 in Gandaki province, nepal

iv. Provision should be made for at least a 10% rebate on electricity bill and a 100%

waiver of late payment charge on the electricity bill.

v.

It is critical to enhance the public transportation system, such as, seating

arrangements, in the light of CoVID-19 safety protocol (physical/social distancing,

wearing face masks, and using hand sanitizer as much as possible). In order to do so,

the provincial government should work closely with the mass and public transport

operators to ensure smooth supply of face masks and sanitizers at subsidized rates.

7.4 cross-cutting issues

i. Based on the previous year's lessons, the PPC should assess its existing CoVID-19

response policy and programs and take relevant adjustments through new policies

and guidelines.

ii. With the help of local governments, it is critical to build a solid database system to

track impacted populations/sectors and perform more scientific surveys/research

with larger sample sizes.

iii. With the assistance of local governments, poor and vulnerable population

identification surveys should be conducted on a regular basis. the list of such

populations should be updated and prioritized on a regular basis.
