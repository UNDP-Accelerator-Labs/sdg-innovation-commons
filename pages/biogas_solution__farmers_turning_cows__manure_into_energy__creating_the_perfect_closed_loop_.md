With minimum resources available, Mr. Atef Azkoul is making generating biogas from cows’ manures.  He learnt about the method through the internet and started applying the experiment within his farms using a basic digester.

Because of the high prices of gas and fuel, biogas provided the perfect solution for a raising challenge.

Moreover, Mr. Azkoul is creating the perfect closed loop by using manure to generate energy and using the remaining liquid as a fertilizer, liquid compost. The compost is applied to crops which are then fed to cows who produce the manure that is used in the “digester” for biogas. 




Mr. Atef is one of many farmers from different Syrian provinces who are following the same practise.
