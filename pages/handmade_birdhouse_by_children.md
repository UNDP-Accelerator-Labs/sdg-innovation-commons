Handmade birdhouse by children 

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Birdhouses are made by children together with their parents at home or at school. We may observe that they are very common in old neighborhoods. Every yard contains 3-5 handmade birdhouses created with different design and color.
