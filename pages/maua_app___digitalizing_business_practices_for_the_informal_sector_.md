Local market disruptions caused by the COVID-19 crisis mitigated through promoting the accessibility of SkyEye’s E-Commerce solution for both vendors and customers, and to address language barriers for rural and marginalised segments. The project is a joint initiative by UNCDF PFIP and UNDP, and aims to mitigate local market disruptions caused by the Covid-19 crisis by supporting SkyEye to scale its existing E-Commerce solution, Maua App. This will be achieved by strengthening SkyEye’s operational capacity, focusing on vendor onboarding and improving Maua App’s accessibility and usage by marginalised segments such as women, rural communities and people with disabilities (PWDs).

The MAUA app was first developed to counter the lack of online shopping services during the lockdowns in Samoa from the Measles outbreak in 2019. The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated its scalability to be more inclusive of the marginalized and vulnerable informal sector.
