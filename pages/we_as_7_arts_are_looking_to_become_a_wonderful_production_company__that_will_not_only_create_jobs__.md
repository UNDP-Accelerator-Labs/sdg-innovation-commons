> Title of the innovation

We as 7 Arts are looking to become a wonderful production company, that will not only create jobs for the youths but also no pen up the country to new forms of investment through tourism

> Brief description of the innovation

As 7 arts we are determined to use the raw talent that we tap from all the youths and children that we work with to create quality and meaningful content that will help all parties involved in the projects. At the current moment due to lack of funding we are slightly impaired so we are not able to produce the quality content we want to the best of our abilities, but our desire though is that in the coming months with proper funding of course we want to create a platform that will benefit the environment, the youths and the nation at large through our wonderful, educational and quality content

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

7 Arts is one of the few youth owned production companies that we have in Zambia, we stand out because we intend to use our abilities to better the lives of as many youths as we can! We plan on doing multiple short projects, and also we plan on creating partnerships with many companies and influential people and that is how we will generate income for our company. The benefit that we bring to the table as a company is that we will not only educate, we will also empower youths by hiving them something to do so that they stay away from bad vices

> Technical Feasibility

It is a production company, run by a group of youths who have come together for a common good

As earlier stated, 7 Arts will work with many youths and children which means we will give them so many projects to work on so that they don't focus on bad vices
