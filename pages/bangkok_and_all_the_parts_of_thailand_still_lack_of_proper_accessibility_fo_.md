## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Bangkok and all the parts of Thailand still lack of proper accessibility for people with disabilities to travel. Even staff of government at working level is clearly aware of the issue but they cannot solve the problem swiftly due to rules and regulations. "Losing face" and "embarrassment" are the main factor that triggers government to take actions.
