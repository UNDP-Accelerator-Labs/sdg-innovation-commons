Ramzu Speed boat is a speedboat service provider in Alifu Alifu Thoddoo that offers a holistic last mile transport solution to guesthouses by providing complimentary drop off and pick up of guests from the guesthouses.  Young men (a mix of local and foreign) are employed in this transport operation and uses a mix of buggies, motorbikes and vans are used for the transport to and from the speedboat. This transport pooling solution brings down operational costs of guesthouses as it reduces the need for individual guesthouses to have their own vehicle to facilitate transport of guests to and from the jetty. This solution also contributes to a reduction of carbon emissions as well.
