> Description of the solution

Romans managed to keep their homes cool by pumping cold water from the aqueducts through the walls of elite people's homes to freshen their dwellings during summer months. aqueducts were devised much earlier in Greece, Egypt, the Near East, and the Indian subcontinent, as an irrigation system. However, it was the Romans who were the first to use aqueducts as natural cooling system.
