## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Transforming the public sector through Innovation and Digital Transformation


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to enhance the innovative capacity of state governments to build more holistic, impactful and sustainable solutions that will improve the lives of citizens and increase access to public service.



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the necessity for governments to design, coordinate and implement, rapidly at times, innovative approaches and novel solutions. The pandemic also demonstrated that governments can push the boundaries of current practice. Existing mental models, norms and value systems were shaken by the pandemic as citizens and governments navigated the shock. New ideas and approaches entered the public sector realm of action; practices which broke with former norms. However, while an important event in history, the challenges and external environment outside of the COVID-19 crisis continues to place pressure on governments. It is not enough for governments to maintain the status quo. Governments need to proactively engage with the future, explore the potential of innovative solutions in the face of complexity and re-think the foundations of public administration in order to continue to improve our societies.



> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Societies are facing complex challenges that require new ways of thinking and working. Innovation offers public servants and managers the possibility to address these complex challenges in new ways. Without innovation, a gap between public administration capabilities and the pressing needs of society is likely to appear. The second principle points to the importance of encouraging innovation and equipping key public servants with the tools, capacities and contexts for innovation. Encouraging and supporting innovation across all levels of government and engaging public servants and managers in these processes comes with substantial opportunities. For example, to counter risk aversion and fear of failure, safe spaces to experiment and an authorising environment for innovation can be developed and sustained. The creation of incentives and stimuli for innovation at the systems, organisational and individual levels are not only important for opening paths to action, but also to reward those public officials and teams who push forward innovative approaches.

We will be co-designing and prototyping a Public Sector Innovation Capacity Framework as a systematic model that’ll guide state governments in leveraging innovation as an integral part of policymaking, public administration, public service delivery &amp; enhance capacity to proactively adapt to the changing environment.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can we leverage innovation and digital transformation for effective and efficient public service delivery.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Through co-creation and collective intelligence with the state actors, we will seek to gain state ownership of the process. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Right now, everyone knows the public sector is facing multi-faceted challenges but there is no data on this. this is why issue mapping is important, when we identify the issues, then we can begin to explore and develop solutions. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The state actors are the first response champions of this challenge, followed closely by the Federal Ministry of Innovation and Digital Economy. 

Growing this challenge would require all stakeholders completely onboard. If successful, all the citizens in the country will benefit from a more effective and efficient service delivery and have better access to public service.
