Glass crusher has been made from discarded metal material allowing glass to be crushed at source for example at bars, restaurants and hotels.  Crushed glass can be used as aggregate in construction ( mixed with concrete - 'glasscrete'), in road construction including the base and surface coat for roadways, underlay for walking trails, walkways and driveways.
