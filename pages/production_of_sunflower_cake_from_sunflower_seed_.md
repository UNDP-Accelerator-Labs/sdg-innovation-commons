3. Packaging materials and 
4. Production and warehousing structure.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Sunflower cake is high protein (18%+) used in production of feed for livestock. It can also be used as supplementary feed for free range cattle in the dry season and is good for dairy cattle. Therefore:
1. Income generation: Target markets are local stock feed manufacturing companies and cattle ranchers in Botswana. 
2. By-product being edible oil can be sold to refining enterprises. 
3. Sunflower seed being pressed into cake and edible oil instead of just being sold as seed constitutes the aspect of value addition. The process is environmentally friendly and can be set up in rural areas thereby giving small scale farmers a ready market for the seed.

> Technical Feasibility

The press is already on the market, can be obtained from Saro Engineering, etc.
The innovation here is that the sunflower seed can now be processed into a finished product or raw material for other enterprises at the village level.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Cattle rearing and other livestock constitutes wealth at village level. 
The demand for sunflower cake is very good and is on an upward trend as more people learn of the accrued  benefits from it's production and use.
