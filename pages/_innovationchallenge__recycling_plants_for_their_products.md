Cervecería Centro Americana S.A. and Reciclados de Centro América S.A. inaugurated the new PET recycling plant with the innovative BTB technology, a process through which post-consumer PET bottles are transformed into raw material to be remanufactured for use in the food industry.

The goal is to reach more than 14 thousand tons per year, equivalent to more than 700 vans. This process will contribute to saving resources, reducing pollution, extending the useful life of materials, reducing the volume of space occupied by plastic waste to prevent it from becoming garbage, and creating sources of direct and indirect jobs.
