## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Tactical urbanism to enhance municipal capacity for participatory design and development
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that municipalities have very few tools in their toolbox for participatory urban design and development, and most of them do not have the necessary skills to initiate new projects in this area. As a result, they rely on conventional methods for designing urban spaces which are limited to informing the public (in a top-down manner) or some form of consultation at best.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Our previous experiment in Gokceada (which used placemaking as a method) has shown us that there is an urgent need for municipalities and communities to come together for new participatory projects on urban design; unfortunately, good examples are scarce, even in big cities. Current applications of urban design follow down-top approaches that do not promote co-creation, responsible consumption, citizenship or other desirable qualities. They purely rely on municipalities’ decisions that are often made in a vacuum and the resulting spaces and structures lack creativity. Most importantly, there is very limited, if at all, citizen engagement. Therefore, utilisation remains low which often results in poor use of space and resources in the long run.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

The general overview of the public space design applications in Turkey shows that participatory methodologies are not adopted as much as needed. Only 1% of the public space design applications use participatory methods and 90% of them are practiced in Istanbul.  In general, there is a top-down, regular approach to design of public spaces.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Currently, this issue is not on the radar of the CO or any other development actor in the country. Our lab has already completed a project on participatory urban design and therefore has the experience and skills needed to accelerate progress in this area. Because the four interventions we have in mind are low-cost and relatively quick to implement, they are perfectly in line with the lab’s scope and ways of working. If we do not initiate new projects in this area, the CO will miss an opportunity to make an impact on an issue that has been neglected for a long time. Also, the specialist UN agency (UN-HABITAT) does not operate in Turkiye, so our intervention will fill an important gap.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

AccLab Turkiye’s tactical urbanism initiative in Izmir aims to set a good example for participatory and low-cost city-making.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can local authorities build organisational capacity to invest in and encourage community-led tactical urbanism? What barriers and opportunities exist? What are the local communities’ needs and priorities when it comes to creating flexible, short-term and low-cost urban interventions?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Ethnography has enabled us to understand the socio cultural structure, the context, social dynamics, needs and desires and strategies for constructive communication ground. Co-creation and participatory design will ensure citizens' and municipality's active involvement in the design of the public space.  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The gap in our understanding of the context will be filled in by ethnographic and socioeconomc data. Geospatial and drone data of the site is providing information to the design team.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Municipalities will be the main beneficiary here, but citizen initiatives/CBOs/NGOs will also benefit as they will be introduced to new ways of participating in decision-making and other aspects of urban life.
