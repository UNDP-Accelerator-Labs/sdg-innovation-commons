## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Engaging With Unusual Partners
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The challenge is that the UNDP Saudi Arabia CO works mainly with a regular and undiversified spectrum of counterparts. The vast majority are high level governmental bodies like ministries, general authorities and national centers.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

As the UNDP Saudi Arabia Country Office is operating in a Net Contributor Country (NCC) where the Saudi government is -almost the only donor and the main beneficiary/counterpart. This, after years led to a commonality in the counterparts/partners we work with. This loop is challenging not just for the CO only, but even for the counterparts that used to see and work with us in a rigid modality that doesn't necessarily serve our purposes or create a space to explore the potentials. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

According to the data taken from the UNDP Transparency Portal, as shown below, above 97% of the CO's budget for 2022 is coming from the Saudi government. The rest (less than 3%) is coming from the CO itself.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Regardless of several attempts by the Country Office to work with non-governmental partners, the Country Office hasn't had much success in signing projects with counterparts from the private sector and NGOs. Even though each attempt faced a different obstacle and had its conditions. 


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Saudi Accelerator Lab is attempting to bring in new partners such as NGOs and Private sectors as well as promoting multi-stakeholder partnerships between governments and the private sector.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The UNDP Saudi Accelerator Lab is exploring new ways of working with partners in Saudi Arabia to promote more inclusive multi-stakeholder opportunities.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we promote more bottom-up initiatives at UNDP? How can we promote a successful multi-stakeholder project?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are trying to find a successful method to co-create this platform with the relevant partners to define the features further. Through this platform, we will be creating a database of what is being done around the SDGs in KSA thematically and be able to document and celebrate local solutions. We hope this will be used as a versatile tool to connect all actors in the innovation ecosystem.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The level of documentation of community-oriented innovations is low. General data on the SDGs in KSA needs to be improved at a higher level, especially at a community/grassroots level.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Once discussions started with the private sector, we pitched the proposal to the Ministry of Economy and Planning who are a UNDP partner and the main custodians of the SDGs in KSA. We hope that through this joint collaboration, we could create sustainability for the platform. We see this platform benefit "Innovation Enablers" potentially, not only the "innovators". At a further stage, there could be a possibility of finding ways to engage the innovation enablers in activities such as crowdfunding/supporting.
