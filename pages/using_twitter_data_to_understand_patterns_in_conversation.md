## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Javier Brolo and María Inés Castañeda



> On date (Day/Month/Year)

September 17th, 2021



> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Knowledge management



> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

How to base decisions and behaviors on existing knowledge



> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

What makes it easier for decisions and behaviors to be informed by existing knowledge rather than starting from scratch?



> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (trial and error, prototype, a/b testing)
- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Civil Society/ NGOs
- Academia

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Diálogos; Universidad del Valle; Volunteer organizations


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to learn if access to new forms of data from social media such as Twitter, and open source tools for analysis such as R can help identify patterns in the conversation around a hashtag that can improve understanding of what everyday people say and inform ways to contribute to the conversation



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we use Twitter data and analyze it with R; THEN we will be able to understand patters in the conversation of everyday people around a topic



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We integrated some open-source

digital tools to access data from the Twitter API around a hashtag during a

period. Then we analyze that data using open-source software R to identify

patterns. We want to see if Twitter can be a way to collect real time data from

the perspective of citizens, something that is useful to different topics.



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Individual tweets



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Using R to collect information from the Twitter API



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

One week



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

This takes a bit of knowledge on data process and analysis using software R. We need to create a developer account in twitter, create an app, develop code to extract and analyze the information, use of visualization techniques. 


## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven. We were able to use Twitter data to

understand the conversation around a protest on Independence Day. 



> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

It was a good opportunity to use the hashtag that emerged organically. The way to communicate results is difficult to wider audiences. It is very easy to replicate, but there is a large learning curve in using the techniques. 



> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Less than one month.



> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

US$0.00



> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes. Now that we have working knowledge on how to gain access and use Twitter data, we are planning on generating data with the help of volunteer organizations.



> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

We are planning to scale the capacity to perform this data collection and analysis, to scale the use of twitter data for other topics, to scale the analysis from organic conversations to promote conversations



> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment did not scale yet
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We know that although it can be technically intensive, there are free alternatives to access and analyze twitter data. This capacity can be leveraged to generate and collect data on multiple topics. 



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

There are technical skills needed to use the tools. The results don't always translate into actions easily.



> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Across the Country Office and UNDP, there has been interest in social media data, but it's expensive and unsustainable. This capacity provides opportunities to incorporate society. 



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Government and Civil Society counterparts have also expressed interest in making more use of social media data to understand conversations. 



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

It required iterations to adjust the code and analysis. But it will now be replicated to include more interactive presentation of results. 



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Try to anchor the exercise on an existing project to increase chances of buy in. Given the technical requirements, expect that not everyone will feel capable to adopt the tools. 



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Certainly. The use of social media data in this way can be replicated in any topic. 



> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Exploration helped prioritize the opportunity of using Twitter data. 



> What surprised you?

It was surprising that this can be done for free, provided the technical capacity. The types of analysis possible, especially the co-ocurrance of words is quite interesting to help understand the conversation by seeing words that appear in the same tweet to gain context of it's meaning. For example, corruption was linked to privations in malnutrition, poverty, violence and impunity.
