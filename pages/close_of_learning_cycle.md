## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. There is a perception that large scale buyers like the government, international agencies and large companies need to put their money where their policies are and buy green 2. The first step to green purchasing is knowing what there is on offer. Buying green needs a national catalogue of green enterprises and initiatives. The public often don’t know what is available. 3. Some agencies lose out when the UNDP becomes involved because the association with us makes suppliers feel they have access to more resource than they actually have and this can lead to cost escalation. The UNDP should be discreet in some situations (where green enterprises are young, have little power and prices can fluctuate widely).  4. On the flipside, the visibility provided by the UNDP can go a long way to boosting businesses in the eyes of local communities and improve their opportunities.  5. Alongside financing, green entrepreneurs need mentors. Any future work with grassroots innovators should factor in project managers and small-scale business mentors. Mentors could be guided by a green enterprise training curriculum and a better understanding of how to communicte values related to the SDGs.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

- Administrative challenges: Learning the UNDP Procurement system  - Pandemic challenges: Unable to physically interact with experiments, innovators and solutions  - Environmental challenges with regard to unpredictable seasonality (some of the green enterprises in our case depended upon seasonal activities) - Some innovators did not have sufficient capacity to implement experimental interventions, despite receiving training from UNDP. As such, they required hands-on support  - UNDP affiliation with some smaller projects was not always beneficial to the innovators. For example, a supplier of services to one grassroots partner, substantially increased their costs upon hearing that their initiative was affiliated with the UNDP

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There was very little data available on the green economy in Trinidad and Tobago, and the information that was available was somewhat disparate. There is also no repository or network of stakeholders in this space. This is why we developed an innovation ecosystem map and a report on the green economy based on desk research and literature review.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We deployed the Innovation Challenge method to identify existing solutions in the space and determine experiments to fund. Because the space is crowded but disparate, we wanted to ensure that interventions were user led and user designed.  Also, there is a lack of standardization locally with regard to green terminology and classification of activities in the green economy, so we chose a qualitative, exploratory approach, as opposed to use of fixed international metrics and standards.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

CARIRI - Caribbean Industrial Research Institute  - CARIRI provided capacity building training to applicants from our innovation challenge Actual grassroots innovators who applied to our Innovation Challenges - These stakeholder/beneficiaries actually implemented innovative solutions with our support. One example is an organization that trained inmates from the Women's Prison in high-tech agricultural skills and developed a hydroponic greenhouse at the prison. Other examples of Stakeholder/Beneficiaries include:    -- De Jeunesse Bath and Body Products: Body Soaps made from Sargassum Seaweed    -- Ecowash: Water efficient car washing pods used to create empowerment and employment for youth in at-risk communities    -- La Creacion De Dios: Empowerment of rural farming communities, producing fertilizers and cattle feed from fish waste    -- Rainforest Agricultural Consultancy: Teaching High Tech Agriculture skills to incarcerated women

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Nudge Caribbean Business Incubator - Organic collaboration occurred to provide small grant funding and technical support to some innovators from the challenge who were producing consumable eco-friendly products

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Planning - Selected participants for the Innovation Challenge CARIRI

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

1. GEF SGP: Brought forward a host of contacts and insight into the green space; provided insight for selection and exclusion criteria of enterprises.  2. All of the micro-innovators from the Innovation Challenge would not normally have been UNDP partners. In this case, they brought their ideas/solutions.  3. Nudge Caribbean Business Incubator: We ended up funding the same project and sharing insights

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Global Environment Fund Small Grants Programme (GEF SGP) - We coordinated with the GEF-SGP to conduct a Green Innovation Challenge. The insight of the Coordinator was important to selecting projects that were new, not duplicating existing work and conceptualizing the challenge. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

Direct interaction with grassroots stakeholders provides particular insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the people who are actually working to solve local challenges. These insights have guided the support that we will provide in the second year. The value of visibility and working out loud. Innovators were able to successfully scale their initiatives thanks to their publicized involvement with the Lab, as well as the marketing materials that we enabled them to create.
