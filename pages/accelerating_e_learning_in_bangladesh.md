Online education has been gaining grounds all around the world, essentially because of convenience and cost-effectiveness. The pandemic, imposing its ravages on on-site in-person schooling, generated a boost for online education. However, online education is dependent on the availability of ICT infrastructure, hardware, and software, which are expensive and thus, invariably place developing countries among the community of nations, and resource-poor segments of population within each country in a highly disadvantaged position. The impact of the pandemic on education in Bangladesh has been an alarming “education deficit”, and in the underprivileged rural sector, a deficit of a disastrous proportion.  To address this education deficit, Accelerator Lab Bangladesh, in collaboration with the Volunteers Association for Bangladesh (VAB) supported 191 digitally underprivileged high school students from 9 schools across 5 districts (Jashore, Satkhira, Kurigram, Nilphamari and Pabna) to receive e-learning for their 2021 Secondary School Certificate (SSC) preparation via tablets and digital contents related to the three Science subjects on which the exam in the Science “stream” was held – Physics, Chemistry and Biology. A picture is attached of the students with the distributed tabs.
