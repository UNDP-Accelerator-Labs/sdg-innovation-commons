> Description of the solution

The Western Balkans' agri-food sector, dominated by small-scale businesses, has significant potential. However, it faces challenges in attracting foreign investment and requires modernization through digitalization and sustainable practices. The European Training Foundation's project aims to address these issues by connecting SMEs with innovation actors, facilitating peer learning, and fostering cross-border cooperation. This initiative will help the region's agri-food sector become more competitive and sustainable, preparing it for integration into the EU single market.
