> Title of the innovation

Sustainable Energy development in Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

Zambia's present energy situation is that generating plants availability is low and the demand-supply gap is crippling. Energy is supposed to be the bedrock of a nation's economy. 
As the government is trying to attain its set goal of 2030 universal access there is greater need to incorporate private sector or individuals with a passion to achieve that goal. There is a need for electricity reform and the fist step being passing an electricity law to allow private investment and establishment of regulatory agencies to set tariffs through Energy Regulation Board which will allow for unbundling the national transmission and distribution businesses.
My innovation is a focus on energy development to sustain economic growth country wide.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income for me as it will be what I call 'hot cake' product. What do I mean by this? Everyone needs solar power because its cheaper and clean. So in turn generating an income for me. It will contribute to the operation of other businesses by contributing to the coverage of power because right now about only 4% of rural and 67% of urban are on the grid. My target market is both rural &amp; urban but urban being the initial plan as most SMEs are in the urban. 
The prize will definitely help grow the business as it will muscle up the final requirements to take off and cover most areas for a start.
My innovation obviously adds value to the environment as its a clean solution.

> Technical Feasibility

There is no prototype yet but my proposed implementation plan covers all key urban towns since most SMEs are in these areas as phase one and then rural areas as phase two.
As resources presents themselves will move from town to town at a time. So the plan depends on resources available.

> Anticipated Social Impact

An extensive solar energy roll-out could help the government attain its 2030 goal; universal access and also help improve people's lives as this improves the services of the SMEs that cant afford paying bills for zesco power and also help extend their operating hours. For example fishermen is far rural areas will be able to preserve their fish before they can transport to the central market place the following market day.
