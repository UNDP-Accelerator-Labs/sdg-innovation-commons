His name is Oumar CAMARA, grew up in Sierra Léon  and has joinned Guinea a decade before. from this picture, we see a single and simple man but when we try to discuss and go a little bit deeper, we discover the other side of the isberg hidden by the wall of modesty.  Let's together read the story of Oumar, our former english teacher transformed throught the impact of covid-19 to an isolant seller.

Oumar Camara has started to monetize his knowledge of english in a school in the city of Kamsar where at the begining, everything was fine and with the time, he took advantage of the fact that Guinea scholarship is less expensive and the program spread the taught program has a shortfall in English. However, we will remember that for the years felt, the government of the Republic of Guinea has focused heavily on strengthening the training capacity of teachers and on the other hand is the need for a professional working language where it was introduced. idea of ​​ensuring that children from elementary school can start studying this language very early. It is therefore in this momentum that our friend Oumar CAMARA has established himself.

And as we know in any case there are ups and downs, our friend Oumar after this good period of grace began to have delays on the wages which was due for the work done despite all the revision and proposal of Alleviation of payment for management hardly changed anything. In the end, he even deduced that it was the management that refused. While the latter gave every effort to be able to respect its commitment and ensure that the damage is minimized. Against all expectations, the covid-19 pendemic has upset the majority of our abitudes and even the most fundamental such as the payment of schooling due to the closure of many businesses and restrictions on motion to certain destinations.

Faced with all these elements which constitute a strong alibi of disuasion to remain indulgent. not long after, Oumar by a coup de grace, found himself promoted to the post of director. From that moment on, Oumar said he was able to quickly receive his salary (s) given that the arrears were a significant portion. On the strength of his new position, Oumar was surprised by the parents' non-reaction to his appeal for payment of school fees. As we raise the curtain on a surprising situation, Oumar suffered a big shock when he finally realized that all this time he was struggling to warm up the management when the reality was totally different. After several recall attempts, he was forced to throw in the towel. Nothing more could be added to it. This is how our friend finds himself in search of a solution to meet his needs and ends up realizing and admitting that everything had to be redone. Surrounded by his friends and brothers, he receives some suggestions of resilience in the face of this lean cow situation among which he brilliantly welcomes the idea of ​​trying his luck in the sale of protective plastics normally intended to pack televisions and other equipment. classified very fragile. In any case, we call it a "float" because of its property of floating on liquid surfaces. 

According to Oumar, the sale of insulation is very easy and quick in terms of generating money as it allows him to earn between 900,000 and 1,500,000 gnf on average and per month, which is much better compared to his old profile. Oumar uses his links in conakry for its supply by isolating collected from repair shops for electronic equipment and or from surrounding markets where the majority of insulation is collected as soon as the freezer boxes and others are opened without forgetting the fact that he makes great use of his fraternal relationships to expand his network of suppliers. Fortunately for him up to this day, everything is going very well. Oumar often pauses the question if for him although the Corona Virus is a difficult burden for all humanity, the fact remains that for him and some of his condition in particular it is rather a solution that has arrived at the right time?

so we wonder, but what is the use of the insulation or floats sold by our friend?
Well behave yourself because, the fishermen rush to the lots of floats to use it, once mixed with oil which gives a sticky and opaque mixture that does not let the water pass under any pretex. In short, it is a perfect element which spread over the sides of the boat, prevents water penetration. AND for our friend Oumar, this is a real positive means of recycling that we could well popularize in order to contribute to the good behavior of the environment.

It is therefore on this end note that Oumar CAMARA gratifies us with this smile while hoping to tell us the rest of his story which according to him must necessarily have a future extract retracing his return to teaching because for him "TEACHING" is the best commitment we can make to the community that has given us everything.


Thank you
