## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

We focused on innovators who won the Ghana Accelerator Lab’s Covid-19 Innovation Challenge at the end of 2020. In 2021, we used Theory U as a guiding framework, based on our experience of successfully completing the Theory U Action Learning Lab led by the Presencing Institute/UNDP from March-June 2021. We put our learning into practice by applying key Theory U principles with some of the winners.  Why did we apply Theory U? We felt it would increase the chances of innovators turning their proposals into reality by making guided reflection a key part of their innovation journeys. We wanted them to: see the AccLab as a key partner on their journeys; see their innovations with fresh pairs of eyes; think with a systems lens and work collectively with other innovators to scale up and perhaps achieve system-wide change; identify unproductive patterns of behaviour which might hinder development of innovations; and be honest about seeing potential solutions from the perspectives of end-users and communities.  The Innovation Challenge winners were paired with members of the AccLab team and/or buddied with other innovators where possible, or external partners. A WhatsApp group was created to encourage sharing of ideas.  The AccLab and the innovators worked through a tailored Theory U approach. Key stages included listening (to oneself and others); seeing the development context in Ghana with a fresh pair of eyes/from different perspectives; sensing from the edges to look at systems and potential solutions in unusual ways; presencing; crystallizing and prototyping solutions.  We initially had one-to-one discussions with the innovators on Zoom, but after a while we held in-person workshops with groups of innovators in Kumasi (in Ghana’s Ashanti Region) and Tamale (in the Northern Region) to help the innovators to see development challenges from different perspectives. Due to time intensive nature of the process, not all the innovators completed the process – but those who did include:   - Ghana Stammering Association: developed a web-app for PWS (Persons Who Stammer)   - PHG and community health volunteers: developed Covid-19 communication for rural communities.   - Asa Nwura: implementation of community-based plastics recycling.   - Poona Briquettes: developed an affordable energy solution to turn rice husks into rice briquettes   - Bukyia: development of a cloud kitchen concept. 1. It’s not always about money: With minimal financial support, innovators are developing potential solutions to various development challenges – amazing frugal innovations are everywhere. Securing finance can be a problem but is not the answer to every question. Often, solutions from an Innovation Challenge are simply not investment-ready and attempts to scale up prematurely lead to failure and disappointment. Implementing Theory U by “letting go” enabled some of our innovators to see these realities and pivot from their original proposal and strongly held beliefs.  2. Yet another Innovation Challenge? An increasing number of innovators are becoming very adept at “Innovation Challenge shopping”, as different development partners in Ghana come up with the same concepts for their Innovation Challenges. This makes sense for the Challenge Winners in terms of developing expertise in pitching their ideas and securing funding. However, it can also lead to duplication and groupthink among innovators - they are not confronted with the realities of going to the financial and other markets to secure funding, and do not share their knowledge and experiences. The result is that the innovations do not collectively achieve the system wide impact necessary to accelerate progress towards the SDGs.  3. Men’s Club and Usual Suspects: The innovation ecosystem appears to be overwhelmingly male and because of innovation challenge shopping, it often involves the same people.  4. Using Theory U to create an environment for asking difficult questions: We found that applying the Theory U framework of methods was very effective in getting the innovators to think through their motivations for becoming innovators, their perceptions about the value of their innovations, and the critical role of end-users and markets. This is translating into better outcomes when they meet potential investors.   5. Resource intensive: The Theory U process can be resource intensive, requiring real commitment from all innovators – many struggled.

A blog on the application of Theory U is being prepared - but we are waiting for some of the&nbsp; innovators to complete before finalising.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, here are blogs/articles summarising the work of some of those who have completed, but not focusing on Theory U, as that was a means to an end, not the main objective. https://www.gh.undp.org/content/ghana/en/home/library/rice-husks-to-cooking-fuel--a-grassroots-experimenters-journey.html

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The main barriers are the resource intensive nature of the process (it can be quite mentally taxing and takes time) and it can be uncomfortable requiring a high level of trust and honesty. As the AccLab we had to question our own motives in setting up the Innovation Challenge and some of the assumptions we were making about the innovators. The innovators often had to challenge strongly held beliefs about their own motivations, capabilities and fears.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We felt that without confronting behaviours, beliefs, and underlying assumption first, our innovators might repeat mistakes they had made previously. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We felt that without confronting behaviours, beliefs, and underlying assumption first, our innovators might repeat mistakes they had made previously. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ghana Stammering Association (worked with them to apply Theory U principles to support implementation of the istammer web app)  Ghana Federation of Disability Organisations (as the umbrella organisation for disability organisations, provided a policy context for disability innovation in Ghana)  Asa Nwura (worked with them to apply Theory U principles and implement further improvements in their waste management project)  PHG (worked with them to apply Theory U principles and implement further improvements in their volunteering approach) 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Indirectly, but worth mentioning. The action learning Lab on Theory U was delivered by the Presencing Institute, and many of the materials we then applied with local innovators drew upon material provided by them. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Poona Briquettes (worked with them to apply Theory U principles and implement the production of rice briquettes)
