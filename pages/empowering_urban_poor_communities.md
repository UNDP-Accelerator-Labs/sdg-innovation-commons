## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Urban poor communities, officially categorised as People in need of social welfare services (PPKS), have received social rehabilitation programs by the government. However, these programs have not been sustainable, resulting in these communities' return to the streets to resume informal and often precarious economic activities.  

2. PPKS do have access to some digital services and use them in their day-to-day activities. However, existing digital services are not designed around their usage patterns, nor to meet their needs.


3. Many of the challenges experienced by PPKS are connected to difficulties in obtaining legal documents. Lack of possession of a national ID becomes an obstacle in securing employment and accessing public services.

4. In reality, PPKS members possess certain skills that unfortunately have not been formally recognised. In addition, there are existing PPKS networks that can be leveraged to strengthen their ability to support one another. Still, their capacities are limited.

5. There is an opportunity to leverage on these findings and develop an intervention that could potentially support them secure additional/alternative means of livelihoods.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

So far we have completed the ethnographic study phase. The learnings from this will be used to design a piloting project in 2024.
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Using these data types allowed us to hear firsthand from People in Need of Social Welfare Service (PPKS). This was valuable, particularly for insights relating to the digital habits of PPKS. The government partners (Ministry of Social Affairs and National Development Planning Agency) we have been in conversation with claimed that ethnographic data did not exist and this type of data could help them to shape their policy.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

These methods gave People in Need of Social Welfare Services the space to express themselves and their needs.
## Partners

> Please indicate what partners you have actually worked with for this learning challenge.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

When seeking a bottom-up perspective, it is imperative for those of us at the programmatic level to meet marginalised communities where they are at. 

In this case, in order to understand the existing barriers to social inclusion, particularly in a digital context, it helps to understand the current digital and spending habits of the communities in question.


> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
