In recent years, more and more companies have emerged in Viet Nam to sell natural, organic and handmade soaps. Sapo, a firm in Hoi An, has recycled 300 liters of used-cooking oil to produce chemical-free kitchen soap in the last five years. These organic soaps are also known to be free of unsustainable palm oil and largely reduce the amount of wastewater released into the environment.
