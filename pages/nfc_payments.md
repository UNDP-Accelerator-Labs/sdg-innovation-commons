> Title of the innovation

NFC payments

> Brief description of the innovation

Zolipay is a micro payment system based of NFC Cards and devices that support NFC.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Unlike mobile money, funds transferred to the Zolipay network are intended for specific usages such as transportation and micro payments. Vendors will be able to analyze transfers in realtime at a fee.

> Technical Feasibility

The customer swipes their  smart phone/NFC card on the vendor interface (smart device/phone). This initiates an instant and secure process for the transaction to commence. The system can work offline.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Zolipay aims to provide digital inclusion and transparency. We believe that we reduce the cost of tracing small incremental monetary movements.
