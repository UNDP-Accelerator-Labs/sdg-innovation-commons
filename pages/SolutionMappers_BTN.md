# "Bhutan's Innovative Approach to Addressing Youth Unemployment through Ethnographic Research and Systems Thinking"

### [[0:00]] Good morning\. So shall we start the interview with you introducing yourself frankly?

Thank you\. So I'm Tshering Wangmo, I work as the Head of solution to mapping with the UNDP Bhutan Country Office\.

### [[0:12]] OK, thank you\. And do we have your consent of the recording today?

Definitely\.

### [[0:17]] OK\. So could you share with us the your R&D story, the journey that you have been on, what you've been working on, the topics and a little bit of the background on that?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[skills:Opportunity framing]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[skills:Videos]]
There are a few stories, but I would like to focus on one particular one that's very close to my heart\. This is the work around the youth unemployment issue that you are, you know, we were facing in Bhutan\. The issue was that while there was this rising youth unemployment issue, but there were also, you know, dual challenges\. Young people were not young people without jobs, but at the same time young people were not willing to take up jobs\. That's already there in the market\. So there was this dual challenge that we were facing\. So that's why we sort of like really wanted to venture into this and, you know, deep dive to understand what the real issue was\. So after the deep dive, what are the challenges that you set out to tackle? There were a lot of, you know, underlying causes\. So we adopted the systems thinking and design approach for this particular issue\. And the one thing that really stood out from, you know, apart from the conventional challenges that were identified through other researchers, one thing that came out very strong was the mindset issue\. There was this very strong mindset around, you know, first one is in terms of the young people themselves not be not wanting to take a blue collar job, you know, versus white collar\. But at the same time, there were also some, you know, mindset issues around the policy makers, around the parents\. So that was something that stood out really, you know, that really stood out as a part of the entire process that we, you know, that we had as a for this particular issue\.

### [[1:52]] Yeah\. Oh, so I heard about the mindset problem from multiple stakeholders around this issue\. So how did you design the I and the initiative that are tackling this multiple mindsets of the stakeholders\.

[[tools:Ethnography]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
So one key tool that we used is the ethnographic research\. I wouldn't really call it the very conventional ethnographic research because that takes a lot of time, but what we call it the quick and dirty ethnographic research\. So this one was mainly looking at really trying to understand, you know, what is really causing young people to not take up the jobs that stay in the market\. But at the same time, also the ethnographic research was not limited to the young people understanding the young people's mindset\. As I mentioned, you know, we also sort of found out that it was also the parents and the policy makers, you know, who had a very different mindset that was also contributing to the rising with unemployment in Bhutan\. So we also did this ethnographic research for the parents of the young people that we were, you know, that we were interviewing\.

### [[2:47]] So, OK, So with the ethnographic research that you mentioned as the main tools, what are the associated skills? Are they the skills that you already have or something that you need to double up in order to undertake this research?

[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
I think ethnographic research is a skill set in itself\. We didn't really have it within the country office\. So I think this is where we sort of like reached out to the global team and this is where Basque came in to support us\. We conducted the two days ethnographic research training to not just for the for the UNTP colleagues, but we also, because this is a joint project with the government\. So we also engaged the government policy makers who also had to go out in the field and talk to the young people and the parents to be able to empathize in terms of, you know, what they were thinking, you know, and also to sort of like reflect in terms of what they were thinking\. So I think it's a very different skill set in itself\. And we required, you know, training a proper training to be able to go out in the field to do it\.

### [[3:44]] Wow, that sounds really fascinating, especially with the part that you engage with government officials to co\-implement this\. Co\-conducted the ethnographic research\. Are there challenges that you did not anticipate and come out as a surprise during this process? Because it's something quite unconventional, right?

[[principles:Inclusivity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[tactics:Finding new alternatives]]
Challenges, I would say, wouldn't really say there were a lot of challenges, but I think one of the biggest challenge was while we were implementing this, you know, COVID hit so that was one of the biggest challenge\. We couldn't really we were initially targeting different communities in different regions because those are we cannot consider them as a homogeneous group\. So we wanted to actually go to different communities from different regions to understand the different mindset that's coming from there\. But because COVID hit and then there was this lockdown and everything, so we were not able to travel a lot\. So, so our the ethnographic research was just limited to two districts\. So that was one of the challenge we faced\.

### [[4:48]] OK, so I hear about limitation in term of the scope of the area\. How about in terms of the depth of the information? Do you feel like through your ethnographic research, you are able to attain the depth of information that really helped to generate strategic solutions after the after the understanding phase?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Immersion and engagemen]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:Collective intelligence for the analysis of emerging signals]]
So then we, we actually adopted combination of tools\. So what of course, one is the ethnographic research, but one thing that we also used was the iceberg model that really helped us unearth, you know, what are the mental models that's currently existing, existing in the ecosystem when we talk about youth, the rising youth unemployment\. So the two of two of these tools put together really helped us and we did a lot of, you know, workshops and then collective intelligence workshops where we brought in not just the young people themselves, but we also brought in students\. Because when you're talking about the rising youth unemployment, it's these students are the kids, the children's school going children will eventually come into the labor market\. So we also wanted to understand their perception in terms of, you know, how do they look at the labor market that's currently in Bhutan\. So a combination of this deep diving through the iceberg model as well as the ethnographic research really helped\. So it's a combination of the tools\.

### [[6:07]] Yes\. Thank you for your sharing about the tools\. I also like to ask you a little bit more on the principal level as well\. So we see the tools of ethnography of the iceberg analysis model\. How about in term of principle? What would you say are the key principles that help drive this initiative?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[tools:Ethnography]]
One is in terms of being on the same page before we actually ventured into doing ethnographic research, as I mentioned, we had, you know, young people actually volunteer to do that ethnographic research with us\. And we also had policy makers\. So we all have to come to a consensus in terms of what is it that we want to actually go out in the field to do when you're talking about ethnographic research\. And one of the key principles is going out into the field with a very open mind, not having any prejudices around, you know, what is, you know, what will be said and you know, so having this open\-ended questionnaire, but that too, you know, sort of like keeping it very open\. So I think one was in terms, one critical principle we had was this open mindedness\. Everybody had to go to the field with a very open mind\.

### [[7:12]] Yeah\. Anything else you'd like to add?

No\.

### [[7:15]] OK\. Then I just picked up what you just shared about something information that you gather from the ground, like really bottom up approach and connecting that with the policy level\. I would imagine that there's something very challenging\. You have a wealth of information of insights from on the ground up, but then how do that connect and translate into the world of the policy level? Because at that level, sometimes they're not very familiar with, you know, this really human story\. So can you share a little bit more about the tools or maybe the skills that you apply in order to connect two worlds?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
I think one critical well point to the, the process that we adopted\. I wouldn't, I, I'm not very sure what kind, what skill we would actually call it\. But when we initially started on this particular journey, we engaged the policy makers from the very beginning, from day one and going into the, you know, data collection as well as well as data analysis\. So we actually sat together, made sense of all the data that was generated\. So they and also them also the policy makers being engaged in ethnographic research themselves sort of like really helped us in terms of not really having to go that extra mile to explain to them what, what kind of insights have been generated from the field\. So one I would say is, you know, but other, other skill set that was quite critical, I would say would be in terms of communication\. You know, whatever insights that we generated from the field, you know, we had to through human stories, as you mentioned, through human stories, we had to communicate, to communicate those insights to the policymakers\. For example, we had this presentation of this work that we did on the youth unemployment to the members of the Parliament\. And there we didn't really take the traditional approach of, you know, explaining to them what the process was and all that\. But rather we want we told them stories that we heard from the field\. So we developed what we call the personas\. So, you know, that was the sense making that we did to actually make sense of all the insights that were generated\. So we sort of like shared those stories with the with the members of the parliament and the one thing that sort of like came out very strongly\. The pattern that was generated was, you know, the social, social background of these young people that were identified as a part of the ethnographic research\. And that one I would say was, you know, one thing, one insight was that all of these young people who are randomly selected came from broken families\. So all these, you know, information that were that we got, we sort of like communicated in the form of stories to the members of the parliament\. And I think this is where we were able to strike a chord with them because they sort of like understood when it came out as stories to them that, you know, oh, you know, maybe this is where we need to actually look at, you know, coming up with, you know, coming up with interventions\. So the, the, the broken families being one\.

### [[10:06]] I see\. That's really interesting\.

I think that's maybe one of the important tactics of all the information and insight that you gather from on the ground\. The way of communicating it through the member of Parliament, it has to be through storytelling persona, really human, human story that really communicate with people\.

### [[10:25]] Thank you\. And how about the impact? So after all this communication that you have with the policy level people, member of Parliament, what do you see as the impact of this R&D journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
The impact I would say would be the openness for the policy makers to sit down with the not really calling them beneficiaries, but you know, the young people themselves sitting down with them to Co design the solutions\. I think that was something that came out very, this was done like, you know, because it's always been top down the approach\. But this was I think the first case where we actually sat down with the young people themselves to understand their issues as well as Co design solutions with them\. So we developed a portfolio of solutions looking at diverse, you know, factors within the ecosystem\. So I would say that would be one of the impact\. The other one would be other one is in terms of ownership from the policymakers, the government, the ministry of the, we actually particularly worked with the Ministry of Labor and Human Resources, who has the mandate to create that enabling conditions for employment generation\. So this is where you know, you know, the Ministry of Labor took full ownership of the, of the findings for from this youth unemployment work and they started implementing it\. So it wasn't just, you know, them implementing the portfolio of solutions with the UNDP, but also going beyond to explore other partners\. So they started working with ADB to look at how can they improve the job portal system, which also came out as one of the, you know, findings from the OR the recommendations from the from the from this work\.

### [[12:00]] Wow, that sounds great\. So it seems like the mindset and the way of working has really been taken up by the partner, even beyond the scope of the focus of this project\. How about the things that doesn't work so well, We have seen now the impact anything that you think didn't turn out as you expect or could have worked better in this journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[tools:Human centered design]]
[[tools:Portfolio approach]]
I think some of the key lessons would be when we were sort of like designing the portfolio of solutions\. I think it will also be critical we would have, we should have actually identified potential development partners or donors who would be interested in taking this forward\. Because while we have designed this portfolio of solutions and we have, you know, been implementing it, but there are certain portfolios because it these are all interconnected solutions, right? So if few of the solutions does not take up, then it will not have that intended impact\. And this is I think in a way what happened\. You know, we had we did have this in a portfolio, but there was a lot of cherry picking in terms of what the solutions were\. You know, some of the solutions that were that were implemented and then there were some solutions which are not implemented\. So I think in a way that really didn't really that, you know, the chicken, the cherry picking of the solutions didn't really bring about that bigger impact that we actually wanted\. And other thing, you know, if I could, you know, one of the key lesson that we learned was, you know, how to be much more future oriented because, you know, I wouldn't really say that it became redundant\. But I think the concept of making this entire R&D work much more future oriented is critical because after COVID, a lot of the young people started like, you know, moving, you know, moving out of the country\. So that also sort of like made the made the work a little redundant, I would say\.

### [[13:53]] Can you elaborate, elaborate a little bit more what you mean by being more future oriented? Like if you can go back in time and redesign how you journey on this R&D thing, how would you do it differently to be more vision oriented?

[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
One way, one thing that I would have done a little differently would be in terms of integrating the concept of foresight into the process at using foresight as another tool, because I think that also helps you look beyond, you know, what is currently there\. So having, you know, looked at the pattern of, you know, how the youth unemployment situation might actually emerge, you know, post COVID, I think that was something that we didn't really, you know, have as an as an integral component during our work\. So if you could, you know, if I could revisit it again, I think the, the foresight would be one of the tool that I would have actually integrated into the, into the process\.

### [[14:48]] So I hear the combination of ethnographic research, iceberg analysis to understand the present and combining with foresight or the future thinking to have the present and the future together\.

Yes, yes\.

### [[15:01]] And any last word that you would like to share regarding your R&D journey? Anything that's really close to your heart coming out of this journey?

[[skills:Imagination]]
[[skills:Foresight]]
[[principles:Time management and adaptability]]
[[tools:Design thinking]]
I think over the, you know, while implementing this particular project or looking at this development issue, One skill that I would sort of I built is in terms of looking at things more at the systems level\. I think I've built my muscle in terms of being able to go to the balcony to see the forest, but at the same time also be able to come down to the ground floor to see the trees\. So you know, this, I think this is one of the skill set that, you know, I sort of acquired, you know, I, I, I was able to develop as a part of this process\. So I think this and this is the kind of skills that I would\.
