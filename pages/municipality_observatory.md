## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Municipality Observatory 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to create a systematized methodology for data collection that allows the City Council of Praia to generate information to support actions.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Together with the team of the largest municipality in the country, Cidade da Praia, with 25% of the population, we identified the need for the agents that act on the ground raising the problems, of a systematized methodology of data collection to allow the generation of metrics, behavioral insights, statistics, and patterns of situations and behaviors that allow the generation of information to support actions.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

CMP currently has 20 field agents collecting data on paper. This archaic collection does not allow the systematization of information, making it difficult to analyze the data and prioritize actions, as well as to provide evidence to partners.   This evidence was collected through meetings with the CMP team. They have information sheets that are being updated as the agents fill them out. But the sheets are not entered into any system afterwards.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

The whole country has an information deficit at various levels.  The municipalities, by being on the ground and in the communities are a huge potential of local data collection that in addition to serving the local power, can also serve the whole country. In all areas / domains which we met internally and externally, we identified information gaps in various areas, exemplifying some:   Social - Families in difficult situations.  Sanitation - open air garbage dumps, insufficient containers, piles of debris or rubble in the neighborhoods, standing water. Territorial - clandestine constructions, road signs or walkways in need of intervention. Child protection - Signalization of children at risk (child labor, rape). Health - Signs on handicapped people, people with chronic diseases. Environment - Disaster risks


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This project emerged from an exploratory process with the main entity - the Municipal Council of Praia - and with the various UNDP portfolios dealing with each sector of the specific area.   All the areas have identified problems that are normally conducted in isolation by each entity, not in an integrated manner and with multiplication of efforts on the ground.   This project aims to bring the added value of being able to act in an integrated manner in all areas, creating and cross referencing information that can serve various players in different areas and sectors.   Inclusively, data will be made available and cross-referenced with other existing E-gov databases, such as the Single Social Registry, which collects social data from families and has as its main purpose the provision of social pensions.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The  Municipality Observatory of Praia is a mirror of 25% of the country's problems and where it allows transversal data to be provided to local and central authorities for better action based on evidence.
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

CMP - Camara Municipal da Praia - Praia City Municipality. UNDP Portfolios: Health, Social Inclusion, Child Protection, Economic Development (almost all portfolios have an entry point in this project with data demand). Ministry of Family and Social Protection. Ministry of Health. NOSI - State entity responsible for e-governance


</div>



<div class="group">


> What sector does our partner belong to?


</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The municipality will be the project owner and data collector.   The portfolios will be the bridge with each respective area of government in terms of data needs.   Ministries will be involved for the analysis and cross-referencing of data that is identified as necessary.   We count on NOSi for technical support so that the system is integrated within the government's logic of e-governance.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

The answers to this challenge will be the data collected that will serve the various partners involved.   Meanwhile, we will monitor how the data will impact the planning and action of each entity.   We intend to do this monitoring of learnings through surveys.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data collection will be based on custom development adapted to the needs of the project.   We will use the techniques of collective intelligence, design thinking and co-creation to design the system together with the partners.   We intend to carry out agile development methodologies that allow interaction by sprints.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The community agents who are our data collectors in the field already have a long field experience, knowing the community. This asset will be very important for the success of the experiment.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The system will be developed on the scale of a single municipality. But the reality of other municipalities is quite similar, given the small size of the country. Since the municipality of Praia is the largest in the country, it will be a test that, in case of success, will be replicable to the remaining 21 municipalities of the country, with the necessary adaptations. The entire development process will be carried out with this objective in mind
