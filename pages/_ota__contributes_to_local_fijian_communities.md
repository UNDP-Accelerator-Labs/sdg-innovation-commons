When you book a holiday with TravelOnline you are making a difference to a local Fijian community. For every Fiji holiday package booked with this OTA, one is directly supporting social housing, education and welfare for Fijian families in need.

TravelOnline first partnered with Koroipita Project back in 2019, contributing FJ$12,000 towards building a new home for a Fiji family in need. As seen above, four members of their team traveled to Koroipita in rural Fiji to get involved by helping to build a new home for a Fijian family.

What is the "Holiday with Heart" concept?
TravelOnline was about to begin production when Covid hit and had to pause all operations since. Recently, the project has opened up again. TravelOnline customers arriving in Fiji will each receive an Eco Beach bag upon arrival. Bags are handmade with love with a special boutique operated by a group of women living in Koroipita  - part of a social enterprise program.


What makes these eco bags unique?
All bags have the same turtle design made from recycled fabric offcuts! Sizes are made to fit beach towels and other holiday essentials. On top of that, inside each bag is a story card explaining the charity with a QR code - customers can choose to donate directly if they wish.
