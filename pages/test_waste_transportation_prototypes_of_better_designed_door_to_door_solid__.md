## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Test waste transportation prototypes of better-designed door to door solid waste collection  
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to test prototypes of better designed door to door solid waste collection pushcarts and create an opportunity for environmentally friendly solid waste management and equal job opportunity for women with in the eco system.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Solid waste management (SWM) in an urban area is a complex activity that involves the collection, transportation, sorting, recycling, resource recovery and disposal of solid waste. Municipal solid waste is composed of different wastes generated by households and different institutions such as schools, hospitals, slaughter houses and public toilets. In Ethiopia, the world bank estimates that 50% of the waste generated is collected through the formal municipal waste collection system, and more than 50% of the collected waste is often disposed at uncontrolled landfills. Lack of suitable infrastructure to support the need of growing urban area and population growth, low implementation of regulations, and disinterest from households in sorting waste plague the current system of waste management with low formal recycling, illegal dumping of waste in rivers and open dumping in an over capacity landfill.

Waste collection rates are often lower than 70% in low-income countries and more than 50% of the collected waste is often disposed of through uncontrolled land filling. Ethiopia is one of the low-income countries facing the consequence of improper solid waste management. It was reported that about 20 to 30% of the waste generated in Addis Ababa, the capital city, remains uncollected. Proper solid waste management requires the commitment of the town municipality and the active involvement of the community members. There are many initiatives taking place in Ethiopia to improve the environmental health.

Improper solid waste management (SWM) is a major public health and environmental concern in the urban areas of many developing countries. The value chain of solid waste management within the country is not clear because there is a highly active informal sector alongside formal waste collecting that contributed greatly to recycling and reusing of waste.  Therefore, it is challenging to quantify the amount directly ending up in landfill and what goes to recycling at the household and sorting association level. The current stakeholders who are engaged in the solid waste business are environmental agencies, waste collection transportation agencies, sorting and recycling associations, compost making associations, research institutes and municipalities.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our lab conducted a deep dive exercise to deeply understand what the challenges were in solid waste collection activity. The existing push carts are not specifically designed for waste collection and didn’t consider the type of waste, the road situation and most importantly ease of use for all as it is very labour-intensive women waste collection association members were having difficult time to operate it. Therefore, Acc lab will bring in prototyping and user testing exercise to make the existing pushcarts more efficient and convenient for the users/waste collectors. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

How might better designed collection carts create an opportunity for environmentally friendly waste management and equal work opportunity for women?

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

This is a continuation of our work on solid waste management with NAMA Compost and Sheger Projects. Different pushcart prototypes will be tested with three city municipalities namely, Addis Ababa, Bahir Dar and Adama to see how the prototypes will perform in improving the efficiency of waste collection. Acc lab will lead and technically support the testing activity and experts form each municipality will conduct the actual testing on ground with waste collectors and households. We also have a local fabrication workshop to help with doing small modification works on prototypes during our testing activity. Once we prove the prototypes can work, the lab will share final designs of the push carts with municipalities and UND projects for potential scaleup.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

- What are the most desirable features of pushcart among users? 

- Can the prototypes be used/operated by women and men? 

- Does the design of prototype trigger any behavior change on households' waste segregation? 

- Is there a local capability to manufacture and maintain the push carts locally?  

- What does the supply chain look like for raw materials used to fabricate the pushcart?  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We are planning to test a waste transportation solution with the waste sorting, collecting, and transporting association and as a follow up activity plan to experiment with the solution we co-create with them through prototyping and human center design.   

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Within our experiment on waste transpiration, the lab team plan to track insights from Ethnography data, focus group discussion, direct interview, and participatory observation on how the design of prototype trigger any behavior change on households' waste segregation and what are the most desirable features of pushcart among users. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The municipalities we are working with will benefit from the results of this experiment. IF the carts we have designed can make a difference on the way waste is collected by allowing separate transporting for organic and inorganic waste, the city can initiate waste sorting at household level and remove the barriers of mixed transportation that has been negating the sorting at home. The waste collecting companies and corporative can also adopt the design of the cart to make pushing easier and create more opportunities for women waste collectors. We have been working with the cities and their local waste collecting cooperatives from the beginning, even through a co-creation workshop to design the carts.  

In addition, the Ethiopian Biotechnology institute is also another collaborator on the grow phase as they do a lot of work related to waste management and house inventions and ideas that are available country wide. We will work with them to include the cart as part of their solution portfolio and make the design available nationally.
