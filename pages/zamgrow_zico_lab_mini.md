> Title of the innovation

Zamgrow Zico Lab Mini

> Brief description of the innovation

The Zamgrow ZICO minilab is a portable device that is used to measure and test an environment in order to advise the user(farmer) on whether it is conducive for farming activities and advise what possible crop, seed or fertilizer is conducive for the climate via soil, humidity light intensity and atmospheric temperature for the best of yields and harvest with 98% accuracy.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

it is designed and tailored to provide 98% surety to the user on what inputs to prepare for the season according to the readings the minilab provides with an easy-to-understand language via it’s features and it helps improve the countries food security and eliminating food shortage in the agricultural sector.
Our team took time to look at what challenges our country and the world at large faced and noticed that a major part of the economy which is the food sector is struggling due to climate change and all that accompanies in addition with pollution. We took it upon ourselves to sit down and think of ways to help our economy thus benefiting both ourselves and the nation for it is a fact that food is the major driver of all human life. We hope to possibly partner with large institutions, corporates in order to distribute the product nationwide and internationally.

> Technical Feasibility

The ZICO minilab has numerous features that perform different tasks that achieve the above listed things which are PH sensor for testing the soil PH and nutritional value of soil, humidity to test the moisture content of the soil and the level , temperature sensor to test the atmospheric temperature of the area in order to know the compatibility of the crops desired and light sensor to test the level of light intensity therefore deducing the crop conducive for the given area and also can provide more info E.g. whether solar panels can be used based on the light intensity for energy purposes etc.

> Anticipated Social Impact

To eliminate hunger and food shortage, improve farming activities (crop sector) in assuring 98% bumper harvest. Educate the public focused on improving and advancing small scale farmers productivity and knowledge in the farming sector. To elevate the Zambian agricultural sector even hire and compete heavily on the international market.
