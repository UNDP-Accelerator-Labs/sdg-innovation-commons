Waste Management portfolio of experimentations
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

“Our challenge is to understand how experiments in waste management can help trigger youth entrepreneurship capable of addressing the solid waste challenges arising in our cities”

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Solid waste is a growing concern in many urban cities in DRC. The latter as well as opened on-streets garbage are a problem of public health, of urban planning which suffers from the air, rivers, streets pollution and the spread of diseases. Through the streets, squares and highways masses of waste are found creating mountains of uncontrolled landfills with serious source of pollution for the environment .With the inexistence of integrated and sustainable waste management mechanism, plastic bags and other solid waste worsen river and street pollution, the spread of malaria because bags and bottles block drainage that leads to stagnant water resulting in the proliferation of mosquitos.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

If the waste generation amount per person is 0.7 kg/person/day and the population is 12 million people, waste generation per day would be 8,400 tons for the city of kinshasa alone. The organized waste collection account for 25% and solid waste is 24% of the west composition

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

-abundance of garbage landfields full of solid waste - rising youth unemployement and entreprenership potential in the waste management sector -pollution of rivers at a faster rate with large amounts of large-scale plastic waste

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The lab brings in value in terms of experimentation methodologies focused on adoption and quality. We have a mandate to experiment, mainly to learn at a small scale what is not the case with other stakeholders on the ground. Linking waste management with job creation for young people is worth a try as unemployment and pollution are rising sharply

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Open trash cans, masses of plastic bottles in rivers and streets. Did you know that this can be a source of job creation for young people? The RDC laboratory is working on a cohort of experiments with solutions that can induce the start of a circular economy in DRC
## Challenge classification
## Partners

</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

Through a collaborative approach with municipalities, young solution carriers managed and coached by selected incubators we would like to roll out a suite of experiments in line with waste management and its value chain.  -Research center will provide analysis and insight on quality requirements necessary to improve solutions under test but also contribute to the learning protocol.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How does existing actors ( solution carriers) cover up waste management value chain?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

-We intend to use participatory design to build pilots with all stakeholders in ensuring result meets the needs and is usable- Sensemaking will help create a shared understanding of the available information on waste management existing system- Solution Mapping would help to learn how grassroot solutions to test were build to solve the ecosytem problem - System thinking would help the team to crack the possible complexity tied to waste management value chain in places with huge gaps as DRC cities

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

-No existing stakeholders mapping: help in the process of synergizing the actor toward an efficient system -Limited skills and knowlegde about challenge : focus group and participatory observation will help leverage each other's cognition  
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

how do we envision the positive impact of waste management on youth job creation for the respective region?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Using the learning from pilots to deployed , we shall project ourselves in the range of plausible developments toward impact on youth unemployment using foresight complemented by the systeme thinking since there is an interelated reality to untangle  

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

-Limited data on waste management economic impact: collecting waste consumer and producer econmic data from the pilot will help shape our foresigh exercise -lack of understanding in system network: Spacial data will certainly provide better visualization of the collection value chain and its logistic peculiarities to consider
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
