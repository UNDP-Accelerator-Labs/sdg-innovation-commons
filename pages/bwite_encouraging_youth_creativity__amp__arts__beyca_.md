> Title of the innovation

Bwite Encouraging Youth Creativity &amp; Arts (BEYCA)

> Brief description of the innovation

Bwite Encouraging Youth Creativity &amp; Arts (BEYCA) is an initiative derived from the Bwite Arts &amp; Crafts gift shop in Mkushi, Central Province. We deal primarily with uncovering raw creative talent amongst Mkushi residents and helping them find their place in the commercial arts &amp; crafts market. Some of the creative works we are interested in include paintings, mosaics, tailored works, woodwork &amp; metalwork, woven baskets and bags of all sorts with majority of the works being made with locally sourced tools and raw materials. This initiative aims at extending our arms to incorporate various youths from all the ten provinces of Zambia to not only encourage creativity in the youths and create diversity in the economic growth of our country but also to promote sustainable trade and increase the socio-economic growth and development potential among those who are in the lowest class of society.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Youths involved in this project will generate income by selling their crafts and artworks under our company name at retail price on the commercial market, which our company is already creating, while the company itself claims 30% of all official sales with terms and conditions applying. The challenge prize will help us grow by financially enabling us to take talented youth from hawking on the streets and give them a professional touchup on their natural talents, providing them with good quality tools, machinery and all other necessary resources that cannot be sourced locally but are very much necessary for a higher quality of creative works and when necessary hold workshops with professional artists in respective creative fields to give tips to the young artists. Moreover to give us the necessary funds to advertise the business and artists to boost and maximize sales. Our initiative will incorporate a recycling project in which recycled glass, plastic, paper etc. will be used as resources for different art projects thereby contributing to environmental sustainability.

> Technical Feasibility

Currently, we are using 2 different methods for the smaller artworks and crafts like woven baskets, chitenge works, paintings &amp; drawings etc; we buy ready-made arts &amp; crafts in bulk at wholesale price and sell them at retail price at the shop or we stock different artworks and crafts for advertisement and take a small commission after a sale has been made. However, moving forward we plan to expand our stock by having artists make their artwork in bulk while consumers buy on order basis, especially for larger works like chairs, beds, headboards, tables etc. In due time and with enough resources, we hope to hold art exhibitions and auctions both online and physically to expand our market internationally, catch the attention of investors and be able to export Zambian made works to other countries after we have improved the standard of works produced by training the young artists professionally to enhance their skills.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It is those whose livelihood depends on the works made by their hands that this initiative targets. By giving them a bigger, more recognized platform to showcase their skills and training and empowering them to improve the quality of their works, they will undeniably earn more money and eventually be able to save for important things like education, building projects and even the financial security of their immediate and future families. Currently, the arts and crafts market is more prominent in the less developed parts of the country as manufactured plastic and glass goods have taken center stage in the modern areas but we aim to balance this out by modernizing the arts and crafts market and bringing cultural themed goods back into the limelight as well as encourage local production among the underprivileged youths to indeed have an all inclusive economic development process.
