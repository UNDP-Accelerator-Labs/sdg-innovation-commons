## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Alternative finance for a sustainable future
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that less than 4% of the country is covered by native forest, where invasive species are displacing native ones and reducing natural diversity. Its conservation and restoration are crucial to care water quality, the adaptation to climate change, and the conservation of biodiversity.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Uruguay has less than 4% of the country covered by native forest. Its conservation and restoration are crucial to protect water quality; that is one of the country's main environmental problems today. 
The human impact on ecosystems and invasive species that displace the native ones are reducing our natural diversity.


In 2019, to start repairing damaged native forest ecosystems, the UNDP office in Uruguay, in conjunction with the government and environmental NGOs, began a first campaign to plant native trees. This initiative has achieved specific plantations in some areas, but one of the limitations that affected scalability and sustainability has been its difficulties in financing its operations. Fundamentally, it was fueled by in-kind contributions, volunteers, and the help and efforts of organizations.


Besides, the native forest in the eastern part of our country, which includes inhabited areas and small tourist and fishing locations, has been affected in recent years, both by the decrease in activity due to the pandemic and fires that have damaged native forests. This area requires support, both in environmental and social terms. 



> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

The exotic species monitoring report of the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Livestock, Agriculture, and fishing has recently shown the extent of exotic invasive species (in red) on the areas of the native forest of Uruguay (in green). This area represents 2.63% of the total area of native forest in the country.


The following figure presents a heat map of the presence of exotic invasive species on a national scale, which can be considered as a measure of the concentration of invaded native forest sites. It is a density estimate, representing an index of concentration of invaded native forest polygons, weighted by the surface of said polygons. As it can be seen at the very southeast corner of the country, one of the highlighted areas is the one to be tackled with this crowdfunding campaign.

The defense of the native forest is aligned with the public policies and strategies of the State, carried out by the three ministries, among which the National Environmental Plan, the National Biodiversity Strategy, the National Climate Change Policy, the National Strategy for Native Forest and the Ecosystem Restoration Plan with Citizen Participation. It is also priority for the environmental NGOs, and it is of upmost importance for the population. We can see this throughout an experience of planting native trees that the country office hold in 2019. The testimonies of Ministries, NGOs, Authorities, and neighbors exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Alternative finance can generate new windows of opportunity to support initiatives with impact in our country and contribute to linking green initiatives with sustainable finance. For example, a crowdfunding strategy is very appropriate to contribute to restore ecosystem since it benefits the common good and the environmental quality. We also aim to scale the initiative since there is a lot of work to do on ecosystem restoration in Uruguay. 


In 2020 and before the Acceleration Laboratory's creation, an unsuccessful attempt was made to start designing a possible crowdfunding campaign. For different reasons, it was not possible to achieve and advance within the office. In this case, the Laboratory can unblock this situation and accelerate actions to achieve the first crowdfunding campaign in the CO of Uruguay and generate greater awareness among citizens, and social and political actors about alternative finance and how they can impact development. For example, nowadays, there are no local platforms for crowdfunding initiatives in Uruguay. On the other hand, our actions would promote an active fundraising system in the office not only for the ecosystem restoration project but for many other projects.


Finally, the Accelerator Lab proposes to sensitize and mobilize the population and summon the public and private sectors to restore the native forest, generating citizen awareness about its environmental, cultural, social, and economic value. In particular, its contribution to water quality care, adaptation to climate change, and the conservation of biodiversity.



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Alternative finance, public participation, and the plantation of native trees for a sustainable future. Restoring our native forests is preserving our identity and crucial to care for our water quality, adaptation to climate change, and biodiversity conservation.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can alternative finance contribute to restoring our native forests in priority areas for conservation, with citizen participation?



> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Crowdfunding: is the key innovation method to answer this learning question. It is at its core because it is the alternative finance option that we will start with to tackle the challenge: raising funds and awareness on the restoration of native forests.


Pilots: Uruguay needs a pilot experience on crowdfunding to demonstrate that social and environmental initiatives can be funded by raising awareness and generous donors.


Asset Mapping: is crucial to address alternative finance initiatives. It allows to correctly identify, communicate and engage with the community, particularly through stories, economic, and institutional assets for restoring native forests.


Participatory Design: alternative finance initiatives need a participatory design with donors, recipients, and the population so that everyone can easily understand engage with the campaign.


Micro Narratives and storytelling would raise awareness of the relevance of restoring native forests in Uruguay, with citizen participation.



> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Satellite and geospatial data would enable evidence of the restoration process and its impacts, and geolocalize every single action done in the field to guarantee transparency and traceability to the stakeholders.


Citizen data will be used to evaluate ex-ante and ex-post the different alternative finance campaigns as this experience is novel in the Uruguay context. 


## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Our Country Office is inherently interested in growing this challenge, as it is going to be the first crowdfunding campaign. In the second place, social enterprises and other NGOs, apart from the ones related to the restoration of native forest, would be interested to collaborate, replicate the pipeline, and learn from this pilot alternative finance experiences.


Engaging with donors and the general public from the very beginning is crucial to grow the relevance of alternative finance for sustainable initiatives and scale to another level the challenge of restoring native forests in Uruguay through citizen participation.
