## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Learning Intent:
The experiment sought to determine if using an interactive tool like Mentimeter could effectively capture and amplify diverse perspectives during a public event. By gathering real-time data, the experiment aimed to identify systemic barriers, actionable solutions, and emerging priorities for advancing women in STEM.

Why It Is Important:
Traditional event formats often limit audience participation, particularly in sensitive topics such as gender equity in STEM. By testing the Mentimeter app, the experiment addressed key challenges:

- Amplifying underrepresented voices.
- Enabling a data-driven approach to dialogue.
- Ensuring the event's conclusions were informed by diverse, real-time feedback.

The insights gained not only enhanced the event’s inclusivity but also provided a replicable model for integrating audience engagement tools in future events or discussions.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Hypothesis: Using an interactive app like Mentimeter would:

... Enhance audience participation.
.., Provide actionable insights during the event.
... Highlight diverse perspectives, enabling a more inclusive dialogue.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

This experiment leveraged the Mentimeter app to enhance audience engagement during the "Her Journey, Her Story: Women Shaping Tech" event. By enabling real-time interaction, the app allowed participants to share insights on systemic barriers, critical skills, and future opportunities for women in STEM. These live responses enriched the discussions, fostered an inclusive atmosphere, and contributed to actionable conclusions. The event attracted 55 attendees, including female students, STEM professionals, entrepreneurs, and academics, ensuring diverse perspectives on challenges and opportunities in the tech industry.

The experiment aimed to assess how real-time interactive tools like Mentimeter can effectively engage participants and enrich structured event discussions. Tailored, event-specific questions were developed to capture live feedback, which was displayed in real-time to guide and deepen conversations with the speakers. These questions focused on key themes such as barriers to advancement, necessary skills for success, and the value of diversity in technology.

Key elements of the experiment included:

Pre-event preparation: Developing questions that aligned with the event's goals and themes.
Real-time interaction: Collecting live responses from participants to create a dynamic feedback loop.
Post-event analysis: Analyzing the collected responses to derive key insights and inform future programming.

By using Mentimeter as the core engagement tool, the experiment stimulated active participation and captured audience perspectives that might have remained unheard in a traditional event format.

Event Size: 55 attendees
Data Collected: 39 responses across five Mentimeter questions

This experiment highlights the potential of interactive technologies to foster inclusivity, amplify diverse voices, and drive data-informed decision-making in event settings.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

Yes, the hypothesis was supported. Mentimeter enhanced audience engagement and provided valuable insights that shaped event conclusions and future recommendations.

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

Identification of systemic barriers for women in STEM: Lack of representation, mentorship, and gender biases.
Highlighting the importance of diversity in innovation and problem-solving.
Ranking critical skills for success: adaptability, communication, and problem-solving.
Capturing audience feedback on empathy as a core principle in tech design.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Technical Familiarity: While Mentimeter is user-friendly, some attendees were unfamiliar with using interactive apps during an event, leading to slower engagement initially.

Limited Time for Interaction: Enthusiastic audience participation extended Q&amp;A sessions, leaving less time for planned agenda items.

Audience Variability: Some attendees were more reserved, requiring additional encouragement to participate.

What advice would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?

Provide Pre-Event Guidance: Share instructions on using Mentimeter before the event to ensure participants are prepared and comfortable with the app.

Allot Ample Time for Interaction: Plan the agenda to accommodate extended Q&amp;A sessions and audience feedback.

Ensure Connectivity: Test the venue's Wi-Fi beforehand and provide support for attendees experiencing technical difficulties.

Tailor Questions Thoughtfully: Design questions that are relevant, concise, and encourage thoughtful responses. Avoid overly complex or abstract prompts.

Encourage Participation: Use the moderator to actively invite responses and remind participants about anonymity to reduce hesitation.

Follow Up on Data: Analyze and share key insights from Mentimeter responses to reinforce the value of participation and guide future activities.
