Sanuva is an initiative of young Malian expatriates who have created a small business whose aim is to contribute to a better management of plastic waste through a change in the behaviour of the population. It consists of carrying out awareness campaigns and providing the population with bins for sorting waste at source. The company receives the waste through the EIGs (Economic Interest Groups), then divides it into categories for export to different countries where it is processed in industry. In the experimental phase, this company plans to embrace the transformation of organic waste in the future.
