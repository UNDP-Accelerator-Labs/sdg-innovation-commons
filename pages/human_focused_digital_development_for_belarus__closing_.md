## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



1. The high level of urbanization demands fostering improvement for better quality of life in cities and towns. Quality of life also means digital well-being for rural population, it is an inseparable part of it.  


2. Public transport services and passengers benefited from the introduction of digitalized passenger information systems, organization of dedicated bus lanes. For example, the average bus ride time was reduced by 3-5 minutes.



3. Limiting car speeds at difficult intersections of small towns down to 30 km/h lowered the number of road traffic accidents by 80%, reduced CO2 emissions by 3,763 tons per year. 



4. The application of energy efficient technology for street lighting helps reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 90 tons per year and generate savings for the local budget of more than US$ 10,000 per year while increasing safety.



5. Information campaigns may be very effective. Cheap information flyers, where residents could compare their own heat and water bills with the model consumption in a similar apartment, reduced the consumption of cold water by 7%, hot water by 5.5%, and heat by 5.9%.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)


- Our work has led to significant changes in our UNDP Country Office programming
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



The results of experiments and the whole scope of work on digitalization, as well as digital solutions of UNDP +5 sister agencies, were presented and discussed at the TIBO'23 international exhibition and forum. As a result, the presented ideas and results led to similar campaigns and actions repeated by private sector players and government authorities.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



This data is available either by UNDP, or shared freely by UNDP partners or collected by UNDP experts.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



Because digitalization is the area that should be applied to something to be practical. With the Exploratory purposes we tried to apply it to Smart cities and regional development to create a system and unpack it.
