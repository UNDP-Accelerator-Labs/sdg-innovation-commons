> Brief description of the innovation

E-commerce is the buying of electronics gadgets, clothing and shoes from USA, UK and China manufactures. 
Forex trading is the skill you acquire through studying and practicing. It is the buying and selling of stocks and currencies.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The value for E-commerce is to help underprivileged students and people in the communities by providing second hand laptops and phones, so that they’re able to access online classes and for research.

> Technical Feasibility

I have to find a reliable suppliers from eBay, Amazon and Alibaba with good reviews from other buyers. Once I identify the seller with the required stocks I want, I have to communicate with them for more information before purchasing. When I am satisfied with everything from the seller I have to pay for the products using PayPal and wait for the seller to ship the product to my forwarding agent i.e DHL, FedEx, Mercury etc.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The product are second hand which will be cheap and at an affordable price. I do a three (3) months lay-buy for those who can not manage to pay a full amount at once.
