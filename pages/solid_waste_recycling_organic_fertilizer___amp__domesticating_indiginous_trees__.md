> Title of the innovation

Solid Waste Recycling(Organic Fertilizer) &amp; Domesticating indiginous trees..

> Brief description of the innovation

Turning waste vegetables into manure for veggies and other crops.
The waste vegetables will be combined with urine and others organic waste that will be recommendable in our pilot project. Then we will add these organic fertilizers into our domestic plants and other indiginous trees that we wish to grow since we're into agro-Forestry too. The who idea is to try as much to protect trees that a slowly going into extinction possing a threat to biodiversity loss.. We wish to grow Organic Trees and Vegetables for the well being of people while creating a source of income.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This is a vegetable waste innovation is targeted at the farmers who bring veggies at soweto market. We discovered that waste vegetables are dumped which posses a health challenge when it comes to sanitation especially when there's a disease outbreak.
So we can turn the rotten veggies to manure in a simple process which can be sold to farmers who in most cases depebd on chemical fertilisers. Selling organic fertilizers to farners will be our source of income as well as planting fruit trees that are organic as seen in the pictures..

> Technical Feasibility

The proposed implementation plan is to do a pilot project right as an identified dumpsite within soweto market.. This project will attract students from the University of Zambia school of Natural sciences to come and other experts to come and carry out experiments because human urine will be used as a combining agent with the rotten veggies because of its high content of urea.
In the end we will encourage our fellows communities to atlist plant trees for a Green &amp; Cleaner Zambia.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Continuous dumping of waste materials causes an overheat that makes too much carbon dioxide to be emmited from the ground.. It then combines with emmissions from other sources such as vehicals and industries which goes up to the air it sits there as much as these human activities continues..
So we wish to try and bring an initiative that wull make money from waste not only that but enourage communities on planting tress that will atlist consume a small amount of this emitted carbon dioxide..
