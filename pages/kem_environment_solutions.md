> Title of the innovation

KEM ENVIRONMENT SOLUTIONS

> Brief description of the innovation

KEM Environment solutions is a business aimed at addressing community challenges associated with the environment by providing improved waste management services, promoting recycling and ensuring reduced pollution.  Around 80.6 million tons of paper is wasted each year when it should have been recycled, often this is due to inefficient waste management systems. The demand for paper is ever increasing and pulp from recycled paper serves as raw material for production of new paper. At KEM, we collect wastepaper from Institutions such as schools, businesses, hospitals etc., which we later sell to paper recycling companies. We make recycling easy, safe and secure by offering waste management services that simplify the process of recycling. We provide our clients with customized commercial bins which enables us to segregate the waste right at the point of collection. The collected wastepaper is sorted by type and moved to type-specific containers. Once a container is full, the material is compressed and bound. From here, the bales are sent to paper production plants, or recycling companies making use of waste paper.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Revenue will be  from collections as well as sales. We will provide our clients with collection bins free of charge while collection will be at a reasonable fee. The collected waste paper will then be sold to companies that make use of recycled paper. This will improve the operations of companies in paper business as the supply of raw material will be convenient and systematic. This will in turn boost the market for eco friendly packaging. Our target market for collections include institutions of learning, offices, printing companies as well as other businesses capable of generating wastepaper in bulk, while for sales, we are targeting paper mills, and other companies producing paper products. The challenge prize will enable us purchase these customized commercial bins which we will make available to our clients thus increasing our customer base and hence grow the business. Recycling of paper not only saves trees which are crucial to the sustainability of our planet but by recycling one ton of paper, it also saves at least 30,000 liters of water and between 3000 to 4000 kWh of electricity. Recycling of paper also helps to reduce green house gas emissions. For instance, the EPA cites landfills as the single largest source of methane emissions to the atmosphere, and has identified the decomposition of paper as among the most significant source of landfill methane. We are fully committed to reducing the impact excessive waste has on the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

Our collection bins are customized i.e.  the lids will only allow for paper to be disposed in. In addition, the bin will bear a symbol to imply 'paper only ', recycle logo as way of campaign to recycling. The collection of the waste paper will be done on a period agreed with the client. We will conduct ourselves in a manner that does not put us nor our clients at risk by strictly adhering to the local and international Environmental standards, as well as proper use of correct PPE.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation comes with job creation. Also, with a more organized waste management system, we are assured of clean surroundings, free from liter in institutions such as schools, print areas, hospitals e.tc and sanity in the city.
The whole innovation is a campaign to the community on the importance of recycling and sustainability.
