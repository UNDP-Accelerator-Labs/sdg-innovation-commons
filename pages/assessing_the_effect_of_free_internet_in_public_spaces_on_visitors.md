## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

The learning intent of this experiment is to determine the causal effect of free Wi-Fi access on the number of visitors to public spaces, particularly tourist parks. By providing and promoting free internet connectivity, the experiment seeks to understand whether this intervention can attract more visitors and contribute to the revitalization of these spaces.

This experiment is important because it helps provide evidence on the role of digital infrastructure in enhancing public spaces. Understanding the impact of free Wi-Fi can guide policymakers, urban planners, and tourism organizations in designing interventions that improve the attractiveness and utility of public spaces. Moreover, the findings could inform strategies to support local businesses and community engagement by making public areas more accessible and appealing through enhanced connectivity. Additionally, it offers insights into the potential social and economic benefits of digital infrastructure in public spaces, which can support broader goals of urban development, digital inclusion, and economic growth.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF free Wi-Fi access is provided and promoted in public spaces, THEN the number of weekly visitors to those spaces will increase, contributing to their revitalization.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

To test the hypothesis, I collaborated with the Salvadoran Tourism Institute (ISTU) to select 12 public parks and, including Balboa Park. In March 2024, we implemented free Wi-Fi access in Balboa Park and promoted it through Facebook and on-site materials. Over the following weeks, we tracked visitor numbers using administrative data provided by ISTU. We then compared the number of visitors before and after the Wi-Fi intervention, using synthetic control methods to estimate the counterfactual outcome for Balboa Park

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven? In which way do the results support the original hypothesis or not?

The original hypothesis was rejected. However, while the free Wi-Fi did not lead to a statistically significant increase in the number of visitors to Balboa Park (compared to the control condition constructed synthetically), the results revealed that visitors who were already at the park perceived the Wi-Fi as an added value, improving their experience. This supports the idea that free connectivity enhances public space, but not in the way initially expected.

> What are the most important learning outcomes of the experiment? Are any changes recommended?

The experiment revealed that free Wi-Fi in Balboa Park didn’t significantly increase visitor numbers, but enhanced the experience for those already present, improving perceptions by 18.8 points. Visitors informed about Wi-Fi stayed longer and were more likely to recommend the park, indicating high potential for customer satisfaction and loyalty, though spending didn't increase.

It was also recommended to ISTU to focus on digital literacy for small business owners to leverage free connectivity. Additionally, explore strategies to encourage visitor spending, such as targeted promotions or interactive digital content linked to the Wi-Fi network.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity? What advise would you give colleagues trying to replicate this experimental activity?


The main challenges included finding a valid control group due to Balboa Park's uniqueness, managed by employing the Synthetic Control Method. We also faced the challenge of managing ISTU’s expectations, as free Wi-Fi alone didn't significantly boost visitor numbers. Consistent data collection across businesses required close coordination.

Advice:

 1. Use Synthetic Controls when similar sites are unavailable, ensuring strong baseline data.
 2. Set clear expectations with stakeholders like ISTU about potential outcomes and limitations.
 3. Combine Wi-Fi with targeted promotions to boost engagement and consider adaptive strategies based on regular feedback.
