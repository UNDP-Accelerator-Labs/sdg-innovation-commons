> Description

Improving labor productivity of informal waste pickers (as an enabler for financing better social protection) requires collective action in the recycling system to improve sorting of waste and the logistics of waste collection. We observed how strengthening the capacity of associations or organizations of informal workers, particularly the trust among them and between them and other actors in the recycling system, are key elements in the pathway towards productivity and the formalization of associative relationships. Both these processes are signaling toward a long-term investment in their cooperative practices and collective assets as the tools to facilitate the formalization of their work by enabling access to social protection.
