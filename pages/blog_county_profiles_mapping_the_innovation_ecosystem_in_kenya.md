The Context

The African Centre for Technology Studies (ACTS), a pioneering development research think
tank on harnessing applications of science, technology and innovation policies for sustainable
development in Africa, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
and Konza Technopolis conducted a study to map out innovation ecosystem in Kenya with a view
to generating evidence for accelerating its growth.

The study was meant to help identify opportunities for collaboration, learning and investment
and to support the growth and development of local innovators across the country. The study
exhaustively mapped the Kenyan innovation ecosystem by identifying its characteristics,
organization (players and actors); challenges, and opportunities, identified its key levers and
highlighted emerging themes and opportunities.

The study specifically focused on establishing the status of the Kenyan innovation ecosystem across
the country: characteristics, organization (players and actors), challenges, and opportunities;
identifying key levers and approaches on how to stimulate the sector for more economic growth
towards achieving key development agenda items (SDGs, Vision 2030), including requisite skill
sets, partnerships, and resources; and highlighting emerging themes and opportunities for
collaboration, partnership and cross-learning.

In light of the above, these county profiles are meant to augment and supplement findings of
the study by providing a deeper understanding of the various innovation ecosystems within
specific counties. The counties were selected based mainly on their perceived development of
the ecosystem and geographical location. The profiles illuminates the similarities and differences
between the specific countries and the challenges and opportunities that exist within them.

In as much as Nairobi sets the benchmark for the innovation system in the country, other counties
have not been left behind. On evidence of the information on these profiles, the innovation
ecosystem in counties outside Nairobi are vibrant and growing, a clear indication of their potential.

Executive Summary

These profiles are an in-depth examination of the current status of the innovation ecosystem
of specific counties in Kenya. They are part of a wider study on mapping the Kenyan innovation
ecosystem, which focused on all the 47 counties. The purpose of the mapping study was to map
the Kenya innovation ecosystem and generate evidence that can support the growth of the Kenyan
innovation ecosystem.

During the course of the study, it was realized that an in- depth examination of specific counties
would provide a deeper understanding of the ecosystem and bring out the similarities and
peculiarities in different parts of the country. This was particularly important in comparing the
state of innovation ecosystem in different parts of the country.

Of course, Nairobi is setting the pace in the growth and development of the innovation ecosystem
in Kenya. After Lagos, Nairobi is recognized as Africa’s second-best start-up ecosystem and ranked
second in the Middle East and Africa. The number of inexpensive and available co- working spaces
is also increasing.Out of a total 186 hubs that were mapped 71 hubs are in Nairobi, translating
to around 38% of the total. This clearly places Nairobi at the apex of the innovation ecosystem in
Kenya.

Nevertheless, other major urban centres in Kenya are also keeping pace with Nairobi, Mombasa,
Nakuru, Kisumu, Kakamega, Nyeri, Makueni, Uasin Gishu and Isiolo are showing positive trends
in the development of their respective innovation ecosystems. This is illustrated by the increasing
number of innovation hubs and related activities including innovation challenges, support from
county governments and academic/technical institutions – all which serve to grow and strengthen
the ecosystem.

These profiles shed light on the innovation ecosystem of selected counties with respect to the
key actors, and their linkages, potential for growth, challenges and existing opportunities for
innovators. They not only give a indication of the status of the innovation ecosystem but also
highlight the potential that exists for growth in these counties.

Mapping of the Kenyan Innovation Ecosystem - County Profiles
1.0 Nairobi County

1.1 Background

According to the Global Start-up Ecosystem Index
2021, Nairobi is the second most vibrant innovation
city in Africa after Lagos in Nigeria. The Start-up
Ecosystem Index ranked 100 countries and 1000
cities by assigning scores based on three factors:
quantity, quality and business environment. The
quantity factor considers the number of start-ups,
co-working spaces, accelerators, and start- up-related
meetings. The quality parameter considers the
number of staff per start-up, unicorns, global start-
ups events, and the prevalence of global start-up
leaders. The business environment includes ease of
forming and conducting business, broadband speeds
and freedom, English proficiency, R&D investment
and patent per capita. Nairobi is number 2 in Africa,
number 6 within the Middle East and African Region
and ranked number 136 globally (Table 1.1).

Nairobi in particular:

Fig. 1.1: Kenya’s map showing location of Nairobi.

1. Labour Market: Nairobi is ranked second in
the Middle East and Africa, according to Start-up
Friendliness Index with a score of 91.73.1

2. Market Environment: After Lagos, Nairobi is
recognized as Africa’s second-best start-up ecosystem.
Application development, Business to Business (B2B)
solutions, software development; ICT solutions in the
financial, health, agriculture, and education sectors,
ICT training and community problem solving; and
hardware are all areas where the digital innovation
ecosystem offers market prospects.2

3. Hubs: Nairobi
is currently ranked sixth and
eighth in the world in terms of the number of
accelerators and incubators per capita. The number
inexpensive and available co-working spaces
of

is also increasing, giving the city a slightly better
score, placing it fifth.3 The government is promoting
the ecosystem’s development in cooperation with
the World Bank through the “Kenya Industry and
Entrepreneurship Project,” which aims to impact 162
start-ups participating in an International Accelerator
Programme.4

4. Activeness: The activity sub-domain includes
indicators for events, the number of start-ups and
whether there are high-equity situations. Nairobi
receives a score of 60.13 on these factors, placing it
at the top of the Middle East and Africa SFI. Nairobi
presently has over 650 start-ups, far more than the
regional average of around 100, putting the city
foremost in this category.5

5. Internet access and infrastructure: The ICT sub-
sector in Kenya is expanding faster. This is because
of the dynamism of telecoms, the acceptance of
e-commerce, and the widespread use of the internet.6
However, internet costs are higher than twice the
regional average and internet penetration in Kenya is
42%7 Hardware infrastructure has seen tremendous
growth in Kenya, particularly with respect to mobile
phone penetration and broadband connectivity
including 4G, with 5G testing already ongoing with
Mobile Network Operators (MNO). Kenya is considered
a mobile first country, with mobile penetration
level at 90%, the country has witnessed significant
increases in international Internet bandwidth, mobile
cellular subscriptions, and active mobile broadband
subscriptions8

6. Policy and Regulation: Many regulatory and
policy changes under the Kenya Vision 2030 have led
to the growth of the economy and the development
of the ICT ecosystem.9

These include the STI Act (2013), the STI policy (2020),
the digital economy strategy (2021) and the start-up
bill (2021).

7. Technology Diffusion and Adoption Systems:
In 2006, the government of Kenya launched an
e-governance system, which is an integrated system
that helps all government agencies with all elements
of their operations. All government entities, for
example, are required to utilize IFMIS (Integrated
Financial Management and Information System) a
software for integrated financial management.10

1.2 Innovation Spaces and Facilities

Out of a total 186 hubs that were mapped (Figure 2.1),
71 hubs are in Nairobi, translating to around 38% of
the total. Table 2.1 shows some of these facilities.

that they collaborate with government agencies,
private sector players and education institutions
in hackathons/events and legal advice in terms of
business policies, plans and tax issues. However,
collaboration amongst innovators and hubs is limited
while collaboration with local and external investors
is almost non-existence. Similarly, collaboration of
innovators and hubs with research labs is weak.

their

2. Skills gaps: Both the innovators and hubs managers
have also identified lack of business, marketing and
legal skills as a key challenge facing most innovators
in
innovation commercialization efforts.
Similarly, all the service providers have mentioned
inadequate skills of their staff particularly legal skills
has a challenge.
Furthermore, there are no training programs from
the training institutions targeting the unique needs
of innovations and hubs.

4. Support from government agencies: Access to
standards and certification, which is recognized as
important for marketing, is also mentioned as a major
challenge. The process is considered cumbersome
by both innovators and hubs. Most of the hubs also
indicated that there is limited training and guidance
offered by government on certification.

5. Inclusive innovations: In terms of inclusivity, some
hubs mentioned that there is limited information/
sensitization on developing products
that are
disability inclusive therefore they are not able to cater
for the needs of people with disabilities.

following opportunities are available

The
innovators and hubs in Mombasa County to exploit.

for

1. Presence of knowledge generators
The presence of the public institutions including
Technical University of Mombasa, Kenya Coast
National Polytechnic, Coast Institute of Technology,
is an important opportunity that should be tap to
address the skills gaps experienced by innovators
and hubs
in this region. In addition, Technical
University of Mombasa could support innovators and
hubs to access specialized laboratories for analysis
and product development if proper collaboration
framework can be developed and implemented

to

2. Increasing international recognition
According
the StartupBlink Global Startup
Ecosystem 2021, Mombasa has emerged as the second
most preferred destination for startups after Nairobi.
This is buoyed by the set up of digital companies in
the county. The 2021 Global Startup Ecosystem report
ranks Mombasa at number 756 amongst other global
cities such as Francisco and London for the first.19
Mombasa county is therefore expected to continue
attracting more investment and startups and boast
the innovation ecosystem. Innovators, startups and
hubs in Mombasa County should therefore prepare
to take advantage of this opportunity.

3. Pwani Innovation Week
The Pwani Innovation Week (PIW) is a powerful
networking
for
innovators, startups and hubs not only for Mombasa
county but also for all the other coastal counties
since it is organized in collaboration with them. The
involvement of the Kenya National Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (KNCCI), and other partners
in an added advantage.

4. Mombasa Business Innovation and Incubation
Hub
the Mombasa
The planned establishment of
Business Innovation and Incubation Hub, by County
Government of Mombasa, will provide innovators
and startups with a unique opportunity, to fill the
skills gaps as well as address the other challenges
faced by innovators such as mentorship and access
to financing. Furthermore, opportunity should trickle
down the other innovators and startups and hubs in
other coastal counties.

5. Kenya Bureau of Standards Mombasa branch
Mombasa hosts the regional office of the Kenya
Bureau of Standards. Therefore, Innovators, startups
and hubs from Mombasa County should find it
easier to access certifications and standards services
compared to those from other coastal counties. A
collaboration agreement between hubs association
and the Kenya Bureau of standards could help is
reducing the challenges innovators and hubs in this
region face. facility can provide support to innovators
and hubs in matters related to standards and product
certifications.

6. Blue economy
In March 2021, the six governors of coastal counties
in collaboration with the Ministry of Devolution and
the Blue Economy Secretariat and other international
partners,20 launched a four-year program aimed at
protecting Kenya’s coastal ecosystem while creating
environmentally friendly jobs in a host of industries
including recycling of wastes (circular economy),
tourism and small-scale fishing, strengthening value
chains and providing technical skills in blue economy.
This provides a huge opportunity for innovators to
develop innovations in the areas identified in this
25-million-euro program.

centers collaborate with non-state actors in terms of
paying for utilities, (power/water/internet) installation
of high speed internet. This has enabled the hubs to
keep running with reduced challenges

2. County government. Some innovators have been
granted waivers to showcase their innovation in
public spaces by the county government. They are
supported with transportation of by different county
government agencies when they are called to exhibit
in National and International events. Through this
collaboration, they have successfully secure several
orders of their innovation. The innovators wish that
the collaboration lasts for about 5 years with follow
ups so that a lot progress can be made on innovations
to scale up.

21

Mapping of the Kenyan Innovation Ecosystem - County Profiles
3. Collaborations: The innovators have pointed
out having limited access to government support
and major private entities as a challenge. Whereas
the hubs are having some form of collaborations
with different government and non-governmental
organizations, these are mainly through payment
of some of the utilities. Collaboration amongst
government, innovators and hubs is limited.

6.6. Challenges

The following are the key challenges mentioned by
the actors of the innovation ecosystem in Nyeri:

1. Limited funding: Access to funding is the main
challenges facing innovators for the commercialization
of their innovations. It is also a major challenge for
the hubs, accelerators, incubators and co-working
spaces to enhance their services to innovators.

2. Training: The innovators have also identified
lack of business skills, certification of innovations
and licenses as challenges in their innovation path.
There are limited training programs from the training
institutions targeting the unique needs of innovations
and hubs. The innovators yearn for training especially
on coming up with better business models for their
innovations.
