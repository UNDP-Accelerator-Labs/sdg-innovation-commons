> Title of the innovation

Proposed creation of a formalized and integrated agribusiness park in Ngwerere on a 15 acre farm plot in Chongwe District. The park is intended to hosting regular Farmers’ Expo and Agro Trading activities whereby enhancing backward and forward market linkages through aggregation and establishment of a temperature controlled Pack House.

> Brief description of the innovation

The concept of establishing an agribusiness park, largely hinges on creating a formalized and integrated community hub for agro and agribusiness players in an open and outdoor market set up. This initiative is envisaged to provide a farmers’ expo market and a Pack house facility. The open space trading concept will provide an ambience of festivity for family shopping and amusement in a relaxed and safer environment with adequate parking space for motorists.  

This innovation is intended to make available an alternative farm produce marketing channel in a formalized manner with appropriate and convenient infrastructures to promote fair trade. 

A Pack House in this regard is envisaged to undertake value addition processes of aggregation, post-harvest cleaning, grading, sorting, weighing, labeling and packaging of farm produce in readiness for distribution into the formalized markets and for actual trading during farmers’ expo market days.

The strategy of aggregation and value addition will ensure continuous supply of quality, safe and well packaged produce meeting the standards as demanded by high end markets such as chain stores and other supermarkets. The temperature controlled pack house will also mitigate the post-harvest loses of fresh vegetables due to lack of cold storage facilities in the area.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The formation of the agribusiness facility of this nature is envisaged to mitigate the problem of ‘smallness’ by embracing aggregation to enable consistent supply of farm produce to lucrative and formalized markets. This initiative will create opportunities to capture value and distribute benefits to the farmers as a result of being directly linked to competitive value chain markets.

The concept will also play a significant role in linking and integrating small scale farmers to the extension services and hands-on training in sustainable and emerging agricultural technologies in view of climate change. In this regard, demo plots will be offered to the seed breeders and other relevant agro dealers.  

The business concept will enable working with companies such as agro dealers and chain stores as farmer input suppliers and farm produce off-takers respectively, at the same interaction with the small scale farmers, cooperatives and smallholder farmers as farm produce suppliers.

This venture will have very minimal degradation impact on the environment. If anything the cleared farm land where this project will be undertaken will be replenished with trees and plants to provide natural shelter for the traders as it is remodeled to the status of a trading and amusement park.

> Technical Feasibility

The technical feasibility of this concept hinges on training the farmers in Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control points (HACCP) protocols.  This training will contribute to quality and safe packaging of farm produce meeting the agreed product specifications by the chain stores.  

This initiative can be prototyped  with Tuesday Market near UTH and Soweto market except that it will be more formal and done periodically most likely week-ends or month ends.  

While the aim would be to make the agribusiness park and the market self-sustaining though levy and membership fees, some startup capital as initial seed money is necessary for the activities listed below:
- Remodeling the un-complete  farm house to a Pack House
- Landscaping
- Perimeter fencing of the farm 
- Main market shelter                         
- Gate house construction
- Car park provision and paving
- Paving of walk ways
- Building an ablution block

> Anticipated Social Impact

It is a recognized fact that as farming becomes more commercial and market oriented, small scale farmers operating as individuals struggle to acquire and maintain market share in the formalized value chains due to various constraints. 

To this effect, this proposal is largely intended to mitigate the plight of small scale farmers and cooperatives who have been side lined to supply some chain stores due to capacity constraints and failure to meet quality and packaging standards. 

On the other hand, trading in an inform sector such as Soweto and other open markets in Lusaka, is a complete nightmare for small-scale and emerging farmers. Trading is characterized with a lot of inconsistencies with no formal recourse outlining the expectations and obligations on the part of the seller and buyer respectively.

The farmers’ expo market will provide farmers and shoppers’ convenience by eliminating middle men at the same time it will also improve the bottom line of farmer’s return on investment mitigating scenarios found in open markets like Soweto.

Having secured the market through creation of own farmers’ expo market, will enable small scale farmers to grow high value vegetables which has been perceived as a preserve for commercial farmers only.
