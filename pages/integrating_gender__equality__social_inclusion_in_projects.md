## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To identify multiple pilots / interventions across the programmtic cycle which could help the project integrate GESI

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF GESI interventions are done across the project cycle, then it is integrated in the way the project works

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Co-design workshop with GESI and project team to identify pilots / interventions and carry them out

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

change in attitudes, behaviors and capacity

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

survey

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 year

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
