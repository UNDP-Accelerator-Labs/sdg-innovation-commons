The Clean Water Solution for Seaweed Community using Solar Hybrid Powered Desalination is a dual-purpose integrated system to produce clean drinkable water using renewable energy source. This project is implemented in Semporna, a coastal region in the state of Sabah, Malaysia where the local communities still do not have stable and consistent supply of electric and clean water. 
The project benefits the local communities who work as seaweed farmers. The system is able to generate 1-5 cubic metres of clean water from the sea per day. This will benefit 100-120 residents living in the surrounding areas. The system also generates electric from the same solar panels. 
The project has demonstrated that it can solve the issue of basic water and electric necessities in remote communities where the major utilities networks cannot reach. The project is scalable to other communities in other remote geographical locations where these communities face the same problem.
