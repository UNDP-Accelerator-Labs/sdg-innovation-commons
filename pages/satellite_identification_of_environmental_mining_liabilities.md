## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Satellite identification of environmental mining liabilities


> On date (Day/Month/Year)

22/11/2023

> What action learning plan is this activity related to?

The plan uses satellite technology and artificial intelligence to identify and monitor environmental impacts caused by mining activities. By integrating satellite imagery and traditional data, the project seeks to enhance the ability of local and national authorities to address the environmental degradation from historical mining operations and improve management strategies for sustainable mining practices

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

Specific Learning Intent of the Activity:
The activity aims to explore how satellite technology and artificial intelligence can be used to identify, monitor, and manage environmental mining liabilities. The goal is to understand how integrating geospatial data can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of environmental remediation in Bolivia's mining regions.

Why Is It Important?
This experiment is important because it provides innovative tools for addressing environmental damage caused by mining, promoting sustainable practices, and supporting the government in making data-driven decisions for mining remediation

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF satellite technology and artificial intelligence are used to identify environmental mining liabilities, THEN they will improve the accuracy and efficiency of detecting and managing mining-related environmental damage, leading to more effective remediation and sustainable mining practices.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Actions to Test the Hypothesis:
Data Collection Using Satellite Technology:

Gather satellite data from sources like Earth Explorer and Copernicus to identify mining liabilities across regions like Potosí and La Paz.
Collaboration:

Work with government bodies, environmental agencies, and mining organizations for validation and calibration of the data.
Pilot Projects:

Conduct pilot tests in identified mining regions like Cerro Rico and Pulacayo using traditional data for comparison.
Analysis and Implementation:

Use AI algorithms to analyze satellite data and provide insights for remediation actions​
