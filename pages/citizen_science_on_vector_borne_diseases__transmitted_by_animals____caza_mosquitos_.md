Objectives • Study the distribution of mosquito vectors, including Aedes aegypti, a species transmitting dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses • Involve citizens in analyzing and questioning their environment, and lead them to take individual actions to contribute to the prevention of the spread of the insect vector  

Description of citizen participation: Through the project’s social media or by a digital, educational and free app, citizens are encouraged to collect data for the creation of a database to study the distribution of mosquito vectors, such as Aedes aegypti, among other significant species present in Argentina. It is also an opportunity for citizen scientists to receive information on actions to prevent mosquito-borne diseases and on other relevant aspects in connection with this issue.  Using this app, citizen scientists can report the presence of mosquitoes and potential breeding sites by submitting photographs and sharing the location detected by their mobile devices. A panel of expert reviewers helps users to identify mosquitoes and determine whether they are potential disease vectors. Then, citizen scientists are informed of such determination.  All information is included in the database created to determine mosquito distribution at a national level.
