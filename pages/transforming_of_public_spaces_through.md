## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Our learning is based on creating conditions for participatory urban design (both form and function) and planning where we could build a common communication ground with residents and decision-makers. The experiment aimed to create a learning process of innovative methods on the ground with the engagement of municipality and residents. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....



If we design public spaces in accordance with participatory principles, we can create more functional, inclusive and purposeful spaces for livable cities.
If we design and conduct participatory design processes in collaboration with the municipality and other local actors, this builds the capacity of local governments to be more open to changing their business as usual approach.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Design of participatory design methodologies, a set of online workshops, and site visits planned.

Inclusive engagement with citizens was coordinated with the municipality.

Impartial workshops were conducted to create a common ground between citizens and the municipality

Online sessions for elderly and young people and children, and local actors (university, city council, and NGOs) to understand the needs and desires.

Ethnographic data collected from field research transformed into design inputs

Social media channels were used actively, A dedicated Facebook page was created to ensure the transparency of the process. Each and every step of the process was shared publicly. (FB was chosen to be the main social media platform among discussion with the municipality and the residents to be reached by everyone from different age groups)

Each designed stage including the final one was assessed, evaluated by residents, the municipality, and the other contributors, and required changes were made.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

residents of Gokceada

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Ethnographic data collected via observation, focus group discussions and surveys. Geospatial data of the site is providing information to the design team. Social network data will be used during the participatory design process to crowdsource and test ideas.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

considerable amount of time allocation
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Hypothesis 1 ( If we design public spaces in accordance with participatory principles, we can create more functional, inclusive and purposeful spaces for livable cities.) was proven. Regarding hypothesis 2 (If we design and conduct participatory design processes in collaboration with the municipality and other local actors, this builds the capacity of local governments to be more open to changing their business as usual approach.) We can say that there is valid learning for municipal teams. Conditionally, the replication of the learnings and full verification of the hypothesis directly depends on the capacity of the municipalities (monetary resources, the capacity of existing experts etc.)

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Due to Covid-19 restrictions all workshops had to be done online. The original design of the methodology was to conduct most of the workshops on-site while encouraging face-to-face interaction. We could have preferred to stick with the original plan. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

From 2020 August to 2021 July (12 months)

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

25K USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We follow up periodically. The place where the experiment was conducted is a challenging area in terms of climatic conditions. Therefore, the municipality can provide more active services in public spaces in the spring months. As of April 2022, the municipality continues to work on the use of the area and the organization of activities to be held here.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

This experiment has been slightly changed in a way that can be achieved in shorter periods of time, with less monetary resources  (by using lighter materials and smaller-scale activities etc.) in collaboration with different municipalities with more capacity. Within the concept of tactical urbanism, we are experimenting with micro-scale public space interventions with the municipalities in İzmir.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1. Willingness of a municipality is not enough for a successful partnership, organizational capacity should be sufficient.  2. People are generally keen to be included in participatory design projects (for public spaces). Local authorities should create a space for residents to take part in design and decision-making processes. Also, residents' understanding of and their capacity for meaningful engagement should be developed so that they fully understand the effects of their involvement in the process. 3. In Turkey, there are CSOs and design collectives who specialize in participatory methods and want to take part in these kinds of projects. They just don't know where to find them, so perhaps an online platform can bring these actors together. 4. Communication challenges arise when international partners are present and not everyone speaks fluent English. It gets worse when there is strong reliance on digital tools for facilitation. Face-to-face interactions are always preferred. Communication, in terms of language barriers between local partners and our Japanese partner has created an information gap since the designers could not directly interact with the stakeholders except UNDP and Urban Strategy (Kentsel Strateji). To overcome this challenge, AccLab had to intervene and act as a knowledge transfer point between the Municipality and our Japanese partner. As a result, building trust and common understanding between partners was challenging and there was a risk of coming up with a design which did not meet the local needs. 5. Sustainability planning is key for a public space's ownership, long-term maintenance, active utilization, etc. This step is usually not well understood and can lead to underutilized public spaces.



> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Participatory design is not a common practice in Turkey, especially in relatively small and disadvantaged regions. Municipalities usually stick to their multi-year plans (on which they were elected) and see participatory design projects as a burden since they involve extra work and bring in additional risks from their perspective. As a result, municipalities tend to stick to their usual ways of working rather than embrace the diversity and richness involved in participatory design processes. Our core partner (Gokceada Municipality) struggled at times to keep up with the pace and the requirements of the experiment. Their lack of capacity in terms of design, community building, coordination, PR, etc. proved to be a real challenge. In terms of methods, due to the geographic distance of the partners and of course the pandemic-induced restrictions, we had to rely on digital tools exclusively. We anticipated some digital activity but certainly did not expect to do the whole thing online. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

While the Inclusive and Democratic Governance (IDG) portfolio does not have a direct work of public spaces, the portfolio's interests may directly relate to this activity. the relations strengthened between UNDP CO and other municipalities, as well as the partnerships which were built during this activity with unusual actors, contributed to permanent cooperation between CO and these actors.



> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

This activity brought a new agenda in which organizations working in the area of planning and public spaces appreciate that UNDP highlighted a missing field to be seen. Making such methods visible could popularize similar practices in the ecosystem and enable other actors to be taken on board in an easier way by municipalities in Turkey. We now know that there are demands from other municipalities to make examples of this activity.



> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

This experiment went through one basic iteration because we had to adapt to the pandemic conditions. we had to design the whole participatory process online by minimizing face-to-face communication.



> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Generally, projects carried out in this field require face-to-face communication, the participants' learning about digital tools used in the workshops and the organization of these workshops by the municipality created serious difficulties at first. This has also shown that participatory workshops can be conducted remotely but a lot more coordination and preparation should be involved.



> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

This experiment serves to SDG 3, 11, and, 17, it can also be considered for SDG 10 and SDG 12 as it is designed to be inclusive and accessible for everyone. There is always a reproduction and reuse opportunity for the citizens since some design elements were already used from waste materials (ie. Modular seating groups were created with waste materials, and decorative textiles were produced through knitting workshops to make seating elements more comfortable and enjoyable.)
