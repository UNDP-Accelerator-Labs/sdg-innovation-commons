> Title of the innovation

Menstrual Hygiene Management practices among adolescent schoolgirls in Zambia

> Brief description of the innovation

The results obtained from a pilot study conducted in Lusaka Province (November 2020) on menstrual hygiene management practices among adolescent school girls showed that while majority of the girls could access menstrual products, it was also found that there were some girls that struggled with accessing and affording menstrual products. This discovery prompted me to find ways to help girls on challenges faced during menstruation. The proposed innovation is to teach girls the skills to make their own cheaper and reusable products using locally sourced materials. By teaching them this skill, they can have access to products while also making it a business venture where they can teach others and sale the same materials, as a business.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Teaching them the skill to make their own menstrual products will generate income for them and their communities. Other existing businesses like school management, tailors, or organisations can work together with girls on this idea. the target market will be girls and women, I hope schools, churches and organisation get interested in this topic. The challenge prize will help scale out this project outside of Lusaka, in order to reach out to more adolescent girls.
Environmental value will be through promotion of sustainable practices of teaching girls the right disposal practices instead of flushing menstrual waste in the toilet, latrines or even uncontrolled burning or throwing them haphazardly. also, reusable products will not cause any solid waste as products will be washed and not disposed off.

> Technical Feasibility

proposed plan is this year 2021 and the next year 2022, hopefully that it will continue for it to reach more and more schoolgirls

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation can impact the lives of many girls and be able to achieve SDGs goals on gender equality, quality education in order to concentrate in class or not be absent from school during menstruations and lastly, creating sustainable cities through the girls and implementing the right menstrual hygiene management practices
