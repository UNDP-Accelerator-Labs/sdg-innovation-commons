Unlocking Digital Agriculture - What can we learn from the solutions?
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that digital agricultural solutions are not effectively diffused in local contexts, limiting their impact on smallholder farmers. We need to understand what digital solutions exist, what digital skills farmers require, and how e-commerce platforms can enhance market access. Many digital solutions are developed without sufficient localization, making them less effective in specific farming communities

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Digital innovation in agriculture holds the potential to improve productivity, sustainability, and resilience. However, many solutions remain underutilized by smallholder farmers due to gaps in digital literacy, access to technology, and contextual relevance. Large-scale producers often have better access to these solutions, creating disparities. Additionally, local e-commerce platforms remain underdeveloped, limiting market access for farmers. Addressing these gaps is crucial to ensuring inclusive agricultural transformation.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

There are some interesting analysis completed by Metamorphosis: 

(ref: https://metamorphosis.org.mk/en/aktivnosti_arhiva/farmers-need-literacy-training-rural-coalition/; https://metamorphosis.org.mk/en/blog/rural-coalition-farmers-still-hang-on-the-counters-the-application-of-digitalization-in-its-initial-stage/) 

Digital Literacy and E-Service Usage: A national report revealed that while 76% of farmers possess an email address and over 92% have stable internet connections, only 19% have utilized e-services.

Additionally, 64% prefer in-person interactions at service counters over electronic communication.

Digital Skills Gap: Despite 85% of rural households owning smartphones and having internet access, only 29% of farmers are proficient in internet and electronic communications, indicating a significant

digital skills gap.

 E-Commerce Adoption: While 92% of respondents have payment cards, only 26% pay bills electronically, and a mere 11% engage in online shopping, highlighting the underutilization of e-commerce platforms. E- commerce platforms remain underutilized, particularly at country level there are no specialized e-commerce sales for small farmers. 

The dataset generated by our team showcases a variety of digital solutions in agriculture: Solutions Platform.

In addition, we have noticed that large-scale producers adopt digital solutions much faster then the small farmers.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

Weak signals observed:

- Smallholder farmers report difficulty in navigating digital tools, even when solutions are available.

- Many digital solutions are developed without sufficient localization, making them less effective in specific farming communities.

- Interviews suggest that farmers are hesitant to adopt e-commerce due to trust issues, lack of digital payment access, and logistical concerns.

According to the analysis conducted by Metamorphosis these are these are some of the highlights: 

1. Trust and Familiarity Issues: Many farmers have email addresses but often forget passwords or leave accounts inactive, leading to reliance on in-person services. This indicates a lack of trust and familiarity with digital tools.

2. Preference for Traditional Methods: Despite having access to digital tools, a significant number of farmers prefer traditional methods of communication and service acquisition, suggesting resistance to digital adoption. 

3. Awareness and Accessibility: Over 52% of farmers are unaware of the national e-services portal (www.uslugi.gov.mk), and among those informed, only 18% have accessed it, often requiring assistance, indicating barriers in awareness and accessibility.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The UNDP Accelerator Lab brings a unique value proposition by applying an action-learning approach to uncover how digital agricultural solutions can be effectively localized in North Macedonia. Our Lab has recruited the help of UNVs and currently is working analyzing further the solutions identifying areas for  experimenting, identify enablers and barriers, and support the program colleagues to co-create interventions with farmers, policymakers, and tech developers. This work complements broader UNDP initiatives by focusing on the diffusion of innovation rather than solely solution development. Investing in this challenge ensures that digital transformation in agriculture is inclusive and sustainable.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



We aim to learn:

How can digital agricultural solutions be effectively diffused in North Macedonia’s local farming contexts?

What digital skills do smallholder farmers need to fully adopt these solutions?

What factors contribute to the differences in adoption between large-scale and small farmers?

How can e-commerce platforms be improved to support market access for small farmers?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Data Analysis: Using our dataset (Solutions Platform), we will identify patterns in digital solution adoption, compare differences between small and large farmers, and evaluate the effectiveness of existing interventions.

Solutions Mapping: By mapping digital solutions that have successfully scaled in other similar contexts, we can identify best practices and potential models for adaptation in North Macedonia.

Data Collection: We will explore ways to conduct surveys and focus group discussions with farmers to assess their digital skills, usage of existing digital tools, and challenges in e-commerce adoption. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Digital Literacy Assessment: Current reports highlight a digital skills gap but lack specifics on how this affects smallholder farmers' ability to adopt digital solutions.

Adoption Challenges: There is limited data on why certain farmers embrace digital solutions while others do not. Our field data can provide insights into behavioral and contextual barriers.

E-commerce Participation: While we know e-commerce usage is low among farmers, there is little information on the specific barriers they face (e.g., trust, payment access, logistical challenges).
