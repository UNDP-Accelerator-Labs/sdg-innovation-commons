Unwanted loneliness is emerging as a complex and increasingly visible challenge in contemporary societies, affecting people from teenagers to older adults, and appearing with different nuances across the life course. Given its growing relevance, several countries and cities around the world are acting. At the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Argentina, we mapped a wide variety of solutions. Many of these initiatives rely on simple, low-cost, small-scale interventions that are easy to test and replicate across different contexts. Our aim is to learn from them.
What kinds of solutions did we map?We identified six broad lines of action aimed at tackling unwanted loneliness. This classification seeks to organize the initiatives according to their main objectives, though we acknowledge it is not the only possible way — it depends on what aspect is prioritized. Below, we highlight the following:1. Fulfilling activities: programs that create purpose, promote well-being and connection, and encourage lifelong learning. Initiatives like “Volunteering for Wellbeing(link is external)” demonstrate the effectiveness of assigning specific volunteer roles according to participants' interests and knowledge, transforming them from passive recipients into active contributors. Meanwhile, social prescribing(link is external) in the UK connects people with art workshops or walking groups, among other initiatives, while green social prescribing(link is external) incorporates nature-based activities to improve mental health[1].2. Community networks: loneliness is addressed through social bonds and initiatives ranging from friendship, companionship, and listening services to specific roles designed to prevent and/or respond. Experiences include different types of volunteering, as well as figures acting as “radars,” “antennas,” or community mobilizers. Examples include Age UK(link is external) offering face-to-face or telephone friendship services, and Barcelona’s Radars(link is external) program, which involves neighbors, businesses, and pharmacies to detect and support older adults at risk of social isolation.3. Urban solutions: public space emerges as a catalyst for interaction and connection. These initiatives highlight the potential of urban regeneration, which not only revitalizes degraded areas but also strengthens local pride and fosters stronger bonds among neighbors. They also showcase forms of community infrastructure that strategically repurpose underutilized spaces—such as museums or libraries—into new opportunities for social engagement. Mobility is another key element for sustaining everyday connections and ensuring full social participation. Examples include programs where volunteers accompany older adults in their daily commutes, as well as free shuttle services, etc. Urban solutions also reshape the very way of living in the city. An inspiring case is Vivir y Convivir(link is external) in Barcelona—a model of intergenerational cohabitation, replicated and adapted in other cities, that connects students in need of affordable housing with older adults living alone, promoting mutual support and companionship.4. Supporting technology: from apps to robots, technology can extend connections or provide services such as reminders and emergency support. However, it does not replace human contact; rather, it enhances it by designing hybrid schemes or complementing proximity. 5. Private-sector initiatives: businesses and services with a local presence also play a role in addressing unwanted loneliness, while opening new opportunities that drive innovative business models. In the Netherlands, supermarket chain Jumbo introduced chat checkout lanes(link is external), allowing customers to take extra time to talk with cashiers. Similarly, the Chatty Café Scheme(link is external) in the UK designates tables where people can sit if they are open to chatting with strangers. In Argentina, initiatives such as group dinners among strangers are also gaining ground.6. Awareness-raising to break stigma: campaigns designed to foster open conversations to help people feel more comfortable discussing it, seeking support, and joining interventions. #LetsTalkLoneliness(link is external) in the UK or Säg hej! (“Say hi”) in Sweden show how simple gestures —talking about the issue or greeting a neighbor— can open the door to more meaningful relationships. Meanwhile, new media (streaming, podcasts, social media) and traditional channels (such as radio) create spaces for people to identify with similar stories, feel less alone, and recognize that their situation goes beyond the individual level and represents part of a collective challenge. Initiatives such as the podcast in Denmark help make shared realities visible and strengthen the sense of community belonging.Many initiatives do not explicitly frame their work around “loneliness,” but rather draw from more positive narratives such as connection or active living(link is external) to avoid stigmatizing those seeking company. It is likely that you are aware of other similar initiatives emerging both formally and informally in different parts of the world, including Argentina, that could be added to this solutions mapping.

Unwanted loneliness cannot be resolved through isolated solutionsThe solution mapping reminds us that there is no single answer to a complex problem: the key lies in combining approaches and interventions across different dimensions, testing and iterating, generating evidence, and, above all, strengthening the social fabric. For instance, studies show that people connect more effectively when they see themselves as providers of help -whether by contributing specific knowledge, engaging in volunteering, or participating in community life- rather than as passive recipients[2]In short, addressing unwanted loneliness requires designing strategies that place well-being at the heart of development, with a cross-cutting, adaptive, and multisectoral approach. Only then can we respond to this pressing challenge, which, by definition, cannot be solved in isolation.Would you like to know more? Soon, we will launch a report sharing our insights, accompanied by a downloadable resource with over 100 globally mapped solutions.
[1] The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a toolkit that defines social prescribing as a strategy enabling healthcare professionals to refer patients to non-clinical activities and community services—such as workshops, social groups, emotional support, or counseling—to enhance overall health and well-being beyond traditional medical care.[2] Mathera, R., Berman, K., & Mohan, B.
