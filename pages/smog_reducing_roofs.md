> Description of the solution

3M has developed Smog-Reducing Granules that allow manufacturers to produce shingles or capsheets that help eliminate smog pollutants and improve air quality. Each home or building with Smog-Reducing shingles helps remove smog pollutants that come in contact with that roof. The nitrogen oxides in smog are converted into a nitrate salt solid which is a more plant usable form of nitrogen.  The roof on a typical home has the smog-fighting capacity of 2-3 trees with over 1 million trees worth of smog-fighting roofing installed so far.

> Socio-economic effects

Improved public health. The smog-reducing granules are also more reflective than other standard-colored granules. That helps communities bring down the urban heat island effect on scorching summer days.

> Type of Measure

- 1. active measures (direct measures for reduction of air pollution)

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- private sector

> Timescale of implementation

- short-term (up to 1 year)
