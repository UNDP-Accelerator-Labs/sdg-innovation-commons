Technology

> Description of the solution

Chilled water is typically provided by chiller units using absorption refrigeration or compression refrigeration. It can then be used to provide cool air, in air handling units, to be ducted around the building, chilled beams, chilled ceiling. Chiller units use a refrigerant that boils at a low temperature and pressure, removing heat from chilled water and the condenses to release that heat which is rejected to the outside or recovered.
