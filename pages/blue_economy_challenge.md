Blue Economy Challenge
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is how to use the great potential of the blue economy in Cape Verde to promote social-economic development and job creation while supporting ocean health and the enhancement of natural resources.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Cabo Verde is a small SIDS country composed by 10 islands and 8 islets, with approximately 4.000 km2, located about 500 miles from the West African coast. Economically the country has performed well in the past four decades and achieved graduation to Middle-Income Country in 2007 and good performance indicators in governance, education, health and human development, compared to the sub-region. Tourism has made a major contribution to the country’s economic development with an exponential growth in the last 3 decades and accounts, directly, for about 25% of GDP, but total contribution is suspected to be larger. Tourism is driving growth in construction, retail, transportation, energy, financial, services, etc. But this dependence on Tourism is one major vulnerability of the country. The impacts of the COVID-19 crisis came to prove this one more time, with latest estimations indicating a record recession of -14% of GDP in 2020, beating worst expectations, when the number of incoming tourists reduced 75% compared to 2019. Others vulnerabilities of Cabo Verde as SIDS are Climate Change and longstanding droughts, high poverty rate and significant regional inequalities. On the other hand, the country recognizes great potential in maritime economy, with its vast Exclusive Economic Zone and related resources. The sector is a recognized country priority and strategic planning has been developed by the authorities with help of international partners to unlock this potential and promote investments in ports and maritime transports, bunkering, fisheries, renewable energy and other related areas. But real diversification is still a major challenge. Agriculture is very limited in Cabo Verde. Almost 80% of all food and 85% of domestic cereal demand is imported. Fisheries sector also faces many challenges. Altogether the primary sector accounts for only 9% of GDP. Artisanal fishing families are facing increasing challenges to access marine resources for subsistence and income. Aquaculture is limited to a few programs. Poverty rates are highest amongst the country’s rural communities. The country also faces other significant impacts of “unsustainable” economic activities, namely habitat destruction from over-construction in coastal areas, overfishing and reduction of species, plastic and waste in ocean, among others. Cabo Verde is rich in globally significant biodiversity. The nation’s coastal zones and EEZ provide habitat for extensive marine biodiversity with a significant rate of endemic and emblematic species. All these opportunities and challenges urges the necessity to promote the sustainable economy linked to the ocean: the Blue Economy.

The total land mass of Cabo Verde is very small, at approximately 4,000 km2.  The nation has 952 kilometers of coast line. Cabo Verde’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is an area of over 800,000 km2. The country is in negotiations for the extension of  its EEZ. The total government budget for 2016 was US$ 511 million. The World Bank estimates GDP per capita of US$ 3,200 in 2017.  Cabo Verde’s 2016 HDI score ranked 10th in Africa and in the top sixty-percentile globally. The division of the country’s GDP is roughly 70% service sector, 20% remittances, 9% fisheries and agriculture, and the remainder light manufacturing. In 1995, approximately 30,000 tourists visited Cabo Verde.  In 2016, this number jumped to 650,000.  Last year (2019), according to National Statistics Institute, more than 810,000 tourists visited the islands.  This exponential growth was anticipated to continue before the pandemic.  According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, tourism directly contributed approximately 17% of GDP in 2016 and will likely approach 30% of GDP within the next decade.  However, the total contribution of the tourism sector to Cabo Verde is suspected to be larger. Cabo Verde is semi-arid receiving an average annual rainfall of only 261 millimeter. There is little natural vegetation and/or fresh water.  The nation relies increasingly upon desalination.    Cape Verde is the 3rd largest turtle spawning site on our planet, is the 11th Global Hotspot for Terrestrial and Marine Biodiversity and is considered one of the 23 Marine Ecoregions of Global Importance for Biodiversity for the high rate of endemic species and home to emblematic species of world importance. Plastic represents at least 1/3 of the waste in Cabo Verde.

Ocean fisheries are principal to the nation’s sustainable livelihoods and food security. Poverty rates are highest amongst the country’s rural communities.  Rural households rely almost entirely upon relatively inexpensive and historically easy to access marine resources for subsistence and income, but facing significant challenges. Here are some challenges / opportunities identified for the sector: • Unsustainable economic activities in the Ocean: Overfishing, Plastic, habitat destruction, Chemical pollution, deoxygenation, etc.; • Near the coast maritime resources has been decreasing in the past few years. • Artisanal fishers facing many challenges and have to go further into the sea with little conditions to fish and obtain income for subsistence; • Low aggregate value to artisanal fishing: logistic channels, marketplaces. • Potential new source of income from activities connected to tourism and ecotourism • Maritime security. • Overfishing. Some species in danger • Use technology to create new opportunities in the sector namely: identify new resources, provide more fishing security in boats and vessels, surveillance for illegal fishing; • Potential activities to develop in blue economy: Renewable Energy, Fisheries, Maritime Transport, Waste Management, Tourism, Climate Change.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Grow possibilities for this challenge include the catalytic effect of selected solutions or projects to leverage the potential of blue economy in promoting socio-economic development in target sub-sectors such as artisanal fisheries, ecotourism, maritime security, renewables or ocean health. A mid-term acceleration program of selected solutions with support of partners such as entrepreneurship and other agencies, NGOs, private sector associations, universities, experts and adequate resources can induce change and impact positively the blue economy ecosystem.
