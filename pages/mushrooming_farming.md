> Title of the innovation

Mushrooming farming

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation  involves mushroom farming . The demand for supply of mushroom has been high especially in periods without rain. Attempting to meet the demand for this produce is the principal problem the innovation is trying to solve.  To solve this problem, I intend to leverage the modern methods of mushroom farming under irrigation so as to have constant supply of mushroom  even during seasons when the produce gets scarce in most of the supermarkets, fresh food stores and other markets

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

To generate income from mushroom , I intend to maximize sales by establishing strong links with supermarkets and marketers.  
 ❖ Estimated users per annum= Numerous  
❖ Estimated cost of operation=K30,000($1714.286)  
❖ Total cost/ expenses=K88,500($5057.143)  
❖ 1 m2 of mycelium 18 cm thick=25 kg  
❖ Intended target area in m2= 200m2  
❖ 200m2= 500kg= K150,000($8571.429)  Profit=K150,000( $8571.429)- K88,500(5057.143)=K61500($3514.286)  Profit margin=41% of K150,000($8571.429
Target Audience/Customers 1. Supermarkets 2. Marketers 3. Institutions involved in exportation.
The innovation does not contribute to land pollution instead it helps to replenish the fertility of the environment as it uses degradable materials such as saw dust as a source of organic nutrients for the growth of mushroom.

> Technical Feasibility

A board called National Union for Small Scale Farmers in Zambia (NUSFAZ) will be engaged as it gives information about the available markets. Furthermore, local agents will be engaged to facilitate the movement of mushroom  to international market. For local supply, supermarkets and marketers will be engaged through sales representatives.  To grow customer base, maintain relationships and build customer loyalty I will create an online platform to get timely feedback from customers . Zambia Farmers Hub and social media will be used for online advertising. For offline marketing, marketing materials will be printed out and distributed through agents. 
 Statistical data show that there is great potential in this business with good profit margin. Once launched, I forecast this venture to grow and lead to further diversification, and this has been projected toward the end of 2023. 
▪ First quarter :  Expansion of the market , both locally and at international level.  ▪ Second quarter: Canning and drying of mushroom. Once the standards set by the Zambia Food and Drug Commission are met, canned and dried  mushroom will be made available for sale locally and exportation.  
▪ Third quarter: Construction of more mushroom growing rooms.  
 ▪ Fourth quarter: Strengthening my team by helping them attend programmes and other forums that address challenges and issues pertaining to our business. Furthermore, I wish to diversify into other ventures as a way of expanding my business.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation aims at meeting the demand for mushroom in Zambia which becomes markedly scarce for long periods of the year. The naturally growing mushroom only appears in rain season,but with this innovation there will be continuous supply of mushroom throughout the year as it is going to leverage irrigation and modern methods of mushroom farming. The innovation will also create employment for my fellow youths.
