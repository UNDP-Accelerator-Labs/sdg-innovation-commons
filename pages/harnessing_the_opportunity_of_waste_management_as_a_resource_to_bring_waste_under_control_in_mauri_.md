## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- so far, there is no sorting system of waste at the household level.  - explored a very interesting and innovative solution ''smart trash'' that can address solid waste in Mauritania. - we learned about the importance of having a comprehensive mapping of the main waste disposal sites in the city of Nouakchott to enable optimal positioning of waste bins to prevent the spread of waste.  - the importance of raising awareness on the risks of waste sites and the importance of behavior-changing starting from the household level.  - composting as a solution for palm waste management.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Obtaining reliable data on solid waste disposal sites was challenging - We tried t address this barrier by using a consultant to gather information and data about the challenge.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

these methods helped in identifying the orgine of the waste problem as well as mapping existing solutions (such as smart trash) - Also, they enabled us to foresee adequate methods of intervention. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Yes, in order to obtain a clear vision of the problem we had to use existing solutions for an optimal intervention.
