DP3T Tracker is an application that allows you to track your own social contacts 
and check the risk of catching COVID-19 depending on who and when the person was in contact. 
Unlike other similar programs, DP3T Tracker processes data locally and does not 
violate person's privacy.

• Tracking contacts based on a combination of Bluetooth and ultra-
sound signals.

• Minimum information - maximum privacy. The application collects and
processes the minimum required amount of data being processed only
locally on the smartphone. The algorithm of rotation of identifiers is used.
• The application is designed for the Android operating system, unfortunately iOS does not
allows you to work with background processes.
