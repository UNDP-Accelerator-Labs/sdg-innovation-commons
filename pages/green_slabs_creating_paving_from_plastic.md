Green Slabs considers the problem of plastic waste in Zimbabwe. Plastic litter causes an unhealthy environment for pedestrians who use public spaces. The start up creates community clean up campaigns to collect this litter that forms an ingredient in the slabs they manufacture. Green slabs uses different technologies to make pavement slabs from recycled material, particularly plastic and glass and or rubber, in pursuit of a cleaner Bulawayo.
