Description: The OLA filter offers a solution for communities with access to a water source through pipes, but that is contaminated or unfit for human consumption. Through tiny fibers, all contaminants in the water are trapped.

It should only be connected to the outlet of the "Jet" and the water that comes out of the filter is completely filtered.   

Interesting feature: It is an instant filter and it is also portable.
