Water from Air - An integrated solution that allows to generate water from air by absorbing water particles using difference in temperature. The energy needed for the equipment is generated from green sources: solar panel and wind turbine. This solution enables access for small communities to drinking water in remote areas where deployment of traditional infrastructure is not feasible. This set allows producing 30 liters of drinking water daily. UNDP Uzbekistan has tested this integrated solution to demonstrate green and viable solution at small remote community at mountainous location.
