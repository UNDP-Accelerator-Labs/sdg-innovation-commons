> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

The bicycle -apart from being a sustainable mode of transport- is the fundamental tool of the sharpener´s daily work. It transforms energy to sharpen knives and allows him to freely move around the neighbourhood, offering a door to door service.
Taking care of daily items (like scissors and knives) not only adds value as sharpeners labour but also reduces waste of disposable knives and scissors.
