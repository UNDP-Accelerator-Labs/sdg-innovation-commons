Binheyo is an urban farming start-up designed to address the rapid income loss brought about by the pandemic while also positively contributing to the environment. Binheyo provides people with equipment and expertise to grow microgreens on a contract basis. The harvest will then be bought back from individuals, providing them with a reliable source of income and offering local cafés and businesses to buy fresh, healthy, and organic produce at affordable prices. Binheyo is also one of the winners of UNDP’s Social Innovation Camp.
