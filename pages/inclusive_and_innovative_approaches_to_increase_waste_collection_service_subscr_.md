## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Inclusive and Innovative approaches to increase waste collection service subscription rate in the municipality of Ratoma
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that households subscription rate to waste management collection is very low in Ratoma municipality to support and manage a sustainable waste management system.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Throughout our first 100 days learning cycle, we explored the waste management system in Conakry and specially in the municipality of Ratoma. We held several collective intelligence and sense making session to identify gaps in the system by using communities and citizen-based approaches to think and map the system. As a result, we reached to the conclusion that subscription rate to waste management collection service is quite low to support a sustainable waste management system. Indeed, according to according to quick survey conducted in collaboration with Ratoma’s municipality only 25% of the households are holding a subscription to the waste management collection service. Moreover, the subscription payments are not regular. The consequence is that the waste collection service is unregular and SME’s as well as the municipality are facing financials ressources mobilization challenge to support waste collection and cleanliness operations.

UNDP's and columbia university students  conducted a survey on the waste management system in Conakry. the Lab and Ratoma's municipality generated crowdsourcing data and a system mapping. Find below the data generated.

By exploring the waste management system in Conakry we learned that there is a vertical and a horizontal lines, and a macro and a micro scale in the system. The vertical line of the system is related to institutions and regulations: Ministry, National Agency, Laws. The Horizontal line is divided into two parrales type of interactions: To the top we identified operationnal issues:  waste production, operations related to the collection and the transport and financials issue. To the bottom we identified actors: the municipalities area, the SME'S and Households.  The vertical axe is mostly working on the macro-environnement of the system: public landfill management, waste collection at  transit and collection points. At the macro level the system is working quite correctly. At the micro level characterized by operationnal items and pre-collection actors, there is a gap between in a specific segment: from the housholds to the collection point. This is municipalities, SME's and Households issues. The fact is that due to low rate of household subscription the pre collection operations are only randmly effective up to 75% in the municipality of Ratoma. The simulation made by the Lab and the municipality of Ratoma shows that once the subscription increased the pre collection service will improve and residual waste in communities will decrease. Find below the gap hightliting scheme.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Labs methods are unique, quickly applicable and the most inclusives ones. Many actors and stakeholders worked and are working on the issue of waste management, but all initiatives implemented till now are on hand limit their scope at the macro level (logistics, institutionnal and infrastructures). On the other hand, the bottom side of the system (households, community level business model) is untapped. Therefore, by using simple methods and reasonnable ressources, the Lab will be able to built a portfolio of solutions to tacke the weak signal. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

In Conakry, Only 25% of households are waste collection service subscribers. UNDP Guinea Acc Lab is working inclusively with Ratoma municipality and communities to increase subscription rate.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How to increase households subscription to waste collection service to positively impact waste management system in the municipality of Ratoma?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Community assets mapping: we will focused on economics assets and institutions in the communities Communities heads and people with influence will be our key partners on this path we can easily mobilize communities. Citizen science: we will use open learning session Our approach is citizen based. We will then highligh to them the extend of the problem and request from them a reflection to design the most suitable price for the service. Collective Intelligence: we will continue gathering all the stakeholders involved. And with crowdsourcing we will be able to have qualitative orientation on our challenge. At the end we aim to test a community challenge as a lever to increase subscription. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Our data sources will give us a clear situation of the problem. For example the current on daily waste production is questionnable because it s a result of the total waste transported to the landfill divided by the numbers of households. Our new orientation is to have at the community level the real data so to challenge on subscription will be designed from raw sources. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?
