Contributory project: It is designed by scientists, and citizens participate in data collection.

Overall goal: Study how melting glaciers affect phytoplankton communities in the west of the Antarctic Peninsula.  Specific goals: Analyze phytoplankton biodiversity and dynamics in coastal areas, which are not so broadly studied in the west of the Antarctic Peninsula. - Raise awareness among visitors as regards the importance of microalgae communities in Antarctic ecosystems. 

Description of citizen participation: Participants with no formal training arrive at the points of interest by tourist ships and disembark in Zodiac-type boats together with a polar guide, who was previously trained by the researchers of the project. They take different water samples (tap, bottle, and meltwater samples), make environmental measurements (conductivity, temperature, and depth measures [CTD], and the Secchi disk) with tools provided by the project team, and duly record data in spreadsheets. At the end of the season, data and samples are collected and sent to the researchers in order to be analyzed.
