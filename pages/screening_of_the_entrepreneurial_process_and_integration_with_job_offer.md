> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to learn if those who undertake out of necessity do not formalize because they dedicate themselves to starting a business to subsist temporarily, while they get a job

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If efficient screening mechanisms are established in entrepreneurship support programs that identify those people with fewer entrepreneurial opportunities and efficient employability networks, they would be more easily linked to the workplace and there would not be as much informal entrepreneurship.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The experimentation group will receive clear and specific information on the route and will be able to access the job offer programs that will facilitate the process.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Entrepreneurs that are in a very early informal stage. 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The data will come from the number of the entrepreneurs continue their formalization route vs the ones that choose the job seeking programs.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
