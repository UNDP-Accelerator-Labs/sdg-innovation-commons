> Brief description about the identified local solution:

The first localized Design Thinking training manual in Iraq has been developed and tested with individuals and institutions for the people who are interested in innovation and entrepreneurship to find worth- solving problems and build partnerships around them. This training manual covers the five stages of Design Thinking (Empathy, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Testing) and their tangible application to the Iraqi market represented by selected local entrepreneurial start-ups. Can be used for any young person interested in Innovation, Design Thinking, or Entrepreneurship… alone or working with a team… planning a social initiative or a business… a student planning his/her graduation project… trying to design a training agenda or even a training program on Design Thinking… for anyone who is working at a bank, company, government institution, organization or university and heard about Design Thinking and wonder if it could add value to their work? For people working on Peace Building and Social Cohesion, Design Thinking can be a great method to gather people around ideas, projects and solutions.
