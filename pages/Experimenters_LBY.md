# Libya's Emergency Response to Groundwater Surfaces.

### [[0:05]] OK, your name, your title and say I consent to this recording\.

OK\. My name is Abdul Rahman Al Basir, the head of experimentation at Club Libya\. And I consent on this recording\. All yours\.

### [[0:23]] All right\. Thank you\. Abbott, could you tell me about an R&D activity you would like to share?

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tools:Data Powered Positive Deviance]]
Sure\. I'll talk about a recent activity that we're working on, which is about emergency response issue in, in Libya, where in a coastal city, the groundwater started to raise from, from the reservoir and started to surface up, causing environmental issues and, and hazards\. And, and, and in there we have started working on leveraging satellite imagery and computer vision, which is a machine learning technique to basically estimate and monitor the water that is on, on the lakes that are are forming in, in, in support to the government and the country office interventions there\.

### [[1:18]] OK, great\. So how did it start?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
So the start was basically the news was and social media and and TV always about this tragedy and this emergency where people are face needed to this to be displaced and and move from their houses because of of the water coming up to their houses causing, as I said, you know, serious environmental issues in the area\. So we need it as as an, an, an, a development entity to do something\. Basically it's, it's people that we know who's who are living there\. We wanted to do something basically to help\. And the news that we've seen that there is not much has been done in terms of the context that we are trying to do\. And and that's where it started\. And the inspiration that I got was basically from a course that I was taking from UNDB\. It's about social media analytics where there was a lecture about leveraging satellite images and computer vision in development or past crisis\. So you kind of you kind of covered the development issues, yeah\. And how it started and what the situation looked like\.

### [[2:44]] So who, who was involved in your journey?

So a a bunch of of of people we have in in the country, the government had started a technical committee, which is basically university professors and and experts in the field where I was\. We attended a couple of their workshops where they were trying to raise awareness and try to root cause the issue there and also the municipalities and the local university and, and in that city\.

### [[3:21]] OK, what was their role? What was their role?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Agility]]
Their roles? Basically they are, we're trying to understand because a lot of rumors, you know, why the water started to raise up from the ground causing all of these problems\. So we're all basically was from a, a scientific perspective, trying to root cause\. What's the problem analyzing, you know, trying to come up with some reasonable causes of, of this issue was the flooding that happened a couple of months ago or No, it's not that it could be that\. So, so definitely it's the climate change\. So things are changing\. And one of the things that we also wanted to touch upon it and, and after within this intervention is that we have, you know, the change is the only constant\. That's the, the, the thing that we are trying to capitalize on\. And instead of only looking at this problem from a bad view, we are trying to explore also what could we actually benefit from this? You know, for example, this is a water that can be leveraged to do some other stuff\. So we're still experimenting doing, but for, for now, it's mainly about this emergency response and trying to help with these monitoring capabilities that we can\.

### [[4:39]] Is it freshwater?

It, it has been contaminated because there is, you know, this, I don't know how to say it, but you know, the, the sewage systems there are\. So it, it has been contaminated, but in other areas it's, it's like a good water\.

### [[4:59]] So, so how did you ensure diverse stakeholder perspective?

[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
So it's, yeah, it's, it's kinda was enforced\. But from the country office, we have the energy and environment pillar that we, we try to work with\. And, and they again, by engaging in those workshops conducted by the scientific committee, we had the chance to engage with the local university, with the municipality and, and, and that's pretty much it\. That as it is important, you know, great\. So what are, what are I? And I can add one thing, which is basically after attempting that course, we, we found that, you know, the, the Research Center that I got inspired from the lecture, we're a research centre in, in Qatar\. And, and I had a couple of meetings with the professor who did a similar intervention in, in the floodings that happened in Pakistan\. So that's, you can consider it as a, as a, as an international, maybe a stakeholder or a partner that we, we are working with\.

### [[6:08]] So what were the tools and methods that you used to do what you just described in life?

[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
So again, I'm a data and theist and, you know, coming from R&D background, I found this as a, as a, the best opportunity to basically leverage what I, what I know and I what, what, what I've been doing in, in the couple, couple of years into a very noble, noble interventional cause, which is, you know, doing an emergency response in, in this case and try to help the, the local people in, in our community\. So the tools that that we are using are basically data analytics and data science and some programming tools like Python And Netbox and, and, and some computer, sorry, satellite data tools\. And yeah, that we can extract images from from, from those\.

### [[7:05]] So what what do you think were the skills needed effectively, effectively identify and understand the challenges or needs that your R&D work work in to address?

[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Undertanding the community]]
[[skills:Community building]]
[[skills:Volunteering and taking initiatives]]
So I I would say bonus, some of them are basically just, you know, sense making and trying to always be on on, on alerted on the local challenges that happens in in in the local communities\. And the other thing is that, you know, being staying current and, and, and always participating and, and couldn't in, in, in continuous learning, basically, for example, the, the tools or the, I got inspired from a course that I attended where I got the tools and I, I'm trying to basically use and this, this intervention now\.

### [[7:55]] Nice, really nice\. So what was the outcome of your RMB journal?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
So, so far, it's basically we're planning a collective intelligence workshop that we're going to present what we have done so far, basically trying to show what the technology can do in, in, in, in, in, in, in certain situations\. In such situations, we're trying to bring the community of experts, we're trying to bring governments in this workshop and also some startups and out\-of\-the\-box thinkers basically to think what we can do with with this water, for example, it's it's a it's a cross and a pressing at the same time\. So we should leverage the other one\. So trying to raise awareness, show what the technology can contribute in this and also what we can do with the current situation and try to get the the best out of that\. And also we're, we're planning to maybe publish a research paper about how can we actually use technology to and, and in such scenarios\.

### [[9:01]] Great\. So how did or will your work impact sustainable development?

So this, you know, this is basically a it, it will help with the post crisis settings\. Having such a monitoring dashboard would allow the governmental entities to have the capability to monitor and basically ensure that people are safe, have an eye on the climate change, you know, thing and it's real and they they have to do something about it always\. And, and, and, and that, that that's, I think what I can think about right now\.

### [[9:46]] OK, so for the learnings, what would you do differently if you had started?

Yeah, OK, this is a tough question, but I think I would act more faster and more agile way\. Don't set high expectations and just do the thing before, you know, try to perfect it\. I think that cost us a bit of time\. But if we tried and, and doing it in, in a more agile and fast way and, and just, you know, having a quick and dirty thing that shows the potential and, and, and downsides that we are aiming to, to show\. It's better than just, you know, perfecting everything and, and, and that would cost you time and maybe losing the opportunity to, to shine there\.

### [[10:33]] Would you do more research the research?

Yeah, definitely\. You know researching more would be always good\. You know, it will speed up the the process of implementing such a solutions\.

### [[10:50]] Great\. OK, so diffusion and catalyzation, what strategies or approaches did you employ to facilitate the diffusion and adoption of the R&D outcomes?

So I, I think I would, I'll go back to the collective intelligence workshop that we are planning, which will get us the visibility and get us, get our platform, the visibility so that the government would have an ownership on that and, and, and use it and, and sustain it and, and, and maybe scale it across the country\. Because we also hear other news, you know, like in other cities like 100 kilometres away that a similar phenomena is witnessing\.
