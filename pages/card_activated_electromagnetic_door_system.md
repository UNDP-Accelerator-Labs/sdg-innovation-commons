> Brief description of the innovation

The electromagnetic door lock system is simple device consists of a magnetic lock and armature plate with no moving parts and works due to magnetic field. An access control system is operated by a swipe card reader to identify the user card whether access is allowed or not. The power circuit will be supplied from 250v power supply outlet  and a backup battery will supply power when electricity goes so that continued operation of the door lock system.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This will increase the security of existing business like University, police station , school and hospital and will restrict access to sensitive rooms only to those with authorization cards it will improve identification of individuals in an organization and locating personnel who had access to a building. This is how it generate income for the business.

> Technical Feasibility

The electromagnetic door lock system is simple device consists of a magnetic lock and armature plate with no moving parts and works due to magnetic field. An access control system is operated by a swipe card reader to identify the user card whether access is allowed or not. The power circuit will be supplied from 250v power supply outlet  and a backup battery will supply power when electricity goes so that continued operation of the door lock system. It costs about K10000 Budget to make in operation and can be improved to further automation because of the covid 19 pandemic.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will in this pandemic of covid, increase security in sensitive building, and help address attendance in schools.
