Galoa District School located in Bua, Fiji, has been provided solar-powered water production units that produces pure and clean water out of thin air. The school previously did not have access to clean, safe drinking water. Hydro panels create approximately 4-10 litres a day, depending on weather conditions. The school was provided 2 hydro panels, but given the large number of students they would need more panels to fully cater for everyone, however, it is a good starting point.
