Reimagining New Capital City: Inclusive and Anticipatory Nusantara
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the development and transition of Indonesia's New Capital City processes are exclusive and rigidly top-down behind closed doors, which ignited protests and criticism from public on points of inclusivity and public participation in the decision making process.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The Indonesian government currently plans to move the national capital city (Ibu Kota Negara — IKN)  to a newly built city in East Kalimantan in 2024. 



As the current capital—Jakarta—serves as the main centre for business activities, the designation of a new capital is planned to distribute economic development more evenly across the country. However, the relocation of the capital elicit concerns among members of the public. One of the issues raised is the social impact of large-scale migration of civil servants and other relevant stakeholders into the area, particularly in relation to the existing presence of indigenous peoples and local communities. Additionally, the inwards flow of migration could bring about unintended consequences such as urban sprawling and the rise of unregulated satellite cities.




Another major concern raised is regarding the city’s construction and its impact on the biodiversity and ecological landscape of the area. As a foundation for the planning process, the government has also passed legislation, namely Law No. 3/2022 and Presidential Decree No.64/2022 regarding the National Capital. Based on the current regulatory framework, the IKN vision is to become a sustainable ‘forest’ city through planning of at least 65% of the city’s territory as public, green, and open spaces. Given that the IKN location will be situated in forest areas with rich biodiversity, it is imperative to ensure that the city’s development process conserves the forests and its natural resources.




Furthermore, The National Planning and Development Agency (BAPPENAS) also highlighted the issue of inclusivity through their academic paper in 2020. This document emphasizes that social development must take place simultaneously with economic progress, where community participation is essential during the city’s developments. The main criticism focuses on the lack of involvement of indigenous communities that are occupying the land in the decision-making process.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

With its extensive portfolio on urban resilience and focus on bottom-up insights, the Accelerator Lab Indonesia is at a strategic position to enable a platform for impacted local communities to convey their aspirations and concerns, as a way to balance national development agenda. The AccLab Indonesia's focus on resilient cities can enable governments to quickly and effectively respond to various uncertainties and complexities. Building this capacity would require the government and other stakeholders in the planning process to identify various trends and its implications on different aspects of the city.




Predominantly, the design of IKN aims to achieve a city that maintains nature, cultural customs, and local traditions - without marginalizing indigenous people. To achieve these objectives, an integrated effort is necessary to foster systemic growth alongside the development of both physical and non-physical infrastructure. Moreover, the new capital should strive to have the capability to anticipate future needs of its citizens, ensuring gender and social cohesion and inclusion (GESI), as well as the resiliency to face potential crises and their substantial risks.




Through approaches such as strategic foresight, the AccLab Indonesia's can support governments to draw insights from ‘weak signals’ identified by the community on the ground, build alternative scenarios and develop policies for the new capital accordingly. Similarly, community members would be able to contribute their aspirations and collective imagination of the new capital, particularly from marginalized groups, to ensure that no one is left behind. Thus, this project aims to leverage strategic foresight approach to provide recommendations for the new National Capital that is anticipatory, inclusive, and systemic.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

(i) How would green open spaces of the New Capital City be planned and managed to achieve a sustainable forest city?


(ii) How can the planned platform for communities' involvement be optimized to achieve an inclusive city?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The project relies heavily on foresight tools such as Inclusive Imaginaries, Horizon Scanning and Scenario Development as a way to gain collective imagination from local impacted communities from the development of the New Capital City. To ensure that the processes upholds representation, a variety of ethnographic and participatory design approaches are also utilized when designing the field activities.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The focus of the project is to gain data on Collective Imagination from local impacted communities, in order to determine their aspirations and concerns for the New Capital City in the future. This process will also be supported with data from participatory observation and qualitative interviews during field missions. Moreover, as a basis for the participatory workshops, an secondary research that analyzes existing policy, regulation and laws as well as publications such as journals and academic papers are carried out to inform the baseline.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The targeted beneficiary of this project is mainly the government partners, both OIKN and BRIN, that would benefit from bottom-up insights on aspirations and concerns from local communities in regards to the New Capital City. These insights are projected to be adopted during the revision of the Law around the New Capital City to ensure that the transition processes are inclusive and equitable, responding to the current criticism towards an exclusive and top-down process. Moreover, for UNDP colleagues, this project initiated a potential pipeline for various issues such as climate action, renewable energy, waste management, circular economy, governance, peace and justice, GBV, disaster resilience, digital and innovative financing.
