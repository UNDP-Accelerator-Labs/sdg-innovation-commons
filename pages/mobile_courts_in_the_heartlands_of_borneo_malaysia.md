While catered to many legal issues, the mobile court initiative in the state of Sabah, Malaysia focuses to address the challenge of late birth registrations in the state. Late registrations, unfortunately has been quite a challenge to overcome due to limited geographical terrains, transportation and other documentation difficulties.  Since its inception in 2007, the programme has been effectively reaching out to those affected by this predicament - in both urban and peripheral areas across the state. With a high frequency of late birth registrations in the state, the initiative targets to resolve the problem by bringing the court to the people, particularly to areas where communities have difficulty reaching out to the authorities. Late birth registrations are particularly problematic as they hinder persons of concern from having equal rights as to those that have registered their births within the time period as stipulated by the law, despite the former's status as citizens of the State. Apart from managing and hearing legal cases, the mobile court team also collaborates with other governing bodies and civil organisations to provide other services such as legal advice and health services to the communities.
