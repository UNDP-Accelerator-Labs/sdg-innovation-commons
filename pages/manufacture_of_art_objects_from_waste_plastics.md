This initiative brings us to Timbuktu in the north of Mali where an artist uses plastic waste and scrap metal to create works of art (animals, tables etc). This initiative is aesthetically pleasing while at the same time making a change in behaviour with respect to solid waste management. These recycled works of art are much appreciated by the visitors who go there.
