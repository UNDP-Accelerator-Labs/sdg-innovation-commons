Education System in Iraq Amid COVID-19, The Challenges:

E-learning signal started emerging in Iraq after the spread of COVID-19 in April 2020; this is actually a tremendous window of opportunity to strengthen the Iraqi education system. In Iraq, the education system is largely focused on offline teaching tools. The incorporation of e-learning will support digital skills of teachers and students, more efficient and effective teaching methods, and the suitability of youth to the digital job market. When COVID-19 hit the world, restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic have disturbed education systems all around the world. In Iraq specifically, all learning has moved online suddenly and without prior notice. This affected mainly the way the material is being delivered and the assessment methods. Hence, this required a quick intervention from the eco-system enablers (UNDP Accelerator Lab Iraq) to induce structural changes to the education system through introducing blended learning.

The Solution, Blended Learning Teaching Methods Curriculum:

Seventeen Iraqi experts from the higher education system worked together to tackle the above challenge with the support of the UNDP Accelerator Lab Iraq and in partnership with the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research by writing the first from its kind teaching methods curriculum "the Blended Learning Teaching Methods Curriculum" for seven specializations; Administrative, Medical &amp; Health Sciences, Engineering, Educational, Humanities, Agricultural and Veterinary, Scientific.). The Blended Learning Teaching Methods Curriculum upskills higher educational professionals to adopt new technological skills and encourage a hybrid mode of learning, combining online learning with on-campus learning. It is the first of its kind in Iraq, and the newly-developed curriculum is officially rolled out across 35 Iraqi universities to serve more than 50,000 academic staff.
