## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- Waste collection fees being high and not subsidized is one of the biggest challenge highlighted for waste management in the city of Kigali.  - A considerate number of citizens already segregate waste and create mostly compost out of their organic waste (mainly in rural sectors like Nduba, Masaka, Gahanga, Kinyinya). - A number of citizens indicate the need for training on waste management practices and waste collection tools. - More than 50 % of the city's population seem not to know the companies that are in charge of waste collection.  - There is a number of unserviced citizens living in the hard to reach areas and inaccessible by waste collection trucks. 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
To be published soon. 

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

- Stakeholders in waste management working in silos. There is overlapping of activities.  - Delays in the implementation of planned activities due to busy schedules of responsible stakeholders. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

- Surveys, Direct interviews and citizen data helped to deeply understand citizen's perspective on their day to day challenges on waste management and how best they can be addressed from their point of view. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Sense-making, co-creation, collective intelligence and participatory design helped to convene all stakeholders in waste management and understand what each stakeholder is working on to address the issue.  We used solutions mapping to identify local solutions to citizens' challenges identified. Prototyping and pilots is helping to validate if the identified solutions will tackle the challenge.
