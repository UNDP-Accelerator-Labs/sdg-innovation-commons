> Brief description of the innovation

Higher grounds academy learning center is a small and independent learning center which was initially  established in 2019. The initiative is aimed at improving the quality of education in Isoka district of Muchinga province of Zambia. The initiative focuses on providing extra lesson/tuitions to learners who are unable to afford to pay for after school lessons in places where they offer tuitions. The higher grounds academy also try to help unemployed teachers by trying to incorporate them in the program, hence reducing the high number of unemployment among youths in the province and the nation at large. Isoka being in the rural part of Zambia experiences a lot of challenges and under developments and education is not an exception. Higher grounds academy learning center looks at how best learners can be helped by ensuring that they have enough time regarding learning and how best learners can have access to learning materials and exam preparation materials particularly those in examination classes. With help we wish to expand our institution so that we address these issues effectively and efficiently and also address other problems regarding education in the district.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The long term goal is to establish the first modern primary and secondary school in the distinct. With our current operations we have a good number of pupils who manages to come for lessons at an almost free of charge fee we charge. This charge is simply to carter for building rentals and other teaching aid materials. With a well established and well financed institution we believe we can make higher grounds academy learning center a well recognised institution. Isoka district has no well established private primary or secondary school. We are visionary that we can establish the very first morden private school around that will be able to compete with the already existing government schools in the district. This is going to provide employment to a good number of people in the district particularly the youths.

> Technical Feasibility

We are a team of five unemployed teachers who have come together and we are offering lessons in the basic five subject which includes Mathematics, English, Biology, Science (physics and chemistry) and integrated science for junior secondary. 
We have a building we are renting at a fee. 
With time we wish to have our own property so that our institution can grow bigger.
But finances remain a challenge.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our innovation will create employment and increase the number of pupils who will pass with flying colours at both junior secondary and senior secondary. With the unforeseen closures the education sector has experienced due to the covid-19 pandemic there is need to come up with strategies that is going to help pupils catch up on there studies and get them ready for their exams. Higher grounds academy learning center is one of those strategies.  The market is readily available.
