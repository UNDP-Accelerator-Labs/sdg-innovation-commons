## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Providing business intelligence to the UNDP and its institutional partners in charge of economy on central issues, impediments, and needs of the companies for their digital transformation, by providing specific reports and summary analysis and view into individual responses of the companies to the Digital Pulse questionnaire.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we develop a survey that mimics a structured interview THEN we will get a clear insight into the skills gaps and needs of surveyees. IF we provide incentives to the surveyees (automated data-driven advisory, participation in capacity building events) THEN we will achieve a representative sample.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We developed a surveying platform that analyses current companies' digital practices in 1) online communication and sales; 2) customer and partner management; 3) employees' digital capacities; 4) cybersecurity awareness and practice; 5) data-driven decision-making; 6) manufacturing and service provisioning using Industry 4.0 technologies. UNDP can analyse the data, identify the main issues, impediments and needs of the companies in the assessment areas, support institutional partners in developing support policy options and follow up with individual companies and SMEs to implement suggested solutions.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Individual company response

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The survey presents users with multiple choice questions in each area, with the logic of a structured interview where the following questions in the survey are conditioned with answers to the previous one. Companies gain or lose points with each answer. The company's digital profile and recommendations are formulated based on the answers provided.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

4 months to develop a platform and run the survey

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Translation and review of the questionnaire provided by the Luxembourg Chamber of Trade. Digital marketing to reach MSMEs and invite them to measure their "digital pulse".
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes. To date, some 670+ companies completed the survey and provided insight into their current digital performance and their needs for further digitalization.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

This experiment was very quickly implemented to feed into the pilot project focusing on the digital transformation of the economy. We could have done a more thorough and critical review of the survey, possibly adding new modules that would feed into the UNDP country office program e.g. focus on women-owned companies and young entrepreneurs. Still, the digital solution developed provides enough resources to amend the current survey and do the research with the registered companies.   

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Some 4-6 months, for the development of the surveying tool and gathering a representative sample of companies who submitted their answers.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Tool cost was some 10.300 USD mobilized from UNDP Rapid Response Facility.

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Over time we have gathered contact data of some 15.000+ business entities. We use the newsletter facility to notify them about different opportunities that the UNDP CO project provides. Although we don't have an imminent next phase experiment design, this large database of business contacts is a good platform for future exploration. Besides the digital pulse module, the system provides full CMS and events management functionalities, which could make this portal a central online convening space for MSMEs interested in digitalization, but also other sustainable business topics.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The digital solution developed has a twofold scaling potential: 1. To become a leading digital economy portal - supporting business development support organisations to publish and manage digital transformation opportunities for MSMEs, and, 2. It Can easily be set up and adapted to any country's context and even to other topics (e.g. circular economy, decarbonisation etc.). We are currently talking with the emerging Circular Economy portfolio to devise a similar assessment for the companies.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The full report on MSMEs' digital skills gaps and needs was developed by the UNDP DigitalBIZ project. The team is now focusing on crafts and artisans niche, the entiry learning is the ownership of the project.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Discovering options to motivate businesses to "measure their digital pulse". 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Anyone in the UNDP country office who needs information from the business community to support the design of programmatic measures for the advancement of the digital economy.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The Digital Pulse solution has three significant impacts on the people outside UNDP: 1. Raising awareness among the MSMEs in Bosnia and Herzegovina about the importance of digitalisation for businesses by introducing, through the questionnaire, different digitalisation options and providing tips and explanations of less known digital concepts.  2. Helping companies assess their digital maturity and provide essential recommendations on being more digitally efficient. The tool is data-driven since the way it evaluates the company and formulates recommendations entirely depends on the answers provided by the users. Assessing the digital maturity level with this tool gives the company:  a) a neutral assessment of its current situation, b) helps define areas where competition is ahead, and c) discover future digitalisation ambitions based on weaknesses and development potential identified while using the tool.  3. Providing business intelligence to our institutional partners on central issues, impediments, and needs of the companies, etc., by providing specific reports and summary analysis and providing a view into individual responses provided by the companies.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

- Partner with UNDP BiH Accelerator Lab team to gain more info; it can be used for other assessments areas as well - Adapt the digital solution developed by UNDP BiH for online surveying and reporting  - Conduct outreach with the business community to ensure there is a wide range of participation - Have companies take the survey (offer incentives) - Analyze the data, identify the main issues, impediments and needs of the companies in the assessment areas  - Follow up with individual companies and SMEs to implement suggested solutions - Support institutional partners in developing policy options 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Digital pulse is a survey platform that can be utilized for any research - if we aim to mimic a structured interview process. The biggest challenge would be to develop a survey. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

We explored dozens of similar solutions in different European countries. The Luxembourg Chamber of Trade survey was good, but the digital solution to deliver the survey was inadequate (poorly developed) and proprietory. We developed
