Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT.  One key challenge is that the predominantly Bengali tourists coming to the Chittagong Hill Tracts region often do not explore and understand the local and ethnic culture of the indigenous minorities residing in the CHT. Tourists are also often not respectful of the local culture, customs, which can create friction with the indigenous people. To address this issue, initiatives need to be taken to identify, prioritize and promote local and ethnic culture among the ethnic majority Bengali tourists. One solution could be provision of training to the tourists to make sure they aware of the local customs and respectful of the traditions of the places they are visiting.
