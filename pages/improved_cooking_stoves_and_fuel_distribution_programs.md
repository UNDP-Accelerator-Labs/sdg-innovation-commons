> Type of the Solution

Technology &amp; Management Approach (improved stoves), Infrastructure &amp; Distribution (fuel access)

> Affected Sector

Health

> Description of the solution

This solution promotes the transition from traditional cooking stoves (often burning biomass like firewood or charcoal) to improved cooking stoves and cleaner fuels. Improved cooking stoves offer several benefits: Increased efficiency, reducing fuel consumption and associated emissions; Reduced smoke and harmful pollutants released during cooking, improving indoor air quality and health; and Potential for using cleaner burning fuels like biogas or ethanol.
Effective programs often combine stove distribution with: Fuel availability: Ensuring access to cleaner fuels for the new stoves; Education and behavior change: Encouraging proper use and maintenance of the new stoves; and Financing mechanisms: Making improved stoves affordable for low-income households.

> Socio-economic effects

Improved health outcomes from reduced indoor air pollution
Reduced fuel consumption and associated costs
Potential for job creation in stove production and fuel distribution
Empowerment of women who are often primarily responsible for cooking

> Type of Measure

- 1. active measures (direct measures for reduction of air pollution)

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- other

> Timescale of implementation

- long-term (5 and above)

> Other Notes

partnerships. Multi-Stakeholder Approach (NGOs, Governments, Private Sector, Communities) lead the solution. Primarily targeting developing countries with large populations relying on traditional cooking methods. The affected sectors are: Energy, Health, Environment. 
The effectiveness of cooking stove replacement programs depends on a holistic approach that addresses stove quality, fuel availability, user education, and affordability. Successful programs consider the specific needs and contexts of the target communities.
