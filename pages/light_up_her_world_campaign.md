Reusable towels are eco-friendly and are free from toxins, chemicals or synthetic dyes found in disposable pads, which cause harm to the environment and the health. 
Reusable towels also reduce waste.

> Technical Feasibility

The reusable pad is developed with three different types of fabrics, forming three different layers of the product, such as 100 percent cotton sheets, which is used as a top layer attached to the skin, which acts as an absorbing fluid and creates comfort to the wearer, polywadding (non-woven) fabric is used at the middle layer, which is mainly used for absorbent purposes, easily washable, and retains cotton fabric shapes from deformation, and water-repellent fabric is used as the lower layer, which acts as a resistant for the blood to prevent from seepage.
