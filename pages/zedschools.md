> Brief description of the innovation

Zedschools is a school application found at www.zedschools.com that solves huge problem in the education sector by providing student jobs, teacher funds using simple but never-seen-before models. Zedschools focuses on 5 entities namely parents, students, teachers, schools and companies and tries to generate income and opportunities among these solving common issues like monetary issues, student behaviour, food, accomodation and access to school. We solved it all.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income will be generated from service fees and subscriptions on many services offered. Extra revenue will come from parents, teachers, students and schools already in the school system and from entities outside the school system looking to engage the aforementioned through digital advertising and marketing like ads. This online school platform goes as far as connecting a company to a student for structured opportunities like short term jobs. From crowd funding models never seen before to generate student pocket cash to delivering education to poor people through RAR files and radio. The money will be used to kickstart our movement and the doors open to facilitate it. Our model is self sustaining after capital injection and we intend to open a teaching radio service, pay for faster hosting plans, office space and team expansion.

> Technical Feasibility

We designed it on web using technologies html, css, javascript, php, python, mysql. It sits on a VPS and the data is stored on dropbox increasing its security. The plan is to spread the word and conduct as many functions as possible to get sign ups. A well equipped competent team has to be in place to respond to queries. Advertising modes like billboards and fliers will also be considered. Android and iOS version of the application will also be built.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The social impact is huge because our application will not only provide teachers with extra income but students too reducing the stress on parents. Companies will get more engagement with their products and services dealing directly with students as they are a huge part of the population and hence their target market. We have solved various problems in the school system.
