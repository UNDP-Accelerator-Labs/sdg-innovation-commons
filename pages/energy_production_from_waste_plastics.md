In search of local initiative, the team met an ambitious young man named Harouna who produces fuel and gas from plastic waste. From a device comprising two gas cylinders connected to each other and a barrel by a coupling, it produces fuel and gas after heating the plastic waste contained in the barrel to a high degree. Its objective is to eventually produce electricity from plastic waste.
