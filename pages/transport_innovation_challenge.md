Transport Innovation Challenge
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that vehicular traffic congestion and traveler safety result in significant loss of time, productivity and general quality of life in urban centers of Trinidad, despite plans from the Ministry of Works and Transport and the Ministry of Planning and Development to resolve these perennial issues through better planning and use of data. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



 Over the past few decades, vehicular traffic congestion has become a critical issue in Trinidad, especially in urban centers like Port of Spain and Chaguanas. The problem began to intensify in the late 1990s as economic growth spurred increased car ownership and urban sprawl. The growth of residential areas further away from commercial centers has led to greater reliance on personal vehicles for commuting. Public transport, historically underdeveloped, has failed to keep pace with the expanding urban population, contributing to a steady rise in private vehicle use. Discussion for the implementation of a mass transport system in Trinidad and Tobago stalled due to government disunity. 

Causes of the Challenge

Several factors contribute to the traffic congestion problem in Trinidad:

1. High Car Ownership Rates: The increasing affordability of cars, coupled with limited alternatives for public transportation, has led to a rapid rise in private vehicle ownership. Inadequate public transit options, particularly outside of major hubs, compel people to rely on cars for daily commutes.

2. Inadequate Public Transportation System: Public transportation services such as buses and maxi-taxis are inefficient and poorly maintained, making them unattractive to commuters. This has led to greater reliance on private vehicles, increasing traffic volume on the roadways.

3. Urban Sprawl: The expansion of residential areas into the outskirts of major cities has created longer commuting distances, with few alternative routes. Additionally, poorly planned urban development without corresponding infrastructure upgrades has compounded the problem.

4. Limited Road Infrastructure: The current road network is not designed to handle the growing volume of vehicles. Bottlenecks occur frequently on major highways and intersections, and road maintenance is inconsistent, leading to frequent breakdowns and accidents.

5. Cultural Preference for Cars: There is a societal preference for driving as a status symbol and a perception that public transport is unreliable or unsafe, further incentivizing private car use.

The situation is exacerbated by poor infrastructure in need of repair and a propensity for flooding in urban centers, such as Port of Spain, Barataria, Macoya and St. Augustine, along the most populous area, known as the East-West Corridor. 

Another important element is road safety. In 2023, Trinidad and Tobago recorded 116 road fatalities, an increase from 101 in 2022, representing a 14.9% rise in road deaths over one year (Trinidad and Tobago Police Service, TTPS). Approximately 45% of road deaths in Trinidad and Tobago involve pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, with speeding being the leading cause of accidents (Ministry of Works and Transport, 2023). According to the Road Safety Unit, 48% of road fatalities in Trinidad and Tobago are linked to alcohol consumption, highlighting the ongoing issue of drunk driving (Arrive Alive, 2023). The country has implemented over 300 speed cameras since 2020, resulting in a 20% reduction in speeding-related fatalities (Trinidad and Tobago Police Service, 2023). Road traffic accidents cost Trinidad and Tobago's economy an estimated TT$ 1.2 billion annually in healthcare, property damage, and lost productivity (Inter-American Development Bank, 2022). These statistics reflect the growing concern about road safety and efforts to reduce fatalities on Trinidad and Tobago’s roads. There have also been high profile cases of kidnappings and murders associated with unregulated transport via unregistered taxis. 

Public transportation, particularly the use of buses and maxi-taxis, presents significant safety challenges. Overcrowding, unregulated routes, and driver misconduct increase the likelihood of accidents and create unsafe environments for passengers. According to a 2021 report by the Ministry of National Security, incidents of robbery and sexual assault have been reported on maxi-taxis, particularly during late-night operations. High-profile cases of kidnapping and rape have further exacerbated public fear, including the tragic case of Ashanti Riley in 2020, who was abducted and murdered after boarding a private hire (PH) taxi (Guardian, 2021).

Nevertheless, despite these efforts, traffic and road-related safety in Trinidad continues to be a major challenge.

In 2023, Trinidad and Tobago recorded 116 road fatalities, a 14.9% increase from the 101 deaths in 2022 (Trinidad and Tobago Police Service, TTPS). Approximately 45% of these deaths involve vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, with speeding identified as the leading cause of accidents (Ministry of Works and Transport, 2023). Additionally, 48% of road fatalities are linked to alcohol consumption, reflecting the ongoing issue of drunk driving (Arrive Alive, 2023). The country has responded by installing over 300 speed cameras since 2020, leading to a 20% reduction in speeding-related fatalities (Trinidad and Tobago Police Service, 2023). Despite these efforts, road traffic accidents cost the economy an estimated TT$1.2 billion annually in healthcare, property damage, and lost productivity (Inter-American Development Bank, 2022). Traffic congestion is also a pressing issue in Trinidad and Tobago, with many citizens reporting severe delays during rush hour, especially in urban areas like Port of Spain and San Fernando. Public frustration is growing, particularly along the East-West Corridor, where major highways are often clogged during peak hours. The lack of efficient public transportation forces a heavy reliance on private vehicles, worsening the traffic situation. Business owners have expressed concerns about how traffic impacts productivity, with frequent delays in deliveries and employees arriving late to work. The increasing frequency of minor accidents, although non-fatal, further exacerbates traffic issues by causing additional delays. Taxi drivers complain about reduced income as prolonged travel times limit the number of trips they can make in a day. Additionally, roadworks and construction projects, such as highway expansions, often cause temporary road closures that worsen congestion. Policymakers are concerned about the influx of new vehicles each year, as the current infrastructure struggles to support the growing number of cars. Commuters traveling between northern and southern regions cite the lack of alternative routes, with many relying solely on the same congested highways. Environmental groups have raised alarms about air pollution caused by the prolonged idling of vehicles, which negatively affects air quality, particularly in heavily trafficked areas like the city center.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The UNDP Trinidad and Tobago Accelerator Lab brings a unique value proposition to addressing traffic management challenges, an area where the organization has not traditionally been involved. Despite this, poor traffic conditions have significant implications for public health, contributing to issues such as increased crime and delinquency, environmental degradation, particularly in terms of air quality and noise pollution. The Accelerator Lab's participation in a global challenge with the UNDP Chief Digital Office and the Government of Singapore demonstrates its ability to apply innovative, data-driven approaches to this issue. Unlike other actors, particularly within Trinidad and Tobago, where traffic management through mass transportation systems has been heavily politicized, the Accelerator Lab, as a non-political entity, is well-positioned to lead this initiative objectively. Furthermore, the Lab’s proposal to utilize existing data and advanced traffic management techniques, rather than relying on costly mass transit systems, offers a more pragmatic and resource-efficient solution, making it a valuable investment for addressing this critical challenge.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



How can data analytics be used to improve traffic and transport management in the borough of Arima, the designated "smart city" of Trinidad and Tobago?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We propose to use existing data sets from the Ministry of Works and Transport and satellite data to facilitate experimentation and policy work for addressing traffic challenges in Arima, which would be used as a pilot town for this reconceptualization of traffic management.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



The issue here is not so much the lack of data but the inaccessibility and the under-use of data. Government has data but it has not been used for a geospatial reworking of traffic management and transport planning with a view to a smart city. The volume of geospatial data and its use for central government traffic management are not fully known for the Trinidad and Tobago case.  
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



The Government of Singapore has pledged USD50K for the initial phase of this project which involves data collection, analysis of data and the use of the latter to develop a management plan. Depending on the reception and impact of this phase, UNDP can approach the government for a second phase which may involve further digitization of Arima, the integration of public data or the replication of the project in another part of Trinidad and Tobago.
