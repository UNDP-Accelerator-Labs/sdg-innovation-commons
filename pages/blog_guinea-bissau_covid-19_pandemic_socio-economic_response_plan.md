Guinea-Bissau COVID-19 Pandemic Socio-economic Response Plan
JANUARY 12, 2022
This Socio-economic Response Plan (SERP) was developed within the context of the overall UN COVID-19 “recovery pathway” framework and follows the UN system‘s initial analysis and programmatic activities since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020. Since then, the United Nations organizations, funds, and programmes working in Guinea-Bissau have conducted numerous thematic assessments and surveys to measure the pandemic‘s impact on the people, institutions, businesses, and the environment.
