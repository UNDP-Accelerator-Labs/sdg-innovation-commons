> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My business will generate income through trading with other business owners such as Marketeers , household based customers, restaurant owners etc. With the challenge prize I will be able to expand my business by purchasing a water pump and build a chicken coop, it will help with the transportation of my good and services to and from the customers. I will partner with the potential consumers and customers so they can have reliable, consistent, stable and cost friendly supply of my goods and services through out the year. I will also create jobs for local residents of ng'ombe area of Luanshya by employing hands on hard working individuals so that they can support their families, earn a good income and get a chance at a better life.

> Technical Feasibility

The main objective of this business is to expand and grow into one of the best agricultural businesses in Zambia by supplying fresh Vegetables and animal products. In the long run I want to expand and have cattle, chickens and fish ponds on the farm that way I will not only help my family but the surrounding families in the area as well.

> Anticipated Social Impact

As I have spent enough time in ng'ombe area of Luanshya, I have noticed that a lot of men and women are unemployed as a result they resort to abusing alcohol, engaging in immoral activities and etc I plan on improving their lives by creating job opportunities on the farm. Most people in the area have skills that can in handy on the farm such as bricklayers, fishermen, farmers and Marketeers. All these individuals lack is an opportunity to put their skills to good use and I believe that even as an upcoming business I can begin to help them and their families to improve their lives.
