I do agricultural business. I grow and sell maize, and vegetables etc. I plan to start growing rice in order to relieve Our beloved country, Zambia from the critical dependence of mealie meal.

> Brief description of the innovation

I grow crops of maize and sell them, I also grow vegetables for sell. I plan to venture into rice production. With this I feel like Our beloved country Zambia will be relieved from the dependence on maize and will venture into other alternatives which in this case is rice. Zambia has as well faced a very critical time in terms of maize mea the past year. Therefore rice can be a very good alternative in place of rice. 
It is known that maize is one of the Zambian exportable product so if we venture in rice as well as producing maize. It will be exported therefore increasing the GNP while rice is being used for local businesses or GDP.
