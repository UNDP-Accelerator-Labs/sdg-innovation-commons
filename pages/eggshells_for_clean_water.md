"H2O Lerma, water for all" is a project of a collective of scientists that seeks to contribute to the improvement of water quality and the reduction of heavy metals in the Lerma River. They carry out efforts of citizen collection of eggshells in schools, events and social networks of eggs. Later, they carry out the design and implementation of filters for heavy metals in the Lerma river. The project was created by Ivonne Linares Hernández, Elia Alejandra Teutli Sequeira, Guadalupe Vázquez Mejía, Guadalupe Fonseca Montes de Oca, Rosa María Fuentes Rivas and Verónica Martínez Miranda, professors and researchers at the Inter-American Institute of Technologies and Water Sciences and CONACyT, and it is developed in collaboration with residents of the city of Lerma.
