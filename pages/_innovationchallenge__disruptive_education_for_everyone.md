This solution was mapped thanks to the third edition of the challenge "Innovating together for children and sustainable development", which aimed to boost solutions that had an impact on clean and affordable energy or solid and liquid waste management. Solutions to the most pressing global problems require creative innovators and critical thinkers. Access to quality STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education is linked to poverty reduction, economic growth and more resilient democracies; these disciplines play a critical role in addressing many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, communities in Guatemala often lack the resources to provide adequate education at the primary and secondary school level. Enciéndete takes a novel approach that provides a framework that addresses this disparity, empowering students to understand the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the development of technological solutions to community or health problems; problems that they can relate to or experience directly.
