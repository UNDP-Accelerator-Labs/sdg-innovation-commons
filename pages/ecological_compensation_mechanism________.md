Mechanism aiming to use economic leverage to mobilize the incentives of local governments at all levels to tackle pollution. Based on the year-on-year changes in ambient air quality in each county and district, implementing assessment rewards and penalties and ecological compensation.

The improvement of ambient air quality in municipalities is assessed on a quarterly basis centred on PM2.5, and the amount of eco-compensation funds received by each municipality is determined accordingly. Municipalities with deteriorating air quality are required to pay eco-compensation funds to the provincial level to compensate municipalities with improving air quality.
