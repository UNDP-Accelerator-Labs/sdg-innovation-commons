## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Sustainable Urban Portfolio: Promoting Citizen Engagement and Participatory Planning
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that with the increase of urbanization and regeneration in Saudi Arabia, how can the Saudi Accelerator Lab support in creating a better urban environment and transition for citizens?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Saudi Arabia is currently going through major fast-paced changes in the urban context of cities. This stemmed from the Kingdom's vision to increase the number of population in cities and improve opportunities. There are several mega projects taking place across the Kingdom which includes a vision of increasing the capital Riyadh's residents "from 7.5 million residents today to around 15-20 million residents in 2030." https://english.alarabiya.net/News/gulf/2021/01/28/Vision-2030-Saudi-Arabia-s-Riyadh-will-be-one-of-largest-city-economies-Crown-Prince With this growth comes great shifts in the social context of cities. How will citizens transition into these changes? What could be the potential areas that need to be improved in terms of quality of life and their sense of belonging?

Riyadh has seen its population grow at an annual rate of more than 8%. Its population has almost doubled since 2000, and the Saudi government estimates that the city’s population will double again from the current 7.5 million to 15 million people by 2030, making it one of the world’s fastest growing cities and the largest agglomeration in the Gulf region. In line with the rapid population growth, Riyadh’s spatial footprint grew from 64 km2 in 1970 to more than 1,900 km2 currently.

The Riyadh Strategy 2030 is aimed to transform the capital city into one of the world’s top ten city economies, doubling its population to 15–20 million people, while increasing the number of visitors to more than 40 million by 2030.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

The signals may not be considered weak as the number of mega projects and urban changes taking place are evident. What may be considered as weak signals is how the relevant communities are taking on these changes and how it may effect the social structure and sense of belonging.

One of the main changes is the introduction of the Metro system: "One of the main reasons that makes placemaking critical is the on-going development of sophisticated public transportation projects, especially in Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam. Metro-based systems, such as those being developed, require a complete environment that intensively capitalizes on walkability and quality of place to increase their ridership in order to be economically feasible, and this simply means adopting placemaking concept. The most important areas for placemaking are around metro stations as well as bus terminals; this implies enhancing a considerable portion of public spaces in Saudi cities." Urban Planning Trends and Challenges in the Pursuit of Saudi Vision 2030 - King Salman Center for Local Governance (ksclg.org)

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Most of the work the CO is currently doing is high-level governmental projects with more of a top-down approach. The Accelerator Lab's added value is promoting more bottom-up approaches, engaging with the community and supporting in more participatory planning.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The UNDP Saudi Accelerator Lab are exploring ways to promote more inclusive and sustainable citizen engagement within the urban transformation in Riyadh.

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

UNDP have a long history of working with the RCRC, they are currently preparing a new project document with the entity that focuses on Urban Indicators and promotion of women empowerment in the workforce. As an AccLab, we have been invited to share ideas with RCRC on other areas of potential collaboration such as Smart Mobility as the metro system has still not been launched in Saudi Arabia and as an AccLab, we can support in research and experimentation on the user journey and how to be more inclusive. Another area could include promoting placemaking and tactile urbanism.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How to encourage and promote more efficient, inclusive and sustainable citizen engagement towards new urban changes?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We hope to explore the user journey when it comes to using public transportation (metro) understanding who are the users, what is their experience, how can we support in engaging them to better their quality of life.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is a gap in proper community/citizen engagement when it comes to designing urban interventions as usually the dynamic is very top-down approach. We hope that through our engagement we could promote better community engagement and citizen knowledge. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are thinking of focusing on one city in Saudi Arabia with relevant partners. Once positive outcomes arise from our proposed areas of exploration and interventions, this might allow us to scale up to other potential partners such as the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and different different commissions and municipalities in other cities.
