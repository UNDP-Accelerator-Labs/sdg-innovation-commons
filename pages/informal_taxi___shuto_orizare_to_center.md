The public transportation fail to provide reliable service to the marginalized communities in the greater area of Skopje. The local settlement of Shuto Orizari is populated mainly by Roma, and the public busses do not go until the last stop; they usually stop at the beginning on the street. This is a challenging walk, especially for the people living the northern parts of the settelment
