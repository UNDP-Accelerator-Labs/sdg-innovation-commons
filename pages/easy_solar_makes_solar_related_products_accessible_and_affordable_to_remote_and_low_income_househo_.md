> Qualitative Results of the Innovation

1. Helped reduce reliance on kerosene lamps and diesel generators, which contribute to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. According to a report by the Global Off-Grid Lighting Association (GOGLA), Easy Solar has sold over 50,000 solar home systems, which have reduced CO2 emissions by 42,000 tons, and improved the lives of over 250,000 people.
2. Easy Solar has also contributed to reducing deforestation in border areas. In Sierra Leone, cooking with wood or charcoal is the primary source of energy for many households, leading to deforestation and soil degradation. Easy Solar's solar-powered cookstoves offer an alternative that is both cleaner and more sustainable. According to a study conducted by Impact Energies, the use of Easy Solar's clean cookstoves has resulted in a reduction of 2.5 tons of CO2 emissions per household per year and saved 300 trees per household per year.
