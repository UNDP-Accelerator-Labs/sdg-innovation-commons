Center of Excellence for Renewable Energy Technology

> Brief description of the innovation

In Zambia, solar PV off-grid systems provide more than 7.5% access to modern energy services across the country with the government of Zambia planning to supplier about 500,000 solar PV off-grid systems in order to increase access to energy in rural areas to 51% by 2030. With solar off-grid systems being seen as a key solution for rural development through increased access to modern energy services. Hence, quality assurance and repair of off-grid systems and/or components including local production of solar modules and solar home systems (SHS) has the potential to play a pivotal role in the transformation of the sector. The major challenges in solar sector in Zambia include:  Lack of quality assurance due to lack of equipment and skills for testing SHS, Lack of skilled workforce with appropriate technical skill, and Lack of local production due to lack of local know-how of solar photovoltaic module and solar home system assemble which leads to dependent on imported expensive, unreliable and unrepairable components. This project aim at; Increasing access to modern energy services, Solar product quality monitoring and assurance, reduce solid wastes on the environment, local capacity building and know-how, and local production and technology transfer.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The business will offer three services;
1) Test Lab: Quality testing of solar PV components before reaching the market for quality assurance: 
2) Training: Practical training programmes (workshops and short courses) on solar off-grid systems (design, installation, repair and maintenance)
3) Local Production: Solar PV Module assembling plant for local production of the solar PV modules and SHSs: 
Benefits:
      -Consumer’s right protection 
      -Environmental Protection 
      - Capacity Building
      - Improved system lifespan &amp; quality 
      - Local Know-How
      - Affordable Technology
      - Revenue generation by government (VAT)
Target Segment: Rural &amp; Urban
Solar Product Distributors and Suppliers, Individuals, Companies, Organization and Government. 
Local production will lead to reduction in the price of solar products in the country hence promoting use of solar products by existing and future business leading to improving their daily operations even in the event of load management. With reduction in the price of solar products and increased access to these products, it is expected that the business will grow faster due to local demand for affordable solar product and access to energy. This business will help increase value for the end-user and benefit the environment by delaying the disposal of components with repairable faults before their lifespan.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Solar PV off-grid systems serve to be  useful solutions in the face of expensive and fast depleting energy services coupled with climate change and increase access to modern and affordable energy services for rural and remote areas far from the grid in sub-Saharan African countries like Zambia. However, just like all other energy producing systems, solar PV off-grid systems are also prone to damages. These damages maybe due to natural aging of the system components or  due to external factors such as weather reasons in most cases storm hail, lightning and over voltage, including fire, excessive heat or an animal bite and make it not operate properly or reduce its performance and lifespan. However, their faulty components are easy to recognize as they leads to reduced energy yields and less energy production from the installed solar PV off-grid systems. Fortunately, solar PV off-grid system component quality testing for quality assurances and solar PV off-grid system/component repairs and maintenance services including local production can help in resolution of most common problems that affect these systems, provided they are performed in time by skilled personnels.  
Thus, prior component tests for quality assurance before the components are brought to market will ensure that the solar system components sold to the off-grid users (consumers) are of good quality and comply with the local and international standards.. In addition, repairing the commonly occurring solar PV off-grid system and /or component problems can alleviate the concerns of disposal (limit amount of disposal of solid wastes to the environment) and replacement which leads to addition investment cost in the forms of new PV components. This will provide long-term positive benefits to the environment by delaying and limiting the amount of solid waste disposal plus help to extend solar PV off-grid systems and/or the components lifespan. In addition, the project will also benefit the communities, industry as well as companies in solar off-grid sector through increased skilled workforce with practical know-how including system and /or component lifespan extension through project services. The project will also not only benefit the society but the regional solar off-grid sector especially in rural areas through increased number of qualified work force to offer repairs and maintenance services. Local production of solar PV modules and SHS will lead to reduced prices for solar products which will help to increase access to affordable and clean technology in the country.
