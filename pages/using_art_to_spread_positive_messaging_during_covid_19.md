The AccLab, in collaboration with the communications department, supported the global UNDP Call to Creatives by running a call in South Africa. The call was to artists to submit works that captured the key messages of UNDP regarding Covid-19 prevention and response. Over 70 art works were received, and a panel of evaluators selected the most relevant and moving pieces. The artists of these works were profiled on social media and other platforms, and their works have since been used in other UNDP knowledge products such as the Annual Report and project calls. In addition, UNDP partnered with the South Africa Creative Industries Incubator to produce a song called “Kindness Contagion” which included musicians across Africa collaborating around this key UNDP message. The music video was launched in a virtual session including many of these artists and other stakeholders from across the continent.
