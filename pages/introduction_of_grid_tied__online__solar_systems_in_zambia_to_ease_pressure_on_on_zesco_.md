> Title of the innovation

Introduction of grid tied (online) solar systems in zambia to ease pressure on on ZESCO.

> Brief description of the innovation

This innovation aims at reducing the power deficit in zambia by introducing solar system which are able to deposit power in the national grid and use that power at a later time such as at night or when there is cloud cover.a battery bank may be used or not be used in this innovation.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This will ease the pressure zesco has been facing concerning low water levels in our dambs.this innovation will also support green energy being promoted hence reduction in usage of ozone depleting energy sources like generator sets.

> Technical Feasibility

This technology exists in developed countries but a feasibility study on how best it can be implement in zambia is to be done.the designs and implementation methodology is something we have.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It would change the way people look at solar energy.our strategy would be renting to own once we are given a go ahead to realize this business.our company would do the installation and the customer would rent to own that installation provided we find project sponsors.
