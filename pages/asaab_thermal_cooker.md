> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Given the lack or scarcity of cooking fuels (wood, coal or gas) in the far north region of Cameroon, and the lack of autonomy among women, because women can no longer go about other occupations because they are constantly preparing. The problem of deforestation which is a direct impact on climate change. ASAAB which is an ultimate solution, is a non-electrical device with a cylindrical shape made from a fabric and several thermal insulators. It allows you to simmer good dishes of all kinds. To use the ASAAB cooker, a pot is first preheated normally to a fireplace (a stove, stove, wood or charcoal fireplace,..) to bring an initial cooking temperature for up to 10 minutes. At this stage, the pan or pot is removed from the fireplace and placed in the cooker where, due to insulation, the container remains close to the temperature at which it was removed from the fireplace for a period of time. The same goes for cold drinks.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- IP protected

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

After economic analysis, our ASAAB cooker is sold between 15000 FCFA and 25000 FCFA or between 23 £ and 39 £ about 33 US$ and 56 US$. On the other hand, the price of other thermal cookers already marketed is about 90 US$ and more or more than 40,500 FCFA.

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

TRL 7

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

 About 100 samples sold out. Customer feedback is positive so far, as it permits women to multitask while cooking and has not risk of food or pot getting burnt.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

We know that a household gas cylinder costs 6,500FCFA. For a family of 4 to 5 people who use a gas cylinder per month, this amounts to 78,000 FCFA per year, or 780,000 FCFA for 10 years. With the faithful use of our ASAAB cooker, the family will end up with about a bottle for two months, due to the fact that it is used for cooking pot fire that is to say no frying just cooking done with water. The service life of asaab is about 10 years because of its insulating material. So the family will spend a bottle for two months will give 39,000 FCFA or 390,000 FCFA for 10 years with a saving of 195,000 FCFA. -Reduce evaporation compared to conventional cooking methods, which prevents food from burning or drying -Frees up time for women for other income-generating activities -Reduce deforestation and fight climate change -Allows cooking using less energy and does not pollute during its use -Significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

Lack of funding for further product expansion
