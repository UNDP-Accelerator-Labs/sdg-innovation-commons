> Title of the innovation

Electricity generation without fuel

> Brief description of the innovation

My inventions are to bring about the generation of electricity without the use of petro and deseals as all cars will run on electricity once my inventions are in factory stage soon coz all i need i funding to build a prototype

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Climate change is the number one enermy and most contributor of most deaths and deases due to carbon emiting exaust gases, Hence my project will swiftly eliminate the use of petro and deseals as all cars will run on electricity once my inventions are in factory stage soon coz all i need i funding to build a prototype.

> Technical Feasibility

Climate change is the number one enermy and most contributor of most deaths and deases due to carbon emiting exaust gases, Hence my project will swiftly eliminate the use of petro and deseals as all cars will run on electricity once my inventions are in factory stage soon coz all i need i funding to build a prototype.
