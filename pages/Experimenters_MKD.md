[[ai_summary:Here is a summary of the interview transcript in exactly 5 sentences or fewer:

Lazar Popiwanov, Head of Experimentation at UNDP's Accelerator Lab team in North Macedonia, discussed an R&D activity aimed at familiarizing the public with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through innovative ideas. The activity used crowdsourcing to collect articles from interested participants, which were then published and led to a public debate on SDG-related issues. Lazar emphasized the importance of diverse stakeholder perspectives, including civil society organizations, media representatives, and academia, in shaping the publication and its outcomes. The R&D activity led to two main takeaways: the development of an SDG Academy for university students and increased policy maker engagement with UNDP's country office on SDGs-related issues. The results demonstrated that crowdsourcing and public debate can be effective tools for amplifying innovative ideas and informing policy decisions.]]

# "Accelerating SDGs in North Macedonia: A Crowdsourced Approach"

### [[0:00]] Tell me your name, your title and say I approve of this message\. No, I got sent to this recording\.

All right\. So my name is Lazaro Popiwanov\. I come from the UNDP country office in North Macedonia\. I'm a part of the Accelerator lab team and my role of my role is head of experimentation\. And I approve this message\. Yeah, I can send to this recording\.

### [[0:22]] OK, Over to you for the first question on R&D activity\. So, Lazar, hi, your first question is, can you tell me tell us about R&D activity you would like to share, how did it come about, where did it start?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
Thank you very much\. So the research and development activity that I would like to talk about is how we used crowdsourcing as a method to obtain new ideas from the general public about how we can accelerate the Sustainable Development Goals in North Macedonia\. And how we try to act as an interlocutor in our country for academics, media, journalists, civil society enthusiasts and other young researchers to amplify their ideas\. But before going into details about the activity itself, allow me to give a little bit of context\. So I come from North Macedonia, which has been a new candidate country from 2005 onwards, and the EU agenda has been a very dominant, prominent agenda in the country, which has left space for the Sustainable Development Goals to be a part of the public discourse\. But we also believe that we can do a little bit more to articulate the Sustainable Development Goals in the general public\. In addition to that, we did two scoping studies, one in 2021 looking into what are the perceptions and awareness in the private sector about this SDGS\. And we quickly learned that a lot of the companies don't know a lot about the sustainable development Goals and even sometimes when they work on particular goals, goals they're not aware of them\. The second very small scoping study that we did was with the law faculty in scoping the capital of the country where we interviewed 58 students that were master degree students and we expected that they will have heard or know about the SD GS\. But that was not the responses that we get with more than half of the students never been never heard about the SD GS in the 1st place\. So with these ideas in mind and kind of informing our thinking and in addition to that, the accelerator lab team in our country participated in the creation of the SDG integrated reports in 2023\. So we decided once we have the momentum now with the SDG Insights report, but also knowing that this scoping studies, the results were not very favorable, but about the familiarization of the SDGS to the public, we asked ourselves, can we do research activities or research and development activities organized around familiarizing the public with the SDGS through bringing new innovative ideas into the public discourse that don't come from UNDP but come from the general public? In addition to that, we wanted to experiment a little bit with the method that we would use to to do so and with teaming up with different people in our society\. So this were the questions that informed this particular RND activity\.

### [[3:14]] And what was the development issue you were trying to address?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
So the development issues that we tried to address through the through this research and development activity was can we demystify the goals for the people in our country? Can we bridge that gap between what the SDGS are, what UNDP is doing, and what everyday researchers or everyday activists in CS OS or members in the media can do to contribute to this endeavor? And in that sense, we were led by this idea that innovative ideas and innovative solutions can come from all walks of life\. So we decided to to open a call for ideas to solicit ideas from the general public while having subscribed to two general principles\. The outlet in which we wanted to gather these ideas were articles\. So pretty much not academic text, but between an academic text and A and A blog post\. So we asked for two things in this articles\. One, for the article to offer a good diagnostics of one of the SDGS or several of the SDGS, so to kind of offer a situational analysis of what's happening in that space\. And then secondly, we really wanted every article to have an innovative component of how the authors believe that they can help overcome the barriers that are currently that we're currently facing as a community towards towards that particular SDG\. We wanted this first part, the diagnostics part, so that we can see if we can bring new data and new insights not only to the country office, but also to the public discourse\. And we also really like the innovative segment so that we see if we're missing out some innovative ideas in the public or that people might have that we can do as UNDP potentially with them, but also for them to be a part of the public discourse so that anyone can can approach and and pursue them\.

### [[5:05]] OK, And who was involved in your journey? What was their role? How did you ensure diverse stakeholder perspectives?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:How might we]]
[[principles:Inclusivity]]
A very good question\. So in in this particular endeavor, we were very happy that from the design stage, we teamed up with one of the Tink tanks in our country, one of the civil society organizations, it's called the Institute for Human Rights, and we work with them on how to design the open call for articles\. What type of articles are we going to look for? But also design the criteria that will ensure that we have a fair representation of ethnicities, gender and ideas in the actual publication that we wanted to be the final outcome of this process\. So we work with them in a very Co creative manner as in a way the ACT labs do, the accelerators labs do\. So we were working with them from the beginning of the of the conceptualization idea until the very advocacy efforts that we pursued\. We also in this process, I think it's fair to say that we teamed up with all the authors that made it to the final cut of the publication\. And we are talking about 14 articles, but 25 authors that made the final cut of the of the publication\. So of course, Needless to say, we collaborated with all the teams in our UNDP country office and also other UN agencies that really helped us promote the open call and reach the groups that we wouldn't have necessarily reached by ourselves\.

### [[6:36]] And the next question is about tools and methods\. So what tools and methods did you use to do what you described and why?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:How might we]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
So the most obvious tool that we used was crowdsourcing\. And this tool, we really liked it because not only it helps us reach different audiences, but it also helped us hear ideas that as UNDP in the country office, we wouldn't have necessarily heard or got in touch with\. So in this process, we received over 60 applications from interested participants\. In the process\. We chose, as I said, 14 articles to make the final publication and we had a range of ideas represented there, from issues on how health on on health issues to energy communities, to how we can make our cities more sustainable to issues like how is climate action failing in our country? Or why don't we have more SD GS into the curriculum of public universities in our country\. So crowdsourcing is definitely one of the tools that we used\. We also wanted to not just create a publication and promote it and you know, finish the the process\. We also wanted a follow up of sorts, a public debate or public engagement\. So we pursued that\. We organized a three hour long in depth public discussion in which we invited not only the authors of the publication, but relevant stakeholders throughout our society to participate\. Talk about the ideas in the publication, but also talk a bit more general about what we can do as actors in our system to to contribute more towards the Sustainable Development Goals\. And in this process, in the public debate, a couple of stakeholders I would like to note, we invited the Dean of the law faculty in the city of Skopia to participate in the debate\. We invited representatives from civil society organizations that work on European integration, but also human rights and other areas that we believe have complementarities with the SD GS\. We invited a journalist, a very well known journalist in our country that covers environmental issues, to talk about some of the obstacles journalists face when they try to write more about the SD GS and we write it\. And we invited representative from one of our Chamber of Commerce's who talked about how companies try to embed SD GS and other types of reporting about environment and social standards into their company practices\. So I would say one method is definitely crowdsourcing, but also in depth debate and the publication itself are some of the methods that we use\.

### [[9:11]] Great\. And your last question, how did you engage policy makers, private sector communities, actors to catalyze? So what was the outcome of your journey?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Accessibility of knowledge]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
Oh, OK\. So as I mentioned during this discussion, we ensured that we will invite a lot of different stakeholders\. And one of the activities we did right after the discussion is we tried to create main takeaways\. And I'll just mention two as the outcomes of this R&D activity\. One of the main takeaways was actually coming from the Dean of the law faculty, who stated that the curricula in their university doesn't really reflect the SDG agenda\. So we sat down after the event with him and his team of university professors and our team at UNDP and the accelerator labs, and we tried to see how can we overcome this challenge and how can we get the SDG content closer to university students at our at our at our faculty\. So we decided that we will create and design an SDG Academy that will take place in the autumn of this year at the Faculty of Law Co, chaired by the Faculty of Law and the Accelerator Lab and UNDP in the country office, in which we will have a thematic focus on issues related to the environment and climate action\. But we will offer a more in depth research knowledge, insights about the SDG agenda to the students of the Faculty of Law\. And then they will get get to do an R&D activity of their own as a sort of a smaller research projects that their students can play with\. And then in addition to that, a second outcome I would say is how this process, this RND activity influenced our country office\. So based on the insights and innovations that we received in the publication, I would just like to mention two examples\. One was one of the articles was about innovative development financing methods and our for instance, democratic governance unit in the country office really works in that space\. So they went into direct communication with the authors of that paper and tried to learn a little bit more if they're missing some of the approaches that the author was recommending as innovative solutions to financing development challenges\. And then the second one was there was this absolutely great article about gender equality in our country and land ownership and how much land women own in our country That really informed we have a gender specialist, but also a broader gender team in the country office that really informed some some of the decisions we made as a gender team in the country office and how we went about pursuing certain activities\. So in a nutshell, I think when it comes to scale, we have this diffusion with an external stakeholder, with the law faculty just to illustrate one example and then internally about how this R&D activity influenced the NDP country office\.

### [[11:53]] Great, already\.
