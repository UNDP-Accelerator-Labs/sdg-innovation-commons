THE LIGHTUP HAT

> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

In the electrification campaign of the city of conakry, the government has installed electricity poles which, according to residents, do not meet the need for light. To overcome this problem, they have found it better to install bulbs of more than 100Watts covered from above by a slice of a 20 liter container but of yellow color.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

this solution is to satisfy the need for large lighting coverage and by the same way protect the bulb against the rain.

> INSIGHTS: What lessons can be learned from this observation?

Installing electricity poles is good but the Electricity company should take in consideration the circonconference of the lighting coverage, the poles top may be changed with transparent plastic like this the one in the picture. This will contribute recycled the water containers wich will certainely be produced by using the millions of thrown plastics.
