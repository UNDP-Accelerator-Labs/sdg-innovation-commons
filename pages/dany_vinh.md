## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To test if a local digital learning platform can improve students' learning outcome in Math, Physics and Chemistry.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If students use Tesdopi as their digital learning complementary tool, they will improve their score in Math, Physics and Chemistry.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

RCT

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Students from grad 10 in two public schools

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Baseline and Enline survey with students, and In-depth interviews with students, teachers and school principles.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

~9months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes except the improvement on Math score.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

About a year

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

~$27,000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, with the Edemy.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, by the Edemy. Now they're going to apply for the Digital X fund for their scaling.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

There were internet access interruption at one of the public schools, which affected the students learning. The school is located near preservation area (near Bakong temple) and to fix this there need to be long processes of request to relevant Ministries done by the school principle.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Students and teachers got confused about the learning app usage. We were able to address this quickly with the support of our implementing partner. There were also locked down and we had to delay our data collection.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport and UNICEF that are working closely in this area.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes especially more work needs to be done on Math. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Ensure that the internet connection is good.
