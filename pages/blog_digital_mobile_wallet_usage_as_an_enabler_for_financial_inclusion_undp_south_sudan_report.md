EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Digital Financial inclusion is an important aspect of economic development, alleviating poverty

and supporting growth. It entails ensuring that individuals and businesses have access to usable

and cheap financial products and services that fulfill their needs—transactions, payments,

savings, credit, and insurance—provided in a responsible and sustainable manner. In many

developing nations, including South Sudan, a sizable proportion of the population is unbanked or

underbanked, limiting their capacity to fully participate in the economy. Digital tools, notably

mobile money services, have emerged as effective drivers and enablers of financial inclusion.

Within the framework of the financial inclusion Rave organized by the UNDP Accelerator Lab

network at global level, Zambia, Cameroon, and South Sudan Country office Accelerator Labs

have partnered to generate knowledge for a comparative study on the usage of mobile wallets

within these three Countries. The R&D Raves, as per the UNDP Accelerator Lab global network,

are a way to turn knowledge into action that advances the Sustainable Development Goals

(SDGs). The R&D Raves intend to serve as learning spaces where we work with partners to

surface knowledge about a specific system, or theme, and explore ways to create momentum

toward change. The exercise to do a desk review and data collection for analysis comes after a

Rave on financial inclusion held in Nairobi from the 4th to the 7th of June 2024 organized by the

global Accelerator Lab team with participants from 23 other Country Accelerator Labs, Private

sector partners, representatives from the UNDP Kenya office, Donors from Japan and key

solution holders operating within related financial inclusion spaces.

DEFINITIONS

Digital Wallets

Digital Wallet: A digital wallet refers to an electronic device or online service that allows an

individual to make electronic transactions or payments. Digital wallets store financial data and can

make transactions quick and simple. They remove the need to carry around physical cards or

money, should one choose to take this path. A digital or e-wallet is a payment tool, usually in the

form of an app that facilitates purchases using a smartphone, smartwatch, or other digital device.

Digital Mobile Wallets

3

Digital Mobile Wallet: The Republic of Uganda Financial Inclusion Strategy 2023 – 2028 defines

it as financial services offered by payment service providers that allow a person to use a mobile

phone to deposit, withdraw, save, borrow, and transfer money, pay bills, and potentially access

other financial services; examples: mGURUSH mobile money, MTN Mobile money (MoMo). A

mobile wallet stores credit or debit card information on a mobile device, such as a smartphone,

tablet, or smartwatch. Mobile wallets are a convenient way for you to buy things online or in stores

that are set up to take payments through the wallet. They may also be more secure than physical

payment cards because of the technology they use to protect your account information.

Financial Inclusion: The World Bank (2014) defines financial inclusion as “the proportion of

individuals and firms that use financial services”. The ADBI (2016) defines financial inclusion as

“the degree of access of households and firms, and small and medium-sized enterprises, to

reasonably priced financial services.

CHAPTER 1. BACKGROUND, OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

Background,

The launch of South Sudan’s first mobile money transfer services in 2019 – mGurush and

Nilepay, both in partnership with Zain – was a key milestone in the country’s journey to financial

inclusion. South Sudan gained independence in 2011 but has continued to suffer from instability,

economic stagnation, conflict, and poverty. A revitalized peace agreement signed in 2018 paved

the way for some social and economic progress.

The introduction of mobile money in South Sudan has allowed development organizations to

distribute cash assistance through mobile money channels. Humanitarian organizations have

gradually substituted in-kind donations for cash disbursements, as preferred by beneficiaries.

However, providing cash assistance through mobile money requires access to mobile phones,

connectivity, and digital literacy among affected communities. Additional care and consideration

are necessary for marginalized groups, such as women and those with disabilities, who are less

likely to be digitally included. Using mobile money to distribute cash transfers has also been more

effective and cost-efficient: moving large amounts of cash through high-risk areas in South Sudan

often required security services, costing up to 30% of the transfer value. Mobile money has

improved payment confidentiality too, ensuring the safety of beneficiaries. In the far rural areas

4

where there is no access to banking facilities, digital mobile money wallets have served that

purpose, providing money safety and source of income.

Financial inclusion in South Sudan is low. In 2017, less than 10% of the adult population held an

account (at a bank, financial institution, or through mobile money – Figure 1). Mobile money

adoption can help drive financial inclusion, enabling easier and faster financial transactions,

reducing the risk of theft, and providing access to savings. This in turn contributes to resilience in

a country where external shocks, such as conflict or natural disasters, are common.

The Bank of South Sudan first introduced regulations governing and supporting mobile money in

2017. However, in 2021, two years after the introduction of mobile money, less than 6% of the

adult population held an account. While this trend was mostly driven by lower financial institution

account access, mobile money account penetration in South Sudan was less than one per cent

in 2021. Conversely, mobile account usage in sub-Saharan Africa had risen to 33% at the same

time.

In South Sudan, people are more likely to have a mobile money account if they are better

educated, live in the city, are male, and are wealthy (Figure 2). Financial inclusion policy should

aim to narrow these gaps to improve the impact of mobile money on socio-economic outcomes.

Mobile money adoption and financial inclusion have faced significant structural challenges in

South Sudan. Inadequate telecommunication infrastructure contributing to patchy network

coverage and has restricted mobile money use, especially in rural areas. Limited access to

electricity and low mobile phone penetration also affected mobile money uptake. The long

distances between residents and mobile money agents have proved challenging too. In 2019,

around 83% of rural inhabitants had to walk at least 30 minutes to reach an agent; this was the

case for only 40% of urban dwellers. To overcome this, the country’s first local telecom operator,

Digitel, launched in 2021, is working to improve mobile network infrastructure in remote areas.

Socioeconomic barriers have limited mobile money uptake. Persistent underdevelopment and low

purchasing power are a constraint, as is a lack of identification documents (ID). In 2019, only 41%

of the population had the required ID to access mobile money subscriptions.

There are more than two million internally displaced people in South Sudan due to ongoing inter-

communal conflicts, insecurity, and flooding. Displacement-affected populations in South Sudan

use mobile wallets to send and receive money from friends and family or to buy airtime. However,

5

mobile phone penetration among displaced communities is hindered by high costs, limited access

to phone charging spaces, low digital literacy among the population.

Economic and health risks presented by COVID-19 have exacerbated the situation. South

Sudan’s currency depreciated by 97% between September 2019 and October 2022. To overcome

this volatility, mGurush also offers USD mobile money accounts to its customers. The company

supports P2P transfers, mobile-to-bank transactions, outward international remittances, bill

payments, as well as cash-ins and cash-outs at agents in both South Sudanese pounds and US

dollars.

MGurush also halved transaction costs in 2022 to 4% relative to their inception, supporting

affordable access to their services. Such adaptation is necessary to support mobile money’s

growth while the economy stabilises but may not be enough on its own to achieve scale. MTN

recently began providing mobile money in South Sudan, which could further improve access to

financial services by offering customers additional choice. More competition in the industry should

lead to better quality services and more affordable prices, driving scale.

While there remain substantial obstacles in the way to digital financial inclusion in South Sudan,

it is important to note that mobile money has the potential to play a key role in this journey.

OBJECTIVES

The key objectives of this exercise were to;

• Understanding the ecosystem and factors influencing uptake and adoption of

digital mobile wallets in South Sudan.

• Understanding how digital mobile wallets is putting money into the pockets of the

most in need and the left behind communities.

• Understanding consumer preferences on digital mobile wallet usage, and how

partners can utilize these trends to better support communities served.

METHODOLOGY

This exercise aims to acquire relevant data through a holistic approach to data collection.

Generate new and unknown data, contribute towards knowledge and learning in a

6

comparative study at global, and leverage citizen science and collective Intelligence to

influence systems to learn from one another and create positive outlook to DMW.

Therefore, two methods have been selected for this research: (1) Survey interviews and

(2) Desk review:

Survey Research is a quantitative research method used for collecting data from a set of

respondents. It has been perhaps one of the most used methodologies in the industry for

several years due to the multiple benefits and advantages that it has when collecting and

analyzing data.

Desk research, also known as secondary research or library research, is a method of

gathering information and insights by analyzing and synthesizing existing data and

sources rather than conducting primary data collection through fieldwork or surveys.

CHAPTER 2. DESK REVIEW FINDINGS

Percentage population with access to phones in South Sudan

"As reported by the World Bank in 2019, Over 45 percent of the population owns a phone

in South Sudan, but this varies across locations. While 63 percent of urban residents and

64 percent of PoC site residents own a phone, only 38 percent of rural residents do".

"According to the International Telecommunication Unit (ITU 2018), research estimates

indicate that only 12-20 percent of the South Sudan population have access to mobile

communication. Media Landscape survey in the Accessible Areas in South Sudan in

2015, indicates there is a low mobile use and Internet penetration rate, but it warns that

some South Sudanese in far flung areas own mobile phones and use them intermittently.

The survey also indicates that many families in South Sudan share mobile phones,

meaning that more people maybe using mobile phones even though they don’t own one.

There were 2.61 million mobile connections in South Sudan in January 2021. The number

of mobile connections in South Sudan increased by 385 thousand (+17%) between

7

January 2020 and January 2021. The number of mobile connections in South Sudan in

January 2021 was equivalent to 23.1% of the total population.

Percentage population that has digital mobile wallets accounts

The Bank of South Sudan first introduced regulations governing and supporting mobile

money in 2017. However, in 2021, two years after the introduction of mobile money, less

than 6% of the adult population held an account. While this trend was mostly driven by

lower financial institution account access, mobile money account penetration in South

Sudan was less than one per cent in 2021.Mobile money adoption and financial inclusion

have

faced significant structural challenges

in South Sudan.

Inadequate

telecommunication infrastructure contributing to patchy network coverage has restricted

mobile money use, especially in rural areas. Limited access to electricity and low mobile

phone penetration also affected mobile money uptake. The long distances between

residents and mobile money agents have proved challenging too. In 2019, around 83%

of rural inhabitants had to walk at least 30 minutes to reach an agent; this was the case

for only 40% of urban dwellers. To overcome this, the country’s first local telecom

operator, Digitel, launched in 2021, is working to improve mobile network infrastructure in

remote areas. "A research entitled “The Digital Worlds of Displacement-Affected

Communities”, working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees

(UNHCR) and The Research People to understand how IDPs and the local host

community use and engage with mobile phones was conducted. South Sudan has one

of the lowest rates of mobile access and connectivity in the world. Conflict has had a

significant impact on mobile network operators (MNOs) in South Sudan, resulting in major

infrastructure losses.

Mobile network coverage across South Sudan

According to the South Sudan Environmental and Social Management Framework

(ESMF) of 2023, it is reported that Mobile networks in South Sudan are limited to major

towns (about 20 percent of the country), cutting out the population of remote areas. Mobile

8

coverage was much higher before the conflict, but the ensuing war led to the switch of

telecom masts. The World Bank estimates that mobile cellular subscriptions in South

Sudan have dropped from 22 percent in 2016 to only 12 percent in 2017. At only 12

percent, also the Internet penetration rate of South Sudan remains low compared to other

countries in the eastern Africa region. Although there has been seemingly a growth in the

popularity of Internet services in the country, the continued conflict and low investments

in telecommunication infrastructure have affected their expansion. Open-source data

indicate that 2.2 million of the country’s population are connected to the Internet,

accounting for only 17 percent of the country’s population estimated at 12.5 million. Urban

Areas: Major cities and towns generally have good coverage from multiple network

providers, while rural areas: Coverage is more sporadic, with many areas still lacking

reliable mobile services.

Percentage population of those with mobile phones with wallets

The Global System for Mobile Communications reported that there was only 0.8% of

people with mobile wallets in South Sudan as of 2021. This entails that there has been

lower Mobile Wallet Penetration in South Sudan. Despite the potential benefits, mobile

wallet adoption has faced hurdles due to factors such as limited infrastructure, low

financial literacy, and security concerns. Despite the low mobile wallet penetration, there

is a growing trend of mobile wallet usage, particularly in urban areas and among younger

demographics. Therefore, it's clear that a significant portion of the South Sudanese

population with mobile phones do not yet have mobile wallets, although the number of

users is increasing."

Regulations in place for mobile wallet services in South Sudan

Electronic Money Regulation (2017): This comprehensive regulation outlines the

framework for electronic money services, including licensing, capital requirements,

consumer protection, and anti-money laundering measures. National Payment System

9

(NPS) Bill: While still in draft, this bill aims to provide a broader regulatory framework for

payment systems in South Sudan, including mobile wallets.

Key Provisions of the Electronic Money Regulation include:

• Licensing: Mobile money service providers must obtain a license from the BoSS.

• Capital Requirements: Providers must meet specific capital requirements to

ensure financial stability.

• Customer Protection: Regulations protect consumers through measures like fraud

prevention, dispute resolution, and data privacy.

• Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT):

Strict AML/CFT measures are enforced to prevent financial crimes.

•

Interoperability: The regulation encourages interoperability between different

mobile money services to promote competition and consumer choice.

The unusual suspects in the digital mobile space (will help identify positive

How mobile wallets are used to improve financial inclusion for small informal

businesses and promote the economic growth of in the country.

Mobile wallets have emerged as powerful tools for driving financial inclusion and

economic growth in developing countries, including South Sudan. Here's how they can

benefit small informal businesses:

• Partnerships between humanitarian organizations and MNOs could facilitate cash

assistance through mobile money to enhance financial inclusion. This could be

done alongside digital literacy training. When digital finance is unencumbered,

people are empowered. The move to introduce mobile money payments is a

strategy to bring the benefits of electronic payments to the people of South Sudan

as well. Having greater digital capabilities through trainings, information provision

and knowing which activities to formally engage themselves in will improve

financial inclusion for small informal business

• Access to Financial Services: Mobile wallets provide a convenient and accessible

way for small informal businesses to manage their finances. They can send and

receive payments, check balances, and access other financial services without

the need for a traditional bank account.

• Reduced Costs: Traditional banking can be expensive and inaccessible for small

businesses. Mobile wallets offer lower transaction fees, making financial

management more affordable.

• Risk Mitigation: Carrying large amounts of cash can be risky. Mobile wallets

reduce the risk of theft and loss.

• Credit and Insurance: Mobile wallets can serve as a platform for accessing

microloans and insurance products, helping businesses to grow and manage

risks.

12

•

Increased Economic Activity: By facilitating easier and more secure transactions,

mobile wallets can stimulate economic activity and trade.

• Formalization of the Economy: As more businesses adopt mobile wallets, they are

more likely to integrate into the formal economy, leading to increased tax revenue

and better economic data.

• Job Creation: The growth of the mobile money ecosystem is creating jobs in

various sectors, such as agent networks, mobile financial services providers, and

related businesses.

• Financial Resilience: Mobile wallets can help businesses build financial resilience

by providing access to savings and insurance products.

• Agriculture: Farmers can use mobile wallets to receive payments for their produce,

access agricultural inputs, and manage their finances.

• Retail: Small retailers can use mobile wallets to accept payments, manage

inventory, and access credit.

• Transportation: Transport operators can use mobile wallets to collect fares,

manage expenses, and access financial services."

While mobile wallets hold immense potential to promote inclusion in South Sudan, the

extent of their impact is still evolving and largely dependent on various factors.

Extent to which digital mobile wallets are promoting inclusion e.g. between

genders or urban and rural users or youth and adults.

Our desk review information indicates that women were less confident in using a mobile

phones or using the mobile internet. Building digital capabilities, with a focus on women

and youths, can help to start reducing the gender gap and it will mean more woman

involvement in the digital money technology space.

Humanitarian actors could begin considering how to integrate elements of digital

capability training into their interactions with beneficiaries. Urban populations are using

mobile wallets more compared to rural populations this has been attributed to distance

13

one needs to cover to find a mobile money agent, lack of network services and low

charging points with electricity for phones in the rural areas.

Majority of people with mobile money wallets are men found in urban setting and are

literate. Low literacy and digital literacy: Both functional and digital literacy were significant

barriers to mobile use, and these were emphasized as particular barriers for those in the

camp, older people, and people with disabilities. For example, 21% of IDPs who did not

own a mobile phone said that not knowing how to use one was a key barrier. Gender

Inclusion with mobile wallets can provide women with greater financial autonomy,

enabling them to participate more actively in the economy. They can facilitate access to

savings, loans, and insurance, which can be crucial for women-owned businesses.

Gender disparities in digital literacy, access to mobile phones, and societal norms can

hinder women's adoption of mobile wallets.

Mobile wallets can potentially bridge the social gap between urban and rural areas by

providing financial services to rural underserved populations. Infrastructural Challenges

such as limited network coverage and infrastructure in rural areas can pose obstacles to

mobile wallet adoption and usage. Mobile wallets can empower youths by providing them

with financial tools and opportunities. They can facilitate youth entrepreneurship and job

creation, majority of youths have access to internet and social media.

Government promotion of digital mobile wallets

The South Sudan government has shown increasing interest in promoting digital mobile

wallets as a tool for financial inclusion and economic development. Below is a general

overview of the government's role:

• Recognizing the Potential: The government has acknowledged the potential of

mobile wallets to drive financial inclusion and economic growth.

• Policy Framework: Efforts have been made to create a conducive regulatory

environment for mobile money services to thrive. This includes issuing licenses to

mobile network operators and other financial institutions to provide mobile money

services.

14

• Financial Inclusion Strategies: The government has incorporated mobile wallets

into its financial inclusion strategies, aiming to expand access to financial services

for the unbanked population.

• Public Awareness Campaigns: While the scale might vary, there have been

attempts to educate the public about the benefits of mobile wallets and how to use

them.

• Partnerships: The government has collaborated with development partners and

international organizations to promote mobile wallet adoption and usage."

How future technological advancements shape the evolution of digital mobile

wallets in South Sudan

Future technological advancements have the potential to revolutionize digital mobile

wallets in South Sudan, driving greater financial inclusion and economic growth. Below

are some key areas:

• Enhanced Security and Privacy

Biometric Authentication: Advanced biometric technologies like facial recognition,

fingerprint, and iris scanning can strengthen security measures.

Blockchain Integration: This can enhance transparency, security, and trust in mobile

wallet transactions.

Data Privacy: Strong data protection measures will be crucial to safeguard user

information.

•

Improved Accessibility and User Experience

AI and Machine Learning: These technologies can personalize user experiences, offer

tailored financial advice, and detect fraud.

Interoperability: Increased interoperability between different mobile wallet platforms will

expand user choices and facilitate seamless transactions.

15

Financial Literacy Tools: Integration of financial education modules can empower users

to make informed financial decisions.

• Expansion of Financial Services

Embedded Finance: Mobile wallets can evolve into platforms offering a wider range of

financial services, such as insurance, loans, and investments.

Digital Currencies: Adoption of digital currencies could revolutionize cross-border

transactions and financial inclusion.

Supply Chain Financing: Mobile wallets can facilitate supply chain financing, benefiting

businesses and farmers.

•

Infrastructure Development

5G and Beyond: Faster internet speeds will enable smoother mobile wallet transactions

and support innovative applications.

Financial Infrastructure: Improvements in payment systems and financial infrastructure

will enhance the efficiency of mobile wallets.

• Addressing Rural Challenges

Agent Networks: Expansion of agent networks in rural areas will improve access to mobile

wallet services.

Offline Capabilities: Developing offline transaction capabilities can ensure uninterrupted

services in areas with limited network coverage.

Solar-Powered Devices: Providing solar-powered devices can address electricity

challenges and support mobile wallet usage.

By embracing these technological advancements, South Sudan can create a more

inclusive, efficient, and resilient financial ecosystem. However, it is essential to consider

the digital divide and ensure that these innovations benefit all segments of the

population."

16

Financial services and products digital mobile service providers give their users

access to

• A variety of informal value transfer services exist in South Sudan for sending and

receiving money domestically. These are based on moving funds through a third-

party agent network. The sender gives cash to an agent, who provides him/her

with a transfer code. This code is then used by the recipient to retrieve the money

from an agent in another geographic location.

• Regional and international transactions are conducted through formal value-

transfer services. While there is anecdotal evidence of IVTSs having branches

outside of South Sudan, and supporting regional transactions, most IVTSs only

conduct domestic transactions. International transfers are instead supported by

formal value-transfer services such as Dahabshiil, which has branches in Juba,

Wau, Aweil and Bor. While IVTSs conduct transactions in the local currency,

transactions with Dahabshiil are conducted in US Dollar (both to send and

receive), even though the fees can be paid in SSP. Again, an ID is required for the

sender. Fees vary depending on the origin and destination of the transfer but are

higher than those of domestic transfers conducted by IVTS. For example, the fee

for a transfer between Juba and Nairobi is 3 percent, but increases to 7 percent

for a transfer between Wau and Khartoum Core Services

• Person-to-Person (P2P) Transfers: This is the most common service, allowing

users to send and receive money to and from other mobile wallets.

• Cash-in and Cash-out: Users can deposit and withdraw cash through a network

of agents.

• Airtime Purchase: Users can top up their own or other people's mobile airtime.

• Bill Payments: Utilities like electricity, water, and TV subscriptions can often be

paid through mobile wallets.

• Mobile Banking: Some providers offer basic banking services like account

balances and transaction history.

• Remittances: Sending and receiving money from abroad is a crucial service for

many South Sudanese.

17

• Micro-Insurance: Basic insurance products like life, health, or property insurance

can be accessed through mobile wallets.

• Micro-Loans: Some providers offer small loans to individuals and businesses.

• Savings Accounts: These allow users to save money digitally."

How Digital Mobile Wallets Catalyze Access to Other Financial Services in South

Sudan

• Building Financial Trust

Trust Establishment: By providing reliable and convenient P2P transactions, mobile

wallets build trust between users and financial institutions.

Risk Mitigation: Successful mobile wallet usage reduces perceived risks associated with

formal financial services.

• Creating a Financial Footprint

Transaction Data: Every transaction on a mobile wallet generates data that can be used

to assess creditworthiness.

Credit Scoring: This data can be leveraged by financial institutions to offer tailored credit

products.

• Expanding Financial Services

Agent Networks: The extensive agent network for mobile wallets can serve as a

distribution channel for other financial products like insurance and savings.

Platform Expansion: Mobile wallet providers can introduce additional financial services,

such as micro-loans and investments.

• Facilitating Financial Literacy

Education Integration: Mobile wallets can be used as a platform to deliver financial

education, empowering users to make informed decisions.

18

Financial Product Awareness: Exposure to various financial services through mobile

wallets can stimulate interest and demand.

•

Improving Financial Inclusion

Reaching the Unbanked: By providing access to essential financial services, mobile

wallets bring millions of unbanked people into the formal financial system.

Empowering Women: Mobile wallets can empower women by providing them with

financial independence and control over their finances.

Therefore, digital mobile wallets serve as a steppingstone to a more inclusive and robust

financial ecosystem in South Sudan. By building trust, creating a financial footprint, and

expanding service offerings, they lay the groundwork for a broader range of financial

products and services to become accessible to the population.

CHAPTER 3. SURVEY FINDINGS

The report gives the findings of a Survey conducted on Mobile Money Usage in South

Sudan from 29th July 2024 to 9th August 2024. The survey started with a desk review of

relevant literature which involved a thorough review and analysis of existing literature,

national strategies, government publications, and international studies relevant to

financial inclusion in South Sudan. Primary data was collected among South Sudanese

participants using a google form, the form was deployed on social media platforms such

as LinkedIn, WhatsApp platforms and Facebook groups and Data was analyzed using

google dashboard.

Demographics

A total of 46 respondents from South Sudan participated in the online survey, this is lower

than our target population of 100 respondents in two weeks, most of whom are from the

urban areas.

19

Gender: The gender indication shows 35(76%) of the survey contributors are Male which

is a good target market for Digital Mobile Wallets based on the market size and only less

than 11(23.9%) of contributors are Female. 11(23.9%) were female and 35(23.9%) were

male this entails that less women participated in the survey.

Recommendation on Gender:

The survey shows that more men participated, indicating that more males utilize Mobile

Digital Wallets therefore, more efforts is needed in encouraging the females to settle

inequality in accessing the digital. More activities should target alleviating digital literacy

among women.

Gender

35

Male

Female

Age: The majority of survey participants ages range between 36-45 years old which is a

good target market for DMW based on the group size. This is not surprising because the

youths are more tech savvy. Some studies by communications regulator Ofcom indicated

that youths along that age group gets attracted more to digital technology and have the

best understanding of it.

Employment status: The question about the Employment Status of participants shows

that more than half are employed which can be a good target market for Digital Mobile

Wallets as it directly involved with economic activities, the next group is Entrepreneurs,

then Unemployed people and finally students. This also correlates to the findings that

20

more males were employed compared to the women and similarly that more men are

having jobs and, in the desk, review it was observed that most people who hold mobile

wallets are those in employment.

As the chart shows, the largest group of participants based on their employment status

are employed people which again shows how Mobile DMW are acceptable within this

group but this doesn’t conclude that usage and uptake of this innovation is not being taken

up among the unemployed, or those in the informality etc., this is simply because the tool

used for this survey kind of limited the participation to these categories.

Education: Majority of the respondents were educated with most holding degree level

education. The desk review as well showed that the more educated one is the more likely

it is to have digital mobile wallets. This can explain why fewer women have mobile money

wallets compared to the men this also corresponds to their education level. The gender

imbalance in the access to education could be the reason for the low female participation

and low access to digital mobile wallet.

Recommendation on Education:

21

Correlation between education and technology is something inevitable and based on

this chart again highly educated people with university degrees are the best market to

choose for developing the Mobile Digital Wallets market.

Network coverage: Majority of the respondents for this survey agreed having access to

mobile networks, which is a good sign and shows that most of the society have enough

devices that are on standby for DMW enrollment. The desk review findings of the South

Sudan the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) of 2023, reported

that mobile networks in South Sudan were only limited to major towns (about 20% of the

country), cutting out the population in remote areas. This entails that South Sudan is the

least in network coverage which can relate to why South Sudan among the three UNDP

country offices had the lowest number of respondents in the survey. The desk review

indicated that there are more than two million internally displaced people in South Sudan

due to ongoing inter-communal conflicts, insecurity, and flooding. The South Sudanese

population use mobile wallets to send and receive money from friends and family both

from within and the diaspora. However, mobile phone penetration among displaced

communities is hindered by high costs, limited access to charging, low literacy, and low

digital literacy. To ensure financial inclusion of displaced people, organizations or

individuals have developed innovative agent network models. These networks represent

a collective of individuals, organizations, and entities that can collaborate to foster

innovative ideas, products, and services on mobile digital wallets that are tailored to rural

communities’ only. Overcoming challenges like infrastructure and security and improved

financial literacy programs with the displaced people by entities that have effectively

integrated financial education with mobile money services. According to WFP REPORT,

June 2024, the humanitarian situation in South Sudan was marked by conflicts, food

insecurity, disease outbreaks, and impact of the Sudan crisis and the risk of imminent

floods, threatening to deepen the already severe situation of vulnerable people. Torrential

rains caused floods and affected people in parts of the country. In Tonj North County in

Warrap State, an estimated 6,000 people were reportedly affected by floods, with some

crops destroyed. In Juba County, Central Equatoria State, heavy rains caused flash

22

floods in Luri payam and Juba Block, affecting over 1,000 people. The Desk Review

showed that the introduction of mobile money in South Sudan has allowed development

organizations to distribute cash assistance through mobile channels. Humanitarian

organizations have gradually substituted in-kind donations for cash disbursements, as

preferred by beneficiaries. However, providing cash assistance through mobile money

requires access to mobile phones, connectivity, and digital literacy among affected

communities. Additional care and consideration are necessary for marginalized groups,

such as women and those with disabilities, who are less likely to be digitally included.

Using mobile money to distribute cash transfers has also been more effective and cost-

efficient: moving large amounts of cash through high-risk areas in South Sudan often

required security services, costing up to 30% of the transfer value. Mobile money has

improved payment confidentiality too, ensuring the money safety of beneficiaries.

Recommendation on Mobile Network Coverage:

According to the previous question about residency areas and the large number of people

in urban areas, this means they have access to mobile networks because telecom service

providers provide wider mobile network coverage for these areas, and it is obvious that

more network access means more potential to encourage mobile network users to use

digital payments & wallets/services.

Mobile phone ownership: Almost all repondents agreed to own a phone, which is a

good sign and shows that most of the society have Smart mobile devices that are ready

to join Digital Mobile Wallets.

Internet usage: According to the survey findings, internet access and reliability is still an

issue in the country, it also revealed that although great percentage respondents had

access to internet, cost and reliability are the key challenges. The desk review revealed

that access to mobile network and internet in the South Sudan is largely found in urban

communities compared to rural areas, this was because of lack of infrastructure in rural

areas, and lack of services such as electricity in the rural areas. The study findings above

show that majority of the respondents from South Sudan came from urban areas having

23

a representation of 65%, rural area had a representation of 13.0% and peri urban had a

representation of 19.5%, which can explain why majority from the urban area had access

to the data collection form.

Recommendation on Internet Usage:

According to the infrastructure requirements for Digital Services nowadays, internet

comes first and as a result, more internet usage means more potential to expand Mobile

Digital Wallets market. Therefore, making internet tariffs more pocket friend has potential

to attract more users even in the furthest areas.

Digital Mobile Wallet Usage: Approximately 4 out of 5 South Sudanese use Digital

mobile money that is a good sign and show how wide it is expanded. 38 agreed to have

digital mobile wallet services and 8 did not have. South Sudan had a low number of

respondents with usage of digital mobile wallets at only 38. The findings from the survey

are in alignment with the desk review information that indicated that, in 2021, two years

after the introduction of mobile money, less than 6% of the adult population held a mobile

account in South Sudan. The survey also revealed that more 66% men had mobile digital

mobile wallets compared to women.

CHAPTER 4. SIGNALS, LESSONS, AND CONCLUSION

Mobile wallet usage in South Sudan is a topic of growing interest and significance, as it

has the potential to improve financial inclusion and access to digital financial services in

the country. However, several challenges affect the penetration and utilization of mobile

wallets. In this report, we explore the signals, pain points and lessons, related to mobile

wallet usage in South Sudan, focusing on the impact of poor infrastructure, low financial

literacy, and security concerns, as well as the opportunities presented by regulatory

frameworks,

financial

inclusion,

and

innovation.

One of the primary challenges hindering the widespread adoption of mobile wallets in

South Sudan is poor infrastructure. The lack of reliable electricity, internet connectivity,

and mobile network coverage in many areas of the country makes it difficult for individuals

to access and use mobile wallet services. Without a stable infrastructure, users may

encounter difficulties in making transactions, accessing their accounts, and utilizing other

25

features of mobile wallets. This limitation highlights the need for investments in

infrastructure development to support the growth of digital financial services in South

Sudan.

Another key factor contributing to the low penetration of mobile wallets in South Sudan is

low financial literacy among the population. Many individuals are unfamiliar with the

concept of mobile wallets and how to use them effectively for financial transactions. This

lack of knowledge and understanding may lead to mistrust and reluctance to adopt mobile

wallet services, particularly among older demographics and rural communities. To

address this issue, efforts should be made to promote financial education and awareness

campaigns that highlight the benefits and functions of mobile wallets, thereby increasing

their usage and acceptance among a broader segment of

the population.

Security concerns also pose a significant barrier to the adoption of mobile wallets in South

Sudan. As digital financial services become more prevalent, the risk of fraud,

cyberattacks, and data breaches increases, leading to concerns about the safety and

security of personal and financial information stored on mobile wallet platforms.

Addressing these security challenges requires strong regulatory frameworks, robust

cybersecurity measures, and consumer protection policies to safeguard users' data and

transactions. By enhancing security protocols and building trust among users, mobile

wallet providers can mitigate risks and improve the overall user experience.

Furthermore, while key regulatory policies are in place to govern mobile wallet usage,

enforcement remains a challenge. Without proper monitoring and compliance

mechanisms, there is a risk of misuse and abuse of mobile wallet services, leading to

negative consequences for users and the overall market. Strengthening enforcement

efforts and enhancing cooperation between regulatory bodies and mobile wallet providers

are essential to ensure the security and integrity of the mobile wallet ecosystem in South

Sudan.

However, there are limitations in terms of data on mobile wallets in South Sudan due to

a lack of research and development in the field. Without accurate and up-to-date

information, it is difficult for policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions

26

and develop effective strategies to promote mobile wallet usage in the country. This

highlights the need for further research and collaboration among industry players to

address this gap and improve the understanding of mobile wallet trends in South Sudan.

Despite these challenges, there are signals of progress and positive trends in mobile

wallet usage in South Sudan. The growing trend of mobile wallet adoption, particularly

among urban areas and younger demographics, indicates an increasing interest and

acceptance of digital financial services in the country. This shift towards mobile wallet

usage presents opportunities for innovation, financial inclusion, and economic growth, as

more individuals gain access to convenient, affordable, and secure digital payment

solutions.

In conclusion, mobile wallet penetration in South Sudan is influenced by a combination of

factors, including poor infrastructure, low financial literacy, and security concerns. While

these challenges may impede the widespread adoption of mobile wallets, there are

opportunities for improvement through regulatory frameworks, financial education, and

technological innovation. By addressing these issues and harnessing the potential of

mobile wallets, South Sudan can enhance financial inclusion, promote economic

development, and empower individuals to access and utilize digital financial services

effectively. Both users and the broader economy.
