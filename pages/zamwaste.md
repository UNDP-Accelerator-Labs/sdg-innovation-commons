> Title of the innovation

Zamwaste

> Brief description of the innovation

A system to be used by waste collection companies to track:
1. Payments (cash, mobile money, cards)
2. Pickups

In phases 3 and beyond, the platform will build the backbone where other service providers can build out tools to their needs. This will be enabled by the fact that we are going to map virtually all households and businesses where waste collection is done. This mapping can be used as proof of residence for KYC purposes by banks, location verification by utility companies, census of households by Zamstats, location verification by food delivery services, etc.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We will make money by charging a commission (about 3% to 5%) for every payment transaction. The waste collection companies will improve their payment collections efficiency as we are going to automate payments. The waste collection companies will also be able to see what is due versus what is paid. Waste collection companies will also be able to use the system to sell other services/products such as bin liners, cleaning/fumigation services, landscaping services, etc.

The prize challenge will help us accelerate the software development process and sales and marketing activities.

> Technical Feasibility

The product will launch as a web-based SaaS application where any waste collection company can register and manage its operations. The product rollout plan is as follows:
Phase 1: payments tracking - Nov - Dec 2021
Phase 2: card and mobile money payment integration - Feb - Mar 2022
Phase 3 and beyond: Apr-Sep 2022
- mapping of waste generating units (households and businesses)
- introduce value-added services e.g. sorting waste as the point of collection,

> Anticipated Social Impact

Waste collection companies will improve their operations thereby improving the quality of service they provide to the communities. The mapping of households and businesses in our system will allow other players to easily plugin and build other products e.g. proof of residence as required by banks, location of a house as required by utility companies, delivery service providers, etc.
