## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Testing new ways to separate household plastic waste in Batumi and Tbilisi 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The challenge is that the household waste in Georgia is not separated. We want to test new approaches of waste separation in two major cities to nudge establishment of a robust waste separation system. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Two major Georgian cities – Tbilisi and Batumi – are already placing the infrastructures to begin household waste separation, following the Waste Management Code, National Strategy on Waste Management and Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). The pilot projects on waste separation conducted by various NGOs show promising results. Nonetheless these pilot projects fail to address the waste separation at the source, which is the gap that we want to fill in.   In general, very few households separate waste, but their experience remains unstudied, making it difficult to plan behavioral changes to motivate more citizens to follow the example. Furthermore, knowledge on recyclables among population is very low. Most of the people are not aware on how the specific waste can be separated and recycled. Although packaging producers' association and recyclers' association are quite active, they fail to establish user-friendly, accessible waste collection points. As the result, reusables end up in the landfills.

The topic of waste separation is quite popular in Georgia. The legislation is being improved in accordance with the EU association agreement. To support the implementation, there have been several efforts by various NGOs to test waste separation. Recently waste separation became also an increasingly interesting topic for private companies as both cost-saving and profit generating activity.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Through understanding of citizens’ behavior, we would like to influence households’ decision to separate waste and come up with the recommendations for the improvement of the waste separation system in Georgia. By doing so we will contribute to decrease pollution and support recycling industry as a way towards green economy. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

To support Georgia's transition towards #GreenEconomy, by using #behavioralscience to nudge households to separate waste, we wish to come up with a way to improve waste separation system in Georgia

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What is the relationship between infrastructure and behavior in the context of household waste separation? Why do some people separate while others don’t? What are the barriers to separation of the household waste? What is the knowledge level of population on waste separation practices? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The chosen methods will help us understand the barriers and perceptions towards separation of the household waste. By conducting the experiment, we will test our approach before recommending it to the stockholders. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is no data available on the subject.   
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The outcome will help Georgian municipalities, waste collection and recycling companies, as well as packaging producers to better understand peoples' behaviors related to the household waste management.
