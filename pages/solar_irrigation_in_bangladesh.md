> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

Solar based irrigation systems are innovative and environment friendly solution for the agro-based economy of Bangladesh. The program intends to provide irrigation facility to rural off-grid areas. Solar irrigation systems reduce dependency on fossil fuel and demand for electricity from national grid in irrigation seasons. The program also reduces carbon emission and at the same time saves millions in foreign currency. Moreover, the solar irrigation assists farmers by providing cheaper irrigation service compared to diesel-based pumps. Given the immense potential the program aims to install solar PV-based irrigation systems in areas where there are possibilities to produce three types of crops throughout the year, all the while staying safe from flooding, arsenic contamination and saline water. To work towards this end, IDCOL has now set a target of installing 10,000 solar irrigation pumps by 2027.

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

Up to March 2021,1,515 solar irrigation pumps are operational with an installed capacity of around 40 MWp.
