## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

&nbsp; + Flowers in the Air.&nbsp;After using "Flowers in the Air" storymaps in a training with over 400 prosecutors from the National Prosecutor Office, we highlight the following learnings: 1.1 Accelerator Lab´s, www.otrosmapas.org manages to capture the attention of its browsers above 87% of other websites. It is an educational and awareness tool with a lot of potential. 2.2 Regarding the emotions or learnings that were mobilized in the justice system officers after navigating the tool, the main one was empathy, followed by feelings of sadness and helplessness. We also identified differences by gender. Women prosecutors refer to their own feelings after navigation and men, instead, describe the situation. Male prosecutros make greater allusions to the application of punitive justice and women mention the need for prevention. 3.3 The most significant reaction in prosecutors was they rethought violence to recognize its structural dimensions and above all the essence of femicide that is, being murdered for the mere fact of being a woman. They recognized that no condition, neither social, nor economic nor origin, prevents you from being killed. &nbsp; + Brave Schools.&nbsp;This intervention took place in one school and reached 150 students and 26 teacher by using pedagogical methods to change behavior and perspective related to gender-based violence and discrimination.&nbsp;1.&nbsp;To generate a safe space to dialogue and reflect about gender-based violence and discrimination within schools is key to shed light on this issue. Once a week adolescents met with their peers and the facilitator to share their thoughts and reflections regarding gender rules and stereotypes based on the reading selected for that week. A similar practice took place among teachers to reflect on how their teaching practices might be biased by gender rules. The exercise of collective dialoguing and reflecting led to a change of perspective in students and teachers, in both cases gender social norms are analyzed with a critical spirit and challenged. 2.&nbsp;To make schools a safe space there was to be a zero tolerance violence policy co-created by the education community and implemented collectively. Violence cannot be identified, stopped, and mitigated, if it is seen as the responsibility of authorities only. Students, parents, and teachers play a key role to create a space that aims for no gender-based violence and no discrimination. Reading, reflecting and dialogue have proved to be a great mechanism to create such space and sustain it in the long run.&nbsp;

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

+ Flower in the air: Yes, in training prosecutors with Flowers in the Air tool, we learned that online training processes have limitations, if you do not have mentors who give individualized support and boost participation. Nevertheless, our intention was not to measure the Moodle training, but the Flowers in the Air tool. This was overcome by cleaning data (disregarding answers that showed no attentive navigation was done) and by triangulating results with focus groups to make sure the answers in the self-administered survey had validity. + Brave Schools. The biggest challenge was to create a work relationship with the school staff (authorities, teachers) and get them excited to be part of the intervention and to try out new teaching practices with a more equal gender approach. A second challenge was to engage the Ministry of Education staff at the territory level to co-led this intervention with us.&nbsp;

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

+ Flowers in the air: Prosecutors training with Flowers in the Air: -Focus group to triangulate data from surveys -Quantitative data from survey to process the level of acceptance the tool had -Qualitative data to extract learnings, feelings, and emotional reactions to the tool -Webpage analytics to know the trends, number of users and navigation time. -Visual mapping or mind maps to categorize codified data obtained with NVivo. + Brave Schools: Our behavioral experiment was testing whether pedagogical methods could change adolescents´ and teachers´ perspective and behavior toward gender-based violence and discrimination within schools. Thus, we used a randomized controlled trial to compare the results obtain between the control and treatment group. To measure perspective, we used a survey to collect the data. To measure behavior, we used a classroom observation tool and focus groups to collect any subtle change.&nbsp;

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

+ Flowers in the Air Prosecutor Training: Because behavioral change is only possible with deep, multidimensional and long term interventions, we decided to measure "awareness" instead, which is possible to impact in a shorter time. Level of awareness, is difficult to measure, therefore we focused on extracting feelings, new thoughts raised, and new understanding further than what the theory says. (For instead, understanding redress not according to the law but according to what families say). For this, we had two instruments using the same indicators: survey and focus groups questions. Information was codified using NVivo and mind maps were developed to verify connections and recurrences. + Brave Schools: School-related gender-based violence (SRGBV) is defined as acts or threats of sexual, physical, or psychological violence occurring in and around schools, perpetrated as a result of gender norms and stereotypes, and enforced by unequal power dynamics. Children and adolescents experiencing SRGBV see their well-being, physical and emotional health, as well as cognitive development compromised. We tapped on the power of education to ensure that children and adolescents are protected from all forms of violence in their school lives. Education is an important socializing mechanism; thus, it is a vehicle for transforming individual behaviors and broader social norms around violence, gender equality and discrimination.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

+ Brave Schools: CREA is the institute that designed the pedagogical methods and the Acc Lab made adjustments to make them relevant tool for gender-based violence and discrimination.&nbsp;

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

NA

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

+ Flower in the air: National Prosecutor Office- they disseminated the tool among 2000 civil servants and allowed us to design a training for over 400 prosecutors. We were granted full access to Moodle as course designers and mentors. + Brave Schools: Ministry of Education authorized to run the pilot in a public school.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

+ Brave Schools: CREA was an unusual partner for UNPD, our collaboration was special since at a global level they keep track of when, were and what for their methodologies are used.&nbsp;

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

+ Brave Schools: We kept UNICEF and UNESCO in the loop to retake conversations about scaling up the intervention once we got results.&nbsp;
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

+Brave schools: The Ministry of Education is currently managing school-related gender-based violence with norms and having a specialist within some schools to solve any case of violence. Nevertheless, this issue has not been solved before with a collective approach by involving in discussions students and teachers and generating a space to talk about gender rules and violence.&nbsp;
