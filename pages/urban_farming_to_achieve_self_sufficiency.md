Because of the economic hardship that most Syrians are going through, especially after the economic sanctions that were imposed recently, a number of urban areas residents decided they want to do things differently and wanted to try achieving self-sufficiency through urban farming. Abdul-Rahman al-Masri, from Damascus Syria, is using a hydroponics system to grow crops on his roof-top. Ziad Thabet and Osama aljbaai from As Suwayda also used Their rooftops to grow different kinds of crops for household consumption. Now, Thabet achieved a surplus in production and is supplying a local market. Another man from As-Suwayda Raslan Othman, a contractor, is planting his little home garden and back yard with different crops vegetables, and fruits for household consumption and is achieving self-sufficiency.
