WasteX Lab: Scaling Pro-poor enterprises in Solid Waste Management
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is improper solid waste management in the islands of Unguja and Pemba in Zanzibar

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

One of the world's most pressing urban issues is solid waste management, which has a disproportionate impact on metropolitan areas, particularly in developing countries. According to recent estimates, more than 2.01 billion tons of solid waste are produced worldwide each year, with the volume expected to reach approximately 3.4 billion tons by 2050. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia, according to the same reports, will account for 35% of these increases. Similarly, each year, approximately 8 million tons of plastic waste are dumped into the world's oceans, and by 2050, the oceans will contain more plastic than fish. Because of unregulated dumping and burning, solid waste contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily methane and carbon dioxide. Sub-Saharan Africa is a major source of solid waste with insufficient management, which contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and their global impact on climate change.   According to the Zanzibar Environment Management Authority, Zanzibar generates approximately 663 tons of municipal solid waste per day (ZEMA). The three major municipal councils, Zanzibar Urban Municipal Council (ZUMC), West A and B Municipal Councils, generate approximately 216 tons of waste per day, nearly half of the island's total waste, of which only 120 tons are collected and disposed of at the Kibele Landfill Site in Tunguu, Central District. Massive amounts of uncollected waste are dumped into the natural environment, contaminating natural resources, endangering the tourism industry, and providing an ideal breeding ground for flies and rodents, which are vectors of various illnesses, including cholera, especially in slum areas. Indiscriminate dumping of solid waste has been blamed for clogging storm drains, resulting in urban flooding, and influencing irresponsible waste littering behavior.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

WasteX is a new concept, however, both agencies has been working on some facets of the solution already- for example, UNICEF in partnership with the Ministry of Health, and the Office of the Second Vice President in Zanzibar is implementing a programme called ‘Comprehensive Cholera elimination Programme, (2018-2027). Through this programme UNICEF also supports urban community-based solid waste management interventions to enhance environmental cleanliness for disease control, innovation in waste management, waste minimization, transportation, and employment generation in 3 urban cholera hotspot districts notably: Urban, West A, and West B. So far, the programme has selected seven groups to engage and pilot various interventions on solid waste management. Among the seven groups selected four have opted to pilot briquette production (charcoal), and three have opted to produce compost.

UNDP through the accelerator lab had conducted various experiments related to solid waste management in Tanzania mainland on satellite data and crowd mapping to create an overview of the production and collection of waste in Mwanza’s Buhongwa ward, a peripheral neighborhood with many informal settlements.  The Lab’s experiment in Mwanza region recommended the following: 1) creating a viable environment for small businesses engaged in recycling by providing guarantees and supporting processes to improve bankability; 2) attract investors in material recovery plant installation and production of compost fertilizer; 3) employ various collective intelligence methods to understand the problem in semi-urban wards e.g. use of unusual sources of data such as satellite data; 4) encourage learning from successful projects elsewhere; 4) run a hackathon to crowdsource ideas that use technology to improve solid waste management systems 5) convene and elevate local solid waste innovators by building a local Innovation forum.   We anticipate that experiences generated from the two projects will enhance the design and operationalization of this idea. By embedding innovative methods and practices including using Human Centered Design, Innovation challenge (during selection of businesses) and the COE approach will allow businesses to thrive and create sustainability of these solutions in the local government setting and eventually trigger a bigger impact.

UNDP and UNICEF Tanzania won the Green Shark Innovation Challenge. The  Green Shark innovation challenge  was designed by UNDP and UNICEF to inspire innovative ideas in the youth and green recovery spaces with the greatest potential to strengthen collaboration and, in doing so, increase the impact of our joint work on the ground. In total, 121 innovative proposals from all regions were received, with more than 1,400 staff participating. After two rounds of evaluation based on carefully developed criteria, three winners were selected  to receive funding and tailored mentoring and coaching sessions. For, Tanzania, the innovation that won is WasteX Lab, which entails an innovative approach that uses a Centre of Excellence design to support the scaling of pro-poor enterprises in solid waste management in Zanzibar. The $250,000 grant won  will help encourage local stakeholders, particularly youth, to engage in a circular economy approach to waste management in partnership with local municipalities within a public-private partnership (PPP) arrangement. The increasing waste volumes in Zanzibar offer an opportunity to create employment by engaging in small and medium-scale businesses through innovative waste recycling and collection services. The "WasteX Lab" will map existing solutions in the solid waste innovation ecosystem and will serve as a catalyst and ladder for further innovation and scale in the region. The WasteX Lab project, which was designed by staff members of the environment department  and the head of exploration of the Accelerator lab team of UNDP in collaboration with the UNICEF staff team, was the only project from the African continent that won. Other winners were Youth Environment Living Labs (YELL): Cultivating youth ‘exploraction’ in climate and environmental action-Malaysia (East Asia & Pacific Region) Focusing on biowaste as an entry point to creating green entrepreneurial opportunities in North Macedonia (Europe & Central Asia)
