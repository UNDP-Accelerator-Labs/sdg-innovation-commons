Instead of single-use plastic straws, a local craftsman from Central Viet Nam decided to produce bamboo straws to supply hotels, resorts and restaurants in Hội An, Đà Nẵng, Nha Trang and Phú Quốc. This project started as a campaign to raise awareness to pollution cased by plastic straws and single-use plastic cups.

The craftsman said his workshop could produce 20,000 bamboo straws each month without the use of chemicals.
