Traceable Tuna: Improving the efficiency and competitiveness of the tuna fishery in Barbados by piloting a traceability system using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to increase the quality and grade of the tuna catch and set the foundation for the establishment of a traceable and sustainable tuna brand. This could increase local market access to a high grade tuna product, improve quality control and transparency of exports, introduce blockchain in the fisheries supply chain, generate Caribbean data capture opportunities and enhance the training of fisherfolk on handling practices and traceability.
