> Brief description of the innovation

Our innovation is called Timeless melody solutions.  This business was birthed out from a passion and a drive to see change in  local music industry. As a musician I have always been passionate about creating music that strengthens belief and brings hope to the hopeless. Most of our African music is not true to culture this is because overtime the music produced has focussed on western culture simply because of how western music has been branded. My company intends to solve this problem by branding, promoting and advancing African culture through music.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We will setup our own music studio. This will be a place of innovation where production will be done and will allow collaborations with different music companies in order to add a unique touch to every project.
Profitability- We plan to earn revenue through digital sells, (on all digital platforms) live shows, concerts and royalties. With the right marketing strategy our target is to sell a minimum of 100K digital copies of our music per annum. (this will increase overtime)

> Technical Feasibility

Timeless Melody Solutions is a publishing company that aims at managing brands and trademarks, coordinate the productions, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyrights for sound recordings and music videos. Our aim is to also conduct talent scouting and development of new artists. The benefits of our services is that we are focussed on delivering music that is not limited by genre, relates to all and caries a positive message of change.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Timeless Melody Solutions improves lives by producing great music that impacts the community with a positive message to people who have been rejected, abandoned, abused, harrased, isolated and those with identity crisis. This is a great contribution to the market as people often to look for music that speaks to their situations.
