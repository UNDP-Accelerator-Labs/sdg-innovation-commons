The Bangladesh Accelerator Lab organized a Women’s Digital Innovation hackathon to promote ICT skills and innovation practices to female students and professionals and find new digital solutions to a wide range of SDG challenges. As lack of digital literacy and primary digital skills among rural women is a major challenge in Bangladesh, one of the ideas that came out of the hackathon aimed to address this via ‘Sobjanta’ (Bengali for "omniniscient") - a messenger chatbot that will help rural women develop basic digital skills, computer and ICT skills, and also guide them regarding public services, human rights, and women-related opportunities. The bot will also troubleshoot basic challenges faced by users related to digital aspects.
