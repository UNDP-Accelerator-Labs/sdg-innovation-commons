> Type of the Solution

Passive Cooling System

> Description of the solution

A natural ventilation technique that relies on the principle that hot air rises and cool air sinks. By creating a vertical temperature gradient in a building, hot air can be vented out of upper floors while cool air is drawn in at lower levels
