The council of Alifu Alifu Thoddoo has an explicit policy to not allocate land from Environmental Protection Zones (EPZs) and the beach area for the establishment of tourism properties. The decision to restrict the development of tourism on the periphery was to prevent a situation where only guesthouses located on the beach area will benefit and guesthouses inland will suffer. This policy gives all guest houses an equal opportunity to benefit from tourism, protects the shoreline and promote the establishment of tourism properties that is more coherent and integrated with the rest of the built infrastructure on the island.
