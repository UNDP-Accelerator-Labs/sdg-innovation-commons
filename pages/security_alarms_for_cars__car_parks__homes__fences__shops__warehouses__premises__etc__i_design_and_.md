> Title of the innovation

Security alarms for cars, car parks, homes, fences, shops, warehouses, premises, etc. I design and manufacture different security sensors/alarms according to customer requirements. I intend to start trading under the following details: Zes Security Electronics, website catalogue:         https://zes-electronics.diytrade.com/sdp/2390715/4/home/0.html

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is meant to reduce or prevent theft, burglary and enhance safety or security of all types of proper, premises and buildings through use of security alarms.The alarm names are according to their respective mode of operations, eg Cosede, Mosede, Blosede, Prosede. Alarms are meant to warn the owner, nearby people and scare away the intruders from the secured property before physical intervention by the owner or security guard in order to safeguard life and property from possible attacks.In most cases intruders a run away and never attempt revisiting such secured premises to avoid possible arrests.  All alarms are interfaced with with mobile cellphones for immediate notifications to the owner or police/security guard for intervention purposes. This immediate notifications goes to the configured cell in where in the world provided there is network.It also allows the informed person to listen to live events at the scene and record the event for follow up reasons. These alarms start warning with audio alarms and stop ringing automatically for the set duration as prepared by customers. Depending on customer requirements, we connect the alarms with a lethal electronic weapon which attacks the intruders with 40,000v AC to injure or incapacitate the intruders for security guard intervention.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income by importing some of raw materials needed, manufacturing and selling finished products. It will employ workers at all levels from raw materials procurement/stores, manufacturing, promotions of products, sales and exports to other countries. The alarms are affordable at local prices and are readily available at local markets for some customers to learn, appreciate the difference between clock alarms and security alarms. These alarms will help to reduce or prevent theft, burglary, ritual killings or gassing which happened in Zambia by improving security or safety of people and property or existing businesses. It with contribute to employment creation, exports and gross domestic products. Target markets include all houses, fences, premises, cars, car parks, shops, motorbikes all persons interested in security and safety of property, etc. The low prices of these products will beat imported products due to high foreign currency exchange rate. All products are environmentally safe and will add value to the environments by enhancing safety, security and by preventing theft, burglary, vandalism and killings.

> Technical Feasibility

These innovations are designed different depending on property to be secured, eg: Cosede demands that you step on, touch or just get in contact with the property. Prosede detects intruders 0 to 30cm away from property, Moses detects intruders 20m away from property and Blosede detects intruders once they cross invisible limits to human eyes or when the intruders get into a restricted zone.All alarms can warn by alarm or sectretely to the owner or security personnel for intervention. The only security alarm with a prototype is Mosede. The rest of alarms were invented due to my vast experience in electronic and electric hobbies since my chief ldhood in 1995.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will help improve security and safety of people's lives, businesses, premises, households and any company or person using such devices. Most of government's institutions like rural schools and clinics have no security guards but they have expensive property like smart care computers, medical equipment etc which need to be protected.Using such a device which needs no service charge nor any kind of subscription, is the solution to security and safety of such property and institutions. These devices work with minimum 3v DC even solar power or AC electricity and are 98% power efficient even the person without solar can use two 1.5v .
