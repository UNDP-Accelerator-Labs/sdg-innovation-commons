## Locally sourced Materials (Plastic Waste, Rafia & Maize Peel) for Interior decorations

Mr Tchaback Thomas is passionate about recycling waste materials to produce objects for decoration. He targets women and young girls from the extreme north region of the country considered the poorest region of the country. His economic empowerment approach is based on his belief that Africa's development has to lay emphasis on the capacity of Africans...He believes in combining knowledge and will to existing resources to boost innovation. In Thomas' words, "innovation brings empowerment and autonomy even to the least educated".
