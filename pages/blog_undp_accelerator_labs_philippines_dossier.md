The UNDP Accelerator Labs were created in 2019 to
re-imagine development for the 21st century – and to do so at an
unprecedented scale by tapping into the relationships, resources,
and expertise of UNDP and its partners.

With the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and
Development of Germany and the Qatar Fund for Development
as founding investors, and support from Italy and UNDP core
donors, UNDP Accelerator Labs now consists of 91 Labs covering
115 countries. Our mission is to catalyze positive change by finding
and sharing solutions that fit the times we live in and generating
new ideas for the times yet to come.

UNDP Accelerator Lab teams help UNDP and partners close the
gap between the current practices of international development
and the need for an accelerated pace of change. To do this,
the Labs create new service lines in development that are
open-ended and safe to fail. The Lab network does this by
iterating in a cycle of sensing, exploring, testing and growing.

HOW WE WORK

UNDP ACCELERATOR LABS’ LEARNING CYCLE
The Accelerator Lab continuously circles through four key activities:

SENSE
This is about understanding emerging
challenges and opportunities in the local
context and determining where we need
to focus our attention.

EXPLORE
This is about understanding emerging challenges
and looking for solutions, particularly by looking
at how citizens are already addressing these
challenges and opportunities

GROW
This is about handling over the portfolio of
solutions, enabling policy change or spinning
solutions off as private ventures.

DESIGN & TEST
This is about designing a portfolio of potential
solutions to intervene at multiple points in the
system and continuously testing them until we are
confident they can work.

This learning cycle defines how UNDP Accelerator Labs collaborate with local partners in addressing
issues to accelerate sustainable development.

Bridging these phases of the learning cycle are the three functions embedded within each lab:

EXPLORATION
Developments, and partnerships, to inform the context for pipeline development

SOLUTIONS MAPPING
Identifying potential local solutions through mapping of grassroots innovations and co-design sessions

EXPERIMENTATION
Deploying data innovations and designing experiments to test assumptions to generate insights

Ultimately these aim to elicit learning before going big with solutions, especially in the volatile
conditions that can dominate development settings.

Understanding gaps and the fit between current investments and the changing environment can
inform pathways to increasing the impact of existing programmes and pipeline development. This aims
to move away from pilot programmes towards a coherent portfolio approach to development, where
certainty of outcome is a rare commodity while accelerating learning in months rather than years.

ALab PH:

UNDP ACCELERATOR LAB
IN THE PHILIPPINES

The UNDP Accelerator Lab in the Philippines, also known as ALab PH, was founded in
2019 with the initial mandate to work on three frontier challenges: circular economy, cities,
and local convergences for poverty reduction.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, support extended to pandemic response
to look at how digital solutions can promote the inclusion of marginalized groups amid
lockdowns. This included deploying chatbots and machine learning to understand the
impact of COVID-19 on households and enterprises, as well as piloting digital initiatives
such as a platform to promote inclusive supply chain for PPEs and digital cash transfers.
Altogether, these have sprung forth a comprehensive portfolio of work, where synergies and
complementaries between each are constantly explored towards integration.

ALab is also dedicated to capacity building to promote advocacies around innovation
capabilities, notably:

Inclusive Innovation in the
Philippines through research
and network building

Policy advocacies backed
by data experiments

Support for facilitating
discussions on participatory
futures to inform strategy

SERVICE LINES

In driving this portfolio, ALab PH supports local partners by applying social innovation tools towards
the following aims:

Facilitating strategic change

Learning for scale

ALab PH facilitates systemic and participatory
processes to enable local governments
to build a strategic agenda that combines
tangible interventions for both short- and
long-term impact. These aim to mobilize
local multi-stakeholder networks and align
relationships to design and activate systemic
change in addressing climate change,
inequality and public service delivery.

Together with partners, ALab PH
co-develops a framework for systematic
reviews, meta-evaluations and analysis of
the existing knowledge base to baseline and
grow initiatives. Through rapid ethnography,
sensemaking and surveys, rapid impact and
needs assessment for initiatives may surface
contextual insights to complement evaluations
towards iterative implementation.

To this end, ALab PH works closely with programme units of UNDP Philippines to leverage its technical
expertise and identify pathways for sustainability of initiatives while engaging its external network, both
locally and globally, to expand prospects for cross-pollination.

This has brought forth three integrated portfolios upon which ALab PH applies the approaches above:
climate & circular economy; poverty & inequality; and public service transformation.

Climate
and Circular
Economy

Climate and Circular Economy

Coastal and marine ecosystems have consistently
been threatened by climate change, overfishing,
habitat loss, and other stressors, and one of the most
pressing threats is marine litter. While situated at the
apex of the Coral Triangle, the Philippines boasts of
being one of the mega-diverse countries in the world
and has millions of Filipinos relying on its waters
for livelihood. With the majority of the Philippines’
population living near rivers and coastal lines, the

Marine litter is one of the most pressing threats to
the coastal and marine environment, in addition to
climate change and unsustainable fishing. In 2019, the
Philippines contributed 356,371 tonnes of plastic waste
into the ocean accounting for 36% of the global total.1

Marine litter is a systemic problem that requires a
solution with a holistic lens. Circular Economy (CE) is
considered by world organizations as a key strategy
to drastically reduce waste problems and provide
significant environmental, economic, and social
benefits.2

Under its strategic change service line, ALab PH works
on the thematic area of climate and circular economy
to support the country’s response to the climate
crisis and transition to more inclusive and resilient
economies. Starting with the Circular Economy initiative
in Pasig City, ALab PH supports the national and
local government units, all stakeholders, and people,
particularly the vulnerable sector, to find synergies that
will demonstrate and accelerate the transition of cities
from a linear to a circular economy.

The project has adopted a portfolio approach that
encompasses data, policy, advocacy, investments, and
behavior interventions needed to address this complex
challenge.

Despite the gradual reduction of poverty in
the Philippines over the past decade, three
million families still live below the poverty line,
according to the poverty estimate in 2018.3
In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic stunned
humanity and developments in poverty
reduction have been put to a stop. In the
Philippines, the impact was felt most by those
in the vulnerable sectors, such as farmers,
fisherfolk, and small entrepreneurs, making it
more difficult for them to rise from poverty.

ALab PH’s campaign to reduce poverty
and inequalities is pushed by both its Local
Convergence for Zero Poverty and Inclusive
Local Value Chains portfolios. Through the
#TawidCOVID challenge, citizens identified and
nurtured local solutions to poverty in the context
of the pandemic. Data innovations were also
pursued through the COVID Pulse PH chatbot
surveys and machine learning for poverty
estimates.

ALab PH partnered with Zero Extreme Poverty
2030 Philippines (ZEP) to build and strengthen

local coalitions that tackle poverty issues through
collective impact. ALab PH and ZEP hope to reach
more local convergences and local government
units (LGUs) through the AAA Recovery Project
focusing on COVID-19 recovery and the
government devolution of services to LGUs
initiated by the Mandanas-Garcia ruling.

MSMEs play a crucial role in the Philippine
economy and employ two-thirds of the
population. ALab PH captured MSME behavior
and perceptions by conducting rapid response
surveys and collaborated with enterprises
that continue to push for social good despite
economic constraints.

ALab PH is in the course of surveying the value
chain situation in both BARMM and Malay, Aklan,
and through rapid ethnography and co-design
sessions, has come up with proposed solutions
to build more inclusive value chain networks. The
experience and lessons learned from working
with local stakeholders have helped ALab PH
fine-tune its Inclusive Local Chain, which the lab
envisions for other localities in the Philippines.

Public Service

Transformation

The NextGenCities portfolio is a convergence
of UNDP’s existing work and has been evolving
into a robust and consolidated offer. Support
to promote urban innovation for agile and
anticipatory governance can be done through
building participatory platforms, providing
portfolio insights, and making use of digital assets
to inform decision making.

As a support to the UNDP Philippines’ COVID-19
response efforts, ALab PH initiated its Digital
Financial Inclusion portfolio.The lab has
implemented policy research and webinars to stir
discussion at the policy level while a solutions
mapping guide called the Saliklakbay has been
designed to take advantage of innovations
perceived at the grassroots level.

Globally, urbanization has been established as
a strong propeller for economic growth and
poverty reduction. In the Philippines, 65 percent
of the population is expected to live within cities
by 2050, a number that is twice the size it is
today. Urbanization can bring about job creation,
improved services, and innovative solutions,while
a reckless approach to attaining an urban society
can lead to congestion, pollution, and more
inequality.4

Because cities must adapt to fast-changing
technology, governments are compelled to
engage in strategic systems change so that
public services such as waste removal or
disaster response are delivered. Public service
transformation has been at the core of ALab
PH’s advocacy. ALab PH aspires to support local
governments by using innovative tools to address
gaps in their capacity to deliver services to the
community. In strengthening the government
units’ and agencies’ capacities, citizen
participation must be reinforced through online
channels and new local coalitions.

IN THREE YEARS, WE HAVE
ACCOMPLISHED THE FOLLOWING
WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS:

Identified and archived 262 Grassroots Innovations in the Davao Region through DOST’s GRIND,

which will also adopt Alab PH’s SalikLakbay Solutions Mapping to identify locally-sourced
solutions with the view of improving local communities across the country.

Facilitated an innovation challenge to support local service delivery and sessions for human-

centered digital service delivery.

Prototyped and co-designed proposed solutions to address barriers to waste management and
financial technology adoption to find novel ways to implement a COVID-19 response, to utilize
cultural assets for socioeconomic growth, to support coalitions achieve collective impact, and to
promote inclusive food systems and value chains.

Designed and initiated 18 experiments, such as data experiments, pilot studies and behavioral
nudges across portfolios, eight of which helped advance the Circular Economy portfolio into
finding innovative solutions to waste detection (Satellite remote sensing, Citizen Science) and
management (ICE Hub). In driving digitalization, a total of five experiments focused on increasing
financial literacy and adaptation of digital cash transfers and creating an inclusive Fintech
ecosystem.

Institutionalized 21 solutions through our partners, building their capacity towards institutional

sustainability. Alab PH’s innovative approaches to data collection and application (e.g., chatbot
survey, machine learning, remote sensing, Pintig Lab), knowledge platforms (Empower, Kai)
and solutions mapping (Saliklakbay) were adopted by government and civic partners while
contributing to UNDP programming.

Mobilized over 3 million USD from both internal and external funding resources to grow learning
on financial inclusion, local innovations, circular economy, informal economy, and food systems.
As our work matures, so does the opportunity to consolidate ALab capacities and strengthen
synergies between thematic areas, as learning gained from each focus area has paved the way
towards an integrated portfolio approach. The Lab continues to be a resource for integration,
interrogation, and iteration of innovation in development work, opening up channels to harness
the capacity of the global learning network.
