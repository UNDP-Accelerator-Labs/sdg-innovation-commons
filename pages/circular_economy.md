## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Creating Green Jobs through Waste Upcycling at Shankharapur Municipality of Nepal
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

One of the major challenges in Nepal is the issues related to waste management. In order to contribute to the national priorities, we are focusing on the challenge related to integrated solid waste management contributing to circular economy

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The constitution of Nepal (2015) states the right of every citizen to live in a clean and healthy
environment. With federalization, the local governments are given the overall responsibilities
to introduce their own environmental and SWM policies and regulations and implement
them in partnership modality.&nbsp;Though Nepal has a mandatory policy for waste segregation, implementation mechanism&nbsp;is yet to be effective. The Solid Waste Management Act 2068 (2011) and Rules 2070 (2013)
mandates the need of waste segregation at source, separate collection and processing of
waste. Nepal’s Environmental Protection Act (2019) and Regulations (2020) and Nepal’s
climate commitments to the UNFCCC (2020) commits that Nepal will adopt segregation at
source, manage degradable and non-degradable waste and recycle across the country by
2030. In addition, Nepal’s 15&nbsp;five-year plan sets out the need for proper waste management
(including plastics). Solid Waste Management National Policy 2022 which was recently
endorsed by the Government of Nepal has emphasized on developing integrated law for
hazardous, chemical, industrial, health care facilities and household waste management.
Most of the newly formed municipalities in 2014 are finding it difficult to set the priorities
regarding waste management, especially in annual programs, budget, equipment,
infrastructure and strengthening its institutional capacity. Most of the municipalities are
still struggling to carry out the basic waste management practices and with no proper
SWM system.
Due to the informal set up and lack of motivation and initiatives from the government, their
presence is limited and short lived. This has resulted in higher risk for any larger investments
on equipment, vehicles, permanent structure and machineries or technologies required in
the overall solid waste management process. Both the diverse composition and volume of
waste is becoming increasingly complex with expansion of urban areas, internal migration
and haphazard urban planning. Together with Shankharapur municipality, Accelerator Lab plans to contribute to circular economy by utilizing waste into different upcycled products.

<div class="group">


> 

There are baseline surveys done by UNDP Nepal and Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). however, it only covers few sample sizes. Currently, we are planning to demonstrate the integrated waste management model in one of the urban municipalities and link it with green jobs and green economy.&nbsp;

The newly formed municipalities do not have any structure and capacity to manage the ever increasing waste. Taking the cases of Namobuddha Municipality and Tilottama Municipality, we conducted detail assessment on the waste composition, existing practices on waste management and the current gaps and challenges. The findings of the exploratory research at both the municipalities were documented and submitted to the respective municipalities. Reports can be accessed in the links below:

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Added Value: Since we have already explored and tested a couple of interventions and options related to waste management and have closely interacted with 7 municipalities on mapping the existing options to manage waste, it has been planned to introduce and register at least 2 of the explored waste upcycling enterprises to create green jobs to the local community (at least 50% women). This will reduce the volume of waste going to landfill by 30%, contributing to UNDP Nepal's CPD outputs 1.2 and 3.1&nbsp;

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP Accelerator Lab in Nepal is exploring to introducing at least 2 waste upcycling enterprises at the local level to promote zero waste model and circular economy.&nbsp;
