## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

• Most of the judges (58.54%) have heard more than 20 cases in the last year, indicating a high procedural burden in provinces such as Guayas and Pichincha.
• The interviews and surveys carried out show a general perception of inefficiency and lack of speed in case management, which reinforces the need for training and improvement in judicial procedures.
• Lack of familiarization with key policies, such as the Comprehensive Gender Policy in the Administration of Justice, was identified as a critical area requiring attention.
• 30 (41%) judges have received more than 20 hours of training; 16 (22%) 5-10 hours; 14 (19%) from 11-20 hours and 13 (18%) less than 5 hours; however, there is no evaluation of training processes when it is crucial to determine specific needs and design effective programs. Most courses were delivered virtually (59), followed by a combination  of virtual and in-person (12). This suggests the need to evaluate the
effectiveness of training modalities and their learning impact.
• The main topics addressed in the training include laws and policies on gender violence (35), gender focus in judicial decisions (29), and awareness and prevention of gender violence (25); however, only 12 judges have received training in victim intervention and support methods, which could indicate a significant area for improvement.


> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Because we measured (evaluated) results from training process and there was an increase in knowledge and awareness, the course will be replicated in two more provinces. Also, the Judicial Council School will integrate a virtual modality into its official curriculum that is nationwide and mandatory for all Judges. We will be creating the virtual modality with mentors this 2025.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The diagnosis triangulates data, as we parted from a hypothesis that  there´s always a gap between "theoretical reporting" to actual
behaviour. That is, we wanted to contrast information provided by  interviews and surveys, to actually see if this was coherent with
verdicts (behaviour).
