## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Our Learnings: 

1.In the context of conflict, accessing community knowledge poses significant challenges. Numerous sensitivities are at play, requiring specialized conflict-sensitive methodologies to foster connections and mitigate divisive elements.

2.The river itself serves as a source sensitivities, particularly given its status as a cross-border river with multiple conflicting stakeholders. Geopolitical dynamics further complicate the situation, necessitating careful engagement with various entities, including governments, private organizations, communities, academia, and others within each governate, to address and prevent potential sensitivities.

3.There exists a significant scarcity of information, data, and research related to climate, biodiversity and cultural intangible heritage related to the Syrian side of the Euphrates River basin. This lack of understanding hampers effective conservation and protection efforts.

4.Recognizing the integral role of knowledge sharing, research, and data, it becomes clear that these components are crucial in the overall process of preserving and protecting the river. A collaborative approach involving diverse stakeholders is essential for informed decision-making and sustainable management.

5.The challenges facing the Euphrates River extend beyond environmental concerns such as climate and water issues. They encompass a complex interplay of cultural, geopolitical, social, and economic factors, forming a multifaceted system that demands a holistic and integrated approach to address its intricacies. Understanding and addressing this broader context is essential for devising effective and future sustainable solutions.

## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Academic Literature Review: Conducting a literature review was imperative to ascertain existing knowledge and delineate research gaps.

Citizen Data, Citizen-Generated Data, Crowdsourcing: Utilizing methods such as photo stories, research calls, and community engagement to actively generate real-time and updated data.

Stakeholder Mapping: Identifying key stakeholders to actively engage and garner support for data generation, as well as enhancing our comprehension of the challenges at hand.

System Mapping: Aiming to comprehend the multifaceted challenges as a system, with multiple actors and components interacting in complex ways.
