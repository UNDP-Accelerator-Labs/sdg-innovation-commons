## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Collective Intelligence for Climate Action
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that rural/ remote maritime local communities are disproportionately affected by natural hazards such as tropical cyclones - due to their limited access to basic needs such as energy.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

4% of Fiji's population does not have access to energy due to their remoteness or distance from main power grid - therefore these communities have slower recovery rates post natural hazards (tropical cyclones).

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The AccLab is using collective intelligence methods to ensure local communities are given an opportunity to participate in the design of clean energy projects - community members will provide information on how access to energy has impacted their lives, their ability to recover from natural hazards, and the which solar enabled services would have the most positive impact on their lives.&nbsp;

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The Fiji AccLab is using collective intelligence to understand how access to clean energy is enabling rural and remote maritime communities to enhance their climate resilience and economic empowerment.&nbsp;

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can access to clean energy increase climate resilience in rural/ remote communities?&nbsp;

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The combination of these methods will allow deeper understanding into the lived experiences of local communities in regards to how they are coping with climate change induced natural hazards, how access to energy has supported their ability to recovery from natural hazards, and what type of further support may be needed to support their future development goals and ability to recover from future natural hazards.&nbsp;

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These sources of data will help to address the current information gap on how the climate resilience of remote communities who have been provided access to clean energy has been affected, and what further support would be needed to increase their climate resilience and economic empowerment.&nbsp;
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The remaining 4% of the population who are yet to be connected to solar power will benefit from the design of the project that is locally contextual and informed by local communtities lived experinees.&nbsp;
