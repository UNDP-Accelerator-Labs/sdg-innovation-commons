The Regional Bureau for Asia & the Pacific (RBAP) of UNDP selected several Country Offices - Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and the Philippines to show core strengths in specific development areas and help these COs in the delivery of “beyond borders” support to other RBAP COs that have the potential to benefit from their lessons learned, guidance, and/or direct support. To this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab is working on the Capacity for Experience Sharing (CESI) initiative on developing an innovative, collaborative cross country knowledge management platform. CESI will promote a risk-based decision-making process that enables understanding of multiple concurrent threats and complex risks, trade-offs and opportunities, and then acting on that knowledge.
