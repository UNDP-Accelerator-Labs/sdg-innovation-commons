## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We wanted to learn how co-creation, participatory design and Design Thinking can be used as tools to create processes that improve public service delivery. Additionally, as an outcome of framing the challenge together with the end users, we wanted to learn about the impact of the physical space (the Notary) on staff and users.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

 H1: IF... participatory approach is used to tackle the challenges faced in the Notary... THEN staff and users will feel a stronger sense of belonging, ultimately improving maintenance of the space.  

H2: IF... The space of the Notary is re-designed through a participatory process.... the needs of users and staff will be better met and improve the perception of how the Notary service is delivered to the population

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment
- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Together with staff and end users, we co-created a prototype design for the space of the Notary. After installation, we made a pre-post-survey with staff and users to measure and compare perception of the space and service delivery before and after intervention. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

We analyzed the results of the pre-post survey

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

1. we collected qualitative data through a collective intelligence workshop carried out with staff, users, Lusófona University student Association and the High Commission for Covid-19. 2. We collected data through a pre-post-survey with staff and users to measure the impact of the remodeled space 3. We tried to compare the data produced daily by the Notary (number of users attended/day). But the comparison can´t be used as we compared the number of users at different times of the year when the natural user flow is very different to eachother

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 days

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

The cycle took around 6 months from start to inauguration. A lot of time was lost in procurement processes and waiting for the Minister of Justice to approve the inauguration. Additional team:  Data collection: Saudigitus (4), Bandim Health Project (2) Users and staff (300-350)
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

H1: IF... participatory approach is used to tackle the challenges faced in the Notary... THEN staff and users will feel a stronger sense of belonging, ultimately altering maintenance - PROVEN through the results of the pre-post survey but DISPROVEN through our observations of the space a couple of months after inauguration H2: IF... The space of the Notary is re-designed through a participatory process.... users and staff needs will be better met and improve the perception of how the Notary service is delivered to the population - PROVEN through the results of the pre-post survey

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

The collective Intelligence workshop created a strong confidence and acceptance of the Lab from staff and users, and facilitated the process a lot. The experiment was expensive and time consuming ( mostly due to procurement processes and bureaucracy), for next time I would use cheaper materials to prototype the intervention and measure the impact faster. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

23.000 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We are discussing to go back to try to understand why H1, the maintenance hypothesis partly failed 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Not what we know for the moment, but the work was well perceived by the Ministry and CO.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Design Thinking and co-creation showed to be a successful tool to improve public service delivery. The remodulation of the space changed the perception of the staff and users in different ways: - Users feel safer in relation to Covid measures after remodulation  - The queue system is perceived as more effective after the remodulation - The space is perceived as cleaner and better maintained after the remodulation - The space is perceived as more attractive and comfortable after remodulation - The space is perceived as more secure and attractive after remodulation as well as being able to provide and improved service delivery- There is still lots of work to be done to improve the relationship between staff and users and the way that services are delivered inside the Notary

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

- Bureaucratic bottlenecks in the Ministry of Justice and UNDP, slowed down the process - Internal resistance from staff when it comes to use new technologies (ex. new digital queue system)

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Governance Cluster as Access to Justice is under their mandate and the experiment shown improved perception among users and staff. But all clusters can benefit from inspired by this activity as it shows the value of working close to end users in order to achieve results confronting the challenges faced on the ground as well as highlighting prototyping as a method to conduct projects.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The Ministry of Justice, other ministries and institutions providing public service as the experimental activity shows that it  spaces can be improved though participatory methods in order to provide a better service delivery

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We saw new things along the way and several iterations were made, ex the size and height of the reception desk, dimension and openings of the glass protection screen, creation of private workspaces for staff with modular walls  

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Try to look in to cheap and efficient ways of prototyping the intervention/ furniture etc. We suffered from long procurement processes.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Ex. Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 5 (gender equality), looking into how to prototype spaces and public spaces where people feel safe and protected 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

25% sense 25% explore I think I would have liked to work closer to both of my colleagues in all phases to always incorporate our different perspectives. It would also have been interesting to extend the explore phase to research other existing similar projects and consult experts. 

> What surprised you?

It took longer and costed more than we expected. Physical changes are evident, giving clear impressions from users.
