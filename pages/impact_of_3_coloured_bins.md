## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

Based on the RCT trial on the effectiveness of the 3 coloured bins to households, following key recommendations have been proposed to the National Environment Commission: 1. Providing households with hazardous bins with stickers (waste type) nudges members to segregate hazardous waste effectively  2. Providing each household with dry and wet information stickers for free will enable members to improve the quality of dry and wet segregation  3.It is vital to make it extremely easy for households to buy matching dry and wet bins for a small fee 4. Clearly communicate waste classification and infrastructure changes to households 5. What's next: explore an experiment on introducing common residential bins and its effectiveness in shortening the waste dumping process

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Waste management challenge is complex with many stakeholders and drivers of behaviours. Solving waste issues will require a range of solutions in the short and long term. Challenges incurred as follows: 1. Limited infrastructure to support the processing of segregated waste  2. Lack of classification of type of wastes generated in the country 3. Lack of knowledge on waste types amongst the citizens  4. Limited resources contributed to the waste management system

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The RCT trial was based on understanding of of  household member's  journey in the waste segregation process. Information was sought through user journey mapping exercises, deep user interviews, surveys etc. Currently there are no information on the the household's level of knowledge on waste type and its seggregation processes. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

To understand the needs of the citizens and their behaviours in waste segregation, it was essential for us to apply design thinking principles. In the later stages of the trial, the three bins were prototyped with local communities and waste handlers. Ethnographic research was also carried out before the trial to get a sense of relationship citizens had with household waste. Throughout the trial, citizens were involved to co-create and co-design the trials for effective implementation. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Worked with Greener Way which is an CSO involved in managing and recycling solid waste in the capital. The RCT was carried out in partnership with them. They helped us access their data base on the types of waste produced by households in the capital. Likewise, they also  partnered in carry out the trial experiment both in the trial design as well as implementation phase. They were part of the taskforce for the bin and sticker prototype given their knowledge in the waste management practices. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None for this trial

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None for this trial

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Worked with the National Environment Commission and city municipality to run the trial. From conception to design to implementation of the trial, they were involved as taskforce members. They took lead in the implementation of the trial on the ground, identifying waste handlers, linking us with households and arranging manpower (desuups) for the trial. 

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

City municipality is the unusual partner for UNDP. They have direct control over the municipal territory and provided much-needed support for running an intensive trial experiment which otherwise would have been challenging for UNDP without having any footing on the ground. The municipality also had forged partnerships with the local communities that we could leverage for a smoother collaboration. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We carried out ethnographic data to study the existing waste management behaviours, carried out statistical rigour discourse for more accurate trial estimates and applied a human centric approach to the trial design. These innovative tools brought much clarity to our approach.
