SUMMARY Philippines

Promoting Leadership and Mitigating
the Negative Impacts of HIV and AIDS
on Human Development

Background

The increasing trend in new HIV infections in the Philippines

calls for sustained and effective national and local responses.
Since the first AIDS case was reported in 1984, the Philippines
has remained a low prevalence country with registered cases
at less than 0.1% of the total population. However, recent
official reports show a steep and accelerating increase in total
number of cases. A multi-sectoral and broad-based approach
is required to mitigate the negative impact of HIV and AIDS on
human development and to achieve Goal 6 of the Millennium
Development Goals of halting and reducing the epidemic by 2015.

response helps in reducing stigma and discrimination as well as
promoting their rights at the institutional and community levels.

Understanding of HIV and AIDS enhances policy and programme
planning on HIV and AIDS by strengthening advocacy and strategic
information to promote a multi-sector response. It identifies and
assists in the production of strategic information to address the
knowledge gaps in the Philippines AIDS responses and functions
