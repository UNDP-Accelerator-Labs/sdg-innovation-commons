> DESCRIPTION: What did you observe, or what did people write or say?

Due to COVID 19 restrictions that also impacted on mobilization,  the "ice-cream grandpas" where facing a higher challenge, how to sell their ice-creams by walking around with their mobile carts, in the urban areas and manage to go back and forth to their homes when public transportation went off and the working hours were very limited in the country. So the social network group "Ayúdame a Trabajar" notice their problem and suggested to bring food to the warehouse the elderly kept the carts to help them to survive. Some of them couldn´t commute back to their homes.  A young lady, María Isabel, came to help them no only providing groceries or health prevention items, but she created a Facebook page "Abuelitos Heladeros" with e-commerce link where packages of ice-creams  from these group of "grandpas", could be sell through the page to help them to keep running their discrete business. Many people who knew about them started buying them many packages and collaborating either with groceries, money donations or other  useful items including medic assistance. Maria Isabel with the help of family and friends raised more funds to refurbish the warehouse and open it as a residential option for them too. The initiative has grown, and now they are helping other elder that are facing rough conditions.  Probably the main success key factor is that María Isabel has published all the expenses of the funds the FBPage has raised.

> NEED: What need does this answer?

The impact elderly face as technology moves faster, they remain conducting their small businesses in the traditional way, how ever with COVID 19 no only their economic activity was in risk, mobilization was blocked and the costs to use private alternative options were high. In addition, they face more risk to get the virus as elders. The solution "Abuelitos Heladeros" has managed to keep the economically active and even raise funds to provide them health care, better conditions in the warehouse they share. This a way how young people may help others to build a "digital bridge" to help others to pass thru digitalization and social media era, and not being left behind.
