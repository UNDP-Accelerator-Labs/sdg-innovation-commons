The Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO) conducted a 3-day plastics repurposing training workshop for 25 local women on the island of Rotuma. The workshop was part of SPTO's Pacific Tourism Waste Action Initiative (PTWAI) and allowed participants to learn new crafting skills, while equipping them with new tools for creating jewellery and decorative items from used plastic bottles.
The initiative will help the women as the sale of these handicrafts will be an additional source of income for households, while at the same time the repurposing of plastic bottles will help to address the plastic waste management issue on the island.
The PTWAI has also been implemented in Fiji, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru and FSM.
