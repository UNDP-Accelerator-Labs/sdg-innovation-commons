> Type of the Solution

Innovative

> Description of the solution

Is a system used in the Gulf. The process underlying is thermic ventilation (convention): the structure is a tower with light walls usually square-based and divided in height or more sector, squared or triangular. Irrespective of the location where the tower is situated, the season or the time of the day, two consecutive sectors will be in the shade and this will determine, inside the tower, a double parallel airflow of exhaust hot air and incoming cool one. For example in Pakistan there are thousands of wind catchers, all aligned and oriented towards the same direction, because in that region the wind always blows from the same side. More sophisticated towers were built with pads that people could orient from the building, depending on the wind.
