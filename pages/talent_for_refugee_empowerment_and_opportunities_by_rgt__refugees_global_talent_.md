Supporting refugees by promoting their talents and creativity
RGT (Refugees Global Talent) is supporting young talented refugees by promoting their talents and creating opportunities for them through an online community. In December 2019 a huge talent festival was organized in the Nakivale Refugee Settlement with thousands of people in the audience and hundreds of performers, whereby a jury selected three winners who are supported to take part in opportunities outside the refugee settlement.



The Enterprise emerged from the SINA Community of Unleashed in the Nakivale Refugee Settlement.
