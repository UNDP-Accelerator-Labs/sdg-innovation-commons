District Education Office officer, Mr Mohamad Yuzaidi Azmi introduced the farming of Volvariella Volvacae Mushroom to small farmers in Kedah as an alternative crop to increase their income. 


The volvariela mushrooms (strawed mushrooms) are planted using soaked palm branches as crop sites, instead of previous method where they use rice straw as a planting medium. The crops use no chemical substances while maximizing the land use in rubber plantations. 


The suitable climate and palm branches in Malaysia help to produce up to 6 kilograms of mushrooms at each crop site after 30 days.
