## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Climate action enhancement
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that currently, there is no diverse participation in climate actions from public policies.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Through the global Climate Promise initiative, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) aims to scale its support for climate action in more than 100 countries. In Uruguay, the Climate Promise, which the Government of Sweden finances, aims to ensure greater understanding, ownership, and involvement in the climate agenda by society and, at the same time, contribute to the second Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) in 2022. Within this framework, UNDP, together with the Ministry of the Environment, led the process of diagnosing the social perception of the impact and responses to climate change, presented in August 2021. This study aimed to produce a mapping of the perception of climate change (CC) in Uruguay. It consisted of a public opinion survey at the country level and qualitative research (interviews and focus groups) in critical sectors. It was a primary input for developing an engagement strategy for climate action. It allows us to get closer to knowing how people understand climate change, what impacts are perceived in people's daily lives and sectors of the national economy, and detecting needs, challenges, and opportunities for action. The survey covered the population over 18 years of age, so the perception of CC in adolescents was excluded. Nevertheless, understanding adolescents' concerns, ideas, visions, and opinions are essential to jointly build a more sustainable present and future. Uruguay faces the consequences of climate change and the population it is not prepared to deal with the new environmental challenges. Therefore, we need to enhance the involvement in climate action of diverse groups of people and link them with public policy to contribute to better policies and greater climate actions.

"The Diagnosis of the Social Perception of the Impact of and the Response to Climate Change was a social research consultancy commissioned to Opción Consultores by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), jointly with the National Directorate for Climate Change of the Ministry of the Environment (MA) in 2020. Its overall goal was to map the perception of climate change (CC) in Uruguay, both on the part of the general population and on the part of key organizations and stakeholders. It thus aimed to generate relevant inputs to develop a national engagement strategy for climate action. The study was divided in two independent modules targeting different populations, which were rolled out simultaneously between October 2020 and February 2021. A telephone survey was conducted to approach the general population, which was representative of the Uruguayan population over 18 years of age, a total of 1,500 people interviewed."

The Diagnosis of the Social Perception of the Impact of and the Response to Climate Change also included a qualitative approach applied to the specific sectors of interest, conducting 20 focus groups and 80 in-depth interviews. Their report summarizes the main findings.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our AccLab can bring new voices to contribute to the decision-making sphere, mapping diverse actors working in climate change and facilitating dialogue between citizens and public policies. We can get new alliances to the UNDP country office and new tools based on collaboration and co-creation processes. On the one hand,  we started working with a group of young activists in climate change to understand what they think, what is needed, how they imagine Uruguay in the future, and what we can do. The AccLab can facilitate the connection between UNDP projects, the government, NGOs, and other UN agencies for the sake of the climate action. On the other hand, we understand that much knowledge around academic research groups is not being considered for public policies. So, we also want to build bridges between knowledge generators and decision-makers in public policy.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We need new approaches to deal with climate change challenges. Therefore, we are working collaboratively with diverse groups of people that are not usually involved in decision-making but have a lot of knowledge, research, and practical work in climate action.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What can we learn from and with the youth, who are the ones who will experience the greatest consequences of climate change? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We plan to develop a co-creation process to involve youth in the "Climate Promise". We will implement a participatory methodology where young climate change activists can collaborate to co-create the most appropriate activity to listen to adolescents' perceptions and foster a collective intelligence approach.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Through focus groups with young people, we seek to know the opinion of young people about climate change and what possible solutions could be more successful when it comes to expanding the scope to greater awareness and dialogue with adolescents.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we achieve a more significant interaction between knowledge generators and decision/policymakers to climate action? How to promote creative ways that allow greater visibility and recognition of the climate actions carried out by various research groups that often go "under the radar" of public policy and UNDP? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will generate a space of work between teams from the Ministry of the Environment, the National Research and Innovation Agency, and the UNDP to co-create a pilot instrument that helps make visible and recognize climate actions unknown by the public policy.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Through the bibliographic analysis, publications, and public databases of research calls, we hope to identify different research groups in multiple areas of knowledge.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Sensing, Exploring and Testing these new ways of engaging with different groups (youth and researchers) could contribute to a new way of building public policy for climate action. Given the recent creation of the Ministry of the Environment, this scenario of pilot experiences could boost its growth to other Ministry policies or new ways of relating to public policy with the support of UNDP.
