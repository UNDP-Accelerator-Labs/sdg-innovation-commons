Fiji’s first community-managed pearl meat farm in Va’ulele village, Cakaudrove. Community members have taken ownership in operating their pearl meat farm throughout the COVID19 pandemic. The oysters are marketed as a luxurious culinary product. Supported by the Blue Action Fund, WCS Fiji, Pacific Community (SPC) and J. Hunter Pearls, this pearl farm project aims to improve livelihoods through supplementary income, support food security while promoting the sustainable use of marine resources.
