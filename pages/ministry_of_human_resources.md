Human resources are the greatest productive asset of any country as they are for any company. Bigger companies all have an HR department that comprehensively deals with all aspects of strengthening the human resource base from recruitment, to continued education to keeping the labor force in good health. At the level of national governments there typically is no comprehensive national HR strategy that addresses all components that range from demographic to health and education strategies. These aspects are dealt with by different ministries with often little collaboration. But health and education, for instance, are closely intertwined, with health problems making it more difficult to learn and more educated people typically choosing healthier life styles and staying in better health until very old age. Rather than only focusing on the institutions providing these services (as is currently done), the idea of new Ministry of Human Resources puts people and support for their comprehensive development and empowerment at the center of attention.
