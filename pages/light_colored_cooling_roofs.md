Infrastructural

> Description of the solution

Light-colored reflective roofs, another alternative to green roofs, can effectively cool interiors by redirecting sun rays and decreasing heat absorption. Examples include roofs with sheet coverings, reflective tiles or shingles, or reflective paint. Mediterranean or the Middle East show a townscape of light-colored buildings with white roofs. These have been traditional architectural characteristics for thousands of years ‚Äì and these roofs are in fact cool roofs. Although cool roofs are one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce indoor temperatures in summer.
