4- Blended learning with MoHESR: The ToT Blended learning workshop found insightful findings about blended learning approaches. The diverse academic backgrounds in the writing committee is enhancing systemic learning approaches. The importance of creating a safe and open learning environment, facilitated by strong relationships among participants. Furthermore, the participants' advanced facilitation skills, emphasizing a shift towards experiential learning methods. A significant need is identified for more knowledge in blended learning models and modern teaching techniques, along with enhancing participants' proficiency in educational technologies, such as Learning Management Systems and digital assessment tools.

5- In Iraq, a developing country, the lack of accurate, interactive data impedes ecosystem development, affecting government, private sector, and youth understanding of needs and solution innovation. Limited government data accessibility, data efficiency in new sectors, and a widening skill-market gap are key challenges. The UNDP Accelerator Lab aims to bolster Iraq's digitalization by supporting data-driven platforms, enhancing innovation ecosystem connectivity. This involves scaling up a digital platform "idata pltform" for interactive dashboards in entrepreneurship and education sectors, focusing on data-driven decisions, data source research, accuracy, categorization, visualization, and social media promotion to address these issues.
