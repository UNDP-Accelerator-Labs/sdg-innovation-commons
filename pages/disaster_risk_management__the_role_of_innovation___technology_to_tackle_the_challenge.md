Disaster risk management: The role of innovation & technology to tackle the challenge
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Mauritania, a country located in West Africa, is prone to various natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and sandstorms. These disasters can have devastating effects on the population, causing loss of human lives and economic losses (livestock, homes, fields, infrastructure, etc.). The impacts of disasters represent a major obstacle to economic growth and development.

Our challenge consists in exploring and identifying new sources of data not yet explored by the country office as well as new & innovative approaches to deal with risks related to disasters in Mauritania.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Natural disasters are mainly a consequence of the climate change impacts and its repercussions. For example, the country witnessed several draughts seasons, floodings and sandstorms. In addition, technological disasters cause equally significant damages to the country's infrastructure and hinder economic development.

The main actors involved in this challenge are the ministry of environment, Ministry of Interior, UNEP and National statistical bureau (ONS).

The current situation is that the country remains particularly vulnerable to natural disasters related effects. For instance, in 2013, floods caused severe damages to the country's infrastructures causing 2,3 million dollars economic losses according to the EM-Dat database. Draughts are recurrent disasters that have significant effects on people's livelihood and the economy. Not to mention, the substantial effect of technological disasters and the associated negative repercussions.

As stated above, the undesired effects are manifested through the economic losses, human life loss, livelihood effects etc.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

Among the identified official data sources, we can cite the EM-Dat data base which comprises essential information on disasters occurring in Mauritania since 1910. Also, the Lab explored the use of the satellite imageries' data to provide information on the issue.

Climate change is progressively affecting the development efforts in Mauritania and its repercussions are felt through the continuing floods and draughts. The Lab documented, during its last learning cycle, an urgent need to put in place an effective early warning and forecasting mechanism as well as a community-centered approach to identify challenges and find effective solutions.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The value added by the Lab is the identification of the sources of data, the exploration and analysis of the obtained data, suggestion and recommendation based on different exploration and mapping processes suggesting the importance of setting forth an early warning system based on reliable mechanisms of predictions and the importance of considering community-based approach in dealing with this challenge. For example, our interaction with the community and the human centered approach led us to suggest a relying on early warning system based on positive deviance observed in some communities who rely on animal behaviors and the sea level in monitoring the hazards likelihood.

This challenge highlights the role innovation can play to perspective in collaboration with all actors involved in the challenge from within UNDP as well as the national partners.

This challenge is considered a priority for the government given its substantial repercussions on the development efforts, people's livelihood and well as many other negatives externalities. This, in fact, justifies the worthiness to invest resources in this regard.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

The learning questions of this challenge are as follows:

- What is the degree of the gravity of the disaster’s effects on local communities?

- What are key sources of data that are essential to orient the decision-making process?

- Is it possible to anticipate and predict the hazards' occurrence probabilities based on historical data?

- Is it relevant to build a dashboard to recapitulate key information on disasters occurrences?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning was considered to analyze the satellite imagery data and to develop a classification method to identify the most impacted areas by floods. Also, we used programming techniques to build a dynamic dashboard using R programing language.

For behavior insights and positive deviance, we made use of our interaction with local communities to learn about their behaviors and techniques in anticipating disasters such as draught, sandstorms, floods etc.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is a substantial gap on disasters related data. The lab identified an open source of data which can be used to learn more about the frequency of occurrence as well as information on the disaster’s repercussions (caused deaths, injuries, economic losses etc.). Also, the Lab identified the importance of the use of satellite imagery data and highlighted the role that data science can play in providing more insights about the challenge.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Our work might be beneficial to national partners dealing with the issue of disasters management readiness and  data oriented informed decision making processes using reliable sources of data. That is the reason why the Lab elaborated an informative policy brief which highlights how the national partner can leverage the gains associated with our approaches and methods
