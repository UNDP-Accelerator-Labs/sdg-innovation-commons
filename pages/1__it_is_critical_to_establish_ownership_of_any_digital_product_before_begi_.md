## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. It is critical to establish ownership of any digital product before beginning its design and development 

2. Multiagency task force helped in avoiding duplication of efforts and in leveraging on their networks 

3. Feedback culture in Bhutan is low, hence conceited efforts are required in advocacy and awareness building

4. Everytime, service is integrated into the web-based service rating tool, it required a trial period and hence prolonged the experiment period 

5. It is important to reflect on the ethical compass of the tool to ensure that the digital tool is ethically viable

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. Taskforce members leaving before the end of the trial experiment 

2. Pandemic related restrictions

3. Establishing common ground in the initial period 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Since there was limited information on the feedback culture, ethnographic data was sourced through focused groups and in-depth interviews to understand why citizens were not providing feedback on service delivery. Anecdotal experiences from social media were also captured. The web-based service rating tool used behavioral nudge messaging to enhance adoption.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The tool was co-designed with citizens the main users of the services. These tools helped in understanding their experiences and mental model with regard to service delivery and feedback mechanism.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

A local innovator partnered with us to apply human centric approach in the tool/system design  

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Royal Civil Service Commission took lead in the experiment

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Local innovator helped in bringing in innovative approaches and in bringing diverse perspectives as oppose to the usual government agencies 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

None 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

It helped engage citizens right from the tool design to the experimentation phase. This helped in adoption of the tool and helped build a stronger feedback culture.
