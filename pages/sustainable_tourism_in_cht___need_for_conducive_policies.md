Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT. 


One of the key challenges identified is that there is a dearth of relevant local policies regarding tourism in the CHT region. For e.g., the rates of boat rides are not standardized, with different boats charging different amounts to tourists. Similarly, when tourists rent cars, there is no clarity regarding whether parking fee is included with the renting fee of the car, and when tourists are unprepared for these hidden costs and are charged different parking fees at different spots, it often creates resentment and can give them a negative tourism experience, discouraging future visits.


To address these concerns, policies can be developed to make such fees standardized and publicly listed. If there is a price list available, that can help increase transparency and enable the tourists to make informed decisions about the costs. Relevant good policies regarding tourism from other regions in the country could also be replicated in the CHT.
