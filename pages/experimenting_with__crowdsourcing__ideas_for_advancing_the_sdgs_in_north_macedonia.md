## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can we bring new ideas, ways of thinking and innovation into the public debate in North Macedonia on how to move the Agenda 2030 forward?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If UNDP solicits ideas from the public [particularly among communities that have vested interest in development policies: the media, civil society, academia, practitioners, youth] on how we can move the agenda 2030 forward, we can encourage the utilization of innovation, digitalization and new ways of thinking, financing, working to achieve the Goals.

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Open call for soliciting ideas to advance the SDGs in North Macedonia.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Number of interested applicants/essays.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

All data was collected through a civil society organization, that we partnered up with in the process.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

Three months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The original hypothesis has been proven.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

I would have loved to make this experiment on a more niche topic, including: societal polarization, or innovations for water governance in North Macedonia.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Three months from the design to the creation of the publication. With additional two months for organizing a launching event and promotional activities.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

6,000$

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

As a result of this activity, we are negotiating collaboration with the private sector and the academic communities on how to integrate SDGs in their line of work.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

This iteration of the experiment is a replication of an experiment we conducted in January - May 2023 while focusing on the theme: solidarity's renewed role in development.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

- Experimenting with crowd-sourcing ideas from the public is proving to be a useful engagement and programmatic tool for the UNDP country office.

- Experimenting with partnering up with think tanks in various development themes, for a co-creation journey of knowledge products is proving to be useful for UNDP to reach new audiences and prepare better knowledge products.

- Practitioners, Academics and Scholars appreciate the opportunity to be featured in UNDP led processes/knowledge products and are willing to undergo competitive processes in doing so.

- In-depth debates/discussions rather than ceremonial debates, are important for us to learn more about the innovations and key debates outside the UN system.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Peer reviewing the articles is always challenging, so in addition to the Lab, we invited the CSO we partnered up with to propose members of the selection/peer-reviewing committee.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Some of the important insights for UNDP from the launching event, include:

- Data, the lack of publicly available, open data is proving to be a challenge for researchers, that pursue projects that are adjacent to the Agenda 2030.

- Private sector, there are companies in North Macedonia that are doing a very good job in reporting for the ESGs, and we need to familiarize them with the SDGs. There are also some sustainable practices incorporated in companies, that we can build on, as good practices.

- Academia, there are almost no chapters/segments in academic curricula that focus on the SDG agenda. Universities are eager to team up with UNDP on creating content for their students.

-Journalists, the key battle journalists seem to be fighting is within their offices, when they want to report on stories connected to SDGs or development. Editorial teams usually prefer more click-intensive stories.

As for the publication itself, the topics and data shared in the publication, proved to be useful for programmatic purposes in the country office as well as other UN agencies.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Academia --&gt; incorporating SDGs in their curriculum,

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We have done two iterations of the experimental activities to crowdsource ideas from the general public. Once we focused on a theoretical argument, asking people to contribute ideas on how solidarity can enhance development. In this iteration we wanted more pragmatic and practical innovations on how to accelerate the SDGs in North Macedonia.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Ensure that the portfilio's in the county office provide insights for the open call, and include them from the design phase of the process.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, I think this experiment can be replicated in multiple development thematic areas.
