> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The local livestock feed enables locals to produce major nutrients content for their livestock, therefore increasing productivity which in return gives them more profit. This is a win win situation as the products are made locally (no GMOs). Products made are purely natural and healthy for livestock which in turn makes a nation and the world a healthy place. These products can be packaged in consumer's demands starting from as little as 1kg to 90kg. This gives everyone chance to take part in the same nutritional value.

> Technical Feasibility

The plan is to grow products of high nutrition value like soya beans and sunflower. Combining these yields with corn (maize) and fish products (grinded kapenta) will help a person in pottry business to thrive as not much money can be spent on procuring such products.
