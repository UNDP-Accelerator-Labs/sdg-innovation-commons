What is in the report?

This report provides 13 case studies of the collective
intelligence initiatives developed and run by the Accelerator
Labs in their first year of operation. It shows how the
Labs have started to use collective intelligence design to
accelerate work within complex systems (five case studies),
monitor the environment in real time to fill data gaps
(two case studies), create new forms of accountability and
governance (two early-stage case studies), and mobilize
distributed problem solving (four case studies, focusing
on the COVID-19 crisis). The case studies provide an
overview of what each Lab did and the methods used.
It summarizes some of the successes to be built on, and
common challenges to be addressed, as the Labs enter their
second year of implementation. This report accompanies
a second publication, Collective Intelligence for Sustainable
Development: Getting smarter together,1 which provides
an overview of the use of collective intelligence methods
within global development.

Who is this report for?

This report is for UNDP’s senior leaders, its regional
representatives and country office teams around the
world. It’s also for the Accelerator Labs themselves and the
funders and partners who helped make these initiatives
happen. Finally, we also hope it will be read by development
professionals from across the sector who are keen to learn
about the work of the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network in its
first year.

Methodology

The case studies were identified by reviewing public blogs
published by the Accelerator Labs that were tagged with
the following labels: ‘crowdsourcing’, ‘collective intelligence’
and ‘citizen science’. Additional examples were crowdsourced
using the Network’s internal knowledge management
platform. Shortlisted Labs took part in semi-structured
interviews via video and email with a Nesta researcher.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development
Foreword

4

The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a once-in-a-generation global swell of
home-grown ingenuity. Communities are adapting, improvising, and looking
beyond this unparalleled socio-economic challenge. Their responses have
included everything from a foot-operated handwashing machine invented
by a nine-year old boy in Kenya, to using the power of crowdsourcing to
rapidly produce 3D-printed Personal Protective Equipment, to tracking the
spread of the virus via a mobile app in Cabo Verde. The challenge now is how
to sustain and scale-up this unprecedented innovation surge to accelerate
progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Part of the solution
lies in harnessing the intelligence distributed across local communities and
organisations. That will help us to better understand complex problems
and unlock new solutions to immense global challenges – from tackling our
climate emergency to boosting the protection and restoration of our planet’s
precious ecosystems and biodiversity.

This collective intelligence approach is founded upon the principle that an
enhanced capacity to solve problems is created when people work together
through the mobilization of a wider range of data, ideas, and insights.
And advances in technology and data science hold the potential to tap into
collective intelligence on a larger scale than ever before. In this rapidly
evolving field, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has
teamed-up with Nesta’s Centre for Collective Intelligence Design to generate
a clearer vision of how collective intelligence approaches can speed up
progress on the SDGs. To this end, this new publication series, Collective
Intelligence for Sustainable Development: Getting Smarter Together analyses and
compares the methods and tools employed by over 200 private and public
sector organizations in this discipline. Collective intelligence is a core method
employed by the UNDP Accelerator Labs Network – the world’s largest and
fastest learning network on sustainable development challenges, which now
serves 115 countries. That includes, for instance, utilising real-time data
sources and ethnography to gain new insights into the first-hand experiences
of women and men who live on the frontlines of climate change. The
accompanying report, 13 Stories from the UNDP Accelerator Labs details more
of these pioneering approaches deployed by the Labs – from using big data
to improve waste management in Lao PDR, to combining multiple datasets
to tackle gender-based violence in Mexico.

The hands-on experience of the United Nations in every corner of the world
since the COVID-19 pandemic hit has acutely demonstrated how local
communities possess the bright ideas and capacity to tackle both local and
global, existential challenges. We now need to fully harness the knowledge
of the almost eight billion people on the planet – and disseminate their often-
surprising solutions and innovative approaches. The Collective Intelligence
for Sustainable Development series is more than a mere signpost on our
path to building the future of development. It serves both as an invitation
and a practical guide for local, national, and international development
practitioners to make increased use of real-time knowledge creation,
collective action and evidence-driven decision making. And ultimately,
collective intelligence will serve as a vital tool to help shape a greener, more
inclusive, and more sustainable planet.

Introduction

The UNDP Accelerator Labs

In January 2019, the UNDP launched a global Accelerator
Lab Network with a bold mandate: to embed collective
intelligence principles into sustainable development work
and to experiment with a wide range of methods. Starting
with ethnographers, data scientists and social innovation
teams across 78 countries, the Labs were envisaged as ‘the
world’s largest and fastest learning network on sustainable
development challenges’2 with a mission to rethink
development for the 21st century. Collective intelligence was
introduced as a core practice for the Network. Each team
received a basic introduction to collective intelligence, and
a playbook of tools and activities to help them design their
own experiments that used collective intelligence methods.
By establishing the Accelerator Labs, UNDP created a global
infrastructure to operationalize the testing and use of collective
intelligence for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

What is collective intelligence?

At its simplest, ‘collective intelligence’ can be understood
as the enhanced capacity that is created when people work
together, often with the help of technology, to mobilize
a wider range of information, ideas and insights (Figure 1).
Collective intelligence emerges when these contributions are
combined to become more than the sum of their parts.

Over centuries, every society has relied on collective
intelligence – sharing knowledge, culture and tools to better
manage crops, combat diseases, anticipate weather patterns
and much more.

Since the start of the digital age, however, collective
intelligence has really evolved. There are now thousands of
digital tools helping us to pool ideas in entirely new ways,
and connect people across huge distances. In the 19th
century, it took almost 70 years to crowdsource the 400,000
words that made up the complete first edition of the Oxford
English Dictionary. A modern-day equivalent, the English
Wikipedia, receives more than 1.9 edits per second and sees
about 200,000 new pages created per month.3

Figure 1
21-st century collective intelligence

By bringing together diverse groups of people, data and technology,

we can create a collective intelligence that is greater than the

individual parts in isolation. And by doing this, we can achieve

things far beyond what any individual human or machine could

achieve alone.

Digital technologies are also enabling us to generate new
sources of data. We can use satellite imagery or mobile
phone data, for example, to create new intelligence used
to inform collective action. Many of these new data sources
are generated through the ‘digital exhaust fumes’ of human
activity, or through the active contribution of volunteers.
Most of this new data is made useful by legions of people
helping to label the datasets that are used to train machine
models and to interpret their meaning.

Increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied
in combination with collective intelligence methods –
to augment and optimize the mobilization of human
intelligence. This is mainly through algorithms that increase
the speed and efficiency of data processing at scale. But
there are other emerging uses of AI, such as modeling and
visualization, which are helping to push the boundaries of
how groups work together to understand complex problems
such as rapid urbanization and the localized impacts of
climate change.

Combining the capabilities of people, data and digital
technologies for solving problems is the next frontier of
21st-century collective intelligence.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development

How this is done, however, matters as much as what is
done. To use collective intelligence well means being
informed by its fundamental key principles (see Figure 2).4
This includes a recognition of the need to draw on diverse
views and perspectives to come to better decisions, and
the need to be mindful of biases and power relations.
It also means acknowledging the importance of data
empowerment – enabling people to use data to advocate
for their rights, take collective action or hold governments
to account. As a practice, collective intelligence is informed
by many of the same values that have driven the use of
participatory decision making and action research involving
local communities in development since the Participatory
Learning and Action approaches of the 1990s. It’s critical to
hold on to these foundations even as technology and new
data sources change the way collective intelligence
is deployed.

Collective intelligence employs a wide range of different
methods. These range from deliberation to crowdsourcing
and web scraping (see the Glossary for a full list). Although
some of these methods remain relatively new to the world of
development, their use has been slowly increasing alongside
more traditional forms of intelligence, from official data to
ethnographic research.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development
Leveraging collective
intelligence for the
SDGs: the case studies

During the first full year of operation, the UNDP Accelerator
Lab Network experimented with a rich variety of collective
intelligence methods, tackling issues from depopulation
to waste management. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many
Labs started with relatively mature methods, such as
challenge prizes, geographic information systems (GIS),
crowdmapping and citizen science.

The availability of open tools and resources, and the
established communities of expert practitioners in national
innovation ecosystems, were important enablers. For
example, in Tanzania, the Lab used the OpenStreetMap
platform to carry out crowdmapping activities, while in
Argentina, the Lab partnered with a global citizen science
project to build DIY sensors for measuring air quality.
Other Labs experimented at the boundaries of collective
intelligence practice, exploring methods that have rarely
been tested in real-world settings. In Mexico, the Lab
launched two such initiatives that use exploratory data
analysis of open government data and non-traditional
datasets to evaluate what works in public sector spending
and programs.

The Labs’ first year coincided with the global COVID-19
pandemic, and many teams pivoted their portfolio to help
manage the impact of the crisis in their countries. Four of
the case studies presented here concern COVID-19-response
directly, while others had to adapt quickly as a result of
changing circumstances, for example by moving in-person
activities to online platforms.

Although it’s still early days, the Labs’ combined portfolio
of experiments in collective intelligence design provides
a glimpse of how collective intelligence approaches can
serve multiple purposes to advance the SDGs. Opposite,
we summarize the 13 case studies, grouped into four ‘use
cases’ – practical ways in which people are using collective
intelligence approaches to achieve ambitions relating
to the SDGs. In the pages that follow, we provide a brief
introduction to the main features of each use case, as well
as the detailed accounts of the relevant Labs’ initiatives.

countries, the scale of environmental issues and the pace

of change threaten to outstrip the monitoring resources
that currently exist.5 Collective intelligence methods like
citizen science and in-situ or remote sensing methods

are gaining traction worldwide amongst institutions

and researchers tasked with environmental protection.

Environmental monitoring projects led by citizens typically

bring together professional scientists and groups of local

volunteers, and sometimes use satellite or sensor data.

These partnerships between concerned citizens and

experts are particularly relevant for SDGs 11, 12, 14

and 15. They help to create more granular and up-

to-date datasets about the state of the environment,

which can inform the design of more locally responsive

interventions. By involving community volunteers in

collecting and interpreting data, they also help those

affected by pollution to see system dynamics and take

action against environmental degradation.

What was the benefit of using
collective intelligence for
this issue?

The main benefit is a more granular
understanding of air pollution. The
aggregated data was shared and discussed
with the Ministry of the Environment
and Sustainable Development and the
Buenos Aires City Government. Although
official air quality data has shown that the
city generally remains within the limits
recommended by the WHO, the citizen-
generated data helped to demonstrate
localized hotspots (such as traffic junctions)
where pollutants exceeded acceptable
levels. Using collective intelligence helped
the team to generate new data on air quality
cheaply and quickly. Since the pilot, officials
from the city administration and Ministry of
Environment and Sustainable Development
have worked with the project team to
explore other measurements that could be
obtained through citizen sensing, such as
noise and temperature.

Figure 3
An example of the maps generated by combining data
collected by participants.

What is the problem?

The WHO has estimated that around seven
million premature deaths globally are
caused by air pollution every year.6 Air quality
monitoring is important for ensuring that
pollution is brought down within limits that
are acceptable for health and wellbeing.
These measurements are typically supported
by expensive fixed-location sensors and
stations that sample at the macroscale level.
Although the data from these sensors is
very accurate, they are costly to maintain
and calibrate. They also fail to capture the
fluctuations in air quality across cities or the
typical exposures to pollutants as citizens
move around.7

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

Using participatory citizen science and low-
cost sensors, the Lab set out to understand
of differences in air quality across different
parts of Buenos Aires. The team established
a partnership with open-seneca,8 a
worldwide network of citizen science pilots
that measures air quality using low-cost
sensors.9 They ran two workshops where
80 local university students learned to
build the air quality sensors, helping them
to develop new skills and learn about
the impact of air quality on health. Each
sensor cost just US$150, in contrast to the
US$50,000 cost of official sensors. Then,
using an open call, the team recruited
20 volunteers to take part in the data
collection. Over a period of seven weeks,
these ‘citizen sensors’ collected data about
daily changes to air quality around Buenos
Aires by carrying the DIY sensors on their
bikes. Each user regularly uploaded their
data to the open-seneca platform where
it was aggregated to produce a city-level
visualization of air pollution (Figure 3).

11

What next?

The Lab has launched similar air quality
pilots in other cities across Argentina in
partnership with local authorities. These
include the provinces of Mendoza, Cordoba
and Tucuman. In these locations, citizen
science will be used to create a much needed
primary data source about air quality.

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

The project helped the Lab to understand
the value of identifying specific policy needs
early on in the project design to ensure
that the results of a project can be taken up

by the government. By working together
with the Ministry of Environment and
Sustainable Development, local governments
across Argentina, scientists and citizens,
they learned to tailor follow-on projects
according to the priorities of each location.
For example, in Buenos Aires they’ll use
temperature and humidity measurements
obtained by the sensors to design urban
‘climate corridors’, while in more rural
locations, they’ll focus on measuring the
impact of local practices such as open
burning on air quality. This is helping the Lab
to ensure that the data created through the
citizen sensors has a clear route to impact.

What was the benefit of using
collective intelligence for this
issue?

During the community meetings, the
regional groups developed the skills to
analyze open source data and use GIS
themselves. The GIS dataset provided a
starting point for the participants to develop
a shared understanding of open burning,
which catalyzed practical discussions about
what could be done. This has enabled them
to start taking action locally, tailoring their
plans to specific burning activity in their
regions. For example, the community of
Zasulska identified that the majority of
local fires occurred in corn fields, while in
Torchynska the data helped residents to link
open burning to agricultural and grass fields.
The Lab also crowdsourced the location of
367 previously unknown composting sites,
many of them maintained by individual
households or small groups. These were
integrated into the data dashboard to
help local activists assess their feasibility
as an alternative to open burning. While
incomplete, this data provides a starting
point for scaling citizen-led composting
practices that are otherwise excluded from
official statistics.11

What is the problem?

Open burning of waste is a widespread
practice in Ukraine, with deep roots in
culture, the agricultural economy and
household habits. Official reports estimate
that between 36,000-56,000 fires occur
each year with devastating impacts on
local air quality and the natural balance
of ecosystems. Burning waste also leads
to economic losses which can amount to
millions of US dollars.10 Despite the scale of
the problem, the government lacks granular
regional data about open burning or
insight into the uptake of sustainable waste
management practices, such as composting.

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

To better understand patterns of waste
management practices across the country,
the Lab set out to create an up-to-date map
of open burning and composting in rural
communities using a combination of open
satellite data with GIS and crowdsourcing. By
engaging with grassroots groups at all stages
of design and implementation, they hoped
to inspire regional groups to take action
against open burning in their communities.
Working with the Center for Innovations
Development, the team created a prototype
dashboard that visualized the data. The
dashboard was shared with community
groups over a series of ten online meetings
due to COVID-19 restrictions. The sessions
were attended by more than 200 members of
grassroots groups, as well as policy makers
from local authorities, with approximately 20
groups taking part regularly. Some meetings
focused on interpreting GIS data and using
open source tools, while others examined
the health impacts of open burning and air
pollution through group deliberation. The
team facilitated open discussions through
chat and video features, as well as using
collaborative workspaces for attendees to
document their understanding of the issue
and suggest solutions to specific problems.

14

Real-time monitoring of environmental conditions

What next?

The Ukraine Ministry of Environmental
Protection and Natural Resources Ministry
of Environment has expressed an interest
in using the open burning dashboard to
inform future programs on air quality and
disaster risk management. The team are
currently working with the government to
identify funding that would allow them to
scale up and integrate the prototype into
official monitoring infrastructures.

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

The team openly explored novel datasets
together with participants. Doing so,
allowed them to build trust on a sensitive
issue, while developing shared goals and a
collective understanding. This was notably
lacking when it came to official data sources,
which the community groups regarded
with suspicion. The team also noticed that
by moving the meetings online in response
to COVID-19 restrictions they substantially
increased diversity by bringing in people
from different sectors (civil society, and local
and national authorities and businesses) and
different parts of the country. Both written
and video contributions were more diverse, a
key design principle for collective intelligence,
which helped the Lab to facilitate more
informed and wide-ranging discussions.

produces more than 1,100 tons of waste
daily.12 Formal waste collection services
are provided by a mix of private and public
actors, and come with a charge to local
communities. It’s estimated that less than
a third of the city’s million residents access
waste management services, leading to
the dumping of waste and open burning.
Recently, the municipality has made efforts
to improve waste collection coverage and
introduced regulations that aim to curb the
use of harmful waste disposal practices.
However, open burning remains common
among residents, filling the streets of the
capital with thick grey smoke that causes
adverse environmental and health impacts.

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

The Lab wanted to use collective intelligence
to better understand what motivates
communities to burn their waste. Using a
combination of GIS mapping with satellite

data, ethnography and town hall discussions
in communities, they set out to create a
better understanding of open burning in
three villages around Vientiane. The team
first created an Air Quality Index with GIS
mapping to call attention to the effects
of open burning on air quality. Although
satellite images helped to highlight the
hotspots where burning takes place, the
team realized this gave no insight about the
reasons for the instead activity. Working
with the local NGO, Disadvantage Children
and Youth Development Association
(DCYA), the Lab tapped into 20 volunteers
to run community meetings that would
help to fill these data gaps. The Lab used
a combination of group deliberation,
ethnography and microsurveys to enrich
the mapping data with qualitative insights
about the drivers of waste behavior in the
villages. Working with community leaders,
they organized six town hall meetings about
waste management for the residents and
local authorities. During the meetings, the
villagers discussed their waste disposal
practices and the environmental impact of
open burning.

the problem space and create a shared
understanding for future action.

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

A key learning was the importance of
designing community-led data collection
efforts together with communities to
ensure solutions can be taken up locally.
In the early stages, the Lab was keen to
involve village residents in mapping local
open burning practices using a simple app.
However, after some initial prototyping they
discovered that most participants didn’t
have access to smartphones and were
reluctant to map burning events due to local
sensitivity around the issue. By partnering
with community leaders and the NGO,
DCYA, the team built relationships with
local residents over time, helping them to
overcome barriers of distrust, and surface
novel insights and potential solutions. This
demonstrates the importance of having
trusted intermediaries and expanding the
network of stakeholders that UNDP teams
typically work with.

What was the benefit of using
collective intelligence for this
issue?

The GIS mapping of open burning hotspots
provided up-to-date data about the scale of
the problem, improving existing official data
on community level waste management
practices. The interviews with local residents
surfaced gaps in the waste management
system that can be addressed by the
municipality, such as the need to reduce
the price associated with waste collection
and to extend collections to hard-to-reach
locations. Through community meetings
and microsurveys, the Lab learned more
about the frequency of open burning by
residents as well as their motivations for
continuing to do so. For example, residents
reasoned that it was difficult to bag certain
types of biomass, such as branches, grass
and leaves, so it was easier to burn them.
These insights helped the Lab and partners
to better understand some of the human
drivers behind the patterns of waste
accumulation in the community and the
open burning highlighted by the maps.
During town hall discussions, the team
discovered that some residents were already
using alternative waste disposal practices,
such as personal composting systems, to
help them manage their organic waste. Here,
collective intelligence helped to uncover a
locally appropriate solution. These types of
solutions can be overlooked when external
innovators work on a problem.

What next?

As a result, the village leaders and local
authorities are exploring options for
centralized composting sites at local
schools, which could serve multiple
households. Learning about novel data
sources and analyses used by the Lab
has proved particularly useful to UNDP
environmental experts. The insights from
this project have already fed into the wider
portfolio of environmental work being

Industries with Highest Out Migration from Serbia 2018 - Net Change

Working with complex systems

Serbia has one of the 10 fastest-shrinking
populations in the world, with an
18.9 per cent decrease in population
predicted between now and 205013 and
approximately 120,000 people reportedly
leaving the country each year to pursue
work opportunities in other countries. This
pattern of depopulation has a significant
impact on the country’s labor market,
through the loss of the youngest people
from the workforce and a growing deficit
among both high- and low-skilled workers.
By better understanding the education and
professional opportunities sought by the
approximately four million Serbians living
abroad, the government aims to develop
policies to stimulate their return in order to
bring their networks and skills back home.
Governments struggle to track the dynamics
of modern economic migration in a precise
way, especially when national statistics
offices rely on traditional and infrequent
data collection practices such as the census.

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

To overcome the limits of traditional
labor market data, the Accelerator Lab
used collective intelligence to map
and understand the drivers of outward
migration in real time. The team
integrated novel data (made available
by the World Bank) about Serbian users
of LinkedIn and Serbian language work-
related Google searches. The LinkedIn
data was anonymized to preserve privacy,
but contained valuable information about
the locations, industries and skills of
Serbian professionals.

The Lab also launched a data challenge
with a US$50,000 prize to surface other
unusual data sources that could reveal
further insights about the labor market and
depopulation, or triangulate the findings
from the other data. Winning ideas included

What next?

The team are currently exploring how these
insights can form part of a broader portfolio
to shape concrete policy interventions.
An example of this is using multilateral
agreements and incentives to encourage
the reciprocal exchange of medical
professionals between Serbia to Germany
and Austria. They’re also planning to create
a centralized platform to share the results
from the data challenge. The site will feature
multiple near real-time dashboards on skills

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

When tapping into private sector datasets,
it’s important to remain flexible and
anticipate what might be possible with a
‘minimum viable product’ approach. The
Lab spent many months exploring publicly
available LinkedIn datasets14, which were
limited in their granularity. Higher-level
aggregation of data helps to protect the
privacy of users of the platform, but also
prevents the disaggregation of results by
certain important characteristics, such as
gender and age. By refining their research
questions, they were able to get the most
value from the available data whilst avoiding
lengthy and expensive negotiations
with a private company. This highlights
the challenge of undertaking collective
intelligence projects that draw on both
proprietary and publicly available data.

What is the problem?

Mwanza is Tanzania’s second largest city
and one of the fastest developing urban
centers in sub-Saharan Africa. Official data
from the city administration estimates that
357 tonnes of solid waste are produced
by the city each day.16 The municipal
waste management system is supported
by four private companies who act as
aggregators and five community-based
waste collection services. However, the city
faces numerous challenges that threaten to
overwhelm the current waste management
system including low investment, a lack
of recycling facilities and the growth of
informal settlements with unmapped waste
management infrastructure.

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

The Lab used satellite data and
crowdmapping to create an overview
of the production and collection of
waste in Mwanza’s Buhongwa ward, a
peripheral neighborhood with many
informal settlements. They partnered with
OpenMap Development Tanzania (OMDTZ),
to run a virtual mapathon with ten local
university students using the Humanitarian
OpenStreetMap platform. Over multiple
sessions in the space of two weeks, students
labeled buildings, roads and waterways in
the Buhongwa ward, as well as identifying
possible trash sites. The resulting dataset
was verified by the team at OMDTZ.

What was the benefit of using
collective intelligence for this
issue?

Through the virtual mapathons, the Lab
generated a novel dataset about the
core infrastructure of Buhongwa ward,
mapping over 26,000 features such as
roads, waterways, buildings and trash
sites. The data has revealed the existence
of new buildings that had previously not
been registered by government officials.
This information is being used by the city’s
Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Authority
to add waste collection points to serve the
previously unmapped informal settlements.

What next?

The team has been using the OpenDataKit17
to enrich their data by mapping extra
features like the location of waste dumpsites
with local residents. Alongside this, they plan
to collect qualitative insights about residents’
perceptions and behaviors towards waste
through community meetings. This data will
be integrated into the existing infrastructure
map produced by the remote volunteers and
will help to inform the city’s future waste
management services.

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

Using the virtual mapathon approach and
an existing platform for task allocation,
the team were able to easily generate a
large amount of novel data in the space
of just one month, including labeling
and validation. Mapathons or short
duration ‘blitz’ methods are often used in
participatory science to help fill data gaps.
This can be a useful approach for collective
intelligence projects that don’t have, or can’t
maintain, long-term volunteer engagement.

Working with complex systems

In Viet Nam, the government has set the
target of recycling at least 15 per cent of
waste by 2025. However, most households
don’t separate their waste at source and
deposit both recyclable and landfill waste
together at roadside and official dumping
sites. Official waste management services
are provided by a complex ecosystem of
both public and private actors. But when
it comes to recycling, it’s the hundreds
of informal waste workers who make a
significant contribution helping to divert
waste from landfills across the country.
These workers, mostly women, separate
out materials such as cardboard, metal and
plastic from other waste and take them
to collection centers. Their contribution
remains largely invisible. This makes
it difficult for the government to fully
understand the recycling opportunities and
vulnerabilities of the waste management
ecosystem, which is vital for achieving its
policy target.

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

The Lab used participatory sensing, GIS
and field interviews of informal workers to
better understand their role in the waste
management system in Da Nang city.
The team recruited nine waste workers,18
attaching GPS trackers to their bicycles,19
to map the routes they took through two
districts: Hoa Vang (a rural district) and
Ngu Hanh Son (an urban district). A local
social enterprise, Evergreen Labs, helped
the team to add detail about local waste
infrastructure to these maps. This included
marking the locations of dumping sites
(both official and illegal), recycling collection
centers and larger waste aggregators.20
Conducting interviews with informal
workers also helped the team to understand
the concerns and drivers of behavior.

What was the benefit of using
collective intelligence for this
issue?

Overall, the team created 39 maps (see
Figure 5 for an example) of the waste-picking
routes. By marking 165 dumpsites and 56
aggregators on these maps, they created
the only overview of formal and informal
waste management infrastructure in the
surveyed areas. In combination with the GPS
route tracking, the data revealed that waste
workers covered official dumpsites, as well
as smaller alleyways and roadsides which
aren’t served by municipal collection services.
Through the interviews they discovered that
workers relied on ‘waste contacts’, such as
individual households and businesses who
reserved waste for them. Interviews also
brought to light the self-perceived upsides
of this type of work, notably the flexibility of
the job, which allows informal workers to fit
their work alongside other responsibilities,
such as caring for family. The data generated
was used to inform the ongoing work of
the UNDP’s Climate Change Unit, which
has partnered with women’s unions across
the country to create recommendations for
local politicians about integrating informal
workers into the official municipal waste
management system.

What next?

The team will use storytelling workshops
to share the findings of the study with the
informal workers who took part in the route-
mapping and interviews. These workshops
will bring informal workers who typically
operate independently, together with others
in the community, including local women’s
unions and scrap owners, to develop new
collective strategies for economic resilience.
This is an important step in collective
intelligence design: closing the feedback
loop to ensure data and insights empower
rather than extract. Looking towards scale,

incubator in Da Nang, to establish a new
hub for the circular economy.22 This initiative
will help to stimulate innovation that
addresses issues of waste management
and recycling more broadly across the country.

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

Making informal activities visible risks
increasing power disparities and tensions
between underrepresented groups and
official institutions. These challenges can
manifest in a reluctance to engage with
international organizations and provide
data or information. Initially, the Lab found
it challenging to recruit waste workers to
take part. They overcame this challenge by
creating incentive structures that appealed
to participants (small financial rewards)
and conducting interviews in collection
centers where the women typically took
their breaks. Adapting the design to suit
the routines of the workers made it easier
for them to participate, and helped build
relationships over time.

What is the problem?

The informal sector accounts for close to
90 per cent of the economy in Zimbabwe.
Due to its invisibility, informal economic
activity isn’t well understood, which makes
it difficult to mitigate against market
disruptions. For example, the country’s food
production and distribution industry has a
high proportion of informal actors including
growers, distributors and sellers. In the
wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Zimbabwe
faced sudden food shortages. But it was
difficult to identify the exact sources and
drivers of this disruption due to data gaps
about the ecosystem that supports food
production.

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

To draw attention to the informal economy’s
contribution to food supply chains, the
Lab used a combination of non-traditional
data sources and qualitative insights from
informal actors. The Lab worked with
three major national trade associations23
to obtain historical datasets on the volume
and pricing of food supplies to informal
markets. Although the associations held
many datasets about the daily changes to
market prices between them, the data was
not interoperable and hadn’t previously
been combined. The Lab combined this
data into an immersive virtual reality data
visualization24 to help communicate insights
about trends, market vulnerabilities and
associated behaviors more effectively to
decision makers.

The team also enriched this data with
insights from a qualitative survey of more
than 3,000 vendors, distributors and
suppliers from across the country. Using
the interactive voice tool, Viamo,25 they sent
voice response questionnaires to vendors in
three different cities in Zimbabwe (Mutare,
Harare and Bulawayo), as well as several
smaller border towns.

29

Working with complex systems

What was the benefit of using
collective intelligence for this
issue?

By combining these novel datasets, the team
were able to analyze trends and fluctuations
within the entire food supply ecosystem in
Zimbabwe. For example, they identified a
consistent annual trend of a drop in sales in
January, which emerged from surveying the
daily market transaction data at the national
level. In 2020, unlike previous years, this
seasonal decrease continued into March and
April due to the introduction of lockdown
measures, which further exacerbated the
loss of earnings experienced by vendors. The
data also helped the team to quantify the
market impact of droughts caused by climate
change on important crops, such as maize.
By making the data from different
associations interoperable, the team helped
to establish a new standardized data
infrastructure for understanding the value
chain of fresh produce. This data capture
system is the only overview of the food
production system in all its complexity. It
provides a foundation for trade associations
and politicians to continue tracking activity in
the future.

What next?

The team shared the visualized data26 with
the trade associations, vendors and policy
makers to help them better anticipate
regular changes in the market, as well
as emerging trends linked to crises like
COVID-19 and climate change. This has
led the Lab to design a broader portfolio
around urban food poverty, NextGenCities,27
together with government, local councils
and vendor associations. As part of this
program, they plan to make the data
capture system they developed for tracking
daily market prices openly accessible.
They’ve also shared their experience of
working on this issue with Lab colleagues
in Eswatini and Botswana to explore scaling
the model to neighboring countries.

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

It’s difficult to build communities or
establish new networks from scratch, and
often it isn’t necessary. Partnering with trade
associations helped the Lab to gain the trust
of informal workers who they struggled
to engage with in the initial phases of the
project. The partnerships also extended
their reach geographically, allowing them to
generate insights using national scale data
across a range of different locations. For
collective intelligence to succeed, tapping
into existing coalitions and networks
generates meaningful insights and change.

What is the problem?

From the early weeks of the COVID-19
pandemic, it became clear that the impacts
would be widespread and long lasting.
In Bosnia & Herzegovina, there were no
existing online spaces for public discourse
or to coordinate civil society responses
to the pandemic. This made it difficult for
those working in the public and private
sectors to understand the priorities of
citizens and where solutions were most
needed or relevant.

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

The online ideation platform,
CovIDEJA2020,29 was launched by the
Accelerator Lab in April 2020. Its purpose
was to mobilize citizens to contribute novel
solutions to COVID-19-related issues that
could be implemented within a short time.

The Lab partnered with 28 organizations,
including local IT companies, international
organizations (such as Deloitte) and the
Ministry of Environment and Tourism. They
invited ideas across 14 different topic areas
ranging from economic interventions to
help citizens manage the crisis, to health
interventions and social support. Members
of the public could submit ideas over a
period of two weeks and all ideas were
ranked by both an expert jury and a public
vote through online voting.

The final selection was made by combining
the choices of experts and citizens to ensure
that winning ideas were both viable and
popular. Of the 109 ideas submitted, six were
selected to receive a financial reward and
tailored support towards implementation,
including mentorship from industry partners
and pitching sessions to country-wide
innovation networks. Several of the winners
were invited to participate in the UNDP Boost
Innovation Accelerator Program, to support
their professional development.

What was the benefit of using
collective intelligence for this
issue?

The winning ideas included a novel
approach to vaccine development, a mask
recycling scheme and apps that supported
the delivery of education and mental
health services. Using this open innovation
approach helped the Lab to surface existing
solutions that could be transferred to
the COVID-19 context (e.g. a new vaccine
technology previously developed for
tuberculosis). It also helped them to support
ideas which addressed the problems that
really mattered to citizens. For example,
the team that pitched to develop D-App – a
mental health support platform – identified
the need to support citizens’ mental health
long before the subject attracted the
attention of policy makers. D-App30 was
launched in late 2020, facilitated by the
attention, funding and mentoring that they
received through CovIDEJA2020. In the first
month, D-App attracted 1,500 active users
and facilitated 250 successful connections
between people and therapists in the
region.

collaboration hub for the public. Some of the
partners have continued to work with the
winners on developing their ideas. This is
the case for Sharklab Center for Marine and
Freshwater Biology who are supporting one
of the winners, Dženan Kovačić, to carry out
proof of concept experiments on the efficacy
of his vaccine technology. Building on their
experience of the ideation challenge, the
Lab has started to use collective intelligence
more widely across their portfolio. For
example, since CovIDEJA2020 they created
a public awareness campaign that used
crowdsourcing to design public health
messages about the disposal of infected
materials, e.g. face masks.

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

Approximately two thirds of all 70 entries
were submitted in the ‘Act Now!’ category
rather than the future-facing ‘Re-imagine
the Future’. This suggests that citizens may
be especially motivated to propose solutions
for immediate problems whose effects are
already being felt.

CovIDEJA2020 also helped the Lab to learn
about the challenge of negotiating longer-
term support from their partner organizations
upfront. Sustainability support for the
innovators remains a challenge. While all of
the CovIDEJA2020 partners were surprised
at the high quality of the ideas and the
popularity of the competition among citizens,
only a few of the partner organizations
committed resources to supporting winners
beyond the initial prize funding. Defining
impact pathways together with partner
organizations in advance could help to ensure
that more winning ideas are taken up.

What was the benefit of using
collective intelligence for this
issue?

Some of the winning designs came from
unexpected sources such as students,
DIY makers, a doctor and a taxi driver. By
working with industry partners, the team
were better able to identify production
constraints and the viability of proposed
solutions in order to support the winning
teams to develop their proposals. Following
the completion of the challenge, the Life
Helmets platform was turned into a hub
for sharing open source designs and a
marketplace for the winning solutions.31
Members of the public and companies use
the platform to buy and sell face shields
for personal use. UNDP Colombia has
purchased and distributed more than 27,000
face shields across the country, including in
remote locations where communities have
struggled to access PPE.

What is the problem?

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic,
the Colombian government introduced
strict lockdown measures to curb the
spread of the disease. These measures had
significant socio-economic impacts, but the
country had a shortage of PPE, especially
face masks, making it difficult to return to
economic activity.

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

To address this issue, the Lab set out
to prototype robust, closed face shields
that could be produced and distributed
quickly. This helped lockdown measures
to be relaxed, reduced the spread of the
disease and created new supply chains to
establish a PPE market. To surface the best
designs from a wide range of innovators
in the shortest time, the team organized a
challenge prize. The Life Helmets Challenge
was a collaboration among government,
the maker community, academia and
industry partners through a dedicated
online platform. After launching the
prize, innovators had ten days to submit
their ideas. To ensure widespread and
diverse participation, the team used a
communication campaign across social
media channels and targeted mailing lists,
as well as online demonstrations and FAQ
sessions. They invited ideas for PPE for
five target groups: medical staff, patients,
homeworkers, children and the broader
population, and ran two rounds of the
challenge over four months. They received
more than 400 proposals.

What next?

The success of the challenge prize model
for COVID-19 response has been recognized
by external stakeholders, including the
Peruvian government and USAID, who
have sought advice from UNDP about
implementing similar initiatives. The team
is also mapping regional manufacturing
chains to support the production of life
helmets and other PPE by small suppliers
throughout the country and to ensure more
even distribution.

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

When organizing challenge prizes in
response to a crisis, it can be tempting to
prioritize speed rather than taking time to
research evaluation criteria or provide
up-front guidance about intellectual
property. The Lab learnt that getting this
right at the outset helps to improve the
quality of submissions and increases the
likelihood that solutions will be taken up in
the long run. Communicating clearly about
selection and evaluation processes is also
important for maintaining participation and
ensuring that participants’ expectations are
aligned to the project goals. There’s also an
opportunity to scale up good ideas that come
from challenge prizes. The key to achieving
this is developing shared infrastructures
and practices for the innovation community
that forms around the prize, so they start to
become a peer-to-peer network.

What is the problem?

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic,
Ecuador, like many of its neighbors, faced
significant shortages of PPE to protect
healthcare workers due to the increased
demand and lack of local suppliers.32 At the
same time, workers in Ecuador’s informal
sectors, including seamstresses, struggled
to generate income. In Quito, these workers
found it difficult to adapt their skills to the
changing circumstances and struggled to
find new sources of work.

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

Together with the social entrepreneurship
DIY Club and 27 local seamstresses, the Lab
helped to establish an online peer-to-peer skills
exchange program across Quito. The group
was largely self-organized and peer-led, with
members running virtual training sessions
for one another to diversify their skillsets,
as well as supporting each other by sharing
sewing materials and tools. In the early
days of the program, the group received
guidance on producing clothing compliant
with biosafety standards to enable them to
contribute to the pandemic response. They
distributed the work amongst themselves
using microtasking arranged through
their WhatsApp group. Over the first four
months of existence, the group members
initiated and ran 16 virtual training sessions,
amounting to 90 hours of upskilling through
peer learning.

What was the benefit of using
collective intelligence for this
issue?

In return for a small financial incentive from
the UNDP, the group produced 800 full sets
of biosafety-compliant PPE, helping to fill
a vital supply gap in the early days of the
pandemic when Ecuador’s healthcare system
was overwhelmed.33 This PPE was donated
to local hospitals. The group went on to

39

produce over 2,000 face masks, which are
being sold online, and they have become
providers to the UN System. In addition
to exchanging skills and resources, they
provided social support for each other when
individual members faced adversity and
health challenges due to the pandemic.
By working closely with the group, the
Lab became aware of additional barriers
that informal workers and small-scale
entrepreneurs face which prevent them
from securing stable work. These include
the inability of workers to fulfill large orders
at short notice or absorb out-of-pocket
payments for large quantities of materials
before delivery, as well as invoicing limits for
workers classified as ‘artisans’. The group
shared upfront material costs and negotiated
for changes to the contracting thresholds.

What next?

Following the completion of the initial
training scheme with DIY Club, the members
co-founded the textile association ‘Without
Borders’ in order to improve their long-term
sustainability as a community of practice. The
Accelerator Lab and DIY Club have extended
the scheme to support a second group
whose economic security was also badly hit
by the pandemic, ‘Mujeres de Frente’ – an
existing network of vulnerable women.

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

The project helped the team to mobilize
skills and assets that were already available
in the community. By working with the DIY
Club and informal (and otherwise invisible)
communities of practice, the Lab discovered a
source of skills that was vital to the pandemic
response. Using collective intelligence also
ensured that they foregrounded the design
principle of empowerment, so they not only
addressed the PPE shortage but also helped
the seamstresses to establish an association
for longer-term economic viability.

What is the problem?

For many years, international development
organizations and civil society actors in
Guinea-Bissau have struggled to coordinate
actions in their efforts to support local
communities and strengthen social cohesion.
The absence of a dedicated space for this
exchange to take place was particularly
evident during the early months of the
COVID-19 pandemic, where stakeholders
struggled to understand local needs and to
map existing grassroots efforts to mitigate
the impacts of the pandemic.

What did the UNDP Accelerator
Lab and partners do?

The UNDP established the Na Nô Mon
platform34 as a shared resource to help
international and local development actors
identify unmet needs across the country.
It also functions as a coordination tool for
more effective response to the pandemic
and in the longer term. There are close
to 400 individual members, representing
around 100 civil society organizations (CSOs)
and grassroots associations. The platform
provides up-to-date guidance on COVID-19,
and allows members to engage in dialogue,
though community rooms. Members can
also share resources and events related to
sustainable and inclusive development.

When setting up the platform, the UNDP
deliberately worked with organizations
with ties to underrepresented groups
across the nine regions of Guinea-Bissau.
For example, the team partnered with the
National Network of Youth Associations,
RENAJ, to help deliver training on the use
of the platform and build engagement with
younger people and communities at large. By
partnering with the women’s radio in Bafatá
they increased the participation of younger
women. The platform has also been used as
a coordination hub for a small grants scheme
that supports grassroots innovations. This
has helped grassroots groups, who are

41

Distributed problem solving

otherwise isolated, to connect to a wider
community of innovators, while getting more
visibility and recognition for their work.

What was the benefit of using
collective intelligence for this
issue?

In only the first six months, the platform
became a community hub and resource
center to support civil society action across
Guinea-Bissau. Members of Na Nô Mon
have mapped COVID-19 response case
studies from different parts of the country
and these are shared on the Solutions
section of the platform to be searchable by
others. The platform lists the expertise and
interests of members, helping individuals
and organizations working in development
to establish collaborations with others
more easily. In August 2020, the platform
was used by 22 CSOs to convene a ‘Civil
Society Forum for Consultation’. This series
of online and in-person dialogues aimed to
create a common agenda and principles for
collaboration – both during and beyond the
pandemic.

Distributed problem solving

A central town hall (Djumbai) was held in the
capital city and groups from other parts of
the country contributed to the discussions
via the Na Nô Mon platform and Zoom.
Using the platform meant that voices from
different regions across the country were
included in discussions and prioritizing
issues. This resulted in the publication of
a Common Agenda for Peace and Stability
in December 2020 – which represented
diverse views and had multilateral buy-in.
For example, participants from regions
outside the capital drew attention to local
challenges, such as conflicts arising from
limited socio-economic opportunities or the
use of rural lands. The Common Agenda for
Peace and Stability is now being used by the
members to guide their interventions.

What next?

As a result of creating the most complete
open repository of COVID-19 response
efforts in Guinea Bissau, the team has
been praised by the country’s High
Commissioner responsible for pandemic
responses. The Commissioner’s office
has invested US$250,000, through the
African Development Bank, for the team
to allocate small grants for members and
projects identified through the platform.
Additionally, the recently launched
Accelerator Lab has continued to expand
the Solutions section of Na Nô Mon by
working with local NGOs to geo-tag and
map community projects throughout the
different regions of Guinea-Bissau.

42

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

Before creating the platform, the team
spent many months building relationships
with other international and civil society
organizations to establish a common
foundation of trust and collective goals.
This was vital for understanding the needs
of the community and securing buy-in
from those who were expected to use
the platform. The process highlighted
the challenge of introducing collective
intelligence approaches without a shared
understanding and the capacity to deliver
collective intelligence within the local
development ecosystem. Committing
to a robust training and dissemination
program, using a network of 18 community
advocates, has helped to address this.
Throughout the training sessions, the
UNDP also collected feedback about the
accessibility of the platform, which has
been used to continuously improve the user
experience for Na Nô Mon members.

What is the problem?

In Mexico, more than half of the homicides
of women in 2019 (52 per cent) occurred in
public spaces.36 High rates of femicide have
drawn increased international attention.
In the face of this growing problem and
public pressure, the Government of Mexico
City declared a public alert about GBV in
November 2019.37 Following the alert, it
worked to increase the safety of public
spaces in the city by introducing safer public
pathways and panic buttons to encourage
reporting of incidents. The impact of these
different interventions on rates of violence
in the city is still unclear and policy makers
are keen to understand where they have
proved most successful.

What is the UNDP Accelerator
Lab planning to do?

In collaboration with GIZ Data Lab and GIZ
Mexico, the Lab is combining open data
about urban infrastructure (such as public
transport) with closed government datasets
about the use of new panic buttons. They
hope this will lead to a better understanding
of the urban characteristics associated
with GBV in public spaces across Mexico
City. They will also work with datasets
that tap into residents’ perceptions of
urban safety, such as sentiment analysis
of social media and crowdmapping with
local women’s groups. By mobilizing these
different sources of intelligence, they will
test whether collective intelligence can
help them to identify the urban spaces
where women are safest (using a method
known as data driven positive deviance38).
Cross-correlating their findings with the
known locations of the government’s safer
pathways will also help the government to
evaluate which policy measures have been
most successful, in order to guide future
interventions.

New forms of accountability and governance

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

The Lab has benefited from the
government’s long standing support of
open data practices and existing data
infrastructure within the public sector.
However, negotiating a Memorandum of
Understanding for the use of non-public
government datasets can still take many
months. To overcome this, the Lab has started
by working with open datasets to develop
a proof of concept (see Figure 8). Thinking
creatively about how they can already work
with existing available data, as they wait to
finalize data sharing agreements, has given
the team flexibility and time to experiment
with new methods.

New forms of accountability and governance

What is the problem?

In 2010, the Mexican government
introduced a performance evaluation
system across all departments to keep track
of the impact of public programming and
spending. The system, based on the Logical
Framework methodology from USAID, is
intended to increase accountability and
improve results of public service delivery.
Over the years it has been used by civil
servants across the government to keep
track of their progress against a set of
indicators unique to each public spending
initiative. The evaluation includes open
text entries where civil servants write a
brief justification to account for goals that
weren’t met. To date, there has been no
analysis of this rich text dataset which spans
many different public services over the last
ten years – despite its potential to surface
novel insights about common barriers to
implementation which could improve the
design of future programs.

What does the UNDP
Accelerator Lab plan to do?

The Lab is mining the text entries using
NLP40 to cluster and rank dominant themes
across this vast public service dataset.
By training an AI model to compare text
entries with a set of predefined common
causes and identify novel themes, they’re
aiming to improve the reporting process for
civil servants in the future. The algorithm
is enabling them to analyze and make
use of civil-servant generated data that’s
otherwise too unstructured for centralized
analysis. Eventually the team hopes to build
a hybrid collective intelligence model, where
the quality of evaluations is improved by
combining NLP classification and inputs
from civil servants in real time.

What does this experience tell
us about collective intelligence
design?

Tackling a complex problem, like improving
the effectiveness of government policy
implementation, isn’t something for which
there is a single silver bullet solution.
The text-mining process will help the
government to extract lessons at a speed
and scale that was not previously possible.
However, it will need to be implemented
alongside other efforts (such as changes
to the user interface of reporting software)
to make the existing program evaluation
system more effective. This will help to
ensure that the insights from the model
are integrated into the machinery of
government and affect future program
design. The Lab is already considering how
to achieve this. Ideas include involving
civil servants in verifying the model and
developing skills across government teams
to enable them to work with the new system
in the long term.

Seven key takeaways
from applying collective
intelligence

If we hope to get closer to
achieving the global goals
over the next decade, it will
be necessary to mobilize
intelligence of all kinds to better
understand problems, broaden
the range of effective solutions,
and implement new ideas more
effectively. Collective intelligence
design offers a varied toolbox
to help the development sector
make progress on the SDGs.
The 13 case studies described in
this report offer many lessons
for challenges to watch out for,
as well as how to overcome
them. We summarize the main
takeaways that cut across the
case studies, as well as the
lessons learnt by the UNDP
Accelerator Lab Network.

48

Working with people
to create change

Move beyond the usual
suspects to build
new coalitions for the SDGs

The Accelerator Labs have demonstrated the
benefit of engaging with existing networks
to expand the potential reach, quality and
impact of their collective intelligence efforts.
For example in Zimbabwe, by partnering
with trade associations, the Lab was able
to make visible the contributions of 20,000
informal workers in the food production
value chain from all across the country.
Prior to this, the team had struggled to
connect with informal vendors in local
markets in Harare. Many other Labs have
also worked with intermediaries who
already had established relationships with
local communities. This may be particularly
important for collective intelligence design
efforts that involve vulnerable communities
and where the engagement is short term,
remote, or there is little time to build trust.

The Labs have also worked effectively with
CSOs to leverage specific technical skills.
In Ukraine for example, the Lab worked
with an NGO who had experience of data
visualization, while in Tanzania, the Lab
partnered with an organization who had the
expertise to support an online mapathon
with local students.

The Labs have also gone beyond the usual
suspects to tap into new sources of innovation
skills. For example, when working on the
Life Helmets Challenge in Colombia, the
Lab engaged with local maker communities
to help them attract individuals with the
necessary skills. And in Argentina, the Lab
connected with an existing open source

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development
hardware community to support students
building DIY sensors. Mobilizing new networks
and partnerships is critical for tapping into
diverse sources of distributed know-how to
drive collective action for the SDGs.

Combine ‘big’ data and
‘thick’ data for contextualized
insights

Official data can lack granularity of insight
and can often be out of date. Novel sources
of data, such as satellite data, can help
address this. As the Labs found, however,
big data might help you see patterns in
what is happening, but it might not help
you understand why. Collective intelligence
methods can bridge these gaps by
generating both quantitative measurements
and qualitative insights that offer
complementary perspectives on an issue.

In Lao PDR, for example, the Lab analyzed
satellite data to help map open burning
hotspots. However, this data missed the
reasons behind the persistence of open
burning in these locations, many of which
were served by municipal waste collection
services. To fill these gaps, the team
supplemented the data with ethnographic
methods, including observations and
interviews, as well as discussions during
community town halls. In Vietnam, the Lab
used on-the-ground GPS sensing to map
routes taken by informal waste workers
in combination with interviews about
the barriers they faced and patterns of
working. This helped the team to better
understand their contributions to the waste
collection system.

Embracing new ways
of working with data

Use novel data and technology
to help build relationships and
trust with communities

Grassroots communities can often question
the motivations of institutional actors and the
credibility of official data. While this challenge
applies to development initiatives more
broadly, it’s especially critical when it comes
to the collective intelligence methods, which
by definition rely on mobilizing insights and
action with, and by, communities.

As the Labs discovered, involving
communities in generating and analyzing
data can establish a shared and objective
source of facts about an issue. This can
help stakeholder groups to build trust and
then propose solutions, with communities
taking ownership of the results. An example
of this is the collective intelligence work
carried out by the team in Ukraine. The
digital dashboard visualizing the locations
of open burning from satellite images was
considered a more trustworthy data source
by community members than official reports.
The Lab worked with rural communities to
interpret this data, leading to new insights
about how open burning patterns varied
regionally. By learning how to work with the
data themselves, these communities had
more faith in its accuracy and were motivated
to take action as a result.

This experience is also echoed in Cambodia,
where the Lab found that the accelerated
adoption of digital tools like Miro, due to
COVID-19 restrictions, enabled more diverse
people to take part in meetings. In addition,
anonymous participation led to a higher
quality of contributions.

49

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development
Establish responsible data
stewardship and remain flexible
during data partnerships

Building pathways
to impact

Emphasize the potential of
collective intelligence for agile
policy-making and program
design

A number of the UNDP Accelerator Labs
have demonstrated the value of collective
intelligence approaches to inform more
agile, localized and responsible governance.
In Tanzania, for example, the team set out
to understand the waste management
practices in a semi-rural ward of Mwanza
city, which had seen a rise of informal
settlements as a result of urbanization.
By using crowdmapping they created an
up-to-date map of the infrastructure of this
fast-changing neighborhood and identified
potential sites of waste accumulation.
These maps are already being used by the
city’s Urban Water Supply and Sanitation
Authority to understand how to adapt their
waste collection services. Ukraine’s Ministry
of Environmental Protection and Natural
Resources is now aiming to scale the Lab’s
data dashboard for open burning as a
monitoring tool for estimating air quality
and disaster risk. In Argentina, officials
from the city administration and Ministry of
Environment and Sustainable Development
are planning to use the temperature and
humidity measurements obtained by the
sensors to design urban ‘climate corridors’.
Although these examples are still at early
stages, they provide a glimpse of how
the Labs are helping governments make
complex systems visible and understand
problems closer to real time – enabling
them to respond more effectively to
localized issues.

Negotiating access to private sector and
other closed data requires high levels
of technical proficiency and can take
many months. Involving communities or
volunteers in data collection complicates
considerations around privacy and ethics.
These common challenges can be off-
putting for organizations lacking in-house
expertise, and steer them away from
experimenting with some of the most novel
data-driven collective intelligence methods.

Some of the Labs have demonstrated the
viability of creative solutions for overcoming
these data partnership challenges. For
example, the team in Mexico started working
with publicly available datasets to develop
a proof of concept while they negotiated a
memorandum of understanding with the
government. In Serbia, the Lab reprioritized
research questions to avoid making requests
for sensitive or personal information,
allowing them to work with publicly available
LinkedIn data.

When collective intelligence initiatives work
with underrepresented or vulnerable groups,
they need to take extra care that data
collection isn’t extractive and is designed
to benefit the communities involved. In
Lao PDR and Viet Nam, the Labs worked
with underrepresented communities and
invested significant resources in outreach
and engagement. This is an important
aspect of creating a collective intelligence
design and shouldn’t be skipped. Experience
also shows that partnering with trusted
intermediaries (such as in Zimbabwe where
the Lab worked with trade associations)
can also be an effective route. Developing a
central or regional support function for data
stewardship that can provide guidance about
different models for data partnerships and
ethical data practices, may encourage local
teams to work with new data sources.

50

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development
Develop clear ‘hand-off’
mechanisms and routes to
impact for prototypes

Many of the Labs have focused on creating
prototypes using new methods. Some of
these have generated interest from their
national governments who have taken
them on or are helping to scale what was
developed. A good example of this is in
Argentina, where the Lab has worked with
both national and city level governments
to adopt citizen sensing for environmental
monitoring. Clearly identifying a ‘sponsor’
within the UNDP or government from the
outset, and ensuring those stakeholders’
needs are factored into the design from the
get-go, may help increase the likelihood that
insights or prototypes find traction.

In Argentina, the Lab adapted the design
of citizen science activities to collect
environmental measurements that were
more relevant to local urban planning
decisions. In other cases, the prototypes
have been taken up by the UNDP country
office. For example in Zimbabwe, the
analysis and visualizations produced by
the Lab are being used to adapt the ways
the country’s long-running Resilience
Building Fund41 works with data for
annual reporting. While in Viet Nam, the
Lab chose the locations for their waste
management project in collaboration with
UNDP environmental experts. This ensured
that the resulting insights could be used
to complement the ongoing work of the
Climate Change Unit in these districts.

However, many of the case studies weren’t
developed with a clear path to adoption
or use. This is a common challenge for
innovators tasked with socializing new
methodological approaches.42 The Labs
could overcome this by spending more time
upfront articulating the change they want to
create and involving key stakeholders early
in the design phase.

Invest in building capacity for
the wider ecosystem

The most successful collective intelligence
initiatives within the UNDP Accelerator Lab
Network have been achieved by partnering
with local NGOs who already have some
methodological expertise in working with
non-traditional data sources or participatory
methods. For example, in Ukraine and
Tanzania, both waste management projects
depended on GIS expertise provided by
their local civil society collaborators. Other
Labs turned to experienced researchers
based at universities, working with them
on a consultancy basis. This was the route
taken by the team in Viet Nam to tap into
GIS expertise and by the team in Mexico
to identify an NLP researcher. These cases
highlight the challenge that Labs face when it
comes to finding appropriate skills. The Labs
have also found it necessary to invest time in
helping to build understanding of collective
intelligence amongst the organizations and
stakeholders they work with.

For collective intelligence methods to thrive,
the entire development sector will need
to invest in developing these 21st-century
innovation skills locally, as well as across
borders. One potential source of future
talent is students. In Tanzania, Lao PDR and
Argentina, the Labs all incorporated training
and workshops with local students into their
project designs, so students could then
undertake crowdmapping and ethnography,
and build DIY air pollution sensors. Involving
groups of students helped the teams to
complete vital project tasks, including
data collection and hardware assembly,
whilst helping to build future capacity in
the local ecosystem. UNDP country teams
and Accelerator Labs should continue to
cultivate skills in-house, as well as providing
external training and workshops on collective
intelligence methods. This will expand the
pool of opportunities for collective intelligence
methodologies to be applied at scale.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development
Three lessons at
the network level

Aligning cultures and
incentives for procurement
and reporting

Sharing learning
throughout the Network,
and beyond

The Labs were set up to work in an
experimental and exploratory way. This
has at times conflicted with the UNDP’s
standard project management and budget
setting processes, which work on the basis
of pre-approved annual plans. Complex
procurement and partnership processes
have sometimes made it harder for the
Labs to move fast or flexibly with projects.
Likewise, standard impact reporting
measurements – designed for traditional
development projects – aren’t necessarily
relevant for small teams working at speed,
primarily generating new insights. These
challenges aren’t unique – they’re faced by
nearly all innovation teams working within
established bureaucracies. It may not be
feasible to redesign all aspects of UNDP’s
established systems and processes for
the Labs, but UNDP should be prepared
to have an honest conversation about
the tensions. Collaboratively reappraising
existing rules and procedures to enable
innovation cultures to flourish should be
rewarded and recognized.

Across the Network, the Labs are
experimenting with a wide range of
methods and sharing their experiences as
they learn. This is enabling the Labs to fast
track the uptake of collective intelligence
methods throughout the Network, as well
as within the wider ecosystem of actors and
partners with whom they collaborate.

Regular global meetings of Lab teams,
shared internal repositories and
WhatsApp groups have enabled insights
to be exchanged and successful collective
intelligence interventions to be replicated –
particularly in countries from the same
region. For example, Labs in Western
Balkans and Eastern European countries
that face similar depopulation challenges
have been learning from Serbia’s experience
of combining novel data sources to map
regional trends. Meanwhile, lessons from
the experiments started in Zimbabwe on
the informal economy were shared with
neighboring Eswatini and Botswana.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development
Collective intelligence is a
mindset that can be learnt

Embedding collective intelligence methods
within development organizations requires
developing new skills, capabilities and
mindsets. The experience of the UNDP
Accelerator Labs over their first 12 months
demonstrates that these can start to form
relatively quickly when practitioners are
given an institutional mandate.

Lessons from the case studies in this report
and beyond show that collective intelligence
skills aren’t necessarily about just developing
deep expertise in one method. They require
an openness to explore a range of methods
and work with a broader mix of partners to
bring in more diverse perspectives and new
forms of data to solve problems.

During our research, we also uncovered
a broader suite of collective intelligence
practice being implemented across the
Network as part of daily operations.
For example, the team in Cambodia
has delivered online multi-stakeholder
workshops, where participant identities
were anonymized to encourage equal
contributions. While in Pakistan, the Lab
uses both online analyses and offline
ethnographic methods to carry out ‘deep
listening’ to diverse voices. This helps them
shape their projects based on the needs and
priorities that are revealed. These activities,
and many others across the Network, don’t
reach the scale of the case studies described
in this report, but they demonstrate that
when it comes to collective intelligence,
‘learning by doing’ can start small.

Collective Intelligence for Sustainable Development
Appendix
Glossary of collective intelligence methods
used by the UNDP Accelerator Labs

Citizen-generated data

Citizen-generated data is a broad category that includes
any information that can be collected from people either by
active involvement (e.g. videos, reports, ideas – usually using
digital platforms) or passively (e.g. transactions data, call
detail records, wearables).

Citizen science

Citizen science is any process where scientists and (usually
unpaid) volunteers work together to collect or process
scientific data or observations. Citizen science unlocks new
resources for research, experimentation and analysis by
opening the process to anyone.

Collaborative platform

A collaborative platform enables a loosely defined group
of participants to come together to create a product or
service, which is typically then made available to contributors
or non-contributors alike. It draws on principles of open
collaboration and open source software development,
whereby openness and transparency in product
development improve participation, trust and collective
memory.

Collective sensemaking

Collective sensemaking refers to the process by which
members of a group create a plausible understanding of a
problem by exchanging interpretations and information to
decide on a course of action.

54

Appendix

Combining data sources

Combining data is a process of bringing together two or
more different datasets to unlock new value or generate
new insights that would not otherwise be exploited. It may
involve partners entering into an agreement to exchange
data for a specific social cause. These datasets may include
data that’s passively generated by people (e.g. call detail
records), or actively contributed (e.g. citizen reporting).

Community of practice

A community of practice is a group who share a concern and
learn by interacting with one another regularly. In pursuing
their practice area, participants help each other, and build
up a repertoire of shared resources (experiences, tools and
solutions) while working together.

Crowd forecasting

Crowd forecasting is a method that asks small or large
groups to make predictions about the future. Individual
predictions are aggregated using statistics into a consensus
crowd forecast. It’s inspired by research which showed that
small crowds of non-experts can often forecast political
events more successfully than individual experts.

Crowdmapping

Crowdmapping is a type of crowdsourcing which gathers
data from different sources (including social media, text
messages or geographic data) to provide real-time, interactive
information about issues on the ground. Crowdmapping can
create detailed almost real-time data in a way that a top-down,
centrally curated map may struggle to replicate.

Crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing is an umbrella term for a variety of
approaches that source data, information, opinions or ideas
from large crowds of people, often by issuing open calls for
contribution. It can help bring new ideas to light that hadn’t
previously been considered, or to gather expertise from
people who have specialized knowledge or understanding of
an issue.

55

Appendix

Data visualization

Data visualization encompasses a range of techniques for
representing information, from complex graphs to mind-
maps and tools for illustrating complex concepts or ideas.
They can be static or dynamic, and may also be connected to
databases, or updated manually. Data visualization can help
to bring complex or messy data to life in new ways, aiding
collective awareness and understanding of the issues that
matter.

Geographic information system (GIS)

A GIS is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate,
analyze, manage and present all types of geographical data.

Microsurvey

Microsurveys are a short, abbreviated form of surveying
which typically take the respondent only a few minutes
to complete. Microsurveys are often delivered by mobile
phone, text message or a digital platform. Benefits include
a much faster turnaround, and higher frequency of results,
compared to traditional surveys.

Natural language processing (NLP)

NLP techniques can be used to carry out automated analysis
of user-generated text from sources like social media, to
better understand what issues matter to people, translate
languages or simulate language.

Open data

Open data is the raw data that’s gathered by people or an
organization and published in an electronic format that
machines can read. It’s then shared online and allowed to be
re-used by others instead of keeping it private.

56

Appendix

Open source repository

An open source repository is a digital repository where
content (e.g. code, text or DIY designs) can be stored and
freely downloaded with few restrictions on use. Many open
source repositories aid collaboration by providing a space for
uploading documentation, monitoring and version control.

Participatory sensing

Participatory sensing is where citizens use lightweight, cheap
sensors to collectively monitor the environment around
them. It also deepens their understanding of the issue,
educating participants and empowering them to act.

Peer-to-peer exchange

Peer-to-peer exchange refers to the process of sharing
information horizontally to build and maintain a community,
collect data, connect people or send alerts. Platforms for this
vary, ranging from messaging platforms to online forums or
collaborative platforms. Some rely on the internet but others
do not (e.g. SMS or mesh networks).

Remote or in-situ sensing

Collecting information from satellites or physical sensors
recording actions and physical changes (e.g. traffic cameras,
weather sensors, ambient sensors, wearables or drones).
This data can provide cheap, real-time measurements of
anything from pollution to crop yields.

Web scraping

Web scraping is a method for extracting unstructured data
from across the web, such as company websites or social
media. Where official datasets are costly to gather and
infrequently updated, web scraping can provide more timely
insights into social or economic trends.
