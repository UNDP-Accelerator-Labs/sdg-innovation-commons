Overall goal: Learn about the current and historical geographic distribution of the Argentine horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata) in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, and encourage the participation of local communities in its conservation.  Specific goals: Monitor the species collaboratively to detect it in real time. Use this information to guide actions for conservation and handling. Disseminate the conservation issues of the Argentine horned frog in particular and amphibians in general. 

Description of citizen participation: Citizens participate by sharing records on the Argentine horned frog. There are three ways of participation:  (1) By filling in a Google form available on the project’s social media. There, participants can upload a photo and add a GPS coordinate, date, time, and weather and environmental data associated with the record.  (2) By downloading the Escuerzo: Gigante de las Pampas App available for Android on Google Play Store. Through the app, the user can sign up and, by just taking a photo, the record is sent with the associated information.  (3) Through in-person surveys at locations where Internet connectivity is low or is not available. For this purpose, the Gigante de las Pampas team visits towns and conducts surveys in person. Records can be current or from several years back, but in all cases, they should include a photo or go through a validation process.
