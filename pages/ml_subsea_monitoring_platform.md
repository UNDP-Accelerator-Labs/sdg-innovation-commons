## 


Bluemvmt changes the price/performance curve in the marine monitoring industry by providing a cost-effective hardware/software solution that combines an innovative subsea monitoring platform (SMP) allowing Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) to dock and upload data and recharge without needing to resurface. The data collected from the large array of sensors, hydrophones, acoustic modems, and cameras are uploaded in real-time to our Blue/AI Cloud. The software measures, tracks and reports on Land, Sea and Sky sensor streams and correlates them. The unique business model reduces their total cost of ownership for our customers over time through a unique revenue sharing program.
