Developed 25 years ago with the goal of helping Malaysia’s rural communities, UTM Membrane Technology aims to become the country's premier membrane manufacturer. It hope to reduce the country's reliance on imported membrane for filtration systems. The technology is claimed to be of equal standing in terms of quality compared with imported technologies. The team has also worked with the Education Ministry, installing water purification systems in rural schools across the country. To date, 60 water purification systems have been installed, providing these communities with access to clean water supply, and subsequently better health. The team hopes to disseminate the application of the technology in other industries, sharing its knowledge of integrating the membrane systems with various equipment to build future-ready sustainable technology. The team continues to enhance the sustainability of its membrane manufacturing process, including utilising materials from alternative sources to reduce waste.
