## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that valuable data and insights in Syria are underutilized due to inefficient communication and lengthy production processes. This limits their potential for timely advocacy, resource mobilization, and stakeholder engagement, reducing the overall impact of our strategic communication efforts.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



Key Drivers:
Fragmented Data Sharing: Internal data flows inefficiently across units, limiting its reach and utility.
Lack of Timely Analysis: Over-analysis delays the production of knowledge products, leading to missed advocacy opportunities.

Inadequate External Communication: Existing insights are not effectively repurposed for external stakeholders, including donors and partners.

Resource Constraints: Limited capacity for creating concise, engaging, and timely communication materials such as visual fact sheets.

Stakeholders Involved:
UNDP Internal Units: SPU, Risk Management Unit, Communications Unit, and programmatic teams.
Donors and Partners: Rely on timely insights to make informed funding and collaboration decisions.
General Public: Beneficiaries of clear, accessible information on UNDP’s impact.

Current Situation:
Inefficient Internal Communication: Data remains siloed within specific units.
Missed Advocacy Opportunities: Delayed and outdated insights weaken the impact of advocacy campaigns.
Limited Stakeholder Engagement: External partners and the public lack access to timely, visually engaging knowledge products.

Undesired Effects:
Reduced Credibility: Inefficient communication affects UNDP’s ability to demonstrate impact effectively.
Missed Funding Opportunities: Lack of timely data insights undermines resource mobilization efforts.
Under-informed Decision-Making: Internal and external stakeholders operate with limited access to actionable data.


> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Expertise in Rapid Knowledge Product Development:

We specialize in quick turnaround for data-driven insights, ensuring that factsheets and infographics are produced in a timely manner, without sacrificing quality or relevance.

Innovation in Data Storytelling:

Our Lab integrates narrative techniques with data visualization to create compelling, easily digestible knowledge products. This enhances the impact of advocacy efforts by making complex data accessible to a wider audience.
Cross-Unit Collaboration:

We excel at breaking silos within organizations, coordinating between the SPU, Risk Management Unit, and Communications Unit to streamline data collection, analysis, and dissemination.

Agility in Responding to Emerging Needs:

Unlike other actors, the Accelerator Lab can quickly adapt to emerging priorities and external developments, ensuring factsheets remain relevant and aligned with strategic advocacy goals.

Why Invest?
Enhanced Advocacy Impact: Timely and engaging factsheets will strengthen UNDP Syria’s advocacy, ensuring critical messages reach stakeholders effectively.
Resource Mobilization: Improved communication of UNDP’s impact will help secure funding and attract new partners.
Data-Driven Decision-Making: Providing stakeholders with regular, clear insights ensures better programmatic decisions and strategic alignment.

- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Co-Creation:

Collaborate with internal units (SPU, Risk Management, Communications) and external stakeholders to design factsheets that meet diverse needs.
Value: Ensures the final products are user-centered, relevant, and widely accepted.

Data Analysis:

Extract key insights from internal reports, government data, and open sources to inform the content of factsheets.
Value: Provides a solid evidence base for advocacy and decision-making.

Data Visualization:

Transform complex data into clear, engaging infographics and charts for the factsheets.
Value: Enhances understanding and retention of key messages, making data accessible to diverse audiences.

Social Media Analysis:

Analyze engagement trends and stakeholder feedback to tailor factsheet dissemination strategies.
Value: Optimizes outreach, ensuring factsheets reach and resonate with the intended audiences.

Storytelling:

Combine data with compelling narratives to contextualize insights and humanize the issues being addressed.
Value: Increases emotional engagement and advocacy impact, driving action and support.


> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Lack of Timely Data for Advocacy:

Existing data is often outdated by the time it’s analyzed and shared.
Value: Data Analysis addresses this by streamlining the extraction of actionable insights for quicker decision-making and advocacy.

Ineffective Data Presentation:

Current reports are dense and not easily digestible for diverse stakeholders.
Value: Data Visualization transforms complex information into clear, impactful visuals, enhancing stakeholder engagement and understanding.

Limited Audience Feedback:

There’s a gap in understanding how stakeholders engage with and perceive knowledge products.
Value: Social Media Analysis provides real-time feedback, allowing for adaptive dissemination strategies and content improvement.

Disconnected Narratives:

Data lacks contextual storytelling, which diminishes its emotional and persuasive impact.
Value: Storytelling bridges this gap by humanizing data, increasing its advocacy power and relevance.
