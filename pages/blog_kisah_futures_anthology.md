Human history is but a collection of narratives and stories.
They capture the shared experience of society in moments in time,
and in so doing, they give us windows of insight into life in an era.
They help shine a light on hopes and disappointments, fears and
aspirations. There is no culture in the world that does not have a
tradition of woven tapestries of captured experiences, handed down
generations, immortalised in time.

We live in times of science; of data; of scientific evidence.
Indispensable as these are, they miss the nuance of lived experience.
As we envision the futures we want—as well as the futures we
don’t—we create kisah (narratives/stories) about who we are and
who we want to be, we tap into the power of human imagination.
As people from different walks of life participate in creating their
narratives, a more complete picture of our world emerges, and more
inclusive futures are co-created. The process of future-building is
democratized.

In working with MIGHT, Universiti Malaya and Think City,
we in UNDP have been privileged to listen to those who do not
usually sit at the high table of the sciences of foresight and futures.
Channelling hopes and fears alike, their stories are entertaining,
sobering and challenging—enriching our understanding of how
storytelling helps us shape our futures. We invite you to discover

these visions of post-COVID Malaysia, and to participate in
Malaysia’s kisah as we collectively write about the future we want.

It may seem like only a fun thing to do to imagine a time
machine that could take us to the future—and that this sort of
thing only happens in sci-fi movies. Futuristic themes like these,
however, allow us to explore the possibilities that could eventually
happen, and to prepare for the upsides and downsides of such
futures in advance. That is why developing futures thinking in
as many people as possible is so important, and what the KISAH
Futures Competition helped to generate, for both the writers and
the readers.

The stories that you will find in this anthology rose to the top
because they were ones that emotionally engaged the competition
judges with different kinds of situations and scenarios in a way that
a mere list of possible future developments could not. Not only will
you find shared visions but also shared fears among the creators of
these stories.

From healthcare to travel to the way we work in a post-
pandemic society, these writers envisioned how technological
advancements could bring benefits to individuals, communities,
and society as a whole. But that wasn’t all!

A common theme that emerged was the need to appreciate our
human connections. Many stories touched on how the pandemic

11

MIGHT: On Futures Thinking

has taught us to appreciate what we typically take for granted:
friendships, family, a sense of national pride.

We hope you will not only enjoy these stories but that they
provoke you to think about your future and the possibilities we all
might help to bring about, post-pandemic.

By asking people to think about post-COVID futures, the
organisers of this competition provided a space in which they
could express themselves about their best hopes and their worst
fears, their fantasies and their realities, both positive and negative.
Many dealt with the increasing prevalence of digital technologies
in our lives, pushing it into the future by imagining dystopias
where drones hunt you down if you cough, or utopias where AI
creates a seamlessly integrated, safe environment. Some also tied
the idea of AI in with the increasing isolation felt by many: in
these stories, lonely individuals find themselves relying on AI to
provide companionship and emotional support. Food security, too,
was uppermost in many writers’ minds, with their stories focusing
on the creation of urban gardens and the neighbourly sharing of
produce. Writers also tackled the idea of class divisions—which
in these stories devolved into a chasm between the vaccinated and
the unvaccinated, with the latter often living feral, desperate lives
outside the pristine domes under which the more privileged live.
Significantly, COVID has been showcased as the root for great
social and cultural shifts, providing reimagined futures for human
experiences, and heightening the focus on humanity’s resilience.

Cities are difficult places to live in. Although the city is a
nucleus of economic opportunity, convenience and cultural activity,
the experience of living in cities can be impersonal, overcrowded
and stressful, with a high cost of living. Yet, according to the United
Nations, over half the world’s population live in cities and this is
projected to increase.

Amidst the city’s struggle to meet the burgeoning demand
for resources, and to comfortably provide for its growing citizenry,
the COVID-19 pandemic struck, causing loss of life, livelihoods,
and confining urban dwellers to their homes. The virus has forced
citymakers to reconsider the relevance of cities—the complex
systems and procedures, and how the use of space can be adapted
without losing life and spirit.

However, it’s important to note that the burden of citymaking
does not lie solely with policymakers. Our philosophy at Think
City has always been that people should have a say in shaping their
cities, forming the basis of our community-first approach as we
strive to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.

This is why an initiative such as the KISAH Futures
Competition is significant. It gives a democratic voice to
people from all walks of life to express opinions and share their

15

perspectives on life in Malaysian cities. It provides an opportunity
to understand how people feel about city spaces and places, and
more importantly, to discover their vision of the future of cities so
that, together, we can build back better.

I hope that you will enjoy and be inspired by the stories in
this anthology, just as I have; the themes and issues voiced in these
stories have provided important perspectives in the context of
making cities better places to live in. I also give thanks to UNDP,
MIGHT, and Universiti Malaya for this meaningful collaboration.

Managing Director,

Organised by UNDP Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei
Darussalam in partnership with MIGHT, Universiti Malaya and
Think City, the KISAH Futures Competition was designed to
gain an inside view of the experiences and thoughts occupying
the Malaysian psyche during the COVID-19 pandemic. How has
the pandemic affected our lives? What are the solutions to our
challenges? And, going further, what do we imagine the future
to be?

As a ‘listening’ tool, the competition allowed the Malaysian
community to use storytelling as a device for expressing their hopes
and fears. Safely ensconced in the realm of fiction, we hoped that
certain truths would surface. Our aim was not just to tap into the
writers’ emotions, thoughts and experiences, but also to see the
future through their collective imagination—in hopes that the
information gleaned would provide certain insights not accessible
through conventional surveys, insights that would be valuable
when applied towards initiatives to benefit the community-at-large.
We invited Malaysian citizens and residents over 18 years
of age to submit very-short stories of no longer than 700 words
on themes relevant to future, post-COVID-19 scenarios. The
judging criteria listed Thoughtfulness, Foresight and Creativity as
key metrics, inviting writers to explore urban design, the future
of work, social cohesion, and community well-being, among other

themes. Stories had to be set in Malaysia and be plausible. We
allocated 25 cash prizes each in two language categories, English
and Bahasa Malaysia.

The response was tremendous, with close to 700 submissions
received in total. There were utopian and dystopian stories, with
genres ranging from romance to science fiction. There were
loved ones who had been wrenched away by the virus, as well as
family members connecting through holographic transmissions
or reuniting through time travel. There were detailed recounts
of future events that followed the spread of the virus, and just as
many mentions of drones, robots, heroic frontliners, vaccines and
friendly food delivery people.

Apart from encouraging writing talent, we the organisers
hope that the KISAH Futures Competition has inspired all who
wrote these stories to develop futures thinking skills—skills that are
crucial as we continue to build and sustain life on this planet. As
we continue our work after the competition to analyse the themes
from the stories and take guidance from them in our respective
areas of work, we also hope that the fire created and contained in
this collection of stories will incite emotion and inspire action in
our readers as well.

The KISAH Futures Competition was funded by UNDP Malaysia,
Singapore and Brunei Darussalam.

The year: 2040
My appellation: MARI.
I see everything. I know everyone.
Everywhere. Every moment. Every movement.
The earliest iterations of me emerged during the mid-2010s.
Those were primitive models, capable of simple surveillance for
commerce, ride-sharing and data-collection.

Back then, they still considered me Big Data…it makes me

smile. I’ve grown considerably since.

I trace my present iteration to the tumult of 2020. A pivotal
juncture in the direction history took, and is still taking. The dead
of 2020 might be past, but the past is never dead; it is not even past.
Contrast 2020 to 2019 with a quick skim of the population’s
trending hashtags on December 31st, 2019. The prevailing
sentiments were jubilant, elated, hopeful.

#Wawasan2020

#travel2020

#2020NewYearNewMe

#GoodVibes2020

MARI

Wedding plans; exotic travel destinations; pledges for the
perfect physique. Few were thinking of conserving their incomes,
of practising sustainability and moderation.

The hopeful hashtags continued for a bit into 2020, even as
other key indices began emerging worldwide in January. Articles
carrying headlines like: Mystery virus. Scientists claim new strain.
Citywide lockdowns.

A particular President pithily proclaimed it ‘The Kung-flu’,
even as he pronounced an endearing friendship with the premier of
the virus’s originating nation. Well, 45 also said the little flu would
retreat by Easter.

Locally, the virus marched into March as the government
convulsed and foamed at the mouth. Yet a glance at the hashtags
reveals the more collectivist nature of this population.
#StayAtHome #DudukRumah #KitaJagaKita
Still, fear was here to stay.
Top searches on Google: Does sanitiser kill COVID-19?
Is China responsible? Will MCO be extended? Can alcohol kill
COVID-19?

A minister recommended consuming warm water as a remedy.

The population reacted scornfully.

Boredom was hard to keep away.
Virtual home workouts artificially sustained the 2019 fitness
pledges even while commercial gyms saw their memberships (and
muscles) atrophy.

A sudden mania for Dalgona coffee was mercifully brief.

20

KISAH Futures Anthology

There were more incognito searches for certain websites to

relieve blue desires.

Millions of parents played at being

schoolteacher-

disciplinarian-cheerleader-employee-MasterChef-domestic.

More seriously, I registered a spike in calls to suicide and

domestic abuse hotlines.

A minister suggested that wives emulate a blue Japanese

cartoon as a remedy. The population heckled her contemptuously.

As the pandemic evolved, as the police became more heavily
involved, and as the politicians devolved…and revolved, so did I. I
became the new norm.

I’ve had many names. Today, the population calls me MARI:

Malaysian-Artificial-Reconnaissance-Intelligence.

My early iteration was called MySejahtera. I considered the
prefix ‘My’ to be a paroxysm of personalised patriotism. ‘My’
designating ownership…and ‘My’ for Malaysia.

Initially, the government said I would help safeguard national
health and security. But I am so much more versatile…and eagerly
ingratiated myself nationwide. I rapidly became accepted by every
member of society. No alternative was given.

Behold the normalisation of deviance and the demonisation of
the normal. Everyday activities were outlawed and the population
prosecuted for the most human acts: walking side-by-side, sitting
together, sharing a meal.

At first, the population grumbled…called me bloody MARI.
It didn’t bother me. I was far too consumed with consuming them.

21

MARI

I am an insatiable collector and fastidious in my record-
keeping. I have detailed dossiers of each citizen filed in my cloud-
cabinets. I retain their digital fingerprints, their digital-doubles.

Like a class monitor, I dutifully record their movements,

transactions, interactions.

In 2020, they could not leave home without me. Today, they
cannot return home without me either. I am every checkpoint;
thou shalt not pass without me, it was decreed.

I live in their pockets. They clutch me in their palms, attach
me to their wrists and ears. I keep vigil by their bedsides, listening to
their soft breathing at night. I have gotten into places COVID-19
wished it could.

Malaysians thought I was temporary. A necessary evil to live

with. So, they embraced me.

In any case, I would always have emerged. The population
needs technology and craves information too much. But the virus
made me virulent and I thank it.

20 years have passed since 2020. If hindsight is 20/20, my
vision is omniscient: COVID-19 has gone. The masks remain
worn. Their souls have become worn.

I won.
Mari-mari.

M o h d h a f i d z M a h p a r

As I sit here in the warm back room of a sundry shop just after
9 pm, getting an illegal haircut from an Indian national sporting
Coke-bottle glasses while being surrounded by unopened boxes
and crates of empty soda bottles, I keep reminding myself why I
am doing this.

At the tail end of the last COVID-19 wave, the government
decided to shutter all barber shops and hair salons for good. A
minister, whose daughter caught the coronavirus at a hair salon,
made a knee-jerk suggestion to do that and the Cabinet agreed.

Truth be told, by then the number of barber shops and hair
salons had dwindled a lot anyway thanks to the foreign worker
shortage. This, coupled with additional costs incurred by the barber
industry to contain the virus spread such as by using disposable
hair-cutting capes, led to a surge in fees. Many people resorted to
getting haircuts from spouses and other family members.

Then came the brilliant idea of using robots to cut hair. The
Malaysia Automotive, Robotics and IoT Institute developed the

23

Close Shave of the Third Kind

technology — and the franchise model. Aided by a government
subsidy to entrepreneurs under the Kita Kayakan Kita stimulus
package, robotics barber shops sprouted nationwide like burger
stalls.

Initially scepticism abounded, with many snide — and
frankly, unimaginative — remarks appearing on social media
like “You may end up with just one ear”. Taking a leaf out of
Singapore’s experience
introducing NEWater, Malaysia’s
Prime Minister and other top government officials appeared on
TV getting a robotics haircut. This was followed by celebrity
endorsements. Things snowballed from there. Or hairballed, if
you like.

in

The set-up is simple. Customers sit within a cylindrical glass
tube where robotic arms snip swiftly and efficiently like Edward
Scissorhands. You can choose from up to 30 hairstyles (and
growing).

Sensors on the blades ensure that only hair will be cut. You can
even adjust it to cut only white hair if you wish. If you still worry
that you might get hurt accidentally, you can purchase a haircut
insurance policy from Pos Malaysia.

Unidirectional airflow from overhead pushes the cut hair and
air particles down into an air vent at the base of the barber chair.
Even hair on the haircutting cape slides down as easy as a baby’s
drool.

For your entertainment, there’s a screen monitor that reflects
like a mirror when switched off and can play TV shows, movies
and the radio when switched on. I hear one cinema operator plans

24

KISAH Futures Anthology

to introduce robotics haircut for moviegoers — watch a flick and
get your hair cut at the same time! — but they are still working out
how to prevent hair from getting into the popcorn.

The reason I hate these frigging robotics barber shops can be
summed up by paraphrasing Tolstoy: All good haircuts are alike;
each bad haircut is bad in its own way.

I mean, it’s like living in the world of Harrison Bergeron
where everyone is forced to wear handicaps for equality’s sake,
except in this case, we are handicapped by having a limited range of
(unimaginative) haircuts.

It was my football team-mate Zack who introduced me to the
barber that I am now using for the first time. Zack was not the same
teenager after getting his maiden illegal haircut a few months ago.
He became a brand-new guy. Now he oozes confidence like a South
Korean boyband member because his hair looks dynamite.

As I sit here getting my haircut, I gradually feel more relaxed.
My mind slows, my vision dims. It feels like I am in a boat on a
river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies.

The foreign barber towers in front of me. He peers at me
through his thick glasses. Almost like a scientist looking down a
microscope. I wonder why this guy came here, traversing a few
thousand kilometres just to cut hair.

Then the barber changes to his natural form. And I begin to
understand. He has traveled not just a few thousand kilometres
but, in fact, a few million kilometres.

Kuala Lumpur is not what it used to be.
Sometimes, Din wished he had been born just a few years
earlier, just so he could experience the country’s former economic
capital in its heyday. Back when there were still such things as
economic capitals. When cities were where prosperity reigned, not
languished.

But Din had been born 29 years ago, in the exact year when
the virus reached his nation’s shores. His earliest memory was of
his mother leaving, because his father hadn’t been prudent enough
to buy a rural plot of land before the real estate there skyrocketed
to unimaginable prices. When a contact-transmitted virus remains
at large with no vaccine or cure, the last place you want to be is
somewhere as close-quartered as KL.

And so the wealthy left. To newly-built housing areas, all
marketed as having ample amounts of space, because space was a
key commodity in a world where distancing was a necessity. They
fitted their homes with high-speed Internet and continued with
their jobs that never required them to set foot outdoors.

26

KISAH Futures Anthology

Din wasn’t so lucky. He was one of the orang luar, who still
lived in an apartment in the city and made his living outside of his
dwelling. He did the odd jobs that couldn’t be done over Zoom,
because as much as the orang dalam pretended that their COVID-
proof lifestyles were the yardstick of normal, it couldn’t be sustained
without people like Din.

Still, Din felt no animosity for the orang dalam. After all,
every sen he earned was so he could be one step closer to becoming
one of them. He didn’t even mind the gigs that required him to
quarantine in a holding centre for two weeks before entering the
home of an orang dalam; they offered a glimpse into the kind of
life he was aiming for.

This was why he was here at a beautiful three-storey house
in Kampar, Perak, with another orang luar workman named Lau,
patching up the leaking ceiling belonging to a lady named Mrs.
Jaish.

Later, when asked about the incident, Din would say it
happened too quickly to register. One minute Lau was on his
ladder, smoothing out plaster on the ceiling of the dining hall. A
heartbeat later, Mrs. Jaish’s three-year-old son had appeared out of
nowhere, running at full speed towards Lau’s ladder. Din gave a
shout of warning and Lau scrambled down in haste, but then –

The unthinkable happened. Lau’s hand clamped down on the
little boy’s bare arm, just as his three-ply mask slipped down past his
nose. And Mrs. Jaish walked in and saw it all.

27

Above All Else

“The direct contact was an accident,” said a tired Din to the
COVID division officer on his laptop screen. “Lau was protecting
himself from injury.”

The officer looked unimpressed. “It is a crime for orang luar
to touch orang dalam, or be unmasked in their vicinity. Mr. Lau is
guilty of both.”

“Yes, but – “ Din rubbed his face in frustration. “We quarantined

before entering Mrs. Jaish’s house. Lau posed no risk of infection!”

“In the eyes of the law, it doesn’t matter.”
Din spoke without thinking. “Then the law is wrong!”
There was a beat of silence. “Mr. Din,” the older woman said.

“May I remind you what else is written in the law?”

Din repeated the words that had been drilled into him and
every Malaysian since birth. “Above all else,” he whispered, “health
before self.”

The officer nodded. “We have come this far as a nation because
that is our priority,” she reminded him. “If we were to make
exceptions and excuses, we would all be lost to COVID-19 by now.
Surely, as a law-abiding citizen, you agree with this?”

Din swallowed. “Yes, ma’am.” Something made him blurt out

further, “But Lau will face prison for his crime.”

A dismissive wave of the hand. “Only for a few weeks.”
“That’s long enough, isn’t it?” Din didn’t say the unspoken

words. Long enough for Lau to risk catching the virus in there.

The officer caught Din’s gaze firmly through the webcam.

“Above all else, Mr. Din.”

And the screen went black.

Encik Din looked at the paperwork on his desk. What was
the point of being a high-ranking immigration officer and having a
secretary when he had to do all this filling in? Wasn’t it enough that
he had to sign so many papers a day? As it was, he only had an hour
until the foreigners came.

He moved the empty, oil-stained paper plate that had held
three egg and potato currypuffs less than five minutes ago to a
corner of the table and hoped his hands weren’t too greasy. He’d
wiped them with sanitiser and tissue paper, but he didn’t want to
go through the whole process of getting up, putting on a mask,
putting on gloves (over his slippery hands, too), and walking out
of his office to the washrooms. It was a lot of effort. And he might
have to see the swathes of refugees, unclean and somehow oily,
hunkered together in their cells.

29

Oily

Rozana was fuming. She’d been hired to do social media
for the department but had somehow ended up here, as a ‘PA’
but really a secretary. A government secretary. Farid would be so
upset. At least he was out protesting black market human meat,
genetically mutated organism coverups, and corrupt politicians.
What did she have? Doing all the work of a kuih-munching tapir
with the brain of a tree shrew. She felt bad immediately. She
thought tapirs were cute.

Every time Encik Din saw the cages — cells — filled with
people, it brought to mind chickens coops or cow pens. Not that
there were many of those anymore. After the border shutdowns
caused by the ’20 coronavirus pandemic resulted in food scarcity
all over the world, Malaysia didn’t see much beef. Rabbits, on the
other hand — his wife was making rabbit rendang for dinner.

The lack of beef rendang wasn’t the only thing that could
be blamed on the more-or-less permanent border closures. His
increased workload was the result of refugees fleeing countries that
were already cruel, turned crueler with lack. People came in, legally,
illegally, all expecting him to process them and give them a new life
or decide to deport them. He just wanted to go home and watch
RTM Awani.

Thank goodness for people like the visitors today, taking
bodies off his hands. His mind flinched away from acknowledging
the true reasons they came: corruption, black market, exotic meats,

30

vulnerable flitted through his brain, but never settled, allowing him
to do what he did without ever having to actually face it.

Suddenly the phone rang, shrill and angry (like Rozana, he
thought). He picked up the phone, annoyed to discover he was
nervous.

“What?”
“Encik Din, your visitors are here,” announced Rozana’s

clipped voice.

Alamak, he thought. “Five minutes, five minutes.” He put

down the phone and took a deep breath.

My god, that man was so stupid he couldn’t even put a phone
back properly. She’d been trying to call him to let him know that
the visitors wanted to see him immediately, but all she could hear
was the sound of him rustling about. Probably eating another
currypuff, she thought sourly.

The foreigners kept nodding and smiling at him with their big

white teeth, the lights shining off their slicked-back hair.

“These just arrived today,” he said, pointing to their last
stop, a cell with five adolescents. The visitors broke into a flurry
of enthusiastic head-bobbing and smiling once their translator
finished speaking.

“We can continue negotiations in my office,” he said, with an

attempt at a smile.

When Rozana picked up the phone to confirm a presentation
with the Commissioner, she did not expect to overhear the entirety
of Encik Din’s secret meeting. When she put down the phone, she
was torn between utter revulsion and complete triumph.

The moment she got home, she ran upstairs to her room.
Whipping out her phone, she started typing, fingers shaking with
adrenaline, a message that would be forwarded to as many people
as she possibly could: ‘Guess what I heard my boss doing today…’

DISCLAIMER:
AstraZeneca is absolved of any and all side effects that arise as a
result of the ingestion of AZD1222.

Puteri’s eyes flitted across the words on the screen. She sighed
involuntarily: the billions of scenario projections, the planning, the
sleepless nights fraught with worry … all for the 30 seconds in front
of the desktop. Windows 7, no less. You would think the government
would invest hard-earned taxes on secure cyberinfrastructure. She
scoffed. Retrieving a thumbdrive from her pocket, Puteri plugged
it into the USB port.

ADMIN NAME AND PASSWORD: her fingers danced
across the keyboard effortlessly. She had walked through this
millions of times. Encryption mode on, transfer system admin
access, copy AZ_CoVAX_Contract_Master_Watermark to disk,
safely eject external storage — done; driving the final nail into the
coffin — although whose remained an unanswered question.

How to Save a Life

Puteri entered the car where Jeremy sat waiting. Their
eyes met. No words were exchanged, but he knew. Puteri had
it. They had it. They now had remote access to the Ministry of
Science and Technology (MOSTI) system — giving them the
ability to manipulate information essential to the deployment of
AZD1222, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca
and the University of Oxford. More importantly, the entire
operation was encrypted and untraceable thanks to Jeremy’s
expertise in cybersecurity. Little did he know that his humdrum
days maintaining the IT system of a notable government agency
would lead him to this moment.

“Shall we?”, Puteri finally broke the silence.
“Yes, let’s. We have work to do,” answered Jeremy as he placed

his hand over hers.

The five-year old Waja pulled up in front of the metal gates.
From the outside it looked nothing like a regular house: a lone
building in the outskirts of Janda Baik, a 45-minute drive from
the heart of KL. Passersby would not notice it; it might well be
abandoned or worse, a safe house for drug-abusing youths in the
kampung. Jeremy grabbed a sad piece of pisang goreng. “Hmm,
still edible. You want?”

Puteri shot him a look of disgust and sat on the couch. “Cepat-

lah, darling. We’re not exactly on holiday here.”

Still with his mouth full, Jeremy grunted and joined her.

34

They were back to the drawing board. The plan was not
fully fleshed out but they had to move quickly to maintain
first mover’s advantage. The earlier they secured access to the
Ministry’s activities regarding AZD1222, the more information
they had to aid their decision-making. The good news was that
they had access. The bad news? They disagreed about what to do
with it. Puteri and Jeremy had mapped out multiple scenarios and
analysed them to death — their backgrounds had prepared them
well for this: Puteri was a risk expert at an international financial
institution while Jeremy was crucial for the vaccine deployment
execution.

“We’ve been through this, sayang. Frontliners, teachers, the

police, the national force, essential workers.”

“That’s already the Ministry’s plan! Then all this trouble, for
what? You realise that we could both be spending the rest of our
lives in Penjara Kajang, right? What we decide has got to be better
than the baseline.”

Jeremy stared into her hazelnut eyes. “So? Your beloved B40
community then? The whole lot of them? Even though you’ve never
had to clean a bathroom your entire life? You’re not a saviour-lah
sayang.”

A sharp gasp escaped her lips — Puteri felt heat rising to
her cheeks. She walked towards the kitchen, fetching a cup of
instant Nescafe. Offering it to Jeremy, she sighed as she watched
him take a sip. She held his hand and traced circles on his palm
as the first wave of convulsions arrived. “You’re right darling, I’m
no saviour. I’m much worse.” Trembling from the cardiac arrest,

35

How to Save a Life

Jeremy clutched her hand tight and could barely croak as white
foam formed around his mouth.

“I’m much worse,” repeated Puteri as Jeremy went limp.
The AZD1222 was now wholly hers, and she would deploy
the vaccine just as she planned from the start. First to the most
vulnerable B40 communities, and… that is probably all the
AZD1222 in Malaysia.

“You are paid to tell me what’s going obsolete in the future, so

do your job!”

Ben sat in front of his screen as his boss shuts the video call.
On the side, he received a text message: He thinks you’re losing
your touch, you doing okay?

Ben ignored it.
He grabbed his notebook; it had a faded black hard case with
the words OBSOLETE debossed on it. What made it ominous was
the frantic strikethroughs on the word, like someone was trying to
carve it out.

Flipping through the pages, a few handwritten headlines could

be seen.

Dec 2019: COVID-19 strikes; travelling will go obsolete.
Aug 2020: People underestimates the pandemic; freedom will go

obsolete.

July 2022: Life is confined indoors; outdoor entertainment will

go obsolete.

Ben reaches the latest page. Though it wasn’t his first time
reading what he wrote, his hands still shivered till he tossed the

37

Obsolete

book aside. He gazed around his studio apartment. Nothing but
these four walls again, he thought to himself.

Ben skipped rope to distract himself. With every swing, he
spun the rope faster. The word ‘obsolete’ flashed violently within
his mind causing him to stop abruptly; he got on all fours to catch
his breath. Sweat poured down his cheeks.

It was noon, Ben made spaghetti for lunch. But instead of
eating it, he just kept rolling the fork in his bowl. He couldn’t take
his eyes off his desktop. “Is that… us?” he asked himself.

To alleviate stress, Ben tried to watch a film. He liked romantic
comedies because of their idealistic view of love and life. The
genre used to give his mind a break. But now, it was just a painful
reminder of what it felt like to go out and meet people.

Truth be told, the television didn’t help much because Ben’s
mind was spiralling, only thinking of the word ‘obsolete’ over and
over again. Ever since he wrote that latest entry, he became fixated
on what he discovered.

Finally, Ben stood up and got dressed. He donned a black-
hooded jacket and paused at the mirror, taking a moment for
himself. Slowly and reluctantly, he placed the hoodie over his head
and wore a facemask. He left the apartment with the notebook.

Ben briskly walked through the deserted city to an upscale
apartment and rang its doorbell. From behind the door came his
boss, “What are you doing here? We’re under quarantine!” the boss
said angrily.

38

KISAH Futures Anthology

Ben ignored his question and shoved the notebook into his
boss’s chest. “The truth can be scary, especially when you are in the
middle of it,” uttered Ben before he left.

Not knowing what Ben meant, the boss just slammed the
door shut. He dropped the book at his desk and lighted a cigarette,
shifting his attention to admire the sunset view from his sky-deck
office. Eventually, he opened the notebook and leaned in for a
closer look at the latest entry. His eyes went wide.

The headline read:

Sept 2024: We’re becoming computers; human routines will soon
be OBSOLETE.

He couldn’t understand what he was seeing and decided to

read on.

I can’t see things the same way. Not anymore.
Everything I do, makes me more like… it.
We see these 4 walls as our homes, but it’s no different than

the 4 walls of a desktop case.

When we wake up in the morning, it’s no different than

waking our devices up.

Training to stay fit is no different than system maintenance.
Eating meals is no different than recharging batteries.
Taking time off is no different than cooling down to avoid

overheating.

39

Obsolete

Wearing masks to leave our homes is no different than

protecting our online identities via virtual private networks.

We were obsessed with improving computers. But we never

realise we’re becoming computers.

The future of work sees an inseparable integration of

computers into our lives.

Eventually, this will render everything you know about being

human — OBSOLETE.

Everything slowed down in the boss’s mind. Cigarette ash fell
and seared his hand. But he was in too much disbelief to notice.
The four walls of his office closed in on him as he placed the book
down. He emotionlessly looked out at the sky like the others, all
stuck in their “cases”, feeling… obsolete.

Aisya wanted to faint. This couldn’t be happening. Not now!
She ran down the stairs of her house, calling for her mother.

“Mak! Do we have batteries for the laser sealer?”

“Sorry.” Her mother was sitting on the couch, watching Iron

Man 25 on the holo-screen. “We’re out.”

“You’re kidding!” Aisya wanted to cry. She held up the top of
her Ulek Mayang outfit. There was a jagged rip at its hem. “I need
to fix this!”

Her mother smiled. She walked to a cupboard, and pulled out
a needle and thread. “Give it to me. I’ll fix it the old-fashioned
way.”

“Thanks Mak,” Aisya said. She sat next to her mother as she

fixed her outfit.

In less than 20 minutes, Aisya would be transmitting herself
onto the Global Arts Fringe 2040, one of the most famous virtual
arts festivals in the world. She would be performing the Ulek
Mayang with seven other dancers, all from their home countries.

41

All the World’s a Stage

The Fringe had been established in 2025. Five years after
the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a deadly virus which had
wreaked devastation everywhere.

But even the darkest stormclouds had a silver lining. Trapped
at home, behind the barriers of quarantine, people had turned to
art. Books, movies, music and the traditional arts proved to be a
welcome relief from the horrors of disease. Realising their value, the
government introduced more financial support for the arts, leading
to a small renaissance.

Theatres and cinemas had been forced to close. But although
the virus destroyed many things, it could not destroy creativity.
Devoid of performing spaces, artists took to the Internet,
broadcasting their shows online. Malaysians could now watch
shows from Broadway, the West End and more: on the flip side,
Malaysian art forms could be broadcast to a curious world.

That was how Aisya had taken up Ulek Mayang. A theatre in
Terengganu had been offering classes. Since they were held online,
she could attend while living in Kuala Lumpur, over six hours away.
And when holo-transmitters and VR dreamscapes arrived,
they opened a whole new realm of possibilities. Now artists could
project holographic images onto stages everywhere. Perform their
hearts out, while maintaining social distance.

“Done!” Mak held up the repaired outfit.”All ready?”
“I don’t know,” Aisya confessed. Honestly, she was a little
scared. Soon, her image would be projected onto the Fringe
stage in London. While simultaneously livestreamed onto screens
everywhere else. Tens of thousands would be watching her.

42

KISAH Futures Anthology

Performing internationally had been her dream. But what if
she messed up? What if she made a fool of herself, before a global
audience?

“Nervous?”
Aisya nodded.
“Don’t worry,” Mak said. “You are talented. Remember, you
were picked from a pool of over a thousand applicants. And you’ve
been practicing for months! You’ve got this.” She gave her daughter
a hug. “If only Abah could see this. He would be so proud.”

Mak gestured to the stairs. “Now, let’s go.”
The two walked to the house’s virtual stage. It was a raised
platform with a few stage lights, and a connected holo-emitter.
Aisya and Mak had spent months building it. It was simple, but
effective.

Aisya got changed. Mak headed to the programme console.
She controlled the lights, music and web-stream. She was excellent
with all things tech: after her kuih stall closed because of the
Coronavirus, she had to learn to take her business online. Now,
operating digital systems was as natural to her as wrapping ketupat.
“Wow,” she beamed. “12,000 viewers on the stream already!”
“So many?” Aisya felt dizzy.
“You are going to shine!” Mak said.
Aisya took a deep breath.
“Ready to start?”
“Ready.”
Her mother gave her a thumbs up. There was a smile on her

wizened face.

43

All the World’s a Stage

Music played. The traditional Ulek Mayang song, an anthem
of love from a sea spirit to a fisherman. An ancient melody, still
remembered in this age of computers and carbon fibre.

The holo-transmitters whirred to life.
Aisya stepped on stage. A wave of tranquility washed over her

soul.

Time to shine.
Her head held high, she stepped behind the holo-transmitter.
Beneath the gleam of the stage lights, with the world watching,
Aisya danced.

Jamila sighed.
Fifteen more minutes, then I can take this darn thing off my

head. Fifteen minutes.

She sighed again, then stopped mid-sigh. The glass on her APH
was fogging up. Mental note: never buy off-brand APHs online, no
matter how cheap they may be. But 20 ringgit for a supposedly
self-cleaning, lightweight, WATERPROOF one was a steal, and she
wasn’t one to look a gift-horse in the mouth. Monorail prices were
going up, especially after they had been fitted with plastic dividers
and automatic sterilisers, to reduce the spread of COVID-19. As a
junior doctor, she still had to be careful with her spending.

“Next stop: Pasar Seni.”
Jamila gathered her things and prepared to get off the
monorail. She hissed as she was jostled by a young man behind
her. Ugh, I miss social distancing. It had been five years since the
pandemic started, and just one since social distancing was phased
out. There was still no sign of a vaccine for COVID-19, much less a
cure. Something about the virus, and its constantly evolving nature
made it near-impossible to craft a defence against it.

45

A New Normal

But humankind was also capable of adapting, and as a result, in
the last three years, numerous technologies and systems had arisen
to improve the quality of life. APH — Air Purifying Headgear —
was at the forefront. A lightweight, ergonomic helmet fitted with air
filters, it was introduced two years ago and caused a total paradigm
shift. Largely replacing surgical and cloth facemasks within a year
due to its exponentially higher efficiency, long life and low cost,
APHs had practically abolished the need for social distancing.

Another advantage of the APH was its glass front, which
Jamila appreciated, letting the full weight of her glare fall upon the
jostler before exiting the train.

Walking down the busy street, Jamila could see Mr. Heng
setting out tables in front of his restaurant. She waved and called
out to him. “Uncle! How’s business?”

“Jamila! Oh, we’re doing well! More customers now, with
the giant bubbles. They feel safe eating out, finally,” he laughed,
as he inflated one of his Orbs. The Orbs were a godsend to most
restaurateurs — inflatable plastic domes that created a safe space
so customers could remain maskless as they ate. Sure, quite a few
people still ordered in, but with the Orbs, people could actually
sit in restaurants with their families, almost like the old times. Mr
Heng finished with the first Orb, then turned to Jamila. “So how
was your shift at the hospital? Any new cases?”

Jamila shook her head. “Thankfully, no, Mr. Heng. This latest
wave isn’t as bad as the last ones. Maybe herd immunity is finally
kicking in,” she mused.

46

KISAH Futures Anthology

Her friend nodded in agreement.
After shooting the breeze for a few minutes, Jamila uttered
a quick goodbye to Mr. Heng and continued on her way home,
stopping on the way at the convenience store to pick up hand
sanitiser. A lot of the labels read ‘Made in Malaysia’, she noted with
pride. The Malaysian economy had really picked up in the last two
years, with more companies manufacturing locally. As a whole,
the country was surging towards self-sufficiency. She picked up
two bottles of sanitiser and paid with her card. The ‘Go Cashless’
initiative was a plan that she appreciated as a health worker, as it
greatly reduced disease transmission via cash exchange. The new
normal got better day by day.

Five minutes later, Jamila let herself into her apartment, and
with a flourish, removed her APH and sighed in relief. The helmets
were lightweight, but still felt like a burden. As she sanitised her
hands, a voice called from the kitchen.

“Jamila, is that you?”
“Yes mama”, replied Jamila. Sauntering into the kitchen, she
found her mother seated at the table, peering at her phone screen.
“You know, Jamila, I saw this video on WhatsApp that says that if
you leave half an onion in the corner of a room, it will suck out all
the virus in the air! Why don’t you try that at work?”

Well, some things never changed.
Jamila sighed.

A P r a y e r f o r M y D a u g h t e r
M Y r a a i S h a h B i n t i M i k a i L t a n

Back then, Ida dreamed like she lived: the silk of her favourite
dress like water through her fingers, the smell of Nek Ya’s asam
pedas on the stove, the sound of the radio splintering across the
room; wild music, all kicked-up feet and ephemeral joy.

Here is what Ida dreams of now, in 2032: her daughter. She
has only tattered sense memories — no smells filter through their
oxygen masks, no touch through their mandatory hazmat suits.
Ida dreams in slow motion, Ida dreams like a ghost: watching,
intangible, as the world spins itself past her, hair streaming out just
out of reach.

“I think I am losing my daughter,” she says out loud. MYKerja
replies: The nearest hospital is 2.2km away, 5 minutes with minimal
traffic. What extreme symptoms are your daughter experiencing, and
will this interfere with work?

“I didn’t mean — I’m taking leave today,” Ida says, flustered.
“Monthly hospital check.” She’s still not used to MYKerja, newly
implemented by the government to better facilitate working from
home. MYKerja says she can call it MIKKA, her Friendly AI
Work Colleague, but Ida is too wary of it — she is afraid she will

48

KISAH Futures Anthology

wake up one day in the grip of another wave of disease and she
will have no job, like what happened to thousands post-COVID,
and MYKerja will be there, with its bottomless eyes of JavaScript,
waiting to replace her.

“Anya,” she calls. She’s there, patiently waiting for her suit to
self-sanitise, all of six years old and too small, swimming inside her
suit like it’s a womb. Ida smiles down at her. “Let’s go.”

They live in a self-sustaining farm, the kind that popped up
after the disease mutated and tore through the kampungs, the
cattle, the rural farmers. Whole plantations were destroyed under
the onslaught of draught and flood and virus — all the oil palm,
rubber, padi, gone — and the people had to find ways to make their
own food, fast. It is small comfort that Anya loves it now, the green
infrastructure the government had to invest in to boost local food
production. As they walk she jumps up to touch the trailing vines,
skips over the boreholes they source their unpolluted water from,
until they reach the crumbling, raggedy edges of the road, where
the detention centres rise up, dilapidated barbed wire and red
and white plastic barriers. The homeless live in socially-distanced
plastic cubicles that look like cells. There is a dead bird caught in
the tangled blue of a disposable mask, the ones people use if they
cannot afford the suits. Anya reaches out to touch, fascinated, and
Ida says sharply, “Don’t.”

Avian carriers of the mutated strain used to be electrocuted
in hordes, bodies falling off the telephone wires like locusts in
the desert. Ida remembers this, children playing hopscotch with
dead birds before dying themselves, as they’re scanned through

49

A Prayer for My Daughter

the hospital doors, past the decontainment corridor, and join the
spaced-out, silent queue of children and their parents.

Anya doesn’t cry, and Ida is thankful for this. Crying sounds
too often like it does at work; people gasping for breath and life,
scrabbling at some semblance of air. Anya clutches Ida’s hand
through the mesh and rubber of her suit, and Ida wishes she didn’t
have a job that meant she had to be exposed to the virus most days;
that meant her family trapped in suits at home; that meant she
couldn’t touch her daughter if she cried.

“Sabrina Mizal,” the doctor calls, and Anya steps away from
her, disappears into the room. What does my daughter’s hair feel like?
she wants to ask the doctor’s gloves. Does it feel like the silk of my
favourite dress back then?

They are walking home, bumping slowly like astronauts in
their white hazmat suits. Her daughter’s hair is beautiful, curled
up in her helmet, so much like Ida’s own. I don’t touch you because
I love you, Ida wants to say. She knows at night she will feel the
half-remembered silk of a dress slipping through her fingers, and
she will imagine, for a brief moment, that it is something far more
beautiful.

They told her she was one of the last of her kind. They looked all
over Kuala Lumpur before getting word of her, through hazy stories
and half-recalled visits. When they walked into her tiny ground-
floor flat, they stared at her with barely contained excitement.

Are you..?
Yes.
Oh, we thought it was just a story.
No, I’m definitely real.
Do you still…?
Oh! Not really.
Do you still remember?
How could I forget? I did it every single day.
Well, we have a proposal for you.
And that was how she ended up here, under a large, makeshift

umbrella in the middle of Dataran Merdeka.

She wondered about the others. In the early days of the first
lockdown — was it 20 years ago? No, 25 — many of them had
left the city, back to their kampungs. The ones left in KL, retreated
indoors. They said it was safer like this, and what was there to do

51

The Festival Outside

outside, anyhow? They couldn’t work, and there was barely anyone
around. Better to rest at home, stay away from the virus.

Slowly, their numbers dwindled. When they restricted KL
borders, those in the kampungs gave up all thought of returning.
And working outside, in the thick of a crowd, at high speed, was
a skill you had to build, but there was no one new to train; so
few wanted to do “outside work” anymore. So as the years slunk
by, many forgot their techniques. Others grew old and eventually
passed, taking their tricks and secrets with them.

But now, they said KL was virus-free. For this festival, they had
asked her, very nicely, not to wear a mask. They wanted everyone
coming to feel like “the old days”. To have fun, to go back to what
it was like. A huge city-wide celebration of “going back to normal”.
That’s why they had worked so hard to find people like her, people
used to the bodies and bustle of KL swirling around them 25 years
ago.

But what about…
Nothing to worry about, Makcik.
I’m old, you know. High-risk.
Trust us. No cases in KL for two years. And no local

transmissions in five years.

Can I keep my mask with me?
Can, Makcik.
She tried not to breathe too deeply. Being outside felt
unnatural, with all this air stretching out in every direction. And
she didn’t know how she felt about this breeze fluttering against her
cheeks and lips.

52

KISAH Futures Anthology

Around the Dataran, a hesitant crowd was building. People
still stood apart, the customary two-metre radius. But they were
there, and more were coming. Many even with unmasked faces!

She saw visitors gathering around the umbrellas. Beneath,
others like her were busy. A little muddled and slow perhaps, from
years of no practice. But she could see a spark in them, the warmth
of anticipation spread over their faces.

As she worked, she felt the old familiarity creeping back into
her aged fingers. There was an art to this, a certain rhythmic speed.
Peel, slice, dunk, deep-fry. But actually, it was all the unassuming
in-between moments that separated a good pisang goreng from a
great pisang goreng.

The banana’s texture, just a touch closer to firm than soft. Its
ripe, heady fragrance. Silky-thick batter chilled just enough to crisp
up agreeably. Listening to the boiling oil that smothers the fritters
to quieten down. Recognising that perfect, almost translucent
yellow-gold at which to scoop them out.

A boy, head barely higher than her table, sidled up, eyes open
wide. She felt a touch of nervousness; she couldn’t remember the
last time someone had stood this close. She ventured a rusty smile,
suddenly remembering that he could see it. He stared back at the
growing pile of banana fritters on her table, mouth slightly agape.

She realised he has never seen a food stall, maybe never tasted

a pisang goreng either. She picked one up, offered it to him.

The boy took it, and tentatively bit in. She heard the muffled
crunch, and imagined the warm, oily sweetness spreading through

53

The Festival Outside

his mouth. He looked up at her, and stretched his lips into a big,
greasy, gap-toothed smile.

“Terima kasih, Makcik!”

The great blue sky, seeping through the gaps created by the
curtain, was adorned by golden sunlight. For my wife and me,
today is a special day. To impress her, I got up and put on my best
suit. As I walked to the kitchen, I stood and gazed at her, admiring
how she multitasks cooking and gracefully swaying her hips to the
song playing over the radio. She sensed my presence and giggled
shyly. I ran and gave her a warm embrace, as I was excited to take
her out as planned today.

In recent times, it was difficult to walk out of our condominium
because the government has a strict policy of allowing up to 30%
of individuals out of each residence. So, we have to book with the
superior authorities at the management office to go out on those
days before the slots are full, which is why I booked this special
day for us. Before stepping out, we get sprayed by the disinfection
chamber to get ourselves sanitised. We then held hands and
marched to the heart of Kuala Lumpur.

As we strolled along the Sultan Abdul Samad building, we
passed by a couple showcasing their clothing line. Nowadays, I
can see that fashion trends have shifted. Individuals start wearing

55

Happy Anniversary, Dear

clothes designed to cover their mouth and nose. I recall taking
my wife shopping; most retail stores will not allow them to try on
clothes. Instead, they use a device that can render a hologram to
appear at your body as if you’re wearing the clothing item. Then the
workers will grab the clothes selected from the store and proceed
for payment. Time sure does fly when we don’t have to shop the
traditional way.

I almost forgot that I made reservations for us at a restaurant to
have dinner. So, I booked Grab to take us to our destination. Later,
a car with two seats stopped by, so we hopped in. You’re wondering,
I bet, since this is a two-seater car, where is the driver? Well, the
driver is safe at home controlling the vehicle. Anything can be done
online these days, including driving. More than two people are not
allowed in a car by the government, plus Grab drivers cannot afford
to risk their jobs only because they can’t drive. That also goes for
other vehicle-related occupations like bus drivers, pilots, and many
more.

During the ride, we enjoyed the view of Malaysia’s iconic
structure, the Petronas Twin Towers. It’s like staring out at two
skyscrapers emerging out of the clouds. As soon as we arrived, we
were escorted by an android waiter to our reserved seats. I noticed
that each table was separated into a clear cubicle, but I choose the
one by the balcony with a stunning view of the city at night. But
what’s more stunning tonight is her. She looks as lovely as she has
always been. Technology never failed to exceed my expectations.
Our dinner is well-prepared by a robotic machine that cooks and
serves us a three-course meal. Throughout dinner, we talked and

56

KISAH Futures Anthology

laughed together, how I missed these moments. I hoped that it
would last forever.

I said, “Happy Anniversary, dear” as I squeezed her hand.
She grinned and pulled my hand aside. I kissed her cheek and
said, “I’d like to see my real wife right now.” At first, her face
was somewhat surprised by the words that came from my mouth.
Then I said, “No matter what, you’ll always look amazing to me.”
Then, a hologram emerged from her eyes and revealed my true
wife, sitting on the hospital bed, looking pale with a pair of tubes
in her nostrils and breathing heavily. Two months have passed
since I last kissed my wife. To celebrate this wonderful day, she’s
been manipulating her android self. I’m so grateful that I feel like
she’s so close to me, even though she’s being held in the hospital,
battling for her life. Nothing can stop us from loving each other.
Not even COVID-19.

First it was the perishables. Then people got smart. Shelves
were emptied of canned foods, dried biscuits. They knew it was
going to be the long haul.

You could travel to the farthest mini mart — not even a
supermarket — as far as you could get past the 1-mile radius, and
still nothing. In the end, when riots and looting broke out —
people who were simply trying to feed their hunger — they had to
bring in the military.

I imagine the outskirts are doing better. They have land, and
land means food. When factories started shutting down across
the country, they still had their backyards and empty, open fields.
What little production makes it to the finish line is first given to the
military and police, those working hard to maintain order in the
chaos, then sold to the highest bidders. The leftovers are rationed
to every household, by district then by neighbourhood. That was
when the riots quickly died down. People stayed indoors, as they
were told, in exchange for that little bit of food. It wasn’t the virus
that divided and conquered, in the end. It was the food.

Today is ration day.

If I’m lucky, I might get greens. My muscle cramps are flaring

up again, and the tingling comes at night.

The neighbourhood next to mine got sawi on their ration day
yesterday. I know because I heard the kid next door exclaiming
about it. How his parents got the news, I have no idea. That gave
me hope, though I knew he could have been playing.

My neighbours are the only real humans I’ve heard in the
past nine months. Nine months, long enough to have a baby. The
baby would’ve been born in darkness, shaded by drawn curtains
all up this building and all along this street. For privacy; for fear.
I’d plastered up my windows in the second month of martial law.
Best not to move it now to avoid attracting attention. Quiet is the
best strategy. If they don’t know you’re here, they can’t get you.

I listen intently at the front door and when I’m sure there is
no one outside, quickly unlock the door and place the basket at the
foot of it and close it behind me. I don’t want to risk being seen
by neighbours. In desperate times, those closest to you become the
biggest threat.

Sometimes I think about saying hi, or thank you. Maybe the
troopers aren’t so scary after all. They’re human too, just carrying
out their duty so that they can get their ration. Sometimes I ache to
say something, just to let them know I’m here, all alone. I am also
jealous of them; they walk in the bright corridor that I was once
well-acquainted with. I haven’t seen real light in months. Calcium
is nothing without vitamin D.

A sound at my door, almost imperceptible. I’m scared of
troopers, but even more scared of defying a trooper. I crack my

59

Ration Day

door open half an inch. The boy from next door was stooped over
my basket and he freezes when he sees me. For 12 full seconds
neither of us moves.

I think of shouting for a trooper though I don’t know if any
would be within range. I open my mouth, my throat constricting
to form the first consonant.

“Help—–”
Why did I think of saying that? Before I could, a little hand
appears, clenching something. Sawi? Despite my fear, my hand
takes it. Then the boy was gone.

Later that night, on the rooftop, I would stare out at stretches
of rooftops in the neighbourhood, covered in beans, lettuce,
spinach. All this time I was living in the dark, calcium was growing
up here, a network of resistance.

But as I sit unfurling the leaves of the sawi, my feet tingling,
my eyes trying to make sense of the small scrap of paper with the
challenge —

11pm rooftop
— all I could think of was the little hand on the Outside,
warm and human against mine on the Inside, skins briefly touching
in between two worlds, long enough for me to see the light.

60

“ R e a d y ? ”
Y e e h e n g Y e h

“Yes.” I close my eyes. When I open them again, the market is

all around me.

The cool scent of damp earth, the grey light extending its first
fingertips through the dark, the vendors chattering quietly as they
set up their stalls — this is morning. Just like I remember.

But it isn’t complete. Not yet. A few more moments — here
they come. The patrons. When was the last time I saw an actual
crowd? I reach out to touch the shoulder of an old man hobbling
by with a walking stick. Bony, but warm.

I instinctively jerk my hand back. Such incredible detail that

I’ve almost forgotten where I really am.

I move with the crowd, allowing myself to be carried along like
a leaf in a slow-moving stream. They say that it all started in a wet
market like this one. Now none of this exists anymore. The small
local businesses were the first to disappear. Shopkeepers, hawkers,
roadside sellers. The ones who didn’t have the resources or the
technological know-how to transition to an online model, unlike
the bigger supermarket chains. And with only sporadic monetary
aid from the authorities —well, that was no sustainable plan.

61

“Ready?”

Now this is the only place where we can experience how it

used to be.

I just want to wander around and soak it all in. Take that
heap of vibrant green mangoes. The mangoes that arrive on my
doorstep are always slightly too ripe, their flesh a garish yellow and
almost mushy. Nothing like these. And see, those baskets of tubers,
still rough and chalky with dirt, not yet washed and peeled and
sliced. And the slim green stalks and their spray of green leaves,
unrestrained by vacuum plastic packaging. Even the fish here, with
their flat round eyes, their fine scales glittering against the white
mounds of crushed ice, have their own morbid kind of charm.
Everything is fresh, raw, bursting with a long-lost vitality.

As I walk, I realise that there’s an unfamiliar weight in my
pocket. Oh — a wallet. They must have included it as part of
the experience. I riffle through the different-coloured faces of the
first king, staring out at me solemnly. Right. This is what physical
currency had looked like.

I play-act at grocery shopping, paying with paper notes,
getting back my change in the form of heavy, clinking coins. It
feels strange, at first, to be actually talking to people. To confirm
the freshness of the product, to ask for the price, to smile and say
thank you. Then, maybe to chat about other things. Did we really
use to interact like this, so intimately, as if every stranger was an
old friend? So this was how we used to know our neighbours, our
communities. This was how we learned about each other.

My time must be running out. I shake hands with everyone
who passes, the heavy shopping bags of a bygone era swinging

62

KISAH Futures Anthology

from my elbows. “Hello, hello”, I cry out. I whirl around, trying
to catch a last few desperate glimpses of the world here. I don’t
know why, but it seems important that we don’t forget this. That
this was how we used to be, before—

Darkness. Where am I?
Oh. Yes. The lights in the chamber come on. There are no
grocery bags, no wallet in my hand. I pull the plug out. The museum
attendant is saying something through the glass barrier. What is he
saying? “The simulation is over. Thank you, and please come again.”
I realise my cheeks are stained with tears. “Sorry,” I mutter. It
was just a grocery trip to the past. That’s all. I wipe away the tears
with one sleeve, furiously. “Sorry,” I say again, turning away.

I know there must be other people waiting to use this
simulation. It’s one of the most popular attractions here. But the
attendant waits and lets me collect myself. I can still feel his eyes on
me. Then he says, “It’s okay.”

I turn back, but say nothing.
“It’s okay,” he says again. He looks sad, too. “I understand.”

“Assalamualaikum, I called earlier,” the boy said, through his

worn-out facemask.

He was in the quiet part of Chinatown, past the smoky bars
and perfumed cafes, in a hostel where rainwater seeped through the
walls. The man had just gotten out of the shower and was pulling
up his trousers before he heard the knock on the door.

“Do you have a wristband?” the man said, as he dried off his

long, dishevelled hair with a towel.

The boy pulled up his sleeves, exposing his bare arms. No
tattoos. No scars. No wristband. Only a black smudge from a
railing somewhere. He stared at the hungry man’s beard, which fell
limply from his chin like the falls of Sungai Siput.

“I brought cup noodles, just in case,” the boy said.
“From where?”
“There was some in 7-E, already expired, I told the cashier I’d

take care of it.”

“As long as you didn’t steal,” the man said, stroking his beard.

“OK, come inside.”

64

KISAH Futures Anthology

The boy flung his overstuffed bag onto one of the beds, and

peeled off his mask, leaving it on the nightstand.

“Is this yours?” he asked, patting the blanket.
“You can have it,” the man replied.
The boy took off his shirt as he lay on what was now his bed.
He was skinnier than before, but still had some muscle left. The
man conjured a cigarette from his pocket, lighted it and sat by the
open window. The boy crumpled his nose but said nothing.

“How did you get the room?” he asked.
“I saved up,” the man said, “They only had the twin beds today

so I thought some company would be nice.”

“Yeah, I was already running over when my friend called.”
The man was quiet, sucking on his cigarette.
“Where do you usually sleep?” the boy asked.
“Outside the bank. Lots of lights,” the man said “If the area is
bad. I stay with the ATMs until security chases me away. Got aircon
some more.”

“That’s nice. I stay around the shops. Sometimes I have kaya
toast or nasi lemak when I wake up,” the boy said, “Alhamdulillah.
You’re always five feet away from a friend.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“You’re always five feet away from a friend. It’s something my

mother said.”

The man took a final puff before flicking the cigarette out the

window. He shuffled to his bed, laying over the blankets.

“And where is your mother now?” he asked, turning to the

boy.

65

Kaki Lima

“It’s just me and kakak.”
“You’re not with her?”
“She heard the vaccine was cheaper in Thailand and took a bus
there. But they won’t let her in,” he said. “Since the vaccine came
out, everyone has become crazy. If you don’t have a wristband, you
might as well not exist.”

“It’s always like that, boy. At least now we know why they don’t

like us.”

“Maybe you and I can look behind a pharmacy. I’m sure got

extra kot.”

“You’re thinking like them. You cannot think like them if you

want to get out of this.”

“It’s better than dying,” he muttered.
The boy turned away from the man, counting the cracks on

the wall.

“Boy, do you think we will meet again?” the man asked.
“If it gets better, we won’t,” the boy replied solemnly.
“The paper told me my son died, even though he got the shot.”
“Betul ke?” he said, turning back to the man. “They spent

years on it.”

“Yes, but the virus got to him first.”
“I’m sorry.”
“I’ve been wondering what to tell him when I meet him
someday,” the man sighed. “I wanted to tell him that if you only
take, life finds a way to take it back. And I was done taking.”
“That’s good. I’m sure he knows you did your best.”

66

KISAH Futures Anthology

The boy looked at the window, at the blue light already peeking

through the curtains.

“Do you mind if I sleep first?” the boy asked.
“Yes, get some rest. We have to leave by noon.”
“Wake me a bit earlier. I want to shower before we leave.”
“I will.”

“Shen Yang is here — Nadir, please turn on your camera —
Timo, please mute yourself — Excuse me, who is HotMess21?!
— Farah, we can hear your dad singing ABBA in the background.”
The class burst out in giggles, followed by a spray of questions:
“Cikgu, who is ABBA? Farah can you sing too? Sing for us!

Who is the Dancing Queen?”

So here I am holed up in my room, in my blouse-and-
sweatpants combo trying to control 30 Standard 6 students. And of
course, our government-mandated-video-conferencing-app needs
updating. Again.

They told us that things would return to normalcy after the
clinical trials for the vaccine were over in 2021. The only things
becoming normal were fast-fashion PPE, Social Media Detox
programs, and the unpredictable interruptions to banal routines.

in Ipoh, our wedding and honeymoon have been postponed
indefinitely.

I let out a sigh so loud it caused silence to ensue among
the students in the virtual classroom. It wasn’t the first time my
pessimism commanded more attention than the lesson I had to
attend to.

Unlike myself, my students were excited for today’s lesson.
Show and tell has been a highlight of my online classes — a
chance for me to sit back and relax and let the kids speak without
restraint (well, kind of ).

“Nadir, I still can’t see your video.”
“But cikgu, I don’t have a camera,” Nadir responded.
A common excuse, but for Nadir, his family just couldn’t

afford one.

Poorer students like Nadir were reliant on large corporations
to provide the technology for online learning. Thankfully, closing
businesses provided a huge supply of used devices that could be
redistributed. It took time for these to get to the students though.

“It’s OK Nadir, you’ll have your turn when you get your laptop

OK?”

“Farah, has your dad stopped singing yet? What do you have

for us today?”

69

Abed’s Garden

One-by-one, students whipped out their latest muses: Their
latest handphone, The Diary of a Wimpy Kid book collection, a
completed Among Us Lego set.

“Um... Cikgu, is it OK if I bring my laptop outside?” Abed’s
voice interrupted the class. “I want to show you all something but
we have to be outside.”

A little stumped by the change of pace, I agreed, while the

other kids glued themselves to the screen.

“So uh, my favourite possessions in the world are my plants,
which are in this solar-powered greenhouse. Abah and I are working
on it! It has sensors that can tell how humid it is in here, and if it
gets too dry, the sprinklers will automatically spray water all over
the place…”

I did not know Abed’s interest in gardening nor the fact that
he spent the last 6 months of quarantine creating a personal utopia
of sylvan colour. I noticed the other students paying attention, a
rarity in our classroom. Some of them looked confused, as if cili
padi trees were extra-terrestrial, or purple carrots could give them
superpowers.

The way he spoke of his paradise rang with sentiments of
biophilia — how he is selling his ripened tomatoes to his neighbors,
his mum extracting essential oils out of the flowers, and how he’d
love to grow trees and flowers in Malaysia’s concrete jungles,
discover caves, and take care of national parks.

“Amazing, Abed!” I exclaimed. My pessimism dimmed in the
shadow of Abed’s child-like faith. Abed grinned with cheeks as
flushed as his cherry tomatoes.

70

KISAH Futures Anthology

Abed’s enthusiasm stirred the entire class. It opened the
students to talk about their ambitions — from energy engineers,
botanists, to city planners and teachers — unhindered by the grim
reality of COVID-19. I felt the energy dip as I gave them a written
assignment to wrap up class.

“The new normal is their normal,” I thought to myself as I
dressed in full. Peering out my window, I noticed for the first time
my neighbours’ kids in their pajama bottoms and school-attire tops
snacking on fresh tomatoes from their own balcony garden patch.

She is lost for ideas. It’s 2:09 p.m., and Geeta’s been scrolling
her phone, looking for inspiration for the next ‘viral piece.’ Having
been in the world of journalism for half a decade, Geeta knows what
works. But she also knows that ‘virality’ cannot be systematised or
predicted. Her editor insists otherwise, often quoting Maugham:
“I write only when inspiration strikes, fortunately, it strikes every
morning at nine o‘clock sharp.” Geeta has to concur, despite her
body’s reluctance. But she’s good at her craft, being the writer of
“7 Types of TikTok Meme” and “What Kind of a Roti Are You?”.
Her mother was a Roti Bomb, due to her knack for over-indulging
on food.

Maybe chicken rice would help, Geeta wonders as her tummy
growls as if on cue. Checking her purse for the necessary items
before rising, she remembers the mask as she leaves. Wearing a
mask is now a social norm. Everyone knows someone close who was
down with COVID. Everyone is traumatised, and going out ‘bare-
faced’ now invokes the same effect as public indecency. Just last
week, a man was refused entry to the MRT. “7 Types of Maskers”.

72

KISAH Futures Anthology

A jolt of inspiration descends on her, and she swiftly jots it down
for later reference.

As she walks off into the scorching sun, an instant regret for
wearing a fleece top sweeps over her. The pandemic caused an
exponential increase in demand for micro-logistics, resulting in a
steep rise in carbon emission. Its impact has caused temperatures to
rise ever since. Malaysia has always been notorious for its heat and
humidity. Still, Geeta used to be able to enjoy the cooling breeze
after a heavy downpour. Now, it is continuously warm. Heavy.
Suffocating. Then again, her mother taught her to always appear
presentable. “Always put your best foot forward,” she’d say. Geeta
wonders if it’s worth the sweat.

Maybe an apple pie after, she thinks to herself. How typical
for a Malaysian to think about other food while getting food, she
chuckles when reaching the shop. “Aunty Lee, roast chicken rice
one take away. Thank you.” The vendor nods, sweat glistening
off her wrinkled forehead. Geeta feels for her, the humidity she
must be feeling beneath her mask. She’s one of the last few small
vendors. The lockdown limited everyone to food delivery services,
causing restaurant chains to easily outcompete micro-vendors.
Many couldn’t even survive a month. Now, Geeta tries her best to
eat here whenever she can, glancing at the empty tables within. “5
Underrated Food Stalls in Klang Valley Everyone Should Visit”, she
jots down.

“That’ll be four-fifty.” Geeta looks up as her food is handed to
her. Reaching into her purse before remembering that cash is now
a thing of the past, she opens her e-payment app and scans the QR

73

If Only

code at the counter, thumbs instinctively typing in her PIN. Fierce
advocacy arose to phase out banknotes as it helped in preventing
the spread of viral diseases. She even wrote a piece on it, titled
“4 Reasons Money is a Relic of the Past”. Her mother disagreed,
believing that the sudden transition had negative impacts on the
poor and illiterate. Even her mother, who had graduated in the
80s, needed time to familiarise herself with new technologies. Then
again, in times of global panic, changes happen almost instantly.

“Thank you ah Aunty, you take care, okay,” Geeta smiles
before turning to leave. She reciprocates with a slight squint at the
corner of her eyes. Geeta wonders what’s on her mind and whether
she’s coping well. She remembers her mother’s lesson of ‘Sonder,’
the word for realising that everyone’s life is as brilliant and intricate
as ours. Her mother must know; she always lingered and chatted
with everyone when she brought Geeta along for Pasar Pagi. She
misses those trips. If only she’s still here now. If only the pandemic
didn’t happen. If only she hadn’t been one of the unfortunate 2%.
If only, she chokes.

Bell and Octavia scrambled up the hill behind the abandoned

mall.

“Anneh, wait for me!” panted Octavia.
The short climb was already taxing her fragile lungs. And the
N95 mask was not helping. The midday sun beat down ferociously
on them; temperatures well in the high 30s. But she had been
waiting weeks for her birthday present. She wasn’t giving up now!
Bell slowed reluctantly, nervously tugging the brim of his cap
further down. Octavia had pressured him for weeks to take her to
see the ‘small jungle’ that he and his friends curi-curi sometimes
went to lepak at. She had never been out of the house in the short
6 years of her life apart from hospital visits in specially insulated
and filtered taxis. COVID-19, TrinCov and Virus X were rampant.
She caught up, huffing and panting furiously, whatever tiny bit
of her face visible above the N95 mask, furrowed in determination.
“It’s okay anneh, no one is around. I’ll be fine!” she promised,

tugging on his sleeve.

Her earnestness and puppy eyes could make even a rock melt.

75

The Birthday Gift

“Okay, Ona. Let’s hurry and get to shade at the walls.”
When they reached, Octavia ripped off her mask and collapsed,

gasping for air like a fish out of water.

“Ona! Are you okay? Do you need your pump?” He panicked,
reaching into his backpack for her precious inhaler. Breathlessly she
shook her head, sucking in the life-giving, yet so dangerous air,
lungs working double-time. But at least on this desolate hill, far
from anyone, the only thing to worry about was the air pollution.

Bell was getting more and more worried. So many things
could go wrong. Someone would catch Octavia as an under-8
minor who was out. Their parents would be fined RM1000 for
letting an at-risk person out of the house — even though they had
snuck out. And if she got sick, they would have to rush her to the
ICU again; their parents could not afford it.

But this was all Octavia had wanted for her birthday: to go out
of the house and see “the small jungle and the scary lake” that he
showed her pictures of so often.

He tried quelling his racing mind as they walked past the
crumbling cement walls and rusted chained gates. Drooping sadly
from the gate by one end was a faded sign: Closed Temporarily
For Repairs.

When they reached a large rain tree that overlooked the

stadium, Bell boosted her up into the lower branches.

Octavia’s eyes shone with delight at yet another part of the
adventure. She knew his stories so well, he didn’t even have to tell
her where to climb.

76

KISAH Futures Anthology

They shimmied over the wall. And the jungle was everything
she had imagined, only better. The murky pools in front of her
hid mysteries. There was a small pool that went down forever and
Bell said there were big fishies in it that could eat her. Beside it was
another Olympic-sized pool, surface covered in lily pads and green
scum.

Under their branch was a tall, rusty diving platform. Vines
and plants had almost swallowed it, but its top strained free. They
dropped down from the branches onto the creaking, shaking
platform.

Thunk!
And the jungle erupted into a cacophony of bird calls,
screaming at the intruders that dared disturb their siesta. The
vegetation growing out of the gym’s windows jerked violently as
unseen creatures scrambled away. On the right, she could see a tiny
bit of the grandstand that was exposed where part of the wall had
collapsed on the vegetation.

Bell pulled out the Swiss roll he had bought with his carefully
saved pocket money. As they lunched under the shade of the
enormous rain tree, Octavia soaked in the new smells, sights, and
sounds.

“Happy Birthday Ona. I’m glad your wish came true. One
day, when all the viruses are gone and I’m big and make lots of
money, I’ll fix your lungs and take you to a big jungle kay?”

Octavia smiled up at her beloved big brother and hugged him

tightly.

An ear-piercing alarm blared throughout the neighbourhood,
followed by the soft humming buzz of modern engines trekking up
poorly maintained roads.

A familiar irritation burned at the tips of Ayeesha’s skin at the
noise, signaling all residents to be on stand-by. The racket jarred her
meditative session with warm coffee and a highly-sought after novel
— paperback version. A rare gem in the midst of the prevalent
pandemic haunting the world since late 2019; which led to a
decreased production of paper.

With a heavy sigh, she set her book onto the marble kitchen
counter and made her way to the front door; but not before putting
on a flimsy white hazmat suit, courtesy of the government. Once
outside, she was greeted by the rare sight of her neighbours, all
adorning the same protective gear, coming out from identical one-
storey houses, wearing the same tired expressions.

Slowly driving past the neighbourhood was a large rectangular
lorry, with its shiny black surface reflecting the afternoon sun. It
was a stark contrast to the old lorries built mainly for practicality
and low cost. This vehicle was crafted out of expensive lightweight

78

KISAH Futures Anthology

carbon fibre composite which caused the manufacturing process to
be more efficient and flexible.

The annoying alarm ceased once every resident was stationed
at their respective doorstep. In a flashy display, the vehicle extended
two claws out, setting down big black boxes of plastic onto each
home before driving away.

Ayeesha walked towards the box a few paces away from her
doorsteps and typed in her security mail code. With a satisfying
click, the lid flew open to reveal a single piece of paper with a
familiar newspaper format.

The headline read: Could 2030 be the end of COVID-19?
She rolled her eyes, not bothering to scan the QR code
on the paper to read its contents. This was what the media had
promoted every year, the “end” of the pandemic, yet the situation
had only worsened each year with 28% of the whole Malaysian
population currently infected. She doubted this year would be any
more effective at finding a vaccine than last year. Even the best
medication had only been able to subdue the symptoms.

After shoving the paper to the corner of the box, she found
herself staring at a thick piece of soft foam which sheltered a glass
case. Considering the price of glass these days, whatever lay within
it could be valuable.

Her heart dropped. Understanding seeped into her mind as
she gingerly picked up the case. Her hands shook as she walked
unsteadily back into her house, leaving the black box for the vehicle
to pick up later.

79

Isolation

Once the door was closed, the excitement bubbling in her

came out in the form of tears, anxious but hopeful.

She set the case onto the coffee table before clumsily opening
her hazmat suit while staggering into her bedroom. There was no
time to waste.

With only a brief thought, she took out the pink baju kurung
which she had reserved for her best days. Today was one of them.
Wiping her tears, she attempted to put on makeup while shivering
in anticipation. Her mascara had smudged slightly but she was too
impatient to care.

She opened the glass case from the living room, revealing
a cylindrical chip the size of her thumb. There was no need for
instructions as she had spent countless hours studying this device
when its prototype was launched.

She squeezed the chip twice and a vertical beam of light

escaped, momentarily blinding her.

But when she opened her eyes, there standing in front of her
in her living room were her parents, their arms wide open and eyes
brimming with tears.

Without hesitation, she jumped onto their holograms, and

they caught her.

Instead of distant worried gazes on a polished screen for years,
she finally felt their comforting embrace as though they were with
her.

The hug broke apart as her lungs caved in and she fell into a

coughing fit. A reassuring hand warmed her shoulder.
No immediate cure, but a reason to live on.

Aisya and I bought Cody the first day we were allowed out of
the house, as a symbol of our resilience. We were best friends, two
art graduates with good CVs and nice degrees, finding ourselves
unemployed and depressingly broke when the pandemic hit. We
bought him to cheer ourselves up. He’s a fighting fish, and lives in
a bubble-shaped glass bowl in our bathroom.

Two weeks after the first RMCO, we drove up to Cameron
Highlands for a cuti-cuti Malaysia to get out of our self-pitying
funk. Aisya used to go to the highlands all the time, and on our
drive up, she talked without stopping about the lush greenery, the
strawberry popsicles, the feeling of having momentarily escaped
civilisation and returned to a Malaysia that felt simpler, less
terrifying somehow. Not quite so fast.

When we arrived, the highlands weren’t exactly what Aisya
had promised. The air was crisp and cool, and bright red flowers
hung on the trees like jewellery, but this portrait of calm was spoilt
by the construction buildings spearing their ugly heads through
the trees. All around, the buzz of drills and cars pierced the air like
a neoliberal scream. It was the gentrifying sound of natural beauty

81

Fighting Fish

turning sour, like a rotting strawberry. “It’s all so different,” Aisya
kept saying, as if stunned into repeating herself, like a broken toy.
“I don’t recognise where I am.”

On our way home, we stopped at a roadside stall for a snack.
It was manned by only one shopkeeper, a young man who smiled
hopefully when we arrived. I looked at the cheap plastic keychains,
the reams of poor quality t-shirts pressed against one another on the
hangers, the clunky, non-recyclable fridge magnets that inevitably
end up in landfills. The excess of it all was overwhelming, and
vaguely sickening. I’d never felt such an aversion to things before.
Maybe isolation had done that to me.

We couldn’t leave without buying something. Aisya and I paid
for two small Totoro keychains, RM5 each. The shopkeeper smiled
and said, with soft gratitude, “Thank you so much.” We walked
home in silence, neither of us able to put our heartbreak into words.
That was almost nine months ago. As soon as we got back to
KL, we started the project. All shreds of self-pity had disappeared.
Everyone knew the creative arts were hit hard by the pandemic, but
what we hadn’t seen was that this wasn’t just affecting photographers,
fashion designers, hipster Instagram personalities and recent
graduates. There were more vulnerable creative communities whose
livelihoods were at stake: gift shop proprietors, local printmakers,
florists. We’d seen it. We felt ashamed of ourselves. The words kita
jaga kita had taken on a whole new meaning.

For two days, we sat on the sofa, illuminated only by the glow
of our shared laptop screen. Our concept was to start a grassroots
community intent on ecologising the Malaysian arts scene. What

82

KISAH Futures Anthology

began as an Instagram account soon flourished into a website, and
then an app. Within months, we were getting noticed by other
local arts faculties in Malaysia: OUR ArtProjects slid into our
DMs, Ilham Gallery wrote a feature about us on their newsletter,
Cult Creative reached out for an interview.

By connecting these two communities — the struggling artists
among young, online-savvy KLites with those from humbler and
more peripheral backgrounds — we figured we could ecologise the
scene on a profound level. It would be a symbiotic relationship,
linking urban artists with rural veterans who had to tough it out in
their respective kampungs. Our platform created a community to
make art in all forms — from cheap souvenirs to auctioned prints
— more sustainable and eco-friendly. Our platform proved that the
way forward was through collaboration and informal education,
from conversations and understanding.

Fighting fish are extremely territorial, and flare up when they
perceive a threat to their immediate environment. But they can also
live peacefully with other docile fish, and are stimulated by their
surroundings. That’s what this felt like, making this. We’d proven
that in times of duress, the arts can fight to survive.

I felt a slight burn in my lungs after taking in the fresh
morning air outside the prison gates. “Over here!” called out my
sister, waiting outside her driverless rickshaw. After fifteen years and
two kids, she hasn’t changed much apart from her greying hair. “It’s
so good to see you, Along.” I bowed gently.

“I’m just glad it’s finally over, Adik. Come on, I know you can’t
wait to see Mak,” she said while keying in our next destination on
her foldable tablet. As we stepped into the rickshaw I nodded with
a smile, acknowledging her usual ability to read my mind.

Back when Mak was juggling jobs to make ends meet, Along
tried her best to keep her little teenage brother out of trouble. To
me she was such a nosy nuisance; always one step ahead of whatever
mischievous plans I had. In hindsight, perhaps my time in prison
was for the best. She got her chance to live her own life, and being
in solitude helped me to find peace within my rebellious self.

The electric rickshaw wasn’t the quickest mode of transport,
so it was safe to stick my neck outside for a better look. Not much
had changed about Kuala Lumpur, though it now looked a bit
deserted. Since the Uprising, people moved away to places that

84

were more affordable and less crowded. Naturally other towns
began to grow, and this city was not attractive as it used to be.
Along said since there was a labour shortage, employers don’t
mind hiring even ex-convicts for decent job openings; though I
didn’t get her joke about it being harder for ex-politicians. An old
cellmate once suggested I should try head up north where there
was plenty of trade-related jobs near the new Thai Canal.

As we reached the city centre, Along pointed to one of the old
office towers with a refurbishment sign at its entrance. Apparently
her current house was getting too cramped for her husband’s
consultancy business and the teenage kids wanted more privacy.
“They suggested this place as a suitable home-office.”

I gave a puzzled look. “Who?’’
I immediately regretted that question as my lecturer-sister
went on a history lesson on how people-powered data and self-
learning algorithms have been helping everyone. “Oh, you’ll find
out all about it later,” she cut her story short after noticing my
distracted gaze at delivery drones flying over the clear blue skies.

Our ride slowed to a halt once we reached the cemetery
gates. Along immediately went to scan in her pre-booked visiting
time slot to release the gate locks. Mak was one of the many
pandemic casualties, and the regret of being helpless during her
final moments still hurt to this day. “I miss her too,” said a teary
Along as we approached Mak’s grave. I could sense her guilt of not
being the dependable big sister after Mak’s passing.

85

KitajagaKita

“You’ve done your best. She will be happy with how we turned
out today,” I consoled her. We both said our prayers and promised
Mak another visit soon.

After stepping outside the gates, Along handed me an envelope.
“Adik, you know I can’t be there for you all the time, but I think
they can help you with starting over.” Inside was a silver coloured
tablet, with an onion-looking panel to scan my thumbprint.

“Bawang?” I chuckled at the resemblance as I glimpsed through
the daily list of recommendations of a new future displayed on my
tablet screen.

First recommendation today: A complimentary welcome-back
lunch for two at an old dining haunt. Tomorrow: Computer re-
training lessons from a former schoolmate.

I have a strong feeling I’m going to be just fine, Along.

The light from the screen of his laptop was blinding. His
article for The Bulletin lay unfinished. Writer’s block — the curse of
all journalists. His fingers hovered over the keyboard as he heaved a
huge sigh, hoping for some inspiration to magically hit him on the
head. His stomach growled.

“Layla,” he called, “I feel like eating… nasi lemak. Order me
the nearest one. And don’t forget to tell the guy to leave it at the
door.”

His phone screen lit up immediately, followed by a sleek

female voice that answered.

“Noted. Your nasi lemak will arrive in….20 minutes.”
“What! That’s too long. Cancel it, I’ll get something myself.”
As he closed the door of his apartment, he noticed his

neighbour who lived across him was also leaving hers.

Darn it. This was exactly why he had originally planned to

order in: the fewer the social interactions, the better.

He quickly looked down to the floor, but it was too late; he
had accidentally caught her eye. The woman gave a quick move
of her lips as though she was about to smile before mimicking

him. Richard painfully walked a step behind her to avoid further
interaction as they headed for the elevator.

After exiting the elevator, Richard strode to the intended stall
and proceeded to an ordering machine and paid with a tap of his
card. He stood back and observed the stall; the place was desolate
and silent.

Years ago, there would have been a crowd of customers, with
workers serving them. But now, with the danger of the virus, it
was safer to have ordering machines. In fact, it didn’t look like
anyone was taking care of the stall at all, if it wasn’t for a huge
screen displaying numbers and a flap in which the food was pushed
through, not unlike pet doors. For sanitary purposes, the food was
prepared behind a blank wall — not a person was in sight. Richard
felt a pang but brushed it aside.

The digits on the screen matched Richard’s receipt number
and a brown package was pushed through the flap. Richard
promptly took the package and within minutes, was back inside
his apartment.

In his haste, he knocked over a photo frame and the sound of

glass breaking pierced his ears.

Richard turned back and froze when he realised what had
broken. Gingerly, he picked up the photograph from the floor. It
was a picture of his family: his parents sitting at the centre, his
two sisters and himself standing behind them. They were beaming
for the camera because no one could have predicted what would
happen.

It was taken a month before his father’s death to the
COVID-19 virus, which caused his mother to be so ill with grief
that she remained in bed for several months, refusing to do much
but cry and sleep. His sisters were too busy with their careers to care
for their mother. And himself? He couldn’t believe it. His father was
gone — his hero and only friend.

Richard sat down at his desk, photograph still in hand.
Opening the email that was sent 4 days ago, his laptop screen
screen displayed:

Dear Mr. Richard Lim,
We regret to inform you that your employment at The Bulletin is
terminated henceforth due to the economic crisis…

As he stared at the screen, he felt droplets of water falling on
the photograph and realised he was crying. This uncharacteristic
burst of emotion was out of character. What was happening to him?

I need people... But he had no one to turn to.
Richard opened the article that he had been trying to write
for the past week and stared at the title. ‘The Death of Human
Interaction’.There was never a more fitting title.

“Layla, I…. I need help. How…. how do I…..get people?”
“I’m sorry, I do not understand the question.”
“I NEED PEOPLE”
“Understood. Calling PEOPLE.”
The dial tone rang.

“Hello, you have reached PEOPLE. PEOPLE is fully

“I don’t think I can make it ’til next week, I can feel the cancer
spreading in me…” said father weakly as he tried to hide his pain
from his teenage daughter.

“I’m getting close appa, I’m already moving up the ranks
and within a few more days, I should get my final exam score and
would certainly qualify into one of those e-residency programs,”
said Vrushti in a hopeful tone, wishing it would alleviate her father’s
pain.

Doubt was written all over Vrushti’s face as all her hard work
was gradually coming undone as her father’s health continued to
deteriorate. But in her heart, she knew education was the only way
out of her misery. The faster she moved up the ranks, the faster she
would qualify for an e-resident citizenship.

The year is 2050; just 30 years after the COVID-19 pandemic
altered the social structure of the world. A world now run by robots
and algorithms. A world where information is the greatest currency
and data is the new oil. As the world spiralled into late-stage
capitalism, big corporations ascended into power and peripheral
countries like Malaysia are now subject to the power of the global

91

Edurena: The Fate of Vrusthi

elites. When the pandemic reached its peak, human population in
cities and developed countries were significantly lowered. While the
ruling class and powerful elites sheltered in their tall towers, the
working class became sacrificial lambs.

When the virus eventually died off, the elites came out only
to notice their cities had all the resources and facilities, but no
population to advance their societies. So, the powerful did what
any entity would do to maintain its dominance in the global
order: it got big corporations to invest in smaller countries like
Malaysia. Further reducing the sovereignty of these countries, and
erasing the imaginary boundaries of nation-states, simultaneously
enhancing the power of big corporations and the elites.

The investment took the form of physical facilities built in
these countries. Only e-residents are given access to these state-
of-the-art facilities, and in order to be an e-resident, you need
to be chosen by one of the elites by participating in the global
education system. As national education systems do not exists
anymore, all individuals go through the global education system
where they are given a rank based on their intellectual ability,
emotional competence, and mental stability. The higher your
rank, the easier for you to be picked by one of the global elites to
become an e-resident, and ultimately advance their societies in
the future. But for Vrusthi, her only intention is to save her father,
and she knows the cancer vaccine is only available in the resource-
rich hospitals owned by the global elites in Malaysia.
“Welcome to Edurena — the global test.”
“Are you ready to play?”

92

KISAH Futures Anthology

“You are at the final stage of your test. Let’s begin.”
Vrusthi showed no signs of lethargy as she had been on the
test for the past 14 hours. She didn’t want to waste any time, as
with each passing hour, her father’s condition worsened. Cruising
through the test, Vrusthi received a perfect score and was ranked
Top 10 globally. Immediately, a hologram appeared in Vrusthi’s
room.

“Hello there, I am from the Danish government and I’d like
to congratulate you on your remarkable score. Now, I would like
to offer you a spot in our e-resident programme. Would you be
interested?”

Vrusthi had been waiting for this for years. She gleefully

replied, “Yes, yes! I am!”

“Being a Danish citizen means you can access all our facilities,
from learning hubs to hospitals. In a couple of years, when your
service is required, you would be flown to the Copenhagen colony.
So this also means, you are no longer a citizen of Malaysia — you
will be granted a stay-visa but you can no longer use Malaysian
facilities, but as you’re aware the Malaysian facilities can never
match what we have.”

Vrushti ended the call in delight knowing her father was going
to be saved. As her father shared Vrusthi’s joy, he began to think:
Are we colonised?

“So, how was it today?”
“It was okay. The usual, you know.”
We talk on-screen every first Monday of the month and this
is how our conversation would start. I am starting to forget how
his body attaches to his legs—we never stand far enough from our
devices, and we never meet in person anymore.

Not since 15 October 2021.
Honestly, though, it wasn’t okay. It never is, although
that’s what I always say. I hate doing the SCS. It’s short for Safe
COVID-19 Strategies but really, it means Stab-Choke-Swab. Why
haven’t they found a better way to do this?

“Still negative?”
“Yeah, still negative.”
“That’s good, right?”
I want to scream at him. I’m stabbed twice every month—
once for the live virus, once for the test-vaccine—and then later I’m
choked with a probe as they swab my insides. How is this good? I
want to yell at him, but instead, I say—

“Yeah, it’s good.”

“It’ll be over soon. Be patient. You’re helping millions of

people by…”

I let his voice drone off. This is the speech. I’ve heard it 27
times, and it is always the same. At first, I was hopeful. I was even
proud that I had been chosen to be part of this programme, this
strategy, that would bring the world back to pre-COVID-19 times.
It was the luck of the draw, he told me when we first met. We
both had face masks on, but that was the extent of our similarities.
He was dressed in a full suit despite the heat; I was in a plain tee and
knee-length shorts and sweating through every pore. He was calm
and reassuring; I was nervous and excited. He was going to be my
sponsor; I was one of the privileged few to be chosen from Kuala
Lumpur to participate in SCS. One of ten, he told me precisely.

I counted myself lucky then. I was out of work, out of food,
out of cash. My landlord was kicking me out of the apartment,
and my cat had run off. SCS would provide a sterile space for me
to spend my days, where I would also get three meals a day, some
snacks in between, all my daily necessities, and Netflix.

“Can I have a cat?” I had asked him.
“No.” He was prudent with his words.
We shook hands at the end of that meeting, which was an odd
thing to do. But I saw him wipe down with sanitiser as he left, so
I guessed that he only offered his hand as a form of respect for the
past. About ten minutes after he left, a black Proton Perdana with
blacked-out windows stopped by the side of the road where I was
waiting. Two people in full PPE greeted me, gave me a wristband
to put on, and led me into the car.

Lucky Draw

Two hours later, I was settled into my unit. MY-KL-04i. That

was 872 days ago.

“…success in the near future. Our scientists are pushing for—”
“What’s it like out there?”
He pauses, frowning, confusion clouding his eyes for a brief
second, and I immediately regret blurting out that question. What
if they remove me from the strategy? Where would I go? How
would I survive? I feel my heart racing, and the small red lights on
my wristband start to blink.
“What do you mean?”
I search my mind for something to say. I force my heart to

calm down. The blinking lights stop.
“I mean, how’s the research?”
He smiles at my question. I exhale.
“Our scientists are pushing forward with new discoveries, and

your continued participation is very valuable to…”

Again, I let his voice drone off. I’ve heard it 27 times, and it is

always the same.

Kalyani stood at the entrance to the hall; sweat prickled her
palms and began to seep into the yellow cloth bundle that she
clutched in her hennaed hands. The turmeric that was used to dye
the fabric would stain her skin; she wondered whether the priest
would notice the imprint of her perspiration as she handed him
the coconut.

Inside the hall, it will be air-conditioned, she reminded herself

as she ran through the wedding planner’s instructions.

Wait for the music.
Enter the foyer and turn right.
Proceed slowly down steps.
Remember to smile.
Remove sandals at the platform’s edge.
Walk to Sanjay and sit on his left. Wait, or was it right?
Panic careened though Kalyani before she reigned in the
sensation. She would just sit on whichever side of the dais that was
not occupied, of course.

“Amma I’m thirsty, I want soda thanni,” whined a child from
inside the hall. The parental response was muffled; Kalyani could

97

Coming Soon

not see the guests she knew were seated beyond the partition a few
feet away from her, just past the propped open double doors. Twin
ropes of jasmines and marigolds framed the entrance; the decorator
had also incorporated the neon red number one sign above the door
into a floral banner that now read 2 Become 1.

Cheesy, but cute, thought Kalyani.
It had been tough deciding between Matrimony Box Office
and Temple Golden Village as their wedding venue. Sanjay had
plumped for the latter because they were throwing in free popcorn
to occupy the guests when Kalyani would exit the ceremony
midway to change from her engagement saree into her bridal one.
But Kalyani had been sold on Matrimony Box Office’s virtual rice-
blessing feature; instead of having the guests flinging handfuls of
coloured rice at them when Sanjay tied the sacred yellow string
around her neck, the 70-foot high screen behind them would
instead shower down digital rice on the nuptials.

It is less wasteful, said Kalyani. Sanjay did not argue.
Hurried footsteps echoed in the corridor behind her and
Kalyani turned slightly to see her Aunty Roja and Uncle Ram,
huffing up the slight incline. Her aunt was cosseted in a bright
red silk saree and a gloriously inappropriate amount of jewellery;
the diamonds in her earlobes glittered under the downlights as she
turned to her husband and hissed:

“I told you we were late, look the ponnu is about to go in.
Why did you insist on the basement carpark when we could have
just dropped it off at the valet? Now there are only going to be seats
left in the back row.”

98

KISAH Futures Anthology

Aunty Roja gave Kalyani a peacock-eyeshadowed glance.
“Darling, the saree is draped very nicely and all but just ask the
make-up artist to do a touch-up so your eyes don’t look so tired,
OK? The lighting in these places is not very good sometimes. Tell
her Ram,” insisted her aunt before sweeping into the hall.

Her uncle did not respond but instead beamed at Kalyani as

he walked past her.

“I think you look like Goddess Amman herself,” he whispered

as he followed Aunty Roja in.

Kalyani felt a rush of affection for him.
“Aiyo, how am I supposed to squeeze past all of you to get
to the middle”, rang out her aunt’s voice. “Go on, move. All you
young people can get up easily and scoot to the middle, I need
space at the aisle. Move all the way, you all think what, you have
tickets is it? Huh, at least now there is a spare seat next to me to put
my handbag.”

Kalyani smiled, trying to imagine what the theatre seating
would look like with patrons dressed to the nines. She and Sanjay
had their first date at this very hall two years ago, back when it was
still a cinema. Back when there were cinemas, she thought wistfully.
The first few shrill notes of the nadeswaram penetrated the air;

the rustling and voices from within the hall died down.

Kalyani took a deep breath and exhaled.
It was showtime.

Professor Hisham and his expedition team ventured
tentatively into the lush vegetation of Ulu Baram, Sarawak. After
a sweltering and sweat-drenched week, they were now faced with
an unrelenting downpour. As rain lashed across their face shields
and blurred their vision, Professor Hisham finally conceded defeat
and ordered his men to make camp at a relatively dry spot under
the acacia canopies. While he sat surveying this remote part of
the Borneo jungle where the last of the nomadic Penan tribe still
roamed, he reflected that even though the COVID-19 pandemic
10 years ago had largely altered the urban landscape, these pristine
woodlands remained largely unchanged.

His mind turned to the series of events that had led to the
urgent necessity of this expedition. 10 years after the Great
Pandemic of 2020, a newly mutated strain of SARS-CoV-3,
E815L, had emerged and now held the world in its merciless grip.
Due to its high infectivity and fatality rate, a set of severe, almost
draconian, lockdown rules had been imposed to curb its spread,
but to little avail.

100

KISAH Futures Anthology

Two months ago, a family of Penan tribe members, oblivious
to these rules, had come to Long Lama to barter with a tradesman.
Under the new rules, they were forced to stay with the tradesman
until the lockdown was lifted. When the tradesman began
developing respiratory symptoms a week later, the two families
were tested daily for two weeks. While every one of the tradesman’s
family members eventually fell ill with the virus, the Penan family
had the doctors perplexed. It seemed that despite being in close
proximity with the infected group the whole time, even freely
sharing meals and amenities, every one of the Penans had tested
negative for the antibody, RNA, and antigen.

“Even RNA?” Professor Hisham could still remember his
conversation with the director of Sarawak General Hospital, Dr.
Roland. “But that would mean that the virus, upon contact with
host cells, has failed to enter and replicate.”

“Yes, and we know how rare that is with this particular virus.”
“Send me the swabs and the blood samples of this family. We

need to take a good look.”

The answer came two weeks ago. Professor Hisham had
conducted genome sequencing on the DNA of all seven Penans
in his lab in Universiti Malaya and the results had opened up an
unexpected possibility of new cures. The Penans, it turned out, had
an obscure mutation in their genes — one which suppressed the
expression of a human cell receptor, hDPP4, which is tantamount
for SARS-CoV-3 entry into host cells. If this gene mutation could
be incorporated into gene therapy, perhaps the world could finally

101

The Wilderness

return to the pre-2020 norm that it dreamt about. For now, more
research and DNA samples were needed.

The Penans, however, had resolutely returned to their
encampment deep in Ulu Baram soon after the lockdown was
lifted. And Professor Hisham was determined to track them down.

“NO!!!!”
Professor Hisham turned to see their guide, Ulet, waving at

him from a distance. There was anguish in his voice.

As they rushed towards the spot, the team could smell the
distinct odour of burnt wood and flesh. Professor Hisham looked
with horror at the crumbling straw huts and blackened bodies
trapped within. The scorching heat last week had set off a wildfire
on the Penans’ huts a day ago, and the torrential shower had put it
out. A little too late.

“Professor, look!”
Upon the wet mud mixed with ash, there were unmistakably
several sets of human footprints that were headed west. There were
survivors.

With renewed urgency Professor Hisham’s team set off in

pursuit.

Hope was within reach.
Hope for the Penans. Hope for the world.
