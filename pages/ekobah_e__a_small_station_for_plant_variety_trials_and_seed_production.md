## 

“Ekobahçe” is a small testing and production area where the seeds of varieties adapted to the climate and geography and suitable in terms of yield, taste and aroma are produced by trying the production of local varieties since 2010. Both the seeds produced in the Eco-garden and the local seeds in the countryside, which have been used by farmers for many years, are kept in the “Local Seed Library”. The most important feature of Ekobahçe is that synthetic agricultural chemicals, synthetic fertilizers and hybrid seeds belonging to companies are not used during production.
