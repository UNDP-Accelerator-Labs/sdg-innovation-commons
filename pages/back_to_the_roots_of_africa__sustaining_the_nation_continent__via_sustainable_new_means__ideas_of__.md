> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation , will not only generate income for me , but the community and nation at large. Today , health living and breathe depends on agriculture, meaning every person , family, community, nation and continent is attained to achieve this go. When I farm , my plants with improved methods that I have , and they grow as stipulated on a large scale,, it means I will supply , to various companies that make finished products, and export as well. I will generate income that way , because there is high demand of agriculture products on the globe. When this income is achieved , I will have even investors , meaning they will also be need to employ more people , especially youths . From this will empower each other with more innovative ideas. So if am given the prize challenge , I will be able to implement my ideas , because I will be able to purchase farming implements , and special tree chips.

> Technical Feasibility

How it is designed, 
1) get land , about 2 Hector. This  will include  a place with availability of water for irrigation. 
2) get tubes ,pumps and sprays for irrigation.
3 insertion of , special tree chips in soil . This is done for faster , and special growth of plants. 
3) allow special tree chips on land , for 5 days not forgetting watering.
4) grow seedlings separately, before planting them on , but some plants to be planted directly on land in form of seeds.
5) land set , plants planted on land.
6 ) special care for plants, begins by irrigation, insertion of special tree chips on land every after 2weeks for a month  .
7) those planted in form of seeds, to be waited upon until germination , before, special care.
8) monitor closely , until cultivation.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Every , little work to be done, will need attention of a person, this means it will call for massive employment. Youths ,men and women. And hence it not just create employment, but it will also improve creativity of people , which will make them  independent.   This innovation is relevant to the current market, because it involves agriculture ( vegetation) on the market , vegetables , herbs have become extremely expensive and unaffordable due to low production rates and high demand . So this will improve supply on the market lessening the burden of demand.
