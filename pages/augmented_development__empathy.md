## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

1. Augmented Development: Empathy
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to foster empathy and enable new solutions by using new technologies. Physical distance and biases affect peoples´´  perceptions and actions towards inclusiveness. The use of new technologies to see/interact (remotely) with people, places, and real-life solutions, to which we do not always have direct access, can contribute to closing development gaps, starting with mental ones by fostering empathy between different groups of people.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The levels of empathy in Colombia are low, amongst others, because we have gotten used to violence due to our armed conflict. We have become numb or resistant to others' pain and suffering because we have normalized it. By reducing mental gaps, connecting to the other, and stop seeing others as someone who has nothing to do with me, we can also reduce development gaps in Colombia. Augmented Development is a term the AccLab coined since our beginning in 2019. We aim to bridge people's physical bodies and minds by building narratives focused on resilience and by using new technologies such as augmented reality, 360 cameras, and drones. We create immersive experiences for people who cannot travel to certain territories to access (remotely) people's realities, understand their conditions, and make more informed decisions according to these places' and their communities' own realities. Late 2020, after hurricane IOTA hit Colombia Caribbean islands (San Andrés y Providencia), UNDP started with early recovery work. Currently, we are designing an economic reactivation strategy based on collaborative and complementary financial mechanisms that allow the islands to reactivate their local economy, mainly tourism. With 360 cameras and drones, we have built an experience that will enable people from the government, donors, UNDP, and the broaden citizenship who cannot travel to the area to live an immersive experience, fostering empathy and their willingness to invest in their local economy.

> 

To understand the islands' situation, especially for Providencia, UNDP collected surveys regarding the infrastructural damages of peoples homes and businesses and data regarding some businesses needs and economic status. In the link below, there is a powerbi with some of this information.

The quantitative information has nurtured the qualitative data and life stories narratives about those businesses interested in receiving financial support. Below there is a blog about some of the work we have been doing in Providencia Island regarding socioeconomic recovery, empathy and the use of new technologies.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Even though the management sees an excellent opportunity to use new technologies to foster empathy, working with these technologies and incorporating behavioral science is new to the CO. Most of the work in Providencia Island regarding empathy and new technologies has been lead by the AccLab with the support of cross teams such as Comms and the Strategic Support Unit. Using mobile devices, headsets, 360 cameras, and drones have provided UNDP the opportunity to create mixed reality and immersive experiences for UNDP colleagues to monitor, evaluate, and manage projects remotely; connect decision-makers to realities they haven't had access to, and empower the community within their local contexts. However, embracing change is a significant barrier, so while the Lab uses new technologies to (remotely) foster empathy, transparency, participation and empower communities in the decision-making process, the aim is to engage a broader team that sees added value in the process. Because in the end, the Acclab wants to leave capabilities with UNDP's teams.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Come live, see and feel Providencia, one of the most beautiful places in Colombia, through an immersive experience. We invite you to see beyond the obvious and invest in Providencia because you are investing in Colombia's economic reactivation by investing in the island.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we help reactivate the local economies in these territories and groups of people? How can we foster empathy between different groups of people by using technology?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Crowdfunding: A collective financing strategy that invites citizens and the private sector to support microentrepreneurs in getting out of the COVID-19 crisis and the hurricane disaster, generating employment, and reactivating the regional economy. This strategy seeks to alleviate the barriers experienced by small and medium-sized companies to access the financial system and offers a training program to strengthen business habits, digital appropriation, and financial education. Behavioral insights: Seeks to experiment with people's motivations, levels of empathy and engagement to donate, lend or invest in the Colombian context. Prototyping: Last year, we developed a crowdfunding campaign using behavioral tools. This year, we incorporate new technologies and immersive experiences a way to foster empathy levels and people's willingness to invest in the economic reactivation of vulnerable communities such as Providencia Island.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Drones and Satellite data have been used as mechanisms to collect information about places, territories or critical situations. With the use of these data sources, we have built experiences that allow people from the government, donors, UNDP, and the broaden citizenship who cannot travel to certain areas, for example, Providencia Island after the hurricane IOTA, to live an immersive experience, understand the conditions, live their realities and make well-informed decisions. Social media data collects information about people's engagement and interaction with the crowdfunding communicational strategy through FB and IG platforms.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The use of new technologies to foster empathy between different people is a work the AccLab started in 2019. At the same time, last year, the AccLab worked on crowdfunding and behavioral science to motivate people to donate to development projects. This year, learning from our previous experiences, the economic reactivation strategy based on collaborative and complementary financial mechanisms will allow the island to reactivate its local economy. Through a Crowdfunding campaign (donation, lending, and investment), we'll be taking (remotely) the broad citizenship that cannot travel to the area to live an immersive experience in Providencia Island, fostering empathy their willingness to invest in their local economy. This exploration will allow us to keep finding ways to foster empathy between people, creating new financial mechanisms for small businesses and our development projects, and embrace the use of new technologies in unimaginable ways.
