## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Isa Bergh Lopes da Costa

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

01/04/2023

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Diaspora: Economic Participation of the Bissau-Guinean Diaspora for Development of the Country

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

Our challenge is that we want to understand 1) the Bissau-Guinean diaspora's contribution to the development of the country, 2) their relationship with the government in the country and government bodies abroad and 3) which mechanisms can be introduced to improve the contribution of the diaspora for the development of the country social, politically and economically. 

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

What is the relationship between the diaspora and the government? In what ways the diaspora engage with the government? Where is the Bissau-Guinean Diaspora in the world? Where does the diaspora invest in Guinea-Bissau? Has the state created conditions to attract diaspora engagement?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Pre Experimental (Trial and erros, prototype, a/b testing)
- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- United Nations agency
- Public Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ianda Guine DJUNTU (European Union Project), IOM
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

 The learning intent of this activity is to explore what the diaspora understands about the Emigrant Card, how to improve engagement, and test whether a marketing

campaign can raise awareness and interest in the card among the Diaspora. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

“IF the Ministry of Foreign Affairs develops a communication campaign for the Emigrant Card, including updating the information on the website, creating a responsive contact platform and implementing a campaign on social networks aimed at the diaspora, THEN there will be a increased diaspora engagement and card subscriptions”.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

From the research carried out by the Laboratory, it was understood that despite the existence of the Emigrant Card, there has been little or no subscription by the diaspora. The next phase, therefore, is to explore what the diaspora understands about the Emigrant Card, how to improve engagement, and then test whether a marketing campaign can raise awareness and interest in the card among the Diaspora.

The test will begin with a baseline survey consisting of an analysis of web traffic to the MNE website and social media pages. The intervention will test whether improved communication, including the renovation of the MFA website and the reinforcement of social media campaigns, will result in more diaspora engagement and interest in the Emigrant Card. The final survey will measure web traffic and include a perception survey

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

1. Baseline/ endline Survey: Conduct a baseline survey to understand the current level of awareness and use of the Emigrant Card among the Diaspora. The survey will be divided into three parts:

2. Web Traffic Analysis: IT personnel will provide statistics on web traffic to the MNE website and social media pages over the last five years. 

 3. Applications for the Emigrant Card: The General Directorate of Communities will provide the number of applications for the Emigrant Card (nationally/internationally) in the last five years  

4. Questionnaire distributed to two diaspora groups (one will be exposed to the marketing campaign and one won´t) to measure:

- what people know about the card / what can be improved

- how many people are interested in the card, as well as a digital version of the card 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Pre-Post Surveys, web traffic analisys, analisys of number of Emigrant Card applications

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 month

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check
