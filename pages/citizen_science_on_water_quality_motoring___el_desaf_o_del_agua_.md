Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis. 

Overall goal: Promote the knowledge of variables for water quality monitoring. - Raise awareness on the importance of protecting this resource.  Specific goals: Learn about the water quality of bodies of water (sea and lakes) in the area of San Jorge Gulf in the province of Chubut

Description of citizen participation: Young people from 12 to 21 years old participated in the project for 3 days.  On the first day, they participated in online training sessions on the use of equipment and supplies provided by the project.  On the second day, an in-person meeting was held, where material for measuring physicochemical water variables was given.  On the last day, participants reflected in person about the collected results, the environmental issues impacting bodies of water, and the possibility to generate alternatives for improvement in water management.  Afterward, in a self-managed manner and together with a youth leader of the foundation, each participant uploaded the data to a section of the EarthEcho International's website, where there are more than 1.5 million records from all over the world, to share with the whole community.  Moreover, participants collaborated later with data analysis, phenomenon monitoring, and solution planning in meetings with activity coordinators of the organization EarthEcho International and the Coastal Development Institute Dr. Héctor Zaixso (National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco [UNPSJB]). 

Time frame: 10/01/2020 - 09/04/2021. 

Project leaders: Javier Tolosano, Coastal Development Institute Dr. Héctor Zaixso /National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco.
