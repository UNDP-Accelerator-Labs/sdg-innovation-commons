The experience of True community is a unique way of communicating with others, of sharing our deepest thoughts and feelings without fear or guilt. A powerful new force for both individual and social change, community can and must be created among small groups of people, then in our churches, our business organizations and our governmental institutions, and ultimately among all people capable and ensure our survival as human beings.
