Grenada Technology and Innovation Hub Proposal
AUGUST 23, 2022
In the wake of global pandemic and other shocks, Grenada has felt the challenges of relying too heavily on the tourism sector. A Technology & Innovation Hub in Grenada would deliver hope for the country, new opportunities for local youths, keeping the most highly trained and intelligent people in Grenada. It can promote innovation and a creative environment, and enable a generation to thrive based on knowledge, skills, open competition, specialization, increased capacity, and efficiency.
A Technology and Innovation Hub is a place where collective understanding of opportunities and challenges are solved using emerging technologies and innovations; a place where resources are shared and strengthened, where new products (product innovations) or processes in application (process innovations) have been developed or created and brought to market. Key components of a Technology and Innovation Hub are sources of funding, access to venture capitalists, angel investors, and government sponsorship.
This study builds upon past research, case studies and extensive consultations to offer a vision and a roadmap for a Technology & Innovation Hub in Grenada.
