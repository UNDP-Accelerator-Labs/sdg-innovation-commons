## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Alab Mongolia is working with the second-largest city in Mongolia, Erdenet to improve the waste recycling process. In order to provide a sustainable solution, we are testing a multi-partner waste recycling process. This includes formalizing waste recyclers into the waste management system, increasing recycling at the source, and developing financial mechanisms. We are attempting to develop a full-cycle process with multiple partners.
a)	To jointly work with the local government, municipal services, retailers, and citizen groups to improve the solid waste recycling system;
b)	Formalize waste reclaimers to pick waste at landfills, dumps, and from businesses and retailers. 
c)	Secure their livelihoods by equipping them with necessary tools, training them, and developing their relationship with the municipality in charge;
d)	Inculcate a behavioral change by gradually expanding their scope and competencies and improving safety, hygiene, and efficiency to improve their image and public standing;
e)	Conduct community and stakeholder training and leverage citizens and municipal workers who are doing extremely well and/or coming up with their own solutions;

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If formalized, provided sufficient training, and built capacities, informal waste collectors and processors can recycle a significant amount of waste and become part of the waste management system.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We selected a community leader who recycles waste, provided her training, and equipment, and formalized their operation. Selected residential areas, as well as commercial centers, were provided training and tools to recycle their waste, which will be picked up by the community leader. The waste management agency and Mayor's office is officially recognizing community leader's work by changing policy to provide subsidy on the amount of waste recycled. If the operation goes well, we can expand the intervention in the city, and explore scale-up.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Amount of waste being recycled

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Waste that is being recycled will be recorded at the recycled waste exporters.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

8-10 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
