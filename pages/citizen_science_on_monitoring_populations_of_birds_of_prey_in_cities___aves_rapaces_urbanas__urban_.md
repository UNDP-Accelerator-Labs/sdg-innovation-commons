## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection. 

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis. 

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process. 
## Overall goal

Monitor the identity, species richness, and abundance of individuals of predatory birds present in cities and urban spaces with different characteristics over time. 

Assess the characteristics of cities and urban spaces that could impact the richness and abundance of predatory birds in these environments.

## Description of citizen participation

Six specific annual surveys are carried out at simultaneously fixed locations (between 20 and 50) throughout Argentina. Groups of bird watchers (made up of residents near the place with some type of interest in birds) use binoculars, cameras, and telescopes to detect birds. They record observations on-site and then upload them to databases and photo repositories. A continuous survey of occasional sightings is also carried out. These sightings can be uploaded by anyone through a mobile phone application and they also enrich the primary information.
