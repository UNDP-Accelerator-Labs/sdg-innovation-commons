## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To strengthen business model of social enterprise that has created an inclusive model on agriculture waste/air pollution & validate claim of startup 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If biofuels are introduced in local industries, it can replace low-grade coal (hence reduce emissions and air pollution)

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Startup led design & business model to convert crop residue into biofuel which can inturn replace low-grade coal in industries + Economic returns to farmers. With seed investment from AccLab, generate biofuels appropriate to local industries to see if circular economy model is feasible.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Parameters measured: Extent of agriculture land stopped crop burning; GHG emissions reduced; Increase in income for farmers

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Data collected by startup, emissions measured used AQI monitoring devices

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Data collaboration is a key factor and very very cost-efficient  

> What surprised you?

  3 States governments in India adopted this platform for state-wide monitoring & regulation of brick kilns in - Bihar, Odisha & Chhattisgarh. These are the three poorest states in the country - not usual suspects for experimenting with emerging technologies. Key Learning: Emerging technologies can have traction even in poorer states with low digital capacities - possibility of leapfrogging
