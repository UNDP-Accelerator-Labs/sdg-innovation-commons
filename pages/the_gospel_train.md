> Title of the innovation

The Gospel Train

> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation will fall under Education, this innovation was created to education students and pupils in different institutions and schools around the country and it will discuss topics such as the importance of school, how to choose a career, early pregnancies, and how to combat premature sex and drug abuse to mention but a few...

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

So the innovation will help employ a lot of youths that will go round educating the students and youths...and distributing flyers and T-shirts that will help disseminate the message, and this will in some way give businesses that print and design T-shirts and flyers make money. The innovation will also help stop or combat early pregnancies and will encourage many to love school and stay determined and focused, and when that hapoens, Zambia and the society at large will have literate people that will help develop the country and the world at large.

> Technical Feasibility

At hand I only have a what's up group with over 50 youths in it, and am currently at Mulungushi University so I will definitely lay out the innovation and have it reached to almost every student... Then once Covid 19 is completely over, the youths and I will visit different institutions and schools just to educate people on the topics and other things I mentioned earlier.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Many people will know the importance of education and how to improve on their skills. And the innovation will employ a number of youths that will get busy working, unlike them just lazing around hence making them vulnerable to things such drug abuse.
