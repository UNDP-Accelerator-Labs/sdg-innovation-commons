## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> Hypothesis: IF... THEN....

1.      If solid waste volume and physical distances from transfer stations could affect household’s decision to dispose of their waste improperly. Therefore, we have assumed that households that reside the farthest from the transfer station and generate a higher volume of waste would likely dispose of their waste improperly. Improper waste disposal practices (such as on streets, open fields, and open canals) were linked to the households that participated in the experiment.   2.      If the amount of waste generated from a household and the household’s distance from a waste transfer station affects behavior when it comes to practicing improper disposal. Under our context, we defined waste transfer stations as the site where the neighborhoods waste is collected until it is picked up and transported to the landfills. We mapped the transfer stations to identify their status and location.   3.      If demographic and economic status of households could make a difference in solid waste management practices specially when it comes waste segregation. 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment
- non-random assignment

> What is the learning intent of the activity?

An in-depth investigation of household solid waste sorting through a behavioral insight approach gives a way to reveal the attitudinal, socioeconomic, physical and institutional factors that impedes a successful sorting practice. Moreover, this might support the identification of positive deviances for best sorting practices, locally made sorting products, waste sorting local initiatives. 

> What is the object being tested?

Household waste sorting behavior 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity?

3 months 

> Describe the methodology of the experimental activity. For example, sample size and selection; data collection technique; collaboration; randomization technique; data analysis technique

For this experiment, we identified contrasting neighborhood locations in Addis Ababa from the centre, periphery and transitional neighbourhoods. The neighbourhoods could represent different socio-economic classes based on residential housing types. We selected the households randomly (199 in the central, 209 in the transitional, and 267 in the periphery). We wanted to compare waste management situations and test if the amount of waste generated from a household and the household’s distance from a waste transfer station affects behaviour when it comes to practising improper disposal. Under our context, we defined waste transfer stations as the site where the neighbourhood’s waste is collected until it is picked up and transported to the landfills. We mapped the transfer stations to identify their status and location. Using the existing distances between households from transfer stations and the waste amount produced by the household, a simple logistic regression method was applied to run the test. The model was used to analyze if the aforementioned factors determine a household’s behaviour on how waste is disposed of and to predict the probability of a household’s tendency to dispose of waste improperly. This information could give insight to the local waste administration unit to either reorient the transfer stations distributions; or set priorities to tackle important factors affecting households’ behaviour. Therefore, improper waste disposal is captured as a binary category with a maximum likelihood of one.

## Review
**This section includes observations by peer reviewers**
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> What were the key results?

From this simple analysis, we have learned that a household’s distance from its nearby transfer station does not determine the household's behaviour when it comes to the proper disposal of waste. The size of the generated waste could also affect a household’s decision on whether to dispose of it in the assigned transfer stations or to practice improper disposal. Therefore, we have concluded that our alternate hypothesis on the improper disposal of solid waste is partially accepted, as solid waste size determines improper solid waste disposal. 

> What were the key insights of this experiment?

Based on these findings, the local solid waste administration could focus on areas that generate a larger quantity of waste per household per week and develop a set of interventions that enhances proper waste disposal. Beyond this piece of insight, an emulation of similar experiences on data-driven decisions could be applied to analyze multiple suspected factors that are affecting certain situations in a development context, similar to waste disposal behaviour. This approach could help local authorities and development organizations be pragmatic and manage for impacts, instead of having blanket interventions that sometimes result in wasted time, financial resources and low results.
