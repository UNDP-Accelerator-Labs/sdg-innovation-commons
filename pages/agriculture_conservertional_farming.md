> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

How it will generate income will be I'll be able to harvest a lot of healthy crops without much input 
Less input more harvest hence poverty levels will reduce

> Technical Feasibility

For a start I'll be using church land for farming 
Am able to grow my own nurseries and also monitoring all my farming activities 
I can be able to source chicken manure and begin growing 
The challenge can be water  how it can be solved  the church has a power pump where I can only be buying electrical unit's

> Anticipated Social Impact

Zambian people like farming but they invest a lot of money but at the harvest is little 
So my innovation would help them on low investment and no buying of fertilizer but using natural resources 
Considering the climate change the chemicals that we put indagers the insects found in the soil and they increase soil erosion which translates in higher levels of çlimate change but with my innovation we practice mulching on the soil that prevents soil erosion ,shattering of the soil and keeps the needed insects in the soil and insured free access of Air in the soil
