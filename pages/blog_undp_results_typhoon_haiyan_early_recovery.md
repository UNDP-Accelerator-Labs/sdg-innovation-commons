UNDP Results
Typhoon Haiyan Early Recovery

United Nations Development Programme

Issued on 6 December 2013

In the immediate aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, UNDP
and its partners launched an early recovery programme,
which began with emergency employment cash-for-work
in debris and waste removal in the most affected areas.

One month after the storm, many of the main streets are
cleared, which allows the relief to reach those who need
it, and kick start the recovery and rebuilding process.

UNDP’s recovery programme will aim to help build back
stronger, more resilient and thriving communities able to
withstand future super storms.

Cash-for-Work Debris Removal

UNDP is currently operating cash-for-work projects in
Tacloban, Palo and Guiuan. As of 6 December, UNDP is
employing 405 workers; a third of them are women. In
compliance with government policy, participating workers
earn minimum wage (for example, in Tacloban it is 260
pesos a day). They are paid every week, and each
person is employed for at least15 days. The workers are
selected
local authorities and
community
leaders to ensure that the employment
opportunities are available to the groups that need it
most.

in coordination with

The objectives of the cash-for-work programme include:

 Clearing debris to allow easier access for aid to

reach affected households;

 Enabling people to bring home much needed income;
 Injecting cash into the local economy;
 Developing ownership of the recovery process; and
 Reducing the risk of disease by properly disposing

waste.

Debris clearing sites:

 Five hospitals (Bethany Hospital, Eastern Visayas
Medical and Regional Center, Remedios Trinidad
Romualdez Hospital, St. Paul’s, Burauen District
Hospital, Carigara District Hospital);

 Four villages (Barangays 87,88,89,90) in Tacloban;

and

 Two schools in Tacloban and Palo.

UNDP’s target is to provide cash-for-work benefits to
10,000 people across five provinces (i.e., Samar, Leyte,
Cebu, Panay and Palawan) by the end of the year.

Medical Waste Removal

The number one priority for UNDP’s debris team was the
swift removal of medical waste from the hard hit hospitals
in and around Tacloban City. With no disposal service for
weeks, waste generated in local hospitals continued to
grow.

UNDP responded within two weeks of the disaster to
restart clearance and disposal of medical waste in five
hospitals that were able to restart life-saving services to
the vulnerable communities.

Municipal Waste Management

Tacloban City has resumed garbage collection with help
from UNDP and other partners. Municipal solid waste is
taken to the city dumpsite, and over the next few weeks,
solid waste management systems will improve and
become more regular.

Funding

The debris removal and waste management are part of a
US$ 46 million early recovery plan. It now has funding of
US$ 12 million from the Government of Japan, Russian
the Central Emergency
Federation, Saudi Arabia,
Response Fund and UNDP.

To meet
communities, UNDP is seeking another US$ 34 million.
