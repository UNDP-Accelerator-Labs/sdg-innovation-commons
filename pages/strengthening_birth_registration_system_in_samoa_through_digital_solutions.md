## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To find and test the appropriate digital solutions to strengthen the birth registration system of Samoa, that is well integrated with the CRVS strategy and can be a building block for National Digital ID

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF appropriate digital solutions are embedded within the current birth registration system, THEN the birth registration rate in Samoa will significantly improve 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Scope out the digital solutions working well in other countries and then based on the government's appetite for change, prototype these for Samoa and then eventually scaling them up to revamp the birth registration system of Samoa  

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Number of birth registrations 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Secondary data - Data collected from Samoa of Bureau of Statistics; Solutions Mapping - What has worked well in other countries especially SIDS

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6-10 months depending on government permission

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.
