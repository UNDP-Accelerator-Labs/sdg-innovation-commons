Behavioral Science in Fight with Coronavirus
APRIL 27, 2020
Behavioral science is a scientific discipline within the living creatures’ actions and reactions are studied via observation and/or experimentation. It is used to understand the target behaviour and learn the best way to reach that. During the pandemic it is well learnt that communication is very important to change someone’s behaviour. Therefore; Accelerator Lab Turkey prepared an easy reading document on behavioral science and COVID-19 based on ESRI's study to share with UNDP Turkey’s government and business partners.
