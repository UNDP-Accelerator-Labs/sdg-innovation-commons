## Type of project

Contributory project: It is designed by members of the scientific community, and citizens participate in data collection. 

Collaborative project: Citizens participate in data collection and analysis. 

Co-created project: Citizens participate in all stages of the scientific process. 
## Overall goal

Determine the existence and degree of anthropic impact in a remaining area of the Atlantic Forest through a collaborative biodiversity record in two differently managed areas. 
## Specific goals

Create a baseline of biodiversity data for selected taxa of flora, fauna, fungi, and soil microbiology from the study areas. 

Describe and compare the observed diversity patterns. 

Develop a monitoring plan together with the Mbya Guaraní community that lives in the area. 
## Description of citizen participation

This project works with members of the Mbya Guaraní community, traditional inhabitants of the Atlantic Forest with extensive knowledge and relationship with the environment. In participatory workshops between the local and scientific communities, worldviews and methodologies are exchanged between both cultures. In addition, biodiversity sampling is designed and implemented in two environments with varying degrees of human intervention. The sampling will be repeated four times a year by teams with professional and non-professional members. Observations will also be discussed from academic and traditional perspectives and will contribute to the creation of an integrated biological and cultural database. The results and discussions will help participants jointly devise a monitoring plan that the community can continue after the project is finished.
