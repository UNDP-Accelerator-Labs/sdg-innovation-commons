Sulemane Trauwale used waste iron and recycled can to produce household items which he later sells. This is part of a circular economy because he pays those of the community who can collect a full bag of cans and iron a fixed amount which he then used to create these items and sell them to make a living. He also employs young men of the region which then create their own workshops or move to Bissau for further training.
