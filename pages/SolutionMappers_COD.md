[[ai_summary:Olivier Bampendi, head of Solution mapping in DRC Accelerator Lab, presented a story about the Boyen de Malamo project. The project aimed to address corruption and improve efficiency in the justice administration by developing solutions for career management, prison management, and justice activities management. After receiving funding from Akbis project, they applied methodologies like Human Centered Design and co-designing to develop software that aligned with legal processes.

# Democratic Republic of Congo: Fighting Corruption through Innovative Justice Administration Solutions

### [[0:01]] OK, Bonjour, Olivier\.

Bonjour, Alexandra Kamosova, Sava bien Super\.

### [[0:06]] So would you please present yourself?

Yes, my name is Olivier Bampendi\. I'm the head of Solution mapping in DRC Accelerator Lab\.

### [[0:16]] OK\. And could you give the R&D story or could you share with us And R&D story? Where did you find out?

There's something very interesting that we did in DRC\. You know, DRC is known to be one of the most corrupt countries in the world and we are actually ranking very bad\. I think it's 168 out of 180 countries in the world\. So we are very highly corrupt and we had an event that was organized by the Ministry of Justice in September 2021 to find out what was the cause of corruption and what should we do to fight corruption\. And out of that meeting that was conveyed by government, UNDP facilitated the meeting and it was adopted that we needed to find solutions to address the issue of delays in justice activities\. Because sometimes when you go into court, when you go into the prison, you have the issue of files being stolen, you have the issue of information being changed\. For instance, if someone has 20 years imprisonment, they'll give him two years because the documents are manual and it's handled manually\. And you also have another issue is that someone could be a magistrate\. And if he's not corrupt magistrate he will not go into the best area\. They'll send him somewhere deep in a village\. He could be forgotten for years\. So there was an issue with career management of magistrates and some of those issues were raised during that government event\. And then the question was asked, what do we do? What can we do to fight corruption in improving the efficiency of the justice administration? That's how the Boyen de Malamo\. Boyen de Malamo means this is good\. Boyen de Malamo project was born and it was born, but there were no funding\. The initiatives were there since 2018, but there were no funding to move with the project until 2022 when there was a call for funding\. But in that call for funding by Akbis project, the requirement it had to involve the Accelerator Lab\. So that's how we came in as the lab\. We applied for the funding and we received the funding and we committed to put in place a career management system for the Superior Council of Magistrates\. We committed to put in place a prison management platform for prisons\. We decided to put in place a software that manages the entire journey of a justice case from the jurisdiction, from the offices to the courts and everything\. So those solutions were developed with the support of UNDPI mean a club ecosystem because it was under the anti corruption project and the justice reform project and a club\. So three projects came together\. Now as we came together we brought in the methodologies of the lab\. One of them was a human centered design and we Co designed with the users\. We identified the users, the people that were supposed to benefit from the different software\. We went to them and we asked them how do you function in the prison? They explained to us how do you function in a court? How do you function in office? They explained to us the entire process\. We went to the superior council of magistrate\. We asked them the question to know what is the process once a magistrate is hired, how long is he supposed to be at a specific position at a specific place? For how long and how, how is the career managed? So after we have collected all these information, we, we, we, we had now to, to codify, if I can say we had now to codify in a sort of a different software\. We came up with the software for career management, we came up with the software for prison management and we came up with a software for the, the justice activities management\. Now once the system was built, the second stage, another stage was to call the users and to present to them the various system\. We presented the system to them and they were happy\. They said let us use it\. So we started the piloting process\. They used the system for a while and then a meeting was called\. It brought together all the users of the system with the Accelerator lab\. We sat down and we had to criticize to find out if the system is working properly\. So there were arguments\. This lawyer will say no, the way the flow of the activities in the software does not align with the provisions of the law in this context\. So we had to adjust, change, add on, remove some of the things, which is what we did\. And then it took some time after we did it, we came up with another version of each software which then we're again tested by the users themselves\. In the entire process we had to do the journey with the users and we used the methodologies of the lab, Human Centered Design, co\-designing\. Then we'll go to see how they are using it, what are the issues that they are having\. In the same time we kept an eye on what other countries are doing also in terms of case management systems and things like that\. So that we are sure that we built software that are up to you know today's realities\. That was our story\. And then once they we had a version that was as of today accepted by all the parties, then we were allowed now to deploy the software across the country\. And that was another challenge because we have an issue of infrastructure development in the country\. Some offices don't have computers\. So with the funding that we received from Sweden and Norway, we were able to buy computers, we're able to buy printer and not printers, scanners, because we are digitalizing the process\. So we bought those equipment and we took those equipment in various cities\. We took them in\. We started by Kinshasa\. We went to the Matadi city, we went to Lubumbashi city, we went to Coloesi, we went to Lucasi, we went to Kipushi\. These are various cities in the country\. And then we deployed the equipment\. But after deploying the equipment, because some of the users, they don't know the software that you have developed\. So we needed to do capacity building sessions with them\. So we'll train them during two days\. We'll do the training on the system\. Once they understand the system, we do practical exercises with them\. So we give them, we ask them, do you have cases of files in your court that you can actually and put into the system, record in the system\. They will do it in front of us and then after the training\. So we have the training, we have the exercise and then we have the mentoring session\. During the mentoring, we take the computers in their offices and we leave them to record themselves and then we just available for assistance in case they need our help\. And then once we see it usually takes between four to seven days depending on the complexity and the size of the team that we are training\. After we've trained them, we go to the another city\. Now some other city had also other challenges like electricity\. So for those places we had to buy solar panels to provide solar panels so that they can use the system\. So that's how the Boyen de Malamu is being actually deployed, all for the country\. And the users are very happy\. The government, the Ministry of Justice is happy, as well as the Superior Council magistrate\.

### [[8:57]] OK, thank you so much\. Olivier, can you say you already stressed about some critical moments? Yes, Hari, can you identify one critical moment in that in your journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
Yes, some of the critical moments were, for instance, when we had to come together to criticize the system because it was a heated debate\. You know, we're talking here about a software, softwares that are supposed to reflect the exact legal processes of each of the, you know, legal things in the country\. So then you have lawyers sitting, you have judges sitting, you have prosecutors sitting each one of each one of them feels like this process does not reflect the way I do things\. So we needed to include the, the opinion the, you know, to co\-create with them\. Sometimes they are having opposing opinion\. We bring them together\. We do to do\. We had to do a bit of emotional intelligence to understand why is this one refusing this process so that we can at least come up with that was 111 key and strategic moment\. The 2nd strategic moment is when deploying because you go out on the field, you don't know who you are going to meet\. You don't know what is their level of understanding of IT\. So you actually you have to train them and to make sure that they understand and to make sure that they've understood, then we create WhatsApp group in each of these provinces\. All the users, after they're being trained, we create a WhatsApp group of that city\. So in that WhatsApp group, it's the trainers\. And we don't bring trainers from UNDP\. We take the first trainer, the first users that have mastered the project, they've understood the system\. They are the ones that go to train their colleagues in other cities\. So once we finish in the city, we create a WhatsApp group\. And regularly when they have issues, they can now put in the WhatsApp group and we maintain conversation\. But as UNDP, we go every six months to just make sure that everything is running smoothly\. And that's the boy in the Malam project\.

### [[11:34]] And how did you diffuse?

[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Proof of concept]]
Well it was the diffuse part and the catalyze was not very complicated because from the beginning the project existed before we came in\. It was part of the justice reform project\. Then the anti corruption project came and then at lab was associated because we were the one that could bring in the funding\. So partners were there that were interested in the project, the Ministry of Justice, the Superior Council of Magistrates were there, the anti\-corruption Agency were there\. So when we finalized the product and then we showed them what we had made available to them, it was easy for them to take ownership of the, the, the, the event\. And we even organized an, a gala event in which the President of the Superior Council of Magistrate and the Minister of Justice, they came to launch or to give the go of the deployment process\. So that's how and it was all over in the media and that's how the the, the, the Catalyse and the diffuse project were made easy because they are involved or through the process\.

### [[12:55]] Thank you, Olivier\. Appreciate\.

Thank you\.
