> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

We teamed up with the Chief Digital Officer in Athens; and the Director of Heat Initiatives at the Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center.
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We wanted to learn if the policy innovation behind 'heat officers' would be something that UNDP in North Macedonia could argue and advocate for.

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If we learn that the policy innovation behind 'heat officers' is something that our country office could adopt, and argue for, then we can work with national/local institutions in the direction of raising awareness about the need for this type of discourse and actionable to make our cities more resilient to the impact of climate change, with a focus on heat.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We took three distinct actions. Our Lab spearheaded the process of forming a 'heat' team within the country office, that explored if there are any policy innovations in the space of 'cooling our cities' and 'heat initiatives' that

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Country office, and ecosystem of individuals, CSOs, members from academia and local institutions.

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The only data we collected is the participation of people on the event, as well as their questions.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

One month, from inception to delivery

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

The time of the Head of Experimentation for the duration of one month, 5% of the time.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The original process has been proven, in the sense that we sensitized the key stakeholders on the challenges pertaining heat and heatwaves for our communities, as well as what tools and policies are at the disposal of actors to either raise awareness on the topic, or to

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Ideally I would add a co-creation session among all of the stakeholders that participated in this session, to create activities in the space of #heat and urban resilience.


> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

One month from inception to results.


> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

We spent less than 500$ for this activity.


> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, we are trying to partner with both stakeholders [ARResilience Center and the network of Chief Heat Officers] and encourage peer to peer learning with our local governance units.


> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

n/a


> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

This experiment/pilot is not related to a specific learning question. We did it right after the incredibly warm summer period in our country. It is in the intersection of our Good Governance and Environment units, and we believed that we should treat it as an interdisciplinary topic.


> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

n/a

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Our Environment and DG units.


> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Local governments, Private sector [impact on heat on businesses].


> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

n/a

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Ensure you follow up with co-creation sessions after having conducted the activity.


> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

yes.


> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Mapping solutions citizens and communities use to deal with growing heat, might be a relevant and useful activity.


> What surprised you?

How much interest the topic sparked among members from the academic and CSO community in the country.
