## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF traditional knowledge is revived, then cultural identity is strengthened and climate resilience is improved 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Along with the United Nations Development Programme’s (UNDP) Ridge-to-Reef project, we went to explore the traditional practice of salt making. Vusama village on Fiji’s Coral Coast, is the traditional custodian of salt making on Fiji’s main island Viti Levu. The village had not made salt in 50 years, and it was on the brink of losing this traditional knowledge altogether with only four elderly village members left who knew about the practice. We set up the system to revive the practice. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Engagement with natural resources and climate change

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

interviews and surveys

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

20% time of solution mapper and experimenter
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We would have selected a traditional knowledge practice which is directly linked to climate resilience (e.g. food, fisheries)

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

It took a short time of 3 months but with COVID and cyclones we couldnt go collect post survey data till much later

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Approx 9000

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The Environment department is working towards building a shed to institutionalize the practice. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The Ministry of iTaukei (indigenous) Affairs is interested in documenting the practice and similar practices for climate and community resilience.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

 The villagers did not view the salt as cooking salt. Rather, they saw it as cultural currency and frequently used terms like ‘treasure’ and ‘valuable possession’ to describe it. When the children were asked to describe Vusama, they used terms like ‘old village, no water and red soil.’ However, while describing Vusama in relation to salt making, they regarded their village as the land of maqa, a barren coastal space found adjacent to the mainland and often devoid of marine flora and fauna where medicinal salt was made. People referred to themselves as original salt makers acknowledging that this practice had travelled through the women of the village who married into the neighbouring communities. Several villagers shared salt making on Facebook, drawing neighbours to the village to see how they crafted salt. Villagers believe that being native custodians of an age-old practice will help them negotiate with local government for a better water supply, something the village has been struggling with for many years.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

COVID and cyclones

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Resilience and sustainable development unit

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Ministry of Environment

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, the survey was changed substantially as we went to the field. 

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Understand the lack of tangible outputs of traditional knowledge 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, it needs to be long term though.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

It did as we did systems mapping and solutions mapping activities which informed this entry point

> What surprised you?

The four elders who were the original knowledge holders were grateful that they could see the community come together to craft salt, as they did 50 years ago. The children were enthused that they were the first to learn the practice again. Women were glad that despite being from other villages, they now understood and knew this traditional practice. This sense of inclusion and pride helped reinforce cultural identity and connection to their land. For the women, this practice became a way of connecting with the village which they got married into. They believe the salt amplifies the flavor of their cooking and is healthier than salt sold in the supermarkets. Also, making salt together built a sense of community. According to them, coming together has helped them resolve misunderstandings and leverage the power of the community. The elders and leadership see this practice as something they can used to attract tourists and rejuvenate as a marker of their culture. In December 2020, the village welcomed a bride from another region, so they planned to make salt and offer it to the bride’s family.The biggest takeaway of this experiment has been the power of traditional knowledge as a driver of change. In indigenous cultures such as Fiji, where ancestors are revered, traditional knowledge is a means through which communities strengthen connections to their land and natural resources. It promotes unity and social collaboration to build resilience in the wake of disasters bringing together diverse groups especially older generations and children. As UNDP works towards resilience, traditional knowledge can be a promising inroad to engage communities and supporting them towards poverty reduction, sustainable livelihoods, and climate security.
