Firstly after I or we collect garbages there is a process ,we separate plastics for recycling and the lest we take the them as to make a feterlity land for farming, This can help others to  develop a sense of knowing how to make toils and plastic materials,ETC shoes.And it can also add advantage to our country for having an initiative of  fertilizer meaning no need to wait for the gorvenment to provide fetilizer for us because we have already made the land fertile,in this way we can develop and achieve our personal needs and want.As to the environment no air pollution all citizen may learn to keep their Homeland clean and safe because as we concern they have to be provided with bag were to keep dirty/garbages,this will help our country to develop hygiene with the provision of providing people to collect garbage bags.only the matter of writing I have idea but this I can assure you it can help a lot.
