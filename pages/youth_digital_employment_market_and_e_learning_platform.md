## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Digital Youth Employment Engine and e-learning platform (Preventing Violent Extremism, Youth Employment and Strengthening (PVE YES))
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that in the context of reduced economic opportunities for youth, many young people are drawn to violence, crime, delinquency and extremism. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

We aim to address youth crime, violence and radicalisation both within communities before youth come into contact with the criminal justice system, as well as within the prison system to reduce the risk of reoffending. The overarching aim is to increase the resilience of vulnerable youth and break the cycle of criminality through providing alternatives to them.  The urgent need for such a project is compounded by the Covid-19 Pandemic which is expected to exacerbate already high unemployment rates. Innovation, digital platforms and technology are at the heart of this project to ensure that it is Covid-19 responsive and to ensure that the project remains resilient to the emerging challenges that the new global reality presents. The proposed solutions revolve around: ·       Employability services: vocational counselling; vocational training; soft skills training; digital skills training; financial culture and fintech skills training; job placement services.
 ·       Business development services: business culture training; suppliers development programme; access to markets and inclusive business development; business innovation; financing.  
·       e-Market place: virtual catalogue; transactional marketplace B2C and B2B Market opportunities (starting with procurement and then private procurement opportunities).

The Employment Engine component of the PVE-YES project is focused on employment and workplace readiness. Between 2015-2019, the average rate of labour force participation for women and men over the age of 15 was 50.5 percent and 71.4 percent, respectively. These percentages shrink when narrowed to youth between the ages of 15 and 24 to 33.6 percent and 48.8 percent, respectively. There is a clear gender disparity in both adult and youth labour force participation.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The lab proposes to explore the use of an e-marketplace or “employment engine” which facilitates a gig economy among youth, including youth from the at-risk populations who have passed through relevant life skills and other training programmes. The employment engine will put demanders of services in touch with suppliers. The Lab will use collective intelligence and other stakeholder participatory methods to support the creation of a minimum viable product that can be support youth employment. The Lab will contribute to creating a product whose look and feel appeal to the target group of young people.  The platform will also have an educational component that aids the young in better management of their money and saving.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

We are working on the pilot design of an e-platform for highlighting the skills and talents of young people, facilitates their co-operation among themselves and supports their better money management. The e-Learning Platform and Employment Engine will be continuously monitored by a group of experts who will be involved in testing and provision of feedback to the Consultant on programme design.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What combination of virtual factors would encourage youth and at risk youth to engage in the workforce/ gig economy?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will use the ideas, desires and requirements of at risk youth to create the basis of the digital platform. Key corporate partners and the wider society will be included as much as possible through crowdsourcing. The element of the platform that teaches the management of money and learning how to save is being conceptualised to be fun, as a game would be. Our plan is to eventually do a MVP leading to a prototype of the intervention. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The entire intervention is new and represents what is a first time this is being addressed in Trinidad and Tobago. It is particularly novel regarding the the gig economy, rotational or itinerant work. No system includes the e-learning component for the management of money and savings. Focus group, surveys and the use of social media in this area are new to the UNDP. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Private companies such as online employment engines like caribbeanjobsonline.com and jobstt.com may be interested in adopting this initiative long term on their websites. Also government affiliated youth support entities such as the Youth Training and Rehabilitation Center (YTRC) and Youth Training and Employment Partnership Program (YTEPP), would be key growth partners.
