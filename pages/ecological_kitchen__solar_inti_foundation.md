This solution seeks to address the scarcity of firewood in a deteriorated ecosystem due to deforestation. Its inhabitants suffer lung and smoke-related eye diseases because some foods (corn, beans, etc.) require several hours of fire cooking. The foundation accompanies communities by offering workshops on ecological kitchen construction. Participants assemble these kitchens and ovens using simple tools (hammers, riveters) and recycled material (brick, adobe). These smoke-free kitchens implement efficient systems in the use of firewood for cooking, baking, and heating water.
