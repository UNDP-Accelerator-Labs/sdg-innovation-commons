> Brief description of the innovation

The project involves producing art therapy coloring books that can be used by individuals and be introduced in the education system. In recent years we have seen cases of suicides among students and we want to remind them “you are not alone”.
Therapeutic art is used by health professionals to aid them during patient evaluation and this program will bring it directly to the people in need. There is strong support for integration in primary health care as this will facilitate early detection and intervention of mental health problems. Research indicates a lack of strict attention on mental health in Zambia. According to WHO Mental Health, the top 3 mental disorders among children and adolescents in all regions globally are alcohol and substance abuse, suicide, and depression. This project will bring attention to the effects of lack of intervention and create a platform for more direct actions on finding more solutions and having the conversation around mental health.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

We aim to reach at least 1000 individuals during the first year. In 2018, Chainama hospital recorded 39.7% alcohol-induced disorders which increased from 37.3% in 2015. We have saved up $1000 for the production of the first 100 books which will be used in the first phase to introduce the project and we plan to upscale the production to cater to a wider market.  In 2019, there was an increase in suicide cases which recorded 91 as opposed to 2018, 85 cases of suicide were recorded. This indicates that the lack of strict attention to mental health will continue to cause a rise in such cases. The stigma that surrounds mental health is expected to reduce with more awareness and sensitization. Normalizing the topic even in schools is also going to make young people comfortable to reach out for help. With this in mind, we intend to create a book specifically that can be introduced in the education system and one of our points of entry is private schools, some of which have already shown interest to purchase the books. the challenge prize will firstly create a platform for us to connect with possible stakeholders for our expansion and it will also aid in the production of the product from point of marketing, branding, and complete production. it will allow us to engage the necessary manpower and allow us to reach a larger market. Our target customer is parents with children with a mental problem and adults affected by substance abuse, depression, and high levels of stress. The goal of this product is to be part of a solution that will bring a stop to the stigma that surrounds mental health illnesses in our communities.

> Technical Feasibility

The idea is to produce an art therapy coloring book that will be used by teenagers and adults for therapy and raising awareness on mental health issues. It will also have inspirational messages that will serve as positive affirmations. The need is for people to have a better understanding of what mental health is, it will serve as a means for therapeutic art, and It will provide critical information in a simplified and easy-to-understand form and can be used in the comfort of one’s home without facing any stigma. currently, the prototype is a soft copy of the art therapy coloring book and it is expected to be produced by December of 2021 and introduced on the market by February 2021. The book is still under the content production stage which begun in June of 2021. the prototype shows an overview of how the book will look and how mental health awareness will be combined and embedded in it. the book is intended to be introduced into the education system and also made available to individuals. It will also be sold to corporates to be used as part of their team-building sessions as mental health cases such as high levels of stress are experienced in the corporate sector.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project will be implemented in Lusaka, which is the capital and the largest city in Zambia. According to a study conducted in 2020, it highlighted that Key barriers to mental health care included inadequate funding, few human resources, poor infrastructure, and stigma. Barriers to care at policy, facility, and individual or community level could be alleviated by strengthening the mental health system. The engagement of community health workers and increasing efforts to sensitize the community about mental health would prove beneficial. In Zambia, the prevalence of mental disorders is approximately 20 percent and there is less than 1% allocation of funds in the national budget.  Between 1995 -2001 plans on mental health and clinical care plans had not been reflected until the 2001 -2005 strategic plan when mental health was listed as part of the public health priorities. However, other programs were given priority excluding mental health. Further, stigma and the lack of knowledge or information on mental health has been an added disadvantage to having more solutions. Within the community, the stigma surrounding mental disorders is a significant barrier to mental health service utilization. In Zambia, students, detainees, prisoners, unemployed, and others are described as ‘at risk of developing mental disorders. This brings us to the reason we are including the ministry of education and the ministry of health to mitigate the larger sensitization processes. We recognize our limitations and at the same time our potential to have a great impact on this project
