## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Enhancing food security and nutrition in vulnerable households in South Africa
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that vulnerable communities lack access to nutrient rich food sources, resulting in rapidly rising food insecurity, malnutrition and an increased risk of contracting and loss of life from COVID 19. In South Africa, where income and livelihood is already threatened due to rising unemployment levels and national economic decline, COVID 19 has exacerbated the situation resulting in more families struggling to source food.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Our challenge is that global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa's financial decline and high levels of unemployment, are known to send shockwaves through food systems (FAO, 2020a; FAO, 2020b). These shocks are manifested in different ways, but they all ultimately affect the health and wellbeing of a population. A protracted pandemic crisis could rapidly put a strain on food supply chains, which are a complex web of interactions involving farmers, agricultural inputs, processing plants, shipping, retailers and more (FAO, 2015; FAO, 2019; FAO, 2020a). Some reports have claimed that COVID-19 may disrupt formal and informal food chains, logistics and supplies, potentially doubling global food insecurity and chronic hunger by the end of 2020. It has also been reported that the death toll due to acute hunger as an indirect consequence of COVID-19 may exceed that of direct COVID-19-related deaths. The poorest and most vulnerable populations are more seriously affected by such shocks in the food system as they have fewer resources to cope with the loss of jobs and incomes, the increase in food prices, and the instability of food availability (FAO, 2020c). Research shows that COVID-19 is especially lethal to people suffering from chronic or acute hunger or malnourishment. Reports also agree that poor nutrition weakens the immune system and jeopardises the body’s ability to fight the COVID-19 infection. Diet-wise, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to cause declining demand for vegetables, fruits, and animal-sourced foods, which are the main sources of essential micronutrients in diets. Declining purchasing power will inadvertently cause poor people to buy the cheapest calories they can find to feed their families. The fact that most nutrient-rich foods are perishable leads to attempts to acquire products with simpler supply chains, increasing availability to non-perishable staple foods and further compounding the tendency toward poor-quality diets. FAO (2020a) states that the immediate needs of vulnerable populations must be met in pandemics such as the one we are currently facing, as follows: 1. Provide emergency food assistance and nutrition interventions; 2. Enhance safety nets and make them more accessible; 3. Ensure urgent increases in food availability from smallholder farmer food production; 4. Make temporary adjustments to trade and tax policies to improve the efficiency of trade facilitation; and 5. Manage macro-economic implications. Hence this action plan seeks to address the threat to food security among the most vulnerable and marginalized communities resulting from the country's economic decline and compounded by COVID 19.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

As the Accelerator Lab we learn from doing/action. We have the ability to quickly experiment/pilot new interventions to better understand if they can positively impact a challenge, and also learn what supporting mechanisms should be in place to ensure success of interventions (through our quick feedback loop). The AccLab also supports innovative ideas, so new/novel solutions can be implemented with little risk (we are allowed to fail fast) unlike UNDP programmes where a positive outcome should be mostly guaranteed. Additionally, our diverse skill sets allows us to assess new solutions from multiple angles and perspectives, and determine their ability to solve a problem.  To this end we are experimenting with 3 new types of sustainable home gardens. These include trench beds, tower gardens and keyhole gardens. This will be supplemented by the introduction of livestock as a source of protein (specifically, rabbit meat, chicken meat and/or eggs). There is also a focus on training communities and taking the "training the teacher" approach by training lead community members/activists.  The gardens will also make use of local organic materials (household biowaste recycling) as well as relying on greywater from the households to irrigate the vegetables.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Improving food security and household income in vulnerable communities by implementing sustainable, household gardens; keyhole, tower and trench bed gardens that recycle greywater and household biowaste 
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

Institute of Natural Resources (INR)


</div>



<div class="group">


> What sector does our partner belong to?


</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

The INR arranges it activities around four themes, one of which is Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods, which will be leading the implementation of this initiative. The Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods theme addresses multiple focal areas, including water management, sustainable landscape management, as well as rural entrepreneurship through our various projects. Our research looks at how we can support local innovation and development of capabilities within the small-scale and rural agricultural sectors, recognising that in many cases the technologies exist and innovation lies in modes of implementation. As INR takes an Action research and social learning approach, and understands the need to empower local farmers and rural communities, INR will partner with UNDP to implement the gardens within the communities. INR will also explore the introduction of new meat sources, such as rabbits, into communities. INR also has close relations with the communities, therefore communities will welcome this pilot project. UNDP will be closely involved in monitoring the experimental results, looking for new data and trends, and new solutions as communities adapt the gardens to suit their needs.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Can sustainable gardens improve food security in vulnerable households and serve as a potential source of income.  

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioral Insights and ethnography will be used to understand the culture of communities to gauge their willingness to be trained to implement sustainable gardens. Are they keen to produce their own food, are there societal/cultural barriers in producing your own food, willingness to learn versus requesting hand-outs.? Are communities willing to test new meat sources such as rabbit - traditionally viewed as a friendly animal.  Participatory design/prototyping - communities will access training centers or demonstration sites to learn how to build the gardens and animal cages, and empowered to choose their most preferred garden designs and meat sources. Once taught the basic designs, communities are free to adapt the design to their needs, advise on improvements, choose materials based on what is locally available, etc.  Pilots: The gardens will be implemented and then monitored over an extended period (pilot period) to assess its impact. Aspects to be investigated during the pilot include: ·   To evaluate the procedures and processes used for project implementation – understanding what factors have affected the success of the project; To evaluate the success of the gardens - has household food security improved. Have the gardens turned into a source of income beyond improving household nutrition.  Are the types of gardens successful - is one design better then the others? Have the gardens proliferated around the community? Have households reused their greywater and bio-waste or not? If not, why?  Have the alternate meat sources been accepted? ·       To evaluate the impact of the project on the participating households (including unintended benefits, especially intangible impacts), and disaggregated for women and youth in particular; ·       To evaluate the different garden elements/systems for vegetable and smallstock production – including the factors that may be barriers to maintenance of the gardens beyond the timeframe of the project; ·       To identify examples where people adapted the systems (i.e. grassroots innovation) to better fit the local context. ·       To use the knowledge gained from the evidence and analysis to make recommendations on how to sustain, replicate and modify projects of this nature; ·
