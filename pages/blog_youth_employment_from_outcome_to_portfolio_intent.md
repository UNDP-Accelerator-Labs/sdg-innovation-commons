Get to know each other for better collaborationIn an inspiring gathering aimed at fostering collaboration and mutual understanding, several key programs were presented, each showcasing the impactful work being done by our institutions. These programs are not just initiatives—they are powerful drivers of change, focusing on youth employability and women's empowerment. The presentations offered a glimpse into the innovative strategies and solutions we are exploring and experimenting to create sustainable job opportunities for the youth of Mozambique. Youth unemployment is a big challenge in as of 2024, Mozambique's population stands at approximately 34.9 million, with a significant portion under 35 years old, contributing to a young demographic profile. The youth (ages 15–24), who represent a critical segment of the workforce, face an unemployment rate estimated at 8.3% overall disaggregated to 7.1% for young men and 9.7% for young women. This gender gap highlights ongoing challenges in achieving equal employment opportunities. Through shared insights and a collective vision, we are not only getting to know each other better but also laying the groundwork for future collaborations that will amplify our impact. This event highlighted the beauty and dedication behind each of our efforts, proving that together, we are going to make a significant difference.
Exploring Collaborative OpportunitiesThe seminar emphasized the importance of collaboration between SEJE (Secretaria de Estado da Juventude e Emprego) and the United Nations System in Mozambique, particularly the UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), in fostering youth employability and empowerment. The participants recognized that creating sustainable employment opportunities for youth and advancing women's empowerment require a coordinated and integrated approach.The seminar emphasized the importance of collaboration between SEJE (Secretaria de Estado da Juventude e Emprego) and the United Nations System in Mozambique, particularly the UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), in fostering youth employability and empowerment.

1. Identifying Synergies Between SEJE and UNDP ProgramsA key area of discussion was identifying synergies between SEJE’s ongoing programs and UNDP’s strategic initiatives. The participants highlighted several programs where collaboration could be particularly impactful: Youth Empowerment through Vocational Training: SEJE’s programs on vocational training, particularly through IFPELAC, align closely with UNDP’s initiatives aimed at building skills and competencies among young people. By integrating resources and expertise, these programs can expand their reach and effectiveness, ensuring that more young people acquire market-relevant skills. Entrepreneurship and Innovation: Both SEJE and UNDP are committed to promoting entrepreneurship among the youth. Collaborative efforts could focus on enhancing entrepreneurial ecosystems, providing young entrepreneurs with access to funding, mentorship, and business development services. This could also include supporting initiatives like the IFPELAC’s Incubadora de Soluções and others. Gender-Responsive Employment Initiatives: The participants agreed on the need for gender-specific programs that address the unique challenges faced by young women in the labor market. SEJE’s focus on empowering young women, combined with UNDP’s expertise in gender equality and women’s empowerment, presents an opportunity to design and implement targeted interventions that promote equitable employment opportunities.2. Formalizing the Partnership: A Roadmap to SuccessDuring the discussions, it was proposed that SEJE and UNDP formalize their partnership through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). This MoU would outline the specific areas of collaboration, including shared goals, resource allocation, and mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation. The roadmap to formalizing this partnership would involve:Defining Key Objectives: Clearly stating the mutual objectives of the collaboration. Setting Milestones: Establishing short-term and long-term milestones to track progress and ensure that both parties are aligned in their efforts. These milestones would include launching new programs, scaling existing initiatives, and achieving specific employment targets.Engagement with Stakeholders: Actively involving other stakeholders, including private sector partners, civil society organizations, and academic institutions, to leverage their expertise and resources. 3. Building Capacity for Sustainable DevelopmentAnother crucial aspect discussed was the need for capacity-building. This involves: Training and Development: Providing train on project management, data collection and analysis, and monitoring and evaluation techniques and other areas relevant.Knowledge Sharing: Establishing platforms for regular knowledge exchange between SEJE, UNDP, and other stakeholders. This would include sharing best practices, lessons learned, and innovative solutions to common challenges.Strengthening Institutional Frameworks: Working together to strengthen the institutional frameworks that support youth employability and women’s empowerment in Mozambique. This includes advocating for policy reforms, enhancing regulatory mechanisms, and ensuring that programs are aligned with national development goals.The seminar concluded with a commitment to scale up successful initiatives through joint efforts. Replicating successful youth employment initiatives in other regions of Mozambique, particularly in underserved and rural areas, to ensure that all young people have access to employment opportunities and design of road map for youth employment activities until January 2025.
