As part of the Empowering Rural Resilience through the Nusantara Green Village Initiative, UNDP Indonesia Accelerator Lab organized waste management training sessions for 40 residents in a rural area surrounding Nusantara, Indonesia's new capital city. The sessions covered both organic and non-organic waste management, focusing on practical techniques such as composting, maggot farming, and ecoenzyme production, alongside non-organic practices like creating ecobricks and upcycling materials. These methods aim to transform waste into valuable resources while fostering environmental stewardship.

The training emphasized the potential of organic waste to be repurposed into products like fertilizers and natural cleaning agents, while non-organic practices promoted resource reuse and innovation. To encourage immediate application, composting bags were distributed, equipping participants to begin composting at home and implement sustainable waste management practices in their daily lives.

This initiative not only addresses critical waste disposal challenges in rural communities but also empowers residents with innovative, resource-efficient skills. By fostering sustainable practices, it supports the broader vision of Nusantara as a resilient and environmentally responsible forest city.
