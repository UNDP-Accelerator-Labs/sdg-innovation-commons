Fatu Uegé, developed a washing powder which she sells and gifts at well below market price. Fatu lives in Farim, a sector separated from the closest biggest city by a river. Due to inaccessibility and lack of employment she and her community have been limited in ways they can buy washing up powder. With inflated prices in Farim, she tested and prototyped till she developed a washing powder which used only local products. With the success of her washing powder she is able to sell but also give to other women of the city who face the same issues as her.
