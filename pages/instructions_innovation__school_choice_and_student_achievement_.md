Instructions innovation, school choice and student achievement.

> Brief description of the innovation

Innovation is the introduction of something new,  furthering progress in society.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Few would argue that the oil and gas Marine equipment and service sector has faced a difficult few years. Things are definitely not what they used to be . But now is not the time to be negative and just sit back and hope the market will one day improve. It's up to oil services and product companies to innovate and adapt to develop new groundbreaking solutions and win new customers. In the words of former U.S. president bill Clinton, "The price of doing the same old thing is far higher than the price of change."

> Technical Feasibility

Technical feasibility is, in the most basic sense, defined by system operation capacity factor and thermal efficiency (as a percent of the energy resources converted to a more usable energy currency or product).

> Anticipated Social Impact

Perhaps the biggest impact innovation has had on society is regarding TECHNOLOGY, which is in effect, embedded in almost everything we do. From agriculture to transport, technology is changing the way we live our lives and interact with those around us. This is especially true in relation to robot process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI).
