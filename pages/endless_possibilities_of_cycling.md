Inspired by the idea of an active lifestyle, Amid and Bahlul, founders of Handbike Azerbaijan, are promoting
cycling for people with disabilities in Baku.

Notably, the friends started without any bicycle, and, guided by youtube videos, they constructed the first one themselves. "Our first bicycle weighed 65 kg, but, of course, it had a symbolic meaning." Although not comfortable, they managed to participate in the city marathon with that bike. The second bicycle Amid made by considering the lesson learned from the first experience.

Amid and Bahlul emphasized that people with disabilities do not need pity. Cycling empowers them, and they want to share this joy with others.
