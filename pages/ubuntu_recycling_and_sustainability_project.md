> Title of the innovation

Ubuntu Recycling and sustainability project

> Brief description of the innovation

The project pilot is a two part project that encompasses community outreach, research, development and implementation of alternative solid waste disposal options. This proposed waste management through education and alternative solid waste disposal method project pilot has been designed  to heighten community awareness on the importance of reducing the environmental impacts of solid waste disposal while gathering data to identify diversified recycling s reuse methods beneficial for sustainable community development. The implementation of the project will include the use of machines that are designed on traditional industrial concepts but on a much smaller scale so that costs and knowledge entry level can be kept at a minimum. The machines ate developed using basic technologies and materials so they are easily understood, reproduced and repaired by people with basic metal and building skills. The machines can be distributed in a stations in different communities small scale recycling can be done at those locations. Individuals interested in recycling will be invited to participate in workshops,community clean-up,recycling campaigns,and practical applications employment opportunities to contribute to the recycling project pilot.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

On a smaller scale, the project would be using plastic waste as raw material to produce plastic products such as plastic cups, plastic plates, necklaces, bracelets etc. This could help generate income by selling these products produced to people in the community or to companies and shops looking for such products. On a larger scale plastic waste would be used on larger projects such as building roads and generation of energy. The project is aimed at reducing pollution by reducing the amount of plastic waste that pollutes the environment hence creating a more sustainable way of plastic disposal, which is no disposal at all but recycling and reuse.

> Technical Feasibility

There is no prototype. The implementation of the project is based on the blue print of the machinery available. The small scale machines will be built by individuals with basic metal work and building knowledge, these machines will be distributed around communities and agents will be assigned to carry out recycling processes.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The project is expected to create jobs for many youths in various communities as it has been observed that lack of jobs is a huge problem among Zambian youths.
