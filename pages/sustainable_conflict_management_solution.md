Sustainable Conflict Management Solution

> Qualitative Results of the Innovation

1. Improved cross-border trade: RASMI facilitated the development of cross-border trade in the region, leading to increased economic opportunities for the people living in border areas. This has contributed to a reduction in tensions and conflicts related to competition for resources.


2. Increased community participation in conflict management: The project encouraged community members to participate in conflict management processes, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility for peaceful coexistence. This has contributed to the strengthening of social cohesion in the region.


3. Enhanced intercultural understanding: The project provided opportunities for people from different cultures and backgrounds to interact and learn from one another. This helped to break down stereotypes and prejudices, leading to increased trust and respect between communities.


4. Strengthened institutional capacity: RASMI provided training and capacity building for local institutions and organizations involved in conflict management. This enhanced their ability to respond to conflicts in a timely and effective manner, contributing to the maintenance of social cohesion in the region.
