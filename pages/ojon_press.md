Jose Pedro dos Santos (Zeca), developed a manual Ojon pressing machine to make the work of women of Bubaque easier. Palm Oil is a big part of the produce Bideras (female market sellers) take to the markets of Bubaque and it is also a product that is highly sought after. Althought, the process of extracting the palm oil can often be physically harmful and unsafe. Zeca developed this machine to make the work easier and allow them to produce in higher quantities. Women can bring their Ojon to be pressed at his workshop.
