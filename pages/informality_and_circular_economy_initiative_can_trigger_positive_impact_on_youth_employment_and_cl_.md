## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

-Information gathered from informal actors were key to build the experiment approach -Collective intelligence in the context on non-existence of formal data is a poweful lever to accelerate insights generation from a unknown system -The network effect provided by KivuTech (the incubator) ensured a fast paced collaboration with the right stakeholders -Each phase of the pilot ( collection, sorting, transformation) has an encouraging capacity to generate sustainable employment for the Youth if a comprehensive incentive system is in place, ongoing awarness for household and local authority engagement to support business

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The successful pitch we did at the mayor's office helped paved the way to minimize bottlenecks. Instead, we had full support at all phases to deploy the pilot

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

The City of Bukavu has no sanitation or waste recycling system in the city. So we had to deal with limited knowledge by bridging the gap with local actors which are youth startups trying to prove that the model is meant to dilute lake pollution and the city in general. So, the interviews with the city mayor, informal conversations with a few workers acting in the collection of plastic waste at a smaller scale, and knowledge sharing with those transforming plastic waste into pavers were key to generating insights.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

To learn if plastic waste recycling can address youth unemployment in the local context, minimal stakeholders mapping was necessary. first of all, mapping existing solutions in the transformation of plastic waste was the first initiative we carried out. Second, knowing what actors are engaged at a minimal level in the entire value chain was priceless to understand the state of the system in which they operate. Last but not least, we had to co-create a pilot together with the support of an incubator ( injecting capacity building for startups at the same time)as well as the involvement of the city mayor in providing a site downtown to experiment with the final product (plastic pavers). The combination of each approach at different stages improved rapidly our knowledge of how such an endeavor would be implemented as model 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Casque Vert is a citizen movement that works to raise awareness and promote ecological habits in communities. They have been a great help in understanding the behavioural dimension to consider in the process. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We have collaborated with startups with whom we co-designed the the Pilot and collected learnings from each chain. Among them we have worked with Full Development Agency the provider of plastic paver MVP; PlastyCor; Plastics Can Make It Beautiful in the transformation of plastic waste into decorative objects, AgriDev, SAV Sarl, Solidarité Des Jeunes Pour le Développement in the collection and sorting value chain 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We have partnered with the City mayor's office to secure site allocation that will be used to test transformed plastic waste into pavers

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Historically, working with an incubator in collaboration with the mayor's office is unusual to the country office. KivuTech (the incubator)played a key role in facilitating information gathering, stakeholders engagement, and fueling trust among the local startups involved in the process. From the 2 partners alone, we dived easily in comprehending the system within a short period of time
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

From the non-existence of a formal waste remediation system, to the lack of official data on the subject in the local context, the combination of methods and above all the contribution of unusual stakeholders has accelerated our understanding of the issues of at each phase in the value chain
