Michael and Ken, two university students who call themselves "the Knights" invented a high-tech automated weeding robot. The duo came up with the automated machine to eliminate the use of herbicides by farmers making the implication of this technology on the environment a momentous one. The robot discriminates between weeds and crops through cameras and uses the same cameras to navigate through the farm, in between rows of crops.
