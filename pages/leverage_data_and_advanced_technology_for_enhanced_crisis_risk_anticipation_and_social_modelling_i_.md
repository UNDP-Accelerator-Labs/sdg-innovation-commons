Leverage Data and Advanced Technology for Enhanced Crisis Risk Anticipation and Social Modelling in Bosnia and Herzegovina
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is to navigate through Bosnia and Herzegovina's perpetuating poly-crisis, exacerbated by COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, while grappling with a complex institutional setup, internal divisions, and a lack of relevant data and analytical capability that undermines our understanding and ability to effectively address the deepening social, political, and ethnic divisions, poverty, environmental concerns, and the overarching threat to the country's post-war existence.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?






One would have hoped that 30 years after the 1992 – 1995 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the country would be prosperous, firmly integrated into the European Union (EU). Regrettably, that is not the case. Bosnia and Herzegovina, today, is facing a perpetuating poly-crisis, a situation now aggravated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. As the work of authorities is increasingly being hampered by a complex institutional set-up and internal divisions, there is a failure to effectively tackle the compounding and unpredictable challenges, such as population loss, endemic corruption, poor economic conditions, deepening poverty and inequalities, environmental concerns and continued social, political and ethnic division. The
surveys suggest that people are less likely to interact with members of a different ethnic group at work, in education, socially or through cultural activities and do not interact even when driving through one another’s
territory. In addition to this growing ethnic distance, there is a widening political divide and other social divisions, including between genders and generations. 

Nationalism and antagonistic political identities are alive and deepening. Social cohesion had already been eroding before the war in Ukraine, with social connections across ethnicities weakening over the past decade. UNDP has identified that the weakening of social connections varies across age cohorts, with a 2019 survey showing that respondents younger than 40 years of age reported fewer friends from other ethnic groups than respondents who were older than 40 years of age. For example, 78% of the younger respondents who identified as Bosniak reported having no Serb friends, whilst 69% of Bosniak respondents older than 40 years of age reported having no Serb friends. None of the Croat respondents younger than 40 years of age reported having Bosniak friends. This societal fragmentation and polarisation are deepened by gender inequalities.
Unequal power distribution and access to resources impact women’s security as well as their meaningful participation in decision-making and economic resilience. After the 2020 Municipal Elections and the 2022 Parliamentary Elections, it is evident that women are still under-represented in politics and
public life. Research also points to a strong negative impact of hate speech, misogyny and violence against women who are active in public life. This is especially so with social media and other digital channels deepening societal polarization and providing new and insidious ways of intimidation. While some relevant data
is available, it is often a micro level, and it lacks disaggregation by gender, ethnicity, etc. which would enable multi-dimensional analysis, towards identifying root causes of the peace challenges and translated into actionable policy options and interventions.   

In addition to growing ethnic distance, there is a widening political divide and other social divisions, with conflicting visions of the future, including between genders and generations. Hate speech, glorification of war criminals and denial of genocide and war crimes prevent societies from dealing with their collective past, constituting renewed trauma of the victims and their loved ones, a lack of healing while also perpetuating injustice and undermining interethnic relationships. Only 0.26% of the content in educational curriculums in use across the three education systems in Bosnia and Herzegovina was found to promote critical thinking, highlighting a critical, structural weakness that may prevent individuals from overcoming the top-down divisive narratives and hate speech. It is worth noting that in 2021, Bosnia and Herzegovina experienced the greatest
loss in Human Development Index value resulting from inequality. All of this deepens social divides and prevents the emergence of desperately needed reconciliation and forgiveness. In fact, the country faces the greatest existential threat of the post-war period, according to the High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Against this background, a lack of relevant data and adequate analytical capability undermines not only the ability to understand the volume and magnitude of challenges but also diminishes the potential for anticipating and designing future-looking policies and measures or engineering transformational development support. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, data is too often used as an instrument for the highly politicised and divisive agenda. Untapped and not yet leveraged technology and new analytical tools may thus serve as powerful instruments for anticipation, risk prevention, or the articulation of conflict prevention and new policy options, which may in turn help to enhance the resilience of communities and society.

UNDP in Bosnia and Herzegovina will undertake a joint effort with UNDP Kosovo* in designing and conducting a study to identify opportunities for women's engagement in environmental justice as a pathway to peace. The study will examine the environmental and conflict risks, especially for women in rural or less developed areas, and provide insights if women have been at the forefront of environmental activism and advocacy and in what way. Furthermore, the study can raise public awareness of environmental issues and empower communities, especially women, to advocate for environmental justice. The results of this study will feed into the CRD of both countries.

Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning

Implement AI and machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of media and research data, creating a "digital twin" that simulates the social fabric of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This involves developing predictive models that can identify patterns, trends, and the impact of different variables on social cohesion.




Behavioural Insights

Apply behavioural science principles to interpret the data and simulations generated by AI, focusing on understanding the motivations, biases, and decision-making processes of individuals and communities. This involves analyzing how online discourse influences offline behaviour and vice versa.





Prototyping

Develop prototypes and models of interventions based on the insights gained from AI analysis and behavioral insights. This could include digital campaigns, policy recommendations, or community programs designed to
amplify positive narratives and reduce conflict.




Social Network Analysis




Employ social network analysis to map and examine the structures of social connections within Bosnia and Herzegovina, including online and offline networks. This method helps identify key influencers,
community structures, and the flow of information.

Ethnography will be employed to gain deep insights into the experiences, motivations, and challenges faced by women involved in environmental justice, especially those in rural or less developed areas. This
approach involves immersive fieldwork, including participant observation, in-depth interviews, and engagement with community members to understand the cultural, social, and environmental dynamics at play.

The exploratory approach will be applied throughout the study to identify opportunities for women's engagement in environmental justice initiatives. This includes exploring new areas of research, such as the
intersection of gender with environmental and conflict risks, and identifying innovative ways women can contribute to and lead environmental activism and
advocacy.
