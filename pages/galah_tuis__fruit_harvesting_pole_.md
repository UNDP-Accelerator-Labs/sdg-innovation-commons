This handy tool enables fruits to be swiftly and easily wrapped directly on tree branches without the need to climb up trees. The innovation protects damage to ripening fruits caused by birds, insects and tree-climbing animals such as squirrels while also reducing the risk of accidents from falling off trees. It is easy to use with minimal maintenance costs.
