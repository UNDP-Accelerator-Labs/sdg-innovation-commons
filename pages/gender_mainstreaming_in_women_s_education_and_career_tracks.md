Gender Mainstreaming in Women's STEM Education and Career Tracks
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that based on available data, fewer women are presented in STEM education and further segregation in the STEM Labor market in Uzbekistan. Most of the women are presented in the following areas: farming and education. Moreover, gender studies were not developed during the last decades, and most of the data on gender issues is not available.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The socialization process has a tremendous influence on the way we think, self-determine ourselves, interact with society and establish social norms (stereotypes).  The impact of social norms on women in Uzbekistan is significant. They affect almost all social, economic, and political areas and in their negative manifestation, they heavily contribute to inequalities between women and men. The Education 2030 agenda recognizes that gender equality requires an approach that 'ensures that girls and boys, women and men not only gain access to and complete education cycles but are empowered equally in and through education’1. Gender equality, in all areas of life, is a fundamental human right that positively influences not only girls and women but every single member of society. Despite all guarantees of providing and establishing equal opportunities for girls and women, improvements are slow and insubstantial and worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. Therefore, women and girls are at high risk of experiencing abuse, poverty, illiteracy, being stigmatized by society, and being less presented in leadership positions as well as STEM and IT education.   

Family:

Family is the starting point for developing social and cultural stereotypes and establishing how we will interact with the world by being the central mechanism of socialization and social integration. To achieve gender equality, increase women's empowerment, and provide more equal opportunities for girls, it is crucial to incorporate and understand the cultural roles of parents, other family members, their values, goals, social and cultural norms, and to what extent they contribute to   Patriarchal social norms  Social norms play a crucial role in establishing gender prejudices towards girls and women and influence their personal development. For example, in patriarchal societies from birth, social and cultural norms teach girls to be patient, and submissive, have smaller expectations and opportunities in life, and be oriented to taking care of their husbands, children, and other family members. These social norms limit girls' opportunities and potential, influence their communication skills, and networking abilities, and make unwanted choices in personal, professional, and academic areas of life.   

Education:

Many studies show the importance of gender awareness in education and family environments in helping children explore whom they want to be in the future, encouraging girls to obtain professions that they are passionate about, such as STEM, IT, Innovations, and others. The provision of equal opportunities for girls in the education system changes stereotypical attitudes in society. It positively changes women's roles in different areas, such as the labor market, family, culture, and community. Even though women's rights have improved significantly, the majority of women are still left behind compared to men in their educational and professional accomplishments. There are great examples of women playing an essential role as a source of human capital and role models for other girls. However, these examples are more exceptions and are not common in society overall.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

During the last several years, Gender issues were not a high priority of the government’s agenda. No studies on gender equality were conducted during the last several decades. When the new government came 5 years ago, Gender issues were identified as one of the main areas of development in different areas of society. During the last year Accelerator Lab in Uzbekistan successfully tested out the gender-based initiative #CallUmida (safe streets for women and girls). Moreover, we explored other areas where we can add value propositions in terms of gender issues. Exploration and collective intelligence sessions with UNDP colleagues and external partners, as well as a review of social media, made us realize that in order to start experimenting in the area of Gender in Uzbekistan, we need avoidances and sometimes not only negative but look on the problem from the different perspective, especially when we talk about young women in STEM education and profession.  When society and development organizations talk about Gender equality, they usually bring up negative aspects of stereotypes and their influences on the groups. In AccLab we decided to change the approach and show the positive aspects/deviances that make girls join STEM forces, presenting them as role models for other young women, families, communities, media, and society. We decided to connect with girls and women who are already in STEM and ask what made them pursue their education and careers in such an “unpopular” field for women. We have in mind that when people are shown good examples, they tend to follow them and change their behaviors toward the role of girls and women in our society.

The objectives of the initiative are to spotlight the misbalances and challenges in women’s education and career tracks in Uzbekistan in the context of cultural, social, economic, or other settings and to test potential solutions to address the issues. The initiative specifically aims to track factors with positive and implement interventions which can trigger behavioral changes, empower women and girls in their education and careers, as well as contribute to general awareness on the associated issues. The anticipated outputs of the initiative are the following:  

• Identifying factors resulting in the deviations in women’s education/career applying positive deviances analysis based on: 

1. Focus group interviews

2. Deep interviews 

3. Survey   

Phase II:

Phase II will build on the results of the Phase I. In this stage insights and learnings will be mainstreamed broadly as well as in a targeted manner through an individual mentorship program by selected role models, training programs, and various awareness-raising activities. 

Mentorship program by role models (if possible, as a pilot media show on TV):

A mentorship program will be developed based on the results of the positive/negative deviance studies. Successful behaviors and strategies will be promoted through tailored mentorship programs for young women. The plan is to engage selected role-models - prominent women in STEM areas and women entrepreneurs. If agreements are reached, the mentorship program will be formatted as a TV show to be aired on one of the mainstream TV channels. 

Training and guidelines for media representatives:

The results of the analysis of gender stereotypes will be used in developing training courses and guidelines for media representatives on avoiding gender bias and stereotypes, and gender-mainstreaming in their work. 

Training and guidelines for educational institutions/families:

The results of the studies will also be used in developing training and guidelines for educational institutions, communities, and families to promote the successful behaviors and strategies in supporting advancement of young women’s education and careers.
