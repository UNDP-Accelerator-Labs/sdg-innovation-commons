Grow your Reader Foundation is a non-profit organization that works to develop the education quality in Bangladesh and make sure that more children are getting the chance to be enlightened by proper education. They are doing this through several initiatives: “WoW-Wheels of Wisdom (জ্ঞানের গাড়ি)” is a mobile library project which uses three-wheeled vans with books and an internet connection to help disadvantaged children continue learning while schools were closed during the pandemic. Since the start of this project, three mobile libraries in 9 communities have distribute over 7400 books to 8500 children and have provided them with more than 34000 hours of internet access from their mobile hotspots in Jashore, Barishal, and Mymensingh. During this Covid 19 pandemic, Grow Your Reader launched a street library project called “Book Garage,” which is founded on a simple principle—leave your old books behind so that those who don’t have the means can discover a new book for free. “Book Garage” has been set up on 19 streets in Dhaka, Jamalpur, Tangail, and Chittagong, where children can take the books, read them, and after reading them, bring them back and borrow new books. Grow Your Reader has placed 1,500 books in these street libraries. “Book Garage” aims to increase literacy gradually and inspire the children currently out of school to keep reading and learning. Grow Your Reader Foundation’s educational stories such as social & emotional Learning- SEL, Sustainable Living, Childhood Mental Health, and Child Food & Nutrition are available in Bangladesh’s first audio-book app “শুনবই”.
