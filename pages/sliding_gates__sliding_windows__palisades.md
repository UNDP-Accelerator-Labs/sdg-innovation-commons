> Title of the innovation

Sliding gates, sliding windows, Palisades

> Brief description of the innovation

Fabrication of all metal types of mild steel, ranging from tankstands, gates, Palisades, carports and also farm fencing, electric fencing, and gate automation.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will help existing businesses because I'll be buying steel from steel manufacturing industries like kafue steel and turn it into a finished product. My innovation targets farm owners who want their farms fenced for grazing of their animals or for farming land and also government organizations that needs security. Making Palisades,farm fencing  and gates will help secure or barricade work premises from intruders, also add beautiful to it.

> Technical Feasibility

It is designed using mild steel by welding different measured joints to form a desired structure. To implement this we need a container or a workshop where steel can be kept and also fabricated structures for customers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It's is already helping many youths in my area because am using them as helpers and through that others have improved to good welders who I now sending to do other works without being there myself. This innovation is relevant to the current market in that many people are building houses and work places so our innovation is definitely needed to fabricate their gates, Palisades to secure there their premises. And also government embarked on infrastructure development which needs more fabrication.
