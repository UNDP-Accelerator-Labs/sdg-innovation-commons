## Solution holder: Batoul Al-Rashdan

In this last century, we have been crafting, designing, and growing materials independently from their future use. This has caused major design flaws in our daily lives, where we find ourselves surrounded by plastics, while observing knowledge about local materials and techniques disappear and left unused even when in abundance. This research focused on exploring material alternatives to the current ones. By bridging craftsmanship techniques and today's easier access to technologies, exploring alternative material resources to craft their processing and develop products and materials hand in hand.
