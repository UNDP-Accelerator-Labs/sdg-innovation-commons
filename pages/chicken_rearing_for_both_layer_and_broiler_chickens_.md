> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Agriculture is a multi million dollar business which plays a huge role to a countries economic growth ,with the high rise in the population growth around the world , food is in such high demand  and I plan on taking advantage of that by supplying my eggs and chickens in the markets. With the help of the prize I would love to improve my business by buying necessary supplies such a cages to keep my layer chickens in, improve the chicken runs to make them more suitable to rear my chickens in etc which will help me grow my business enabling me to help create jobs for people to work for me. My target market will be the local markets Where I'll sell my eggs and chickens to the marketeers for them to later sell on to the public in the markets. The environmental aspect of my business is that I can use and sell the chicken feces also known as chicken manure which is used as an organic fertilizer in most gardens.

> Technical Feasibility

Our farm is in kalulushi about 8km into town. We have a truck which is a good mode of tranporting both the eggs and chickens to the market. Kalulushi to kitwe is about 23 km which has a large market I would love to target for my growth.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My business will help create a chain of employment for myself,my employees and the marketeers. Food is on high demand due to high increase in population growth in the country. Food helps fight hunger, as competitive as the food market is it still has enough room for more food suppliers. Food Is a necessity which helps provide us with proteins necessary for body growth and good health.
