> Brief description of the innovation

This is a business idea that was born a few years ago after isolating/realising we had a huge fish deficit,high fish market prices and a high demand for fish despite having one of the freshest water bodies on our continent, alot of available land for use .
Our natural water bodies have faced fish depopulation due to excessive and dangerous fishing methods used by our fishermen to try and meet up with the growing demand and make a living for themselves.
We came up with this business idea to help and solve some of these problems highlighted.
Currently we have excavated four ponds with hope of making more. Of these only two are functional (stocked with 5000&amp; 3000 fingerlings respectively). Our vision is to have 24 big ponds that we can harvest on twice monthly,this will go a long way in ensuring consistency and help us retain our markets base.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Fish farming business is one of the fastest growing industry in Zambia,and we have no doubt that our business if well nutured plus financial support has potential to grow ,not just itself but the community,country and continent at Large, our consumers/Target markets will be assured of first grade fish that will help in increasing their income.
 Through fish farming sales we will be able to make profit that will changes many lives. Our Target market is mainly restaurants, supermarkets,hotels, individuals, fish centers.
The challenge prize money will go a long way I'm ensuring that we have a borehole and a fully functional hatchery.
We will not waste any of our resources,the water from our ponds will go directly to the gardens ,the waste from the fish will be used to make fish meal . 
We will also use non conventional feeds like duckweed/azola as supplementary feed .

> Technical Feasibility

Our business is designed to run in mainly 3 stages .
But due to financial constraints we have not yet attained our milestones.
1. Hatchery :- we will produce fingerlings for our ponds and for resell to farmers around us , as currently we do not have a fully functional hatchery as a district.
2. Fish farming :- here we are growing fish in our ponds for resell as table sized fish and growing the others as broodstock for production.
3. Value addition:- At this stage we plan on adding value to our products by smoking/drying our fish,making fish fillets and using the waste as fish meal.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our business Will improve lives of people who are around us through Job creation mainly to youths, women and differently abled people. Aside from that we are also helping our community improve their nutritional status through protein intake. We believe our efforts will also add and improve the national GDP. 
We also take is as our social responsibility to train willing youths and and women who have the interest in fish farming and also empower them with funds / consultancy services that will also help them build their businesses.
