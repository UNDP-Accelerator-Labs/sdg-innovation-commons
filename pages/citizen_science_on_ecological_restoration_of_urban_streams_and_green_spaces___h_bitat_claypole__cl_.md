## Type of project

Evaluate techniques for the reintroduction of native aquatic and riparian plants and their survival in the environment. 

Evaluate the effect of the reintroduction of aquatic and riparian plants on ecosystem biodiversity and water quality. 

Develop water treatment devices or ecological management strategies to mitigate pollutants in the stream that enter through the domestic stormwater system.

## Overall goal

Collaboratively design, implement and assess tools for the ecological restoration of urban streams and green spaces close to the bed of the Arroyo San Francisco (Claypole, Almirante Brown, province of Buenos Aires). 
## Description of citizen participation

In regular meetings, through participatory techniques, participants jointly establish a diagnosis of local issues and share updates about them. They also discuss the design and implementation of solutions and plan the activities included in the project and each actor/participant’s responsibilities. Citizen engagement in the design and implementation is reflected in the construction and installation of devices for the treatment of effluents entering the stream, the procurement of the necessary materials, and the cultivation and reproduction of aquatic and riparian plants for the interventions on the stream bed. Citizens also participate in the monitoring of these plants, which includes data collection (taking photographs to assess plant survival and other treatment devices and using field forms to analyze the state of the stream and vegetation), the water sample collection to assess the effects of actions taken related to the stream, and the use of technologies to analyze certain water parameters (pH, temperature, conductivity, nitrates, phosphates, etc.). The participatory analysis of data is carried out in workshops where participants discuss sampling results, treatment device efficiency, the right choices and errors of the actions developed and the next steps to be taken.
