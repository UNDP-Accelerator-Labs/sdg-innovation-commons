## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Integration Gender, equity and social inclusion (GESI) in UNDP projects
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our Challenge is that GESI is not adequately mainstreamed in how UNDP programming and project cycle.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

GESI is seen as a good to have component rather than a must have. It is added into project documents as an afterthought and needs better integration. The Senior Management is keen that this work is undertaken as part of the Gender Strategy and Gender Seal. We want to move GESI from being additional to integral. Along with Governance for Resilience project and support from the Gender Focal point, the AccLab will test new ways for better integration which could be potentially scaled to all UNDP Pacific projects. 

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

Most new UNDP Pacific projects are Gen2 projects whereas legacy projects are Gen1. There are very few Gen3 projects. The Office is keen to move all projects on Gen2 and find ways for projects to adequately implement and report on the gender component. This is a matter of compliance for donors as well as serving our mandate of leaving no one behind.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

Senior Management has discussed this topic at length at the office retreat and asked projects to ramp up their work on gender. At the same retreat, all projects reported they worked heavily on gender but that was not reflected in our dashboard implying some information is not captured and could merit with an intervention. 


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

AccLab is looking to test new tools and methods which can allow projects to track their gender implementation. As this is a cross cutting theme, the AccLab acts as an integrator. The AccLab is also well suited to try something completely new outside of the way gender has been previously understood. 

We have supported a project for integrating innovative frameworks in their GESI action plan. This led to 3 entry points for experimentation – MERL survey /tool for GESI, Participatory monitoring with CSOs and testing capacity building sessions as part of Gender Seal.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

“How do we shift GESI from additional to integral. AccLab Pacific is testing new ways for gender integration and mainstreaming”.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the new ways to integrate and mainstream gender into UNDP Pacific’s all projects and do gender sensitive programming?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

MVP / Pilots / Prototyping / Proof of Concept will be used to test new ways of working and integrating gender Participatory Design will help ensure that interventions are designed with all relevant stakeholders together

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

This data will help understand how to improve uptake and adoption of gender. It will help identify tools / methodologies which can be embedded in our implementation 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We are working with a GSI (Gender and Social Inclusion) consultant and UN Women with whom we are trying to introduce the lens of political economy and power analysis as an inroad to report on gender. Potentially our work here could benefit all working on political economy.
