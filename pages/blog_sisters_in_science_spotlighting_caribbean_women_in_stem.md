Paula Williams, 3D Printing InstructorFACILITATING CAPACITY-BUILDING IN 3D PRINTING Emerging technology could transform Eastern Caribbean SIDS by making them more competitive and sustainable. More specifically, emerging technologies such as 3D printing can enable the region to experiment and create prototypes quickly and at a lower cost. Against this backdrop, the UNDP Accelerator Lab launched a 3D printing design project with Paula Williams, a 3D Printing Instructor at the Samuel Jackman Prescod Institute of Technology(link is external) in Barbados.In the 3D printing project, co-led with the Accelerator Lab(link is external), Paula worked with students to develop a suite of designs and prints which can be used in post-disaster settings. She also focused her work on refining open-source tools to increase accessibility of this technology. Additionally, Paula created 3D educational manipulatives, which could have significant impacts within the SIDS early childhood sector and minimize existing barriers such as restricted access to goods and high importation costs. For Paula, it’s an honor to be part of this movement.

What does it mean to you to be a Caribbean woman in science?
"Being a Caribbean woman in science means merging tradition with innovation to drive conservation and sustainability. It represents resilience and adaptability; navigating a field where women, particularly from Small Island Developing States, are still forging their paths in science." - Meike Joseph

These intelligent, innovative and imaginative women from the Caribbean are forging and deepening entry points into the STEM field for females in SIDS, providing guidance and a source of mentorship for those looking to enter the many careers STEM offers. Globally, this is significant, as women still make up only one-third of the world’s scientific community (UNESCO, 2025(link is external)). In some countries, less than 10% of researchers are women, and in G20 countries, women hold only 22% of STEM jobs (Ibid). The implications of these statistics are noteworthy, with gender disparities in STEM resulting in missed opportunities, biases and solutions that underrepresent women. Given these realities, it is incredibly important to tell the stories of women like Ambria Holligan, Paula Williams, Althia Bonit and Meike Joseph as they are actively changing the equation by championing STEM for women. Together, these innovators exemplify the power of "Her Voice in Science," driving progress and inspiring future generations of women in STEM across the Caribbean.
