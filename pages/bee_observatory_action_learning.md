Walkers Reserve in Barbados opened in 2024 a Bee Observatory, providing a "Bajan Bee Experience" for visitors which offers a fascinating look into the essential role bees play in our ecosystem, allowing participants to safely observe these remarkable creatures up close in the Bee Observatory.  This immersive experience combines education, regeneration and innovation, offering insights that emphasize Walkers Reserve's commitment to environmental stewardship.

The Bee Observatory is managed by local beekeepers who impart knowledge of Caribbean bees and biodiversity to guests. Through the Bajan Bee Experience, visitors get to view up close how hives function and the general lives of bees.
