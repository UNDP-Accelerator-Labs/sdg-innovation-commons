## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Our objective was to test how non-literate people can use the digital tool in their daily activities by building he design and the digital sens on  images. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If less literate women can use social networks by basing their digital sense on the meaning of images, then they have the capacity to understand a digital application built on images,  If they can understand the meaning of images, then it is possible to reduce inequality in digital services accessibility  for the less literate by building the digital sense through images

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Don't know

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The action we took to test our hypothesis has two elements: First, we sought to understand how low-literate women entrepreneurs interact with digital media. Second, we developed a 75% image interpretation based application and submitted it to a sample of 150 women for use

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

We use the number of interactions on the App as data source to curry on the performance analysis of the experimentation 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Our data collection methodology has two sides. One one hand (before implementing) we use survey forms to get inside from the concerned groups. One the other hand (by the time of implementation) we use data generated by the backup administration of the App to appreciate trends

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

We have conducted this experimentation for 3 months time, a learning cycle time. 

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

30% of the time and support from the public sector. 
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Yes

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Nothing

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

3 months 

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

About 22500 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We had the ambition to take the results to the next level by expanding the area of the experimentation. But we didn't have the opportunity to move further due to lack of resources

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

It's meant to be scaled by one of our cluster in the CO. We are still waiting. In the meantime our national partners has been

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

The main learning during the experiment is that there is a lot of space for digital to expand even in a difficult context such as rural area and with people with low literacy. The other main learning is that there should be another way to design digital content especially for context like Africa and for low literate people. We called it Imagetronism

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Mobilizing the ecosystem towards the challenge

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

UNDP can use the results to design news projects and programs, innovative and with large impact. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The Ministry of Economy, and The Ministry of Women Empowerment may have a data source with this experiment. The banking sector as well.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Not at all.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

The main advice would be to patient and very focused on the target. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, this can be replicated in Education for example, to expand learning and make it more accessible

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The sense and explore phases help a lot to consider the challenge as a whole, not only as a problem but as an ecosystem

> What surprised you?

The ability for people with very low literacy rate to understand the logic behind a sign by refering to their own culture
