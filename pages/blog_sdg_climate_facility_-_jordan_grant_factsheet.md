Scaling up water innovation for climate security
in northern jordan

key challenges:
Jordan’s ambitions towards sustainable development are
challenged by multiple biophysical and socio-economic
barriers including:

Water
scarcity

Rapid
population
growth

High
unemployment
rates

Land
degradation

Forced
displacement
and migration

Limited
economic
resources

Low levels of
technology
adoption

These challenges have left individuals, households and
communities vulnerable to extensive asset and livelihood
losses that are expected to worsen with climate change.

the Issue:
The above listed pressures are currently exacerbated by the
observed and projected adverse impacts of climate change.

Based on dynamic downscaling and future projections until
2100, Jordan is likely subjected to:

ing all sectors especially water and agriculture in achieving
water and food security.

proposed solution:
1. The project will launch a call for action targeting entrepre-
neurs through an inclusive community outreach approach to
identify eligible male and
female entrepreneurs and
start-ups with water innovation models to apply.

2. The project will provide one-to-one mentorship and
customized business support to the selected water and
agriculture innovation startups who arise as winners from
the Business Call for Action, and support them in refining
their business models to adapt their technologies to local
market needs.

3. The project will provide water innovation start-ups with
extensive training on advanced entrepreneurship skills devel-
opment to improve their business and revenue models while
focusing on leadership and management, innovation, target-
ed segments, market identification, business and financial
models.

Project objectives:
The project aims to identify and nurture innovative water-se-
curity entrepreneurs and SMEs in Northern Jordan. This pilot
project seeks to contribute to multiple dimensions of sustain-
able development, including by aiming to create additional
job opportunities for Syrian refugees and Jordanian host
communities in Mafraq and Jerash.

Targeted Sdgs:

our work:
1. At least 10 local start-ups will receive business support
training to develop and refine market-ready business models
or technologies in the water sector.

2. At least 10 community-managed pilot projects for water
efficiency, on-site water reuse and reclaimed waste-water
systems, soil water conservation and innovative water securi-
ty technologies implemented at each target governorate.

3. Fifty water users at each target governorate trained in
Jordanian water
standards, and
techniques.
