GOAT REARING ON IMPROVED RAISED GOAT HOUSES

> Brief description of the innovation

In Zambia, Goats have proved to adapt very well to climate change (they are resilient). However, raising them on poor structures with poor ventilation and letting them sleep on the wet ground leads to outbreak of diseases and low production/productivity. 
The improved raised Goat houses are made using hard wood timber and poles in such a way where the platform on which goats sleep is raised (1 meter high) and has small gaps that allow dropping and urine to fall to the ground. Sweeping and cleaning of the house is also easy. Ventilation is enhanced by leaving gaps on the side walls and this helps keep the goats healthy. Iron sheets are used for roofing as shown in the pictures above.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Goats are prolific, very profitable and have high demand within and outside the country, yet production is still very low because a number of farmers lack capital and knowledge/skills to successfully venture into this enterprise. Income generation will be achieved through job creation, Goat breeding, direct sales of live goats, meat sales, meat processing (sausage making, mincemeat, smoking etc.), selling of by-products such as hides, manure and bone meal. 
The target market includes individuals, super markets, restaurants, bars, meat sellers, and meat export etc. 
The Challenge prize will help build the improved goat houses, purchase improved male goat breeds for breeding with the local females, purchase of fencing material, construction of essential structures and processing equipment. 
The value addition of the innovation on the environment include the promotion of organic crop production using goat manure, soil fertility through decomposition of dropping, growing of fodder to feed the goats will help in soil cover and reduce soil erosion.

> Technical Feasibility

The project will be carried out on a 50 hectares farm land in Kasama District of Northern Province of Zambia. The land in question is already available with a perennial stream as a water source. 
A 14m x 6m Improved Goat house will be constructed. Construction materials, labour and female breeding stock will be sourced locally. The project will start with 20 female Goats. Two (2) Healthy/Improved male breeding goats will be purchased locally or outside the District. Material for Construction of improved raised goat house will be purchased locally and these are: Iron sheets, Roofing nails, Wire nails, Concrete nails, Treated poles, Crushed stones, Sand, Blocks, Cement, tying wire, Inches, Planks (timber), Fencing wire and poles for paddocking.
For a start, two people will be employed to help with labour.
Record keeping will be a priority at every stage.
Commencement of the project and the end dates will be determined by the time finding will be received.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The anticipated social impact include job creation, income generation, poverty reduction, availability of healthy meat and meat products, improved nutrition and knowledge/skill transfer. Goats also clear land by clearing all types of unwanted plants such as weeds, ivy, overgrown shrubs, and blackberry branches. Having Goats to remove all those pesky, unwanted weeds eliminates the need to use harmful herbicides and reduces the risk of forest fires.
