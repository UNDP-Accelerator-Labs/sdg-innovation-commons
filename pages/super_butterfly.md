OUR SOLUTION
Without disturbing water production and water demand, our Super Butterfly technology can take advantage of this wasted or untapped excess pressure and convert it into clean energy.
BENEFITS FROM OUR SOLUTION
We complement water operators’ energy cost with revenue from selling energy by utilizing their untapped excess pressure (using our Super Butterfly). We promote the full utilization of water infrastructures where expensive pipelines can be used not only to transfer water but generate clean energy concurrently. This initiative also will lead to the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emission.
There are currently three (3) products: P20, P40, and P50. The product range refers to the excess pressure the product can tap in a pipe line, with P20 tapping at 20%, P40 at 40% and P50 at 50% of full water pressure capacities, respectively. 
The solution has won multiple awards, including Climate Launchpad (CLP) Malaysia National Final 2020 (2nd Place winner), and Malaysian Technology Expo 2021 (Gold Award winner).
