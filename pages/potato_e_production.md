> Brief description of the innovation

Potatoe production involves growing or cultivation of commercial potatoes, the very high quality requirements at every stage of marketing require the highest care from seed preparation to plant protection.
- Nutrients and water supply.
- potatoe production has key factor in consideration, climate ( weather) which is ideal for potatoes production and steps involved in growing potatoes organically reveals equipment needs with access to the proper tools for mechanized weed management hilling, growth habit potatoes can be relatively easy to grow.
The following are the steps involved in potatoe production practices.
- soil type and ph, potatoes best grow in loose, well drained non crustering sandy loam soils.
- site selection, isolate successive potatoe plantings and plant as far as possible from other suceptive, crops such as tomatoes to minimize the risk of impact and late bright.
- fertility requirements, soil temperature.
- bed spacing within row planting size and depth, crop rotation and seed variety.
- Timming of planting, preparing seed potatoes for planting bed spacing, planting technics.
- production schedule, phase 1 vegetative establishment 0 to 30 days, phase 2 soften and turber iniciation 30 to 60 days. Phase 3 turber enlargement 60 to 90 days phase 4 enlargement, skin set curing 90 to 120days.
- Harvest and harvesting equipment, post harvest handling.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Potatoe production falls under agriculture and food security therefore potatoe is one of the major crop besides wheat rice and maize (in cropping pattern of the majority of the house holds). In our district and country at large, therefore it has a good market reputation and source of income. An assessment of few demos proves high profitability and production of potatoe in this area. The necessary results was obtained by analyzing social economic and demographic characteristics benefits cost ratio and production function. The demand of potatoes in the form of chips, fries and mashed potatoes etc as widened scope which helps to uplift the economic conditions. the community been our target market potatoe Is one of the impact and cash crops to address food insecurity and reduce poverty levels in the community. It is also a good option to improve health and nutrition factor of rural population because It has economic productive value than other cereals a wide adaptability high yield potential and high demand. 
The price will help grow the business by addressing the high cost of cultivation and mechanisation.

> Technical Feasibility

Potatoes production involves good agricultural practices, hence the posses a big influence on the place of origin potatoes are grown from a special potatoes called seed potatoes" which are cut into pieces sometimes Left whole and planted in the ground and pieces of potatoes grow stems and roots from the eyes because they are able to feed off the energy in the seed potatoe plants grow very fast right from the start. They are planted just below 1 to 4 inches deep. exposed potatoes push up through the soil when this happens, about 2 to 3 inches of additional soil are added to the top row to prevent sunburned tubers.( hilling) 10 to 14 days sprouts will emerge the euro plant ( donata and jelly ) been our proto type, a scaling strategy to involve institutions partnerships and expects as been implemented to address critical aspects of potatoe production. Coming from a back ground of experience in terms of technical and managerial skills on potatoe provisions of technical knowledges from a teading potatoe production makes us stand better in implementation.

> Anticipated Social Impact

With many varieties and high consumer consumption, potatoes fit well with many small growers and can be marketed through various out lets. Seasonal and year to year price movements can affect individual small growers who lack the financial resources and resilience of larger producers apart from its contribution to food security, it is a source of income ( economic earnings) potatoe production results in the creation of jobs. Creation of jobs indirectly such as at the transportation company that are used to transport potatoes. Potatoes are a good enterprise option for many. The is a substantial whole sale market based around the increasing demand for locally produced speciality type of potatoes. Due to the wide diversity in types and high consumer consumption whole sale markets will want to explore local and regional produce auctions, grocer local buyer programs and direct to restaurant sales.
The relevance is also basing on marketing alternatives available and new ideas in productivity and quality. To build a strong market linkages and knowledge of time industry wide trends in the function of the potatoe market.
