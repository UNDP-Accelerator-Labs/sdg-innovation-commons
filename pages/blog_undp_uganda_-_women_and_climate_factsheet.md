Advancing gender equality in
the context of the climate crisis
remains one of the greatest
global challenges of the 21st
century. Women across the globe
are increasingly more vulnerable
to climate change impacts
than men. This is in part due to
women’s greater involvement
in ensuring food security for
the family and community, in
providing water for domestic
use, and women’s dependence
on natural resources for various
reasons including energy
production and other domestic
needs.

Climate change will continue to
exacerbate gender inequalities
following the differentiated roles
of men and women structured
by cultural and social norms,
unless there are deliberate
efforts to reform these norms.
This is further aggravated

by unequal access to land,
knowledge, financial resources,
food insecurity, and other factors
that expose women and girls to
gender-based violence, leading
to health, psychosocial and
economic challenges.

According to the United Nations
Framework Convention on
Climate Change (UNFCC),
women represent 80% of people
displaced by climate change. The
UN Environment Programme’s
Global Environment Outlook
(GEO-6) also highlights that
despite progress made in access
to basic drinking water, women
still spend 16 million hours
per day collecting water in 25
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa,
compared to 6 million hours
by men and 4 million hours by
children. This alone underscores
why social equity and gender
equity remain key attributes

for the realization of the
Sustainable Development Goals,
specifically on SDG5: Gender
Equality, SDG6: Clean Water and
Sanitation, SDG7: Affordable and
Clean Energy, SDG10: Reduced
Inequalities, and SDG13: Climate
Action.

Women hold a pivotal role in
responding to climate change
and possess important local
knowledge and leadership skills
in natural resource management.
This capacity must be harnessed
through empowering women
and girls and fostering inclusive
participation in climate change
decision making. There is an
urgent need for women and men
to have equal opportunities for
realizing their full potential,
while contributing to and
benefiting from social, cultural
and economic development.

UNDP INTERVENTIONS
UNDP INTERVENTIONS

The United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) and partners prioritize inclusive nature-
based solutions in the achievement of Uganda’s
Vision 2040, the 2030 Agenda and its 17
Sustainable Development Goals. In recognition
of the need for greater women’s inclusion and
leadership in Uganda’s sustainable development,
UNDP has partnered with the Government of
Uganda and multi-sector partners to support in
various ways.

• Gender mainstreaming into Uganda’s

Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to
the Paris Agreement, through identifying gaps
and opportunities in priority sectors including
energy, agriculture, and waste management.

• Provision of Climate Action Challenge Grants
to engage women and youth led organizations
and local communities for climate change
mitigation and adaptation technologies such as
biogas, energy efficient cooking stoves, solar,
forestry, drip irrigation and waste management,
contributing to the implementation of Uganda’s
NDC.

• Solarization of 24 Health Centers in rural

areas of the country to ensure uninterrupted
and quality healthcare services, increased

capacity to respond to emergencies, and
reduced maternal and child mortalities in health
facilities.

• Support to over 300 women artisanal miners
in Tororo, Kasese and Karamoja to implement
sustainable mining operations with emphasis
on environmental protection, adoption of
appropriate technologies, avoidance of
wasteful mining, and health and safety
protocols.

• Development of the Uganda Natural Resource
Information System (NARIS), an open-source
data visualization platform that monitors
and mediates deforestation and encourages
transparency in natural resource governance.

•

Implementation of the Biomass to Electricity
Project, being piloted at Mulago Hospital to
encourage Uganda’s large institutions such as
hospitals and schools to shift from the use of
biomass to electricity for cooking.

• Training and capacity building of women
in various areas including climate smart
agriculture, alternative livelihoods,
entrepreneurship, business management,
financial literacy, and technical skills
development.
