UNDP
ACCELERATOR
LABS

A NEW BREED
OF CHALLENGES

Migration, water scarcity, violent extremism, economic
dislocations due to automation, diseases that spread
more quickly due to increasing draughts. These are
the types of real-world problems that undermine
global development. They are problems that aren’t
simple to solve. They are compounded by billions of
actions and interactions. They change by the minute.
They are complex. They are interconnected.

These problems don’t respond to well-laid economic
growth and development plans. They don’t respond to
social mobilization alone. They can’t be analysed with
five -year-old datasets. And they won’t be solved by a
singular technological breakthrough.

The speed, dynamics, and complexity of today’s
challenges are fundamentally different from previous
eras in history. A new breed of development
challenges is emerging and, to date, the development
system has not been able to address them effectively.

ACCELERATOR LABS:
AN EXPERIMENT AT SCALE

The UNDP Accelerator Labs are a new service offering
that works with people, governments, and the private
sector to reimagine development for the 21st century.

Through long-standing partnerships with national
governments, we are creating a new capability for
decision-makers to explore, experiment, and grow
portfolios of mutually-reinforcing solutions to tackle
complex challenges from multiple angles.

THE WORLD’S FASTEST LEARNING
NETWORK ON DEVELOPMENT
CHALLENGES

The Accelerator Lab Network is made up of 60 teams
in Africa, Eastern Europe, Asia and the Pacific, and
Latin America and the Caribbean. The Labs will work
on development challenges in parallel.

Together we will accelerate the speed at which we learn
about what works and how to land solutions in local
contexts. While traditional monitoring and evaluation
methods might take two years or more to understand
whether a solution is working, the Accelerator Labs can
bring this time down to months or weeks.

A GREATER BREADTH OF SOLUTIONS FOR
DEVELOPMENT CHALLENGES

The Labs combine deep local networks that allow our
partners to elevate grassroots solutions as well as to
source solutions globally from across the Lab network,
our network partners, and UNDP.

PORTFOLIOS FOR SYSTEMS IMPACT

We are designing portfolios with a full spectrum
of regulatory, technological, behavioural, and
participatory experiments to learn what combinations
provide the right mix of solutions to systemic issues in
development.

CLOSER TO REAL-TIME DATA

New sources of data, such as high-precision maps
based on satellite data together with ethnographic
understanding will help inform the development of
highly targeted initiatives.

But data are just the beginning. Decision making and
collaboration are the end game. The Accelerator Labs
will explore ways to incentivize high level decision-
making based on these new sources of data. We
will also test methods to channel people’s insights,
views and actions towards intractable development
problems.

HOW IT WORKS

SENSE-MAKING:

Sense-making helps partners understand whether
there is a fit between current investments and the
changing environment. This is where learning effects
can be accelerated: a move away from pilots towards
genuine experiments in a portfolio logic.

COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE:

The Labs will use the power of various sources of
intelligence including the crowd, machine learning
and distributed decision making to support partners to
understand problems, develop new solutions, promote
more inclusive decision making, and provide better
oversight of what is done.

SOLUTIONS MAPPING:

The Labs will identify local solutions that have the
potential to accelerate development. Mapping
grassroots innovation in 78 countries will provide
an opportunity to test our hypotheses that when a
problem is mutating rapidly, bottom up innovation is
more relevant than innovation driven by a single start-
up or central authority.

5

PORTFOLIOS OF EXPERIMENTS:

The Labs will both deepen and widen the use of
experimentation in the development sector.

Experimentation will help the network learn whether
particular assumptions are accurate before deploying
solutions at scale, especially in uncertain or volatile
conditions that often dominate development progress.

A portfolio approach will focus on diversifying
the learning generated from a range of types of
experiments.

MARRYING SOCIAL
INNOVATION TALENT WITH
DEVELOPMENT EXPERTISE

To deliver on this offering, we’re onboarding Accelerator
Lab explorers, mappers and experimenters. They will
marry UNDP’s expertise in climate change, governance
and poverty reduction with a new set of capabilities to
tackle 21st century development challenges.

The network that we’re building will have 180 engineers,
designers, data scientists and ethnographers from
over 60 countries. The Accelerator Lab network is
onboarding:

• 60 Heads of Exploration to continuously search for
emerging, under-the-radar, and unintuitive solutions
and mine new sources of data on development issues.

• 60 Heads of Solutions Mapping to find local solutions
that have emerged not just from hackathons in the
capital, but also from people’s ingenuity in remote
regions of the country.

• 60 Heads of Experimentation to develop and mature
portfolios of tests to rapidly learn about what works,
and what doesn’t in addressing complex, fast-moving
social and environmental issues.

KNOWLEDGE PARTNERS

A goal this ambitious needs broad expertise for pooled
capability. So far, the Accelerator Lab network is
working with Nesta, MIT, the Honeybee Network, Lego’s
Lead User Lab and Axilo.

EARLY TRACTION

We’re already seeing partners demand a new kind of
capability. Some examples:

THE PHILIPPINES

Within a vibrant innovation ecosystem in the
Philippines, more than 30 NGOs and labs are looking
to the UNDP Accelerator Lab as a potential curator of
knowledge and a convenor to bring people together
to observe and learn from each other. The focus of
this coalition will be to help 1 million families out of
poverty.

SERBIA

Serbia is among the world’s ten fastest shrinking
populations due to its low birth rates, high out-
migration and low immigration. The President’s Office
has asked the Accelerator Lab to create actionable
intelligence on this trend. The lab in Serbia will design
and test a portfolio of experiments, focusing on
circular migration and measures for retaining skilled
and unskilled workers.

ZIMBABWE

Amidst the post-Mugabe transition, the Zimbabwe
Accelerator Lab will help create space to support
sustained dialogue and constructive engagement
between citizens and the government on key social,
economic and governance reforms. At the request
of the Office of the President’s Cabinet and 22
ministries, the lab has already begun to use sense-
making as a method to shift from expert-driven
advice to experience-driven policies and to create
a socialized understanding of the gap between the
intent of reforms, their delivery, and a constantly
changing environment.

INNOVATION BACKED BY
THE RELATIONSHIPS AND
EXPERTISE OF UNDP

We’re combining UNDP’s development expertise with
social innovation expertise.

UNDP has forged action-oriented partnerships
with national governments, social development
organizations and the private sector in 170 countries
for more than fifty years.

In 2019 alone, UNDP:

• Supported 15 countries to develop or implement

strategies to prevent violent extremism.

• Was the primary actor on climate change in the
United Nations and during the last year we have
helped 140 countries move closer to meeting their
Paris Agreement pledges.

• Helped cut 256 million tons of carbon emissions-

which is equivalent to the footprint of 50 million cars
in one year.

This is not the first introduction of innovation into
UNDP. Since 2014, with the support of Denmark and
others, UNDP has invested in over 140 experiments
across programme countries to create prototypes
and land new ways of working in programme design.
The return on investment for seed funds in innovation
in UNDP has been significant: every 1$ invested in
innovation prototypes has generated 2$ in return.

Founding investors will co-build the Accelerator Lab
Network as a joint venture. Our founding investors are
part of our Strategic Advisory Group together with high
impact members with in-depth experience in social
innovation. The group will help shape the direction of
the Lab Network. They will benefit from the learning
opportunities of the Labs, have real-time access to data,
solutions and learning from the 60 Labs, and be an
integral part of our identity.

Partners will include the Governments of the 78 countries
the Network serves, as well as other investors. They
will benefit from the emerging lessons of the Network
and co-define the problems the labs address through
experimentation.

Knowledge partners are institutions with niche expertise
and data relevant to the Accelerator Labs who will benefit
from insight into emergent demand in this area.
