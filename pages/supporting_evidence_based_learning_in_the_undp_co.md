## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Supporting Evidence Based Learning in the UNDP CO 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that CO programing tends to lack data and evidence to support the magnitude of the challenges being addressed and the solutions being developed and implemented.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

This challenge is caused by a number of factors, mainly the non-existance of a coordinated system to manage and share data within the development space. For instance, a number of UN Agencies and local partners undertake different studies on a continuing basis that are geared towards the SDGs. However, there is no method of harnessing all of this data and information into a single accessible platform where it can easily be shared and accessed by partners for planning and programming purposes. The result is that duplications occur, where agencies end up doing similar assignments in silos instead of coordinating resources to achieve a larger goal.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

The non existence of a coordinated data sharing mechanism is proof of this challenge. Additionally, the number of similar programs being undertaken by different agencies that are currently concurrently running.


</div>


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

This issue touches upon many agencies and development partners and needs a solution that can be tested first to provide proof of concept before it can be presented to external stakeholders for buy-in. The UNDP AccLab has the competitive advantage and experience of being able to test new ideas with limited fear for failure

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Exploring solutions for a coordinated data sharing mechanism
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.


<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

The United Nations Resident Coordinator's Office


</div>



<div class="group">


> What sector does our partner belong to?


</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

We plan to work with the Resident Coordinator's Office to explore solutions for a coordinated data sharing mechanism. s the UN's coordinating body, the RCO is in a strategic position to lead, adopt and scale up this experiment if it proves successful. They are also strategically placed to galvanize the buy-in of other agencies and development partners into participation in the experiment

<div class="group">


> Please state the name of the Parter:

The Coordinating Assembly of Non-Governmental Organisations (CANGO)

<div class="group">


> What sector does our partner belong to?


</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

A number of NGOs in the country undertake a lot of research studies and assessments that contribute towards the achievement of SDGs. These studies and also not available in a coordinated manner, hence CANGO, being the coordinating body for civil society organisations is strategically placed to assist us get the buy-in of these partners into the experiment

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

ESERPAC is a semi-autonomous entity that aims to build sustainable national capacity through public policy research to provide evidence based policy formulation. We plan to work with this entity to further support evidence based learning and programming for UNDP through tapping into their research capacities.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

we want to learn how feasible it is to have a coordinated system or a data repository for the SDGs where all development partners and civil society organisations can convene information in an open source format

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will use solutions mapping and sensemaking to explore available solutions a scan the horizon for incoming solutions that can be used to solve this challenge. prototyping will be used to develop a model of and SDG data platform that can be tested for data coordination.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

These data sources will provide us with the information we need to feed into the envisaged coordinating platform. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The RCO's Office, CANGO and other development partners are envisaged as the parties that may sustain this initiative and facilitate its upscaling. These partners will be engaged early on in the assignment
