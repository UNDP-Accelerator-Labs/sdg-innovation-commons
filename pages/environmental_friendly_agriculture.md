> Title of the innovation

Environmental friendly agriculture

> Brief description of the innovation

The inovation as according to the title is all about environmental friendly agriculture, in that the plan is to find land big enough to make an avocado plantation. The average time taken for an ordinary avocado to start fruiting is is than 10 years, but the plan is to source funds and buy dwarf avocado seedlings from Zambia agriculture research institute which starts fruiting at an early stage. while waiting for these to mature am Planning to plant castor beans on 2 or 3 hacters of land on contract with lifebrand in order to ensure the sustainability of the plantation.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The inovation will generate income for me and those that will be helping me taking care of the plantation in that..after sales at low price, than the usual I noticed on the market, while making profits because production doesn't consume much income but the product is expensive on the market because there are few farmers who are willing to farm avocado on a large scale if any, the business will provide enough profits for the farm it's self to improve, for me, for the workers and the marketeers in that the dwarf variety can be planted in calibration of 550/ha producing 7 to 20 tones of avocado. Marketeers will order it at a lower price therefore can be able to get profits even after sales at low prices there by providing for them and the consumer both affordability and the nutritional value.The targeted market is the copper belt where I reside and apart from the nutritional value and financial gain to the business chain the trees will add value to the ecological system there by reducing climate change and also no chemicals will be used only organic inputs hence improving the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

Am planning to plant according to resources available especially starting with a 1 hacter of land, planting 500 dwarf avocado seedlings with the spacing of 4 to 6m per station and 15 to 16 rows, starting with one helper then later increase the hectarage and size of helpers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The anticipated social impact is in the profits of the business chain starting from the workers on the farm and the marketeers ordering the fruits, in that farm workers will get there pay and food, marketeers will order at a low price making it affordable for consumers and satisfying their nutritional needs.
