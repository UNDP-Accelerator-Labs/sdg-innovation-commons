- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

- Interviews to understand how persons with visual impairment are trying to address mobility issue - Design-thinking workshops with Rwanda Union of the Blind and Beno Holdings to collect insights from beneficiaries regarding user requirements and feedback on the first prototype. - Experimentation workshops to train persons with visual impairment how to use the smart white cane and detailed information on various features and their functionalities.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

40 persons with visual impairment.   

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

- We will collect user feedback from oral interviews - We will use design-thinking workshops to capture users insights  - Testing the white cane functionality with actual users to get feedback for better improvement. 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

- 8 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time allocation from team: 960 hours
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The original hypothesis was proven. 

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

We used co-creation and it has worked well so far. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

4 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

10,458 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, the first iteration was to design a white cane with basic features including obstacle detection, identify locations, night or day notification, alerting other road users that the user of the white cane needs special assistance. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, based on the feedback we got from the users, we are planning to develop a second version of the white cane with more features including battery notification, using elastic wires for flexible folding and enabling the tracking of the white cane in case it is stolen.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 



> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

- Co-creating with people closest to the problem helped to design suitable features that can respond to their needs. - Grassroots innovation can have great impact in solving problems faced by our communities.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Getting electronic materials including the sensors to make the smart white cane took longer than we anticipated. We still lack machines to design board cards. Every circuit was designed manually which increased the production time. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Program managers working on the disability platform project. This experimentation helped to test the model and proved that the smart white cane can work. It has been adopted in UNDP Programme Design related to supporting innovations for disability inclusion. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

This experiment has influenced policy design. It has enabled CSOs like National Council of Persons with Disabilities to recognize the smart white cane and it has been incorporated in their action plan. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes, so far we have done two iterations. In the first iteration, we worked on basic features including programming the sensor camera that help to detect obstacles and use sound to alert the user about the danger. It also had charging capabilities and it could notify the user if it is day or night so that they can avoid moving when it is dark. After the first iteration we tested with a group of 40 persons with visual disability and their feedback helped to design the second iteration which included vibration capabilities because we realized that they are people with combined disabilities who cannot hear nor see. Therefore, when an obstacle is detected the sound alert would not work for them, they also needed a vibration alert. They also requested that most of the time they get lost, so it would be better if they can be able to identify locations or use the white cane to track their whereabout.  

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Co-creating with the users is very critical. Their insights and feedback will help to design relevant features which respond to their needs. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

  Yes, it can be replicated in SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth) to enable an inclusive economic growth where persons with visual disability have assistive tools that allow them to work, study and access other opportunities to improve their lives.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Initially, we did a virtual solution mapping exercise with various stakeholders to identify local solutions that address complex development challenges and realized that innovation for disability inclusion was an area that needed support . We found a local solution at very early stage of development (prototype) to help persons with visual impairment.    We organized design thinking sessions with members of Rwanda Union of the Blind (An association of persons with visual impairment) and the solution provider (Innovator) to deeply understand the challenges and learn how visually impaired persons are trying to address the mobility issue.

> What surprised you?

Experimentation requires dedication and patience. You will not immediately see results. You have to be open to try new ideas. With continuous improvement, the results will be achieved.
