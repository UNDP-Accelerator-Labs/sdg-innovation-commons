Service Design for Social Support Centers in Earthquake Region
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



women’s and children’s safe space (WCSS) designed for earthquake affected regions to respond to women’s needs of safety, information, referral and in-place support. The campuses are not solely designed with participatory and service design approach.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



UNDP has a pilot project that aims to quickly respond to women’s needs of safety, information, referral and in-place support in a pilot location through establishing women’s and children’s safe spaces in Hatay, one of the most affected provinces by the earthquake. With Impact Hub Ankara, AccLab will make a service design for these centers to better answer to beneficiary needs. The study will find out the most relevant services to be provided and will contribute to the design of the tools to provide selected services.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

According to the statements of the social worker, a total of 570 people, 197 of whom are women, live in Çadırkent. The one-person psychosocial support staff at the Purple Campus can receive an average of five women a day at capacity. group activities. On the other hand, it was observed that about 20 children participated in group activities in 2 sessions a day. It has been observed that children from rural areas also participate in children's activities, but there is no concrete number available as no registration is made. It was observed that there was no participation in the visits made on three separate days during the women's group activities. This may be because activity hours conflict with the distribution of aid or a health professional checkup. On the other hand, it was observed that the social worker answered the questions of 50 people on average (usually about basic needs such as distributed aid and shelter). After the devastating earthquake the container cities have been established in Hatay region. UNDP is supporting social support centers either managed by NGOs or establishing other social support centers.  Since the needs assessment shows there is an urgent need for services to be better designed for the beneficiaries a service design approach is needed.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Service design is new to UNDP and also the innovation actor Impact Hub Ankara is new to UNDP Turkiye. The resources of the project has been used and not AccLab resources for this experiment. Country office is mainly working for earthquake recover and this experiment will serve to all earthquake recovery projects of the country office. Within this experiment an ecosystem map is prepared that will also serve to all the stakeholders working in this area. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



AccLab Turkiye is focusing on earthquake recovery actions with introducing service design approach to social support centers in container cities.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



What are the needs of the potential beneficiaries?

With what kind of design and service they will feel safe?

What other centers are providing?

What are the obstacles of being accessible for these centers?

 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



service design approach will be used. meeting with potential beneficiaries, observation of the current system, finding out the gaps in the system will be found out.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



the data of the potential beneficiaries of the centers are lacking. to better serve to beneficiaries, their ethnographic data is important.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



this study wil feed all the earthquake recovery projects of the country office. the ecosystem map will be used by all stakeholders in the ecosystem trying to contribute to earthquake recovery efforts.
