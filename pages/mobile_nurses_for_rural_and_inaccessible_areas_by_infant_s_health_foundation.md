Increasing access to maternal health through mobile nurses
The Infants Health Foundation reduces mother morbidity, infant mortality and birth defects in Uganda with an innovative approach to reach rural and inaccessible areas through mobile home-based maternal child healthcare services. Nurses are transported on motorcycles on regular intervals for home visits. The enterprise is fighting for healthy pregnancies to avoid extensive unnecessary death and lifelong, devastating disability/ birth defects of children and women.
