It's an application that will bridge the gap between tenants and property owners

> Brief description of the innovation

It allows customers who are tenants  and those looking to buy properties  to have access to the posted and listed properties, and allows property owners to post their properties

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

* Market size up-to 2 million of the 3.5+ million people with smart phones and we only want a 1 million of it which is roughly 25% of the market share. By this we mean people who are connected to the internet 
We have two ways we will raise revenue 
1. Subscription for technical support (IT) 
2. Commisons which will range from 3 to 8% of the sales we will be making OK behalf of our customers which is likely to be the most effective and efficient ways to make money for both parties 
* We are solving a problem of finding quality property within our citizens from different walks of life by using your smart phone or computer with internet connection. 
* The challenge prize will see us investing mainly in servers, marketing and Channel and distribution which will be key in our customer acquisition for quality gross addition to our revenue and the interested parties. Like the tenants property owners and the government who will benefit taxes because all our transaction will be system generated hence increased legal taxes. 
* it's encouraging people to own their own properties by making their search so simple and more comfortable regardless of their geographical location. 
*it will bring about job creation for our graduates and non graduates 
* financial inclusion, in the sense that all payments to be encouraged through Mobile Money  and banks because of the system we are putting in place. 
* Encourages young  people to be self sustaining like myself (Chief executive officer)  I'm young it will be good to motivate fellow young ones to work hard and be innovate and we better the lives of many in problem identifying then solution provision. 
* Green way of doing things meaning it will have less harm on the environment negative effects

> Technical Feasibility

Our design or customer journey is simple as follows 
1. Customer with internet connection goes on Google play store or app store 
2. Will search for TINKALE 
3. click on download and install 
4. Click on sign up with phone number or email 
5. Finish signing up and confirm with the code to be shared via email or number 
6. Customer has access to the App (tenant/buyer) will be able to view and like then connect if interested (property owner) will be able to post and see how many reviews thier property has. 
7. All sales to be done through the app to ensure order is maintained for future references and easy reconciliation

> Anticipated Social Impact

According to the study I have taken 5 provinces, some people don't invest or don't want to expose themselves to real estate because of how untruthful some agents are. 
 
The world is challenge people don't want to spend time looking for something that can actually pop on their phone once it's available so it will help save time and money for the parties involved and bring sanity in the way businesses are involved which will later attract foreign investment.  Zambia is a developing nation we have a lot in the infrastructure we need to do hence the need to support the TINKALE MOBILE app idea.
