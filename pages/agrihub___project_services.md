> Brief description of the innovation

AGRIHUB IS BOTH AN ONLINE DIGITAL AGRI-BUSINESS SCHOOL AND AN AGRO-PROCESSING CENTRE AND INTEGRATES BOTH FORWARD AND BACKWARD ACTIVITIES OF A NEW CASTOR SEED VALUE CHAIN  OUT-GROWER ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PROGRAMME AT KANAKANTAPA AGRICULTURAL VILLAGE. IT HAS 25 HOUSEHOLDS IN THE OUTGROWER SCHEME (2020 / 2021 SEASON) AND HAS 17,000 HOUSEHOLDS FOR 2021 / 2022 FARMING SEASON. THE PROCESSING OF CASTOR SEED INTO CRUDE OIL ADDS GREATER ECONOMIC VALUE TO THESE HOUSEHOLDS AND ZAMBIA.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

THE CASTOR SEED IS A CLIMATE SMART FARMING SOLUTION. THIS POTENTIAL AGRI-BUSINESS DRAWS ITS VIABILITY FROM THE EXPORT OF CRUDE OIL. THE BUSINESS HAS FOCUS ON HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL ECONOMIES. ALREADY 25 SUCH HOUSEHOLDS PARTNERED WITH US AND FOR 2021 / 2022 FARMING SEASON, OVER 17,000 HAVE JOINED.  THIS BUSINESS MODEL IS PROJECTED TO TRANSFORM HOUSEHOLDS INTO MODEL FAMILY AGRI-BUSINESSES BY 2030 THEREBY POWERING A PLANNED 7 MILLION OUT OF EXTREME POVERTY - CHANGING FROM USD 1.90 / PERSON / DAY TO USD 4.81 / PERSON / DAY SUSTAINABLY BY 2030

> Technical Feasibility

AN INTEGRATED AGRIBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT WHERE ONLINE DIGITAL AGRIBUSINESS SCHOOL IS ALIGNED WITH AGRI-PROCESSING WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AGRO SUPPLIERS, DEMONSTRATION PLOT, LOGISTICS HUB, BACKWARD AND FORWARD INTEGRATION TO LINK SMALL SCALE PRODUCERS (SSP) TO EXPORT MARKETS; AND SSPS AND HOUSEHOLDS ARE TRANSFORMED INTO MODEL FAMILY AGRI-BUSINESSES AND SCALABLE TO ALL 10 PROVINCES IN ZAMBIA AND REACHING A TARGET OF 7 MILLION POOR HOUSEHOLDS. THE PLAN IS TO MOVE FROM THE CURRENT 25 HOUSEHOLDS TO 17,000 (2021/ 2022 SEASON) BY 2022 TO 7MILLION BY 2030. IT IS FEASIBLE (WE ARE ALREADY DOING IT), IT IS VIABLE AND SCALABLE

> Anticipated Social Impact

INTEGRATING ONLINE DIGITAL AGRIBUSINESS SCHOOL WITH AN OUT-GROWER ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT PROGRAMME WITH A FOCUS ON HOUSEHOLDS IN RURAL ECONOMIES HAS POTENCY TO LIFT A GREATER NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS OUT OF EXTREME POVERTY AND HUNGER. WE HAVE STARTED AND ARE GROWING - HELP US REACH MORE HOUSEHOLDS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
