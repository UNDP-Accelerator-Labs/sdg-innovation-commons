> Title of the innovation

Small Scale Plastic Recycling Community Level Project

> Brief description of the innovation

The small scale plastic recycling project is an innovation that aims to promote health, climate change mitigation and adaption and employment creation among other in Zambian communities, by setting of plastic recycling workshops at community level for plastic pellets production to supply to plastic product manufacturers; and production of simple plastic products and plastic timber replacements products such as table boards and wooden sofas. The innovation involves working with plastic generation hubs such as hotels, conference halls and lodges for setting up of plastic collection centers complemented by a flexible plastic waste collection system, that will involve setting up of collection centers. The innovation involves a sustainable operations system that has five main step which are Collection, Shredding, Pellet Production and Distribution, Plastic Product Production and Selling.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation will generate income from selling plastic pellets to plastic product manufacturers and simple plastic products and timber replacements products like timber boards to make household goods like tables and sofas for sale to community members as there is a huge market. The target market for the innovation comprises plastic manufacturing industries in the country and region at large, general business houses and households.

The innovation will improve the operations of the plastic manufacturing industry through increased provision of cheap raw materials (plastic pellets) and reduced costs of production. Other businesses whose operations will be improved are hotels and lodges, by reducing their cost of waste management and improving their image sustainably.
The prize will go a long in establishing the business, as it will be used to acquire simple machinery for starting recycling of plastic waste and will be useful in ensuring the business starts operating and starts to grow. sustainably. 

The innovation is a climate smart practice that will contribute to a cleaner, health local environment with pure water and air quality as well as healthy soils. Surface and groundwater contamination will reduce. The general environmental aesthetics will improve and drainages will be free of plastics.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation design involves setting up a small scale plastic recycling workshops in communities for production of pellets, simple plastic products and timber replacement at community level using simple plastic waste recycling machinery. This will be followed by setting up a well-structured plastic waste collection system from small scale and large scale commercial operations places by introducing a well-structured plastic recovery and collection systems. This will also include forming and train a network of plastic waste sorters and collectors in communities; and promotion of public participation in plastic waste sorting and collection through knowledge enhancement on plastic waste management and economic value using different media platforms. furthermore,  a  marketing and sales network for pellets and finished plastic products at national, regional and international levels will be established.  
For development and growth of the innovation their will be continuous building of a market and customer network of factories in plastic production both at local and international level. The innovation team will ensure continued exploration of various plastic application through research and development.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation can improved the lives of others through increasing income generation and employment creation in that apart from achieving a clean local environment, the project will also have a financial viability and employment creation aspect.
The innovation can help local communities and their people through creating a sustainable resilient community recycling industry to uplift social well-being and replication and adoption of similar innovations.
Another anticipated social impact is creation of a health and climate smart community. This will benefit people through improved health surroundings and providing a good climate mitigation and adaptation measure.
