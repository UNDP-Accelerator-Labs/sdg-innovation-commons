## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

We planned 3 experiments within the Digital Literacy theme: Assessment, Web accessibility for Persons with Disabilities, and Digital Literacy Curriculum. The assessment was the first experiment where we adopted the EU’s DigComp framework for digital skills assessment and experimented it in the Mongolian context. We also focused on specific vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities, elderly, low-income households, migrants and rural/remote population, who are likely to be left behind in the quest for digitalization. Out key learning from the assessment were: a.      People with disabilities and elderly have lowest digital skills and they cannot benefit from digitalization process as much as other groups do. b.      In particular, people with disabilities are also faced with significant accessibility barrier, when they attempt to use digital services, as website and applications do not take into consideration their specific needs and limitations. We decided to focus on improving the web accessibility and digital skills curriculum, out of which the curriculum experiment is still in progress. For web accessibility, we identified 7 most used websites and applications by PwD and conducted an audit of their accessibility. Based on the accessibility issues identified, we conducted a training for front-end developers on solving these issues. The key learnings from the experiment were: c.       Front-end developers cared about the appearance of the website and application and used to add some sophisticated features; however, thanks to our training, they learned about specific needs of PwD and the problems they encounter on daily basis. As one of the developers expressed: “I only cared about how my application would look and function, but now with accessibility in mind I can see that it is not as easy to use as I thought. I understood that it is better to keep some features simple and learned the accessibility techniques”. d.      Even though there are international web accessibility standards (WCAG), it is still new in Mongolia and, when we spoke about it to government, companies, and officials, they had major misconceptions about making websites and applications accessible, such as “if we add accessibility features, they will make the site/application ugly”, “adding accessibility features is too expensive”. Our training demonstrated that it is relatively easy to add accessibility features, without compromising appearance and budget. However, the difference they make in the lives of PwD is quite impressive. e.      We also involved people with disabilities in both the audit and training, so that they would provide practical insight, actual experiences to the process. This provided added value of giving the issue a face and voice, which was very persuasive in dealing with government.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

In conducting our experiment, we had a strong buy-in from the government side, as it recently adopted the WCAG and developed national web accessibility standards. However, getting the support and collaboration from private sector was quite challenging as they did not know about the accessibility, were reluctant to allocate time and funds to these. So as an initial step, we decided to go ahead with government-run websites and applications.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

There were very limited data related to Digital Literacy and we used some of these methods to generate data and insights ourselves. For instance, our assessment used survey, observation and focus group to generate conclusions about specific groups. Then we had in-depth interviews with PwD to learn about their accessibility problems and difficulties and come up with possible solutions.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We involved both the government and associations of people with disabilities in our experiment design, so that our solution closely caters to their needs and expectations. Having both on board helped each side to understand advantages and limitations, which helped us to arrive to commonly acceptable solution. 
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Mongolian National Federation of the Blind, which a local NGO catering to the needs and interests of the blind people and Mongolian Deaf Association, which unifies the people with hearing and speech loss. They did accessibility audit of the most commonly used websites and applications, as well as provided their inputs to the web accessibility training. In addition to this, they are also providing their inputs to the digital literacy curriculum. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We collaborate with Deque Software, an Indian company that specializes in accessibility training and software. Their experts and instructors helped us in organizing the training for the front-end developers.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

We collaborate with the Communication and Information Technology Ministry, a main government body in charge of digitalization and information technology development. They helped us to mobilize government agencies, which services the PwD use the most. We also collaborated with the National Agency for Development of People with Disabilities, which is the main government implementing agency to work with PwD, which helped us in organizing the training as well as liaison with Disability associations.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

All these partners are not usual partners of UNDP. Given the UNDP mandate, it works more on highest decision making levels, while these agencies are working more at grassroots levels and cater to the needs our specific group both at policy and implementation level. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

For the assessment part, we closely worked with Innovation Unit of BRH, which provided us with comments and suggestions on the methodology and report development. In addition to that, BRH provided us with budget to complete the web accessibility experiment.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enabled you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The accessibility experiment is completed very recently, and we still plan some follow-up actions on evaluating the accessibility features that are already done, as well as doing some more work on involving the private sector.
