Broadway health services or adult health month

> Brief description of the innovation

The Broadway health services or adult health month is an innovation that seeks to provide health services to all Zambians by reaching out to people living in outskirts of the country Zambia,these people have to travel miles of kilometers just to get access to health services and drugs while this innovation looks forward to deal with this issues and combat it,this innovation come to light by Hamweene Simanhwa a Zambian citizen who is a registered nurse by profession while carrying out our rural outreach in chikuni, southern province were one of my friend's lost his father in chipata while he was suffering from hypertension (commonly known as high blood pressure) it took three days for them just to get to the health post he couldn't make it because he died on way and by the time they reached the hospital he was already dead....this is still a bigger problem in most part of the country.
The other reason I came up with this innovation is to deal with the high number of health graduates  who are just seated home doing nothing at all but according to survey health workers require alot of hands on or practice for the courses....so that's were I centered my innovation on  by using the same graduates to provide health services to people living in distanced parts of the country Zambia...hence this will seek to reduce the the large burden of unemployment in the health sector and also reduce the large number of graduating health students from just sitting home doing nothing there by meeting one of the SDG of good health and well-being as a country zambia. This innovation will be carried out twice every year to combat the disease's being faced in different provinces and districts as well as dealing with the five major health problems in Zambia by bringing health services closer to the people and right at their door steps it will be more like child health but this innovation called the Broadway health services will have it's focus on adults facing many health challenges in the villages provinces and districts....it will look at early treatment and diagnosis not for getting drug provision to patient s suffering from TB ,HIV/AIDS, MALARIA and MATERNAL problems  not forgetting diarrhoeal disease's as well.
