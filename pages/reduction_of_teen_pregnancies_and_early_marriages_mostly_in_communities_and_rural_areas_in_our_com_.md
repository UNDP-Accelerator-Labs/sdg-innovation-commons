> Title of the innovation

Reduction of teen pregnancies and early marriages mostly in communities and rural areas in our communities and rural areas it has become common that even girls as young as 12 of age are becoming mother most of our young women have adopted the idea that if they fail there examination in grade 7,9,12 thats the end of time they venture into marriage or drop out of school while these more to just failling  in villages remote areas our young women are married off but if they can have an opportunity to learn skills that will sustain them depending on there place of location then we would be curbing early marriages and teenage pregnancies.most young men go into working as bus conductors in bus stations and come out as carders because they are simply trying to earn some respect from both the driver and the passenger so if rules can be placed in respect for there jobs then we would have less carders in bus stations.

> Brief description of the innovation

I have been trained into having a skill as enterprenuer through tailoring and designing i train my fellow young women how to do business and earn money.having two sewing machines which would not sustain all the five girls we buy old purses renovate them into new ones by covering them with new materials
Am yet to Target young talent good in art and designing helping them build there talent and skills helping them bring money and food there tables through their  talents and skills.
Building a productive market that will help these talents sale there products country wide or world wide.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation will generate income because we have most needed things that are imported that will be locally made or farmed if things that are imported can be locally made this will benefit both the county and it's citizen's if beds soffer chairs and other wooden stuff  can be made by our local carpenter this would benefit the local Carpenters because it would generate income for them.for the tailors if they can have all materials made at affordable prices we can stop importing materials and cloths but have them locally made by our local factories it would also benefit the country and it's citizen's by not importing either cloths or materials.

> Technical Feasibility

I propose we bring on board people that  that will train our young women transforming the belief of a man being a source of income or being the provider.
And training them on how to be strong enterprenuers in different sectors like agriculture and other skills killing the mind set of failer through being productive as a young woman.Before being empowered both young men and women should go through entrepreneurship classes to understand the reason for there empowerment.
The introduction of bus station rules we have rules like don't drink and drive why not bring in rules like bus conductors should not drink and work which will bring in proper working and respect from both the driver and the passagers .I would propose there jobs gain some more of respect because there better off than thieves.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation will improve the life of a girl child because they will not depend on men for money  or basic needs.
Bus conductors will be respected by both drivers and the community having had there jobs respected and rules attached to it.
