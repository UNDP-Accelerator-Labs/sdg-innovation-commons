> Brief description of the innovation

The main aim of our Innovation is to equip all beneficiaries to have the knowledge and assets in installations i.e cold, Freezer rooms and Chillers ,as well as Electrical/Electronics and swimming pool installations.
Installations such as chillers,cold and freezer rooms will help local farmers to preserve perishable goods for a good period of time,and it will help in transporting of such products in good condition,by means of refrigerated tracks, hence, helping farming by way of preserving farm products.
Youths or rather people that will benefit from this innovation will also have the knowledge to troubleshoot and maintain all Electrical/Electronics and refrigeration systems. Knowledge and skills in baking of cakes and other products will also provided with consideration of gender equity and equality.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our Innovation will generate income by means of rentals i.e by renting Freezer,cold and freezer rooms to farmers and marketeers in commercial and local markets that are ever in need of preserving their goods. The innovation will also help in raising funds by installing  and maintaining such structures and equipments owned by other business partners.

> Technical Feasibility

Our plan is to open branches in the above named provinces for equipping youths with the Knowledge,skills and structures earlier explained,as well of promoting farming and self dependence in stated disciplines(technical and cluttering skills)

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will improve lives of many,and help them from violent activities,as they will have a source of income for a better living and their own investment.
