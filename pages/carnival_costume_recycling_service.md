Recycling service focused on costume/clothing waste generated during the Caribbean carnival season.

Carnival costumes often contain hazardous materials such as plastics, synthetic fibers, metal embellishments, and toxic dyes. When these costumes are discarded, they contribute to the growing waste crisis and pose a significant threat to the environment. At Carnicycle, they have pioneered the first solution to tackle the environmental impact of discarded carnival costumes. Their costume recycling program collects, cleans, and refurbishes costumes, allowing them to be reused for future events or repurposed for craft projects.
