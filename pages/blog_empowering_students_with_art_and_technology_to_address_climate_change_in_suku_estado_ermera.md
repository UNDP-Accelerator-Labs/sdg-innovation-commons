Activities to raise student understanding about climate change issues Julio Fernandes/UNDP Timor-Leste

The UNDP Timor-Leste Accelerator Lab, in collaboration with community leaders of Suku (village) Estado Ermera Municipality, the Ministry of Forestry, and six schools, conducted an initiative to raise student awareness of climate change issues using art and technology. Simple, yet powerful to address one of the tough and challenging issues faced by the community and youth in rural areas of Timor-Leste. Camera drones, mobile apps, and painting arts play a significant role in addressing this issue. These tools signify the values in both traditional and digitalization-era methods that could alleviate the ongoing practice that promotes solution creation for or by the community. These methods are accessible, affordable, and easy to implement, offering a cost-effective way to generate significant impact at the grassroots level. This blog explores how collective action within the community can help tackle pressing issues like climate change.
The green initiative began in October 2022, launching its first pilot program with the Salesian Community Schools of Don Bosco Fatumaca, which includes primary, pre-secondary, secondary, and technical vocational institutions. The program successfully introduced a green initiative program with the government through the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Over 1,000 tree seeds were planted in the Fatumaca area, and students received certificates for their participation. This initiative was integrated into the school curriculum, to reduce natural disasters while promoting forest conservation and environmental protection. The idea of greening has since become embedded in the school’s culture, and now the program is being expanded to the Ermera Municipality, specifically in the village of Estado. Students, youth, and community members in Ermera have embraced the green initiative, including tree planting, art, and the use of technology, as essential tools for environmental preservation. These activities raise awareness of climate change and inspire collective action to advocate for environmental protection. However, this green initiative at Ermera Six schools such as EBF Estado, EBF Bazar, EBF Membutilau, EBF Colimate, EBC Raicala, and ESTV Raicala participated, alongside community members, youth groups, and village leaders. The enthusiasm shown by the participants highlights the significant positive impact this initiative has had within the community.

Art and Painting: A Creative Approach Creative arts and painting have been used as tools to inspire students to act in protecting the environment. This method encourages students to express their creativity while developing a deeper connection with nature. Students used pencils to draw forests, creating meaningful images that represent their love for the environment. They also crafted human figures from recycled paper, symbolizing the importance of caring for trees and other living creatures. By recycling paper, students learned the vital connection between tree conservation and sustainability. This simple yet powerful method of promoting green practices advocates for sustainable action, giving a voice to students and communities in rural areas, and expressing the profound bond between humans and nature.
Forest Watcher App and Drone Cameras: Technology for Change The Forest Watcher app is a free and widely available mobile tool that provides real-time updates on forest changes through a dynamic online monitoring alert system. Though intricate, it is powerful in its ability to track environmental changes. During the event, students and community members were introduced to this app and received tutorials on how to monitor their surrounding environment using the app on their mobile phones. The use of drones to capture aerial images further demonstrated how technology can be employed to monitor environmental changes effectively.

Tree Planting As part of the green initiative, twelve species of trees were planted in Suku Estado. These tree species not only contribute to economic sustainability but also protect the land from landslides and environmental degradation. Students, youth, and community members planted trees on school grounds, community farms, and public spaces, demonstrating their commitment to preserving green spaces and promoting sustainability. The green initiative will continue to expand and be replicated in selected schools across various municipalities. This expansion aims to address several key issues. Over the past two years, Timor-Leste has experienced persistent deforestation, which has increased the country's vulnerability to natural disasters, environmental degradation, water shortages, pollution, and flooding. These challenges demand a range of interventions and innovative solutions. The green initiative program seeks to instill empathy in students from an early age, nurturing a deep connection to nature and promoting positive contributions to conservation efforts and social responsibility. Additionally, the program raises awareness among both students and the broader community about the urgent need to address deforestation and protect the environment.
