Renewable energies
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to contribute to the positioning of renewable energies in Argentina’s agenda using an approach that emphasizes social innovation. By doing so, we seek to highlight the potential of interventions that can improve the quality of life of communities left behind in terms of energy access. We will focus on the challenge of populations in vulnerable situations to adapt to existing technologies. Along the way, we will try to contribute different types of evidence related to renewable energies, such as solutions, patterns, insights, emerging trends, and the like.


> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

One of the multiple dimensions of poverty is energy poverty. This dimension was defined by the World Economic Forum (2010) as the lack of access to modern sustainable energy services and products. These services must be adequate, affordable, reliable, quality, safe, and environmentally sustainable to support development (Habitat for Humanity, 2022). Worldwide, energy, which is essential to the functioning of modern societies, is highly unequally distributed. Given access to energy is linked to a country's social and economic development, the economically disadvantaged persons are generally those with the worst access to energy services. Furthermore, because energy inefficiency feeds back into development, the poorest countries are trapped in a vicious circle: they lack access to the energy required to overcome their economic stagnation (Habitat for Humanity, 2022). From a more human perspective, energy access challenges hinder development insofar as they can hamper daily activities such as cooking, heating the home, or bathing; they also have an impact on possibilities related to health, education, and work, among others.

The world is falling behind on SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), since its targets are far from being met by 2030 (Sustainable Energy for All, Aug, 22nd 2022). For example, more than 750 million people have no access to electricity and 2.6 billion people continue to lack access to clean cooking technologies (The Energy Progress Report, 2021). At the current pace, these numbers will remain above 600 million and 2 billion people respectively in 2030 (World Economic Forum, 2021). At the national level, 1.46 million households in Argentina were affected by energy poverty in 2020 (ENERGAS, 2021). On the other hand, from an environmental viewpoint, the energy sector accounted for 51% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018 (Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development of Argentina, 2021).

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

The first and main signal identified refers to the negative impacts of the climate crisis, caused by human action, that entail more than just natural climate variability and affect nature and people. Regardless of the region or sector, the most vulnerable people and systems are disproportionately affected. The irreversible impact of increasing weather and climate extreme events is evident, as natural and human systems are forced to exceed their adaptability (IPCC, 2022).

Given the effects of climate change, the energy transition towards sustainable means of energy consumption appears as a solution. A large portion of the emissions produced in the world comes from energy consumption. In fact, the consumption of fossil fuels is the largest contributor to global climate change (SEI, IISD, ODI, Climate Analytics, CICERO, and UNEP, 2019). Therefore, its mitigation requires a change in the current energy consumption matrix, based on investment in clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable energy sources. (UN, s.f). Visit the link below for an accurate summary of this perspective:

In Argentina, emissions from the energy sector represent almost half of the country's emissions, in addition to its increase due to the impact of economic factors and population growth (MAyD, 2021). This is another signal indicating the urgency of promoting the energy transition. The chart below shows the sectoral distribution of the National GHG Inventory for 2018:

The combination of the previously developed national energy scheme and an environment with optimal conditions has the potential for renewable energy development. The diversity of climates and the extension of the Argentine territory provide a favorable context for the development of solar and hydroelectric energy initiatives and projects focused on biofuels and the territory’s enormous wind capacity. However, renewable energy facilities in Argentina are well below their potential capacity (Schaube, Ortiz & Recalde, 2018). The article below explains some of these features:

The signals identified indicate not only the need and urgency but also a window of opportunity to work on the identification of renewable energy solutions that encourage a transition to renewable energies in Argentina (and in the world).

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The added value the AccLab can provide in terms of renewable energies is the systematization and visibility of evidence that is not as prevalent in our country's energy policy discussions (grassroots solutions, and weak signals, among others). In Argentina, the agenda regarding this topic is associated with large infrastructure projects, the need to attract investors to carry out these projects, and public utility fees in a situation marked by rising inflation. We believe, however, that we can contribute towards drawing attention to other types of actors, experiences, and lessons learned that can favor the debate; or promote smaller-scale interventions in different communities. Moreover, we believe that we will be able to collaborate with the Environment Cluster in the CO. We had very productive experiences together in another learning cycle and they are interested in deepening their work in renewable energies. For all of these reasons, we are aware of the strategic importance of further addressing this issue in the near future. 


> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

The   renewable  energy  solutions   mapping   shows   that  there   isn’t   only   one   technology applying to all cases and that having access to a technology doesn’t guarantee having a solution. The technology challenge is defined by how the processes are developed and whether communities with greater energy needs are able to adapt to those solutions.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

We know that many of the technologies work (solar stoves, etc.), so we asked ourselves: What are the elements and/or processes that make more likely the adoption of renewable energies by worse-off people who suffer from a lack of access to energy services and products?  From this general question, we can infer some specific questions that we are beginning to outline:  How the reach strategy affects the adoption? In specific, how does the distribution and implementation of solutions affect their effectiveness and whether different degrees of user engagement could change this when the desired effectiveness is not achieved 


> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

It is precisely through the different methods that we will pay special attention to the challenge linked to the adaptability of renewable energy technologies. We know that many projects aimed at promoting them fail because people have different habits, organizational models, or values. For this reason, we want to provide evidence to offer public policy recommendations in this topic. To that end and to facilitate adoption, we will adopt a participatory action research and nudge strategies. 


> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We would like to underline that the main difference is related to the type of information that is prioritized and/or circulated in the most important areas where this issue is discussed. The topics most frequently discussed when dealing with energy are large infrastructure projects, investments, and fees, among others. As a result, the type of evidence that the Lab can provide is not the most prevalent or universally known. We will attempt to shed more light on other aspects of the same issue through a portfolio of actions. 

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The challenges linked to renewable energies are unavoidable to promote sustainable development in our country and work on climate action and, in particular, the energy transition. The methodology used in the AccLab can promote complementary approaches to the predominant discussions on energy and encourage small-scale, decentralized, and more easily replicable experiments and interventions in different communities. Hence, we are interested in systematizing not only the lessons learned through the grassroots experiences that are being implemented but also the emerging trends and challenges.
