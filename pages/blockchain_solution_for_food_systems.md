## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity? Why is it important to do this experiment?

The specific learning objective of the activity is to understand whether small farmers, who are vulnerable populations, can take advantage of appropriate technologies and knowledge to improve their income while creating a direct link with consumers, who will be able to access better quality products at a better price.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the technology can help linking final consumers and farmers, then the final consumers will be able to purchase goods directly from the producer and by then make the value chains more sustainable



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> Describe which actions, with whom, where, when will you (or did you) take to test your hypothesis:

Implement solutions to enhance the visibility and marketability of artisanal products through:

1- Online business education;

2- Enhanced marketing;

3- Integration onto global platforms;

4- Deployment of innovative technologies to differentiate and attract fair-trade conscious consumers.

- Quality &amp; Authenticity:

To tackle the quality issue head-on, we propose to use an ingenious solution involving an authentication to our platform. So, the customers that order their products can scan a QR code or another identification tag attached to the product they purchase. This QR allows our customers enables you to trace the origin of the product and find out which farmer produced it.

- Platform integration:

To increase their visibility and thus their sales, it is necessary to integrate existing platforms that are adapted to the characteristics of farmers and geared towards their customers (FAME for exemple, etc.).

- Secured sales:

To tackle the lack of trust regarding BtoB international sales, smart contracts solutions will be proposed through application like FAME. It will help to reassure Moroccan farmers vis-à-vis international traders, as well as guaranteeing that customers receive compliant products. 

Special features for craftsman products: Digitalization of Moroccan heritage to build on unique knowledge in terms of creations, designs, patterns, shapes, etc. and to preserve and monetize Moroccan heritage, we think that it will be important to record cultural artworks on blockchain.
