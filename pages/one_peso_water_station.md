Access to clean and potable water.

> User: Who is the solution for? How does it answer the need of the user? Why does it matter to the user?

The solution is for the general public who would like to have access to clean and safe drinking / potable water.

With just Php1.00 (US$0.02), anyone can have clean and safe drinking water anytime.
