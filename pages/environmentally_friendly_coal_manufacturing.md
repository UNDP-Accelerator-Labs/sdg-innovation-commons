NIMPA NGOUFO Abed Julius

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

E-mail address: nimpaabedjulius@gmail.com 

Contact: 691 926 657

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

Yes the solution is affiliated with an institution in Cameroon -Energy Solutions for All (ESA Services)

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem &amp; solution description)

10 years ago, women and girls in rural areas of Cameroon's Far North region were barely 2 km away to get wood for cooking meals. Today they are at least 15km. This strong pressure on forest cover is causing deforestation and the degradation of forest ecosystems, which in turn exacerbates the vulnerability of populations to the effects of climate change. Our solution is to offer an alternative fuel to the use of wood energy. Indeed, we recover organic waste (rice husk, millet stalk, corn stalk, cotton stalk, peanut shell...) in order to produce ecological charcoal which is an environmentally friendly fuel and meets the seventh objective of sustainable development (SDG 7). Our goal in the next two years is to replicate the solution in the North Cameroon region and the Adamawa region. Indeed, the problem of waste management is common in our communities and this solution that we propose is part of a logic of waste recovery for the proper management of waste.

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

We sell a kilogram at 150cfa compared to that of wood whose prices vary from 300cfa to 500frs sometimes. The wood in the city of Maroua is sold in a small pile of about 03 twigs which is up to 100frs and can not make a meal

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

TRL 5- TRL 6

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

The product is in demand by households and restaurants in the city of Maroua who appreciate very well the cooking time of the product as well as its very reduced price. Currently about 500 kg of the product is requested per day.

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

500 kg of the product is requested per day. A small amount of our product can be used to cook large amounts or more food for longer than regular charcoal or charcoal from other sources that usually burn faster and the consistency of the heat is not the same.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

Our main challenge now is that of communication around our product. Also we are still battling for the recognition of our product by the Agency for Quality and Standard Control
