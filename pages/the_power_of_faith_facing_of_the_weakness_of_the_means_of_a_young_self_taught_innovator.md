> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

   In a village where everyone thinks that not going far in their studies is an end in itself, where relentlessness and dedication are not considered as real arguments to support a citizen in his project, this is the decor in which evolves Mamadou Saliou Diallo, an autodidact whose level of study is of the 5th year of primary school; is developing a pico-dam to supply electricity to surrounding villages.

               In the process of developing the energy sector to solve the power problem in Guinea, the government has electrified major cities, prefectures, and sub-prefectures. However, it emerges that despite these enormous efforts, shortcomings remain. So to provide a quick and low-cost solution, our friend “Actor's Name” gave himself body and soul to put together a micro-dam which for him will serve as a quick answer to the question of coverage and thus, influence positively on the lifestyle of local residents.
