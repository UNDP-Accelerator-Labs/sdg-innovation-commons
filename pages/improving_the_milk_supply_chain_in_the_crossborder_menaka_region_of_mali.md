## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Improving the milk supply chain in the crossborder Menaka region of Mali
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that despite the granting of small milk processing equipment to women's cooperatives in Menaka, they have difficulty selling their product. We want to learn from this experience and propose possible solutions.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

As part of the improvement of the living conditions of cross-border communities, the Trade for Peace (T4P) project provided two women's dairy cooperatives with small equipments to promote the processing, conservation and marketing of milk. This initiative comes from the fact that ménaka is a cross-border and breeding area par excellence. Despite these efforts by T4P, women are struggling to sell their product. Thus, the laboratories of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger having been selected as part of the 2021 innovation challenge have decided to link the latter to the trade for peace project, in particular the milk processing, conservation and marketing component in order to help women better sell their product to improve their living conditions. If nothing is done to help these women beneficiaries, the expected effects will not be achieved.

A brainstorming with the focal point made it possible to understand that he had granted small materials to the cooperatives. After a while, they wondered what was wrong. Is it the quality of their product that is not suited to the market? Is it the type of packaging they use? Why can't they sell their product? The focal point monitoring the project came to the conclusion that the women need support that would help them better understand the challenge and propose solutions. If urgent solutions are not found, over time, women risk abandoning this activity while it is relevant in the three-border area.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The three laboratories will seek to understand the difficulties faced by the dairy cooperatives benefiting from trade for peace. This learning, which will go through three stages of the Acclabs protocol, will provide value by understanding the challenge, finding a solution and experimenting through a control group. It is important to invest resources in this action because it aims to improve the living conditions of cross-border communities that are suffering the effects of the security crisis. Also, since trade for peace was in this dynamic, it is important to support it to achieve the objectives it has set.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Trade for Peace initiated this project in order to contribute to the stabilization of communities and participate in the reconstitution of production capital. Our interventions, so much requested by the beneficiaries, will certainly contribute to bringing a smile to these women in the grip of the multidimensional crisis.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Following the interview we had with the trade for peace focal point, we learned that despite support for small processing and conservation equipment, women are unable to sell their products on the market. So we want to learn from the partnership between trade for peace and cooperatives, the challenges that cooperatives face, is the project focused on the priority needs of cooperatives and customers; what data do we have? what would our value proposition be? propose possible solutions in order to facilitate the flow of products, contribute to cross our actions to the improvement of the modes of subsistence.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The application of our tools through sensemaking, solution mapping and experimentation through control and control groups will allow a better understanding of the challenge because we will have collected different points of view and carried out a comparative analysis allowing whether the intervention meets the priorities of all parties. these tools will make it possible to carry out a complex analysis of the challenges and to seek possible solutions that could involve collective intelligence and market visits. it should be noted that the project did not do such research to address the difficulties women face. the added value of the lab would come from its ability to identify the bottlenecks of the project and make proposals contributing to the improvement of the lifestyles of the beneficiaries

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We will use activity reports from trade for peace and its partner GRDL. We will also use the reports of the technical services of the state without forgetting the social networks.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

We (3 labs) will work with trade for peace, communities and the government which is a partner of T4P. We will work to improve the livelihoods of cross-border communities including women's milk cooperatives. If nothing is done, women will always be confronted with the problem of selling dairy products, whereas T4P has already invested financial resources in the purchase of equipment for processing, preserving and marketing milk. Therefore, this support could be a failure if we do not try to understand the bottlenecks and find adequate solutions.
