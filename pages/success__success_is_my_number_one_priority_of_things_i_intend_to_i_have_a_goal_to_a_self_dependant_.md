> Title of the innovation

Success; success is my number one priority of things I intend to I have a goal to a self dependant or as an independent individual I believe in working extra had to brighten living because life is whole about success and for that am a small interprenior.

> Brief description of the innovation

For someone to be success as a story teller about success he or she must first go through the hard time of business were sometimes business goes down someone tries this and that things just goes soure,that through innovation and delaminations there comes a time of settlement in every success story it's about time when the business starts to boom from zero to something successful ...I could go on and on ....!

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My addition value;for someone to be stable in every success business,one should avoid many different advices from different people whom they don't even know sure that this person can motivate even if they might have an improved life because of business it's not everyone who genuine things in live somes are just destroyers they might not give someone full tips of business because thier jelous there too scared that the person there telling those tips might bigger things more than them,so it's better u get advise from one two trusted business people then the other you just keep on observing from the distance or were possible one must also buy and start reading business books because they don't cheat .

> Technical Feasibility

My innovation planned to have more men and women doing good things in future aspecially us youths I would want to become a successfully business advisor in future through my todays contributions because the time hustle is now as young as I am .

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation can help some one out there that's if he or she is eager in half in doing business without being demorised fake false woods in it could from our families ,friends extra... believing in what you can manage to do is 90%trust weath than following foot steps others which u can't even manage to do it might destroy someones reputations...but food advise is always the best
