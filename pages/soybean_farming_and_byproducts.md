> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovator will be benefitting from the profit.
The innovation will benefit others because a number of people will be employed i.e., caretakers, sowers, reapers, weaders.
The innovation will contribute to the already existing business in such a way that it will enhance the pork farming, for example, whereas the animal feed that we'll be producing will be used to feed the animals thereby enhancing their growth and improve their market.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovatiors will first be involved much more in soybean farming (due to lack of enough resources and as we grow, we'll advance to animal feed production, and to biodiesel when we have grown.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our products we'll be sold at a very a cheaper but competitive prices which will accommodate everyone, e.g small scale pork farmers.
