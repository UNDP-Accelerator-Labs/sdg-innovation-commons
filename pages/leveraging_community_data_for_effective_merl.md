## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Name of the experimental activity

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can we improve the way UNDP collects citizen feedback using ethnography to increase nuance of our impact

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF ethnography is used in MERL for citizen / community feedback, then we can better understand our true impact on beneficiaries we serve.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Collaborate with UNDP - IRMU (Integrated Results Monitoring Unit) to design survey, identify partners, and implement 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Level of detail available for ROAR reporting 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

The data was captured using the ethnographic methods of online virtual interviews.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

Approximately 3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting links

N/A

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

50% of solution mappers time, and 50% of time of the monitoring, evaluation and oversight officer of the resilience and sustainable development and the IRMU.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

There is potential to strengthen the approach utilized for accessing citizens feedback on the projects implemented by the UNDP and the Implementing partners.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Approximately 6 months

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

None

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

No

> Please add any supporting links that describe the planning, implementation, results of learning of this activity? For example a tweet, a blog, or a report. 

N/A- internal experiment.
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

We can report far more than we can as we report only on bare minimum. By collecting micronarratives (e.g. water council), we learnt that our impact goes beyond numbers and impacts lives beyond the design of our prodoc

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Lack of incentive for IRMU unit to dedicate time. COVID was another challenge. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

IRMU Team and other field and reporting teams 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Other organizations having an monitoring and evaluation unit.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes. There were some modifications along the way to incorporate evolving ideas and views of the IRMU Team and the monitoring evaluation and oversight officer of the resilience and sustainable development team, relative to what was initially planned.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Add ethnographic / qualitative as a potential KPI for team members (e.g. engage comms). Also important to get buy in from community gatekeepers who control access into the community. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, this is very adaptable to other contexts

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Limited use. 

> What surprised you?

The power of diverse ethnographic methods in make overt important micro-narratives, to provide different lenses to view the results of the work that the UNDP does.
