Curious to see how fellow Namibians were addressing issues that are directly or indirectly affecting them during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Accelerator Lab in collaboration with our partner Launch Namibia conceptualized a digital solution safari. The solution safari was a social media campaign that looked at COVID-19 related products and services developed or adapted by not only entrepreneurs but as well as community members in underserved areas. 


Our aim with this campaign was to highlight entrepreneurs who are making a difference within their communities, we were specifically looking at entrepreneurs sharing useful information on COVID-19, gathering resources that can be donated to the less privileged or making innovative strides as entrepreneurs to ensure that they not only continue working but also inspiring others to follow suit. This digital safari was also a means to highlight and collate information on locally owned solutions outside of the entrepreneurship space. Our main way of engaging followers on social media was through a call to action where followers of both UNDP and Launch accounts were asked to submit information regarding community members who have developed COVID-19 specific solutions.



1.  Kaushiwetu Johannes came up with a hygiene hand-was system to aid the fight against the pandemic, his design can be customised to suit the needs of the community and it comes in various sizes. The design also allows for multiple people to use it at the same time.  

 
2.Ingo Shangyenge through his start-up Inansa Investment has been manufacturing masks for essential staff as well as the public at large.

3.  Emmerancia Van Wyk has been providing nutritious meals to between 250 & 300 children daily who were formerly dependent on their school feeding schemes while educating them on COVID-19

4.  Linda Ndakolo whose start-up manufactures cleaning materials donated dishwashing liquid to over 500 beneficiaries living in an informal settlement in Windhoek. 

5. Sylvanie Beukes alongside his partners has been developing sanitizing tools to aid in the fight of COVID-19 and future pathogenic threats to come.
