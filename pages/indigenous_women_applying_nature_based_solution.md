Indigenous Women Applying Nature-Based Solution

> Description

The Uru Uru Team’s solution is led by Indigenous women engaged in sustainable and efficient activities, applying Nature-Based Solutions such as the construction of floating rafts using Indigenous phytoremediation techniques to reduce pollution in Lake Uru Uru, combined with community gardens to generate food and income. This involves developing skills in environmental management and sustainable practices to strengthen phytoremediation techniques and community farming, fostering a behavioral shift toward greater environmental protection and sustainable practices within the community. Increased collaboration is also anticipated between Indigenous youth and other community members
