## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Community-level awareness of the challenge of plastic pollution is a key driver of collection (collection at the household level is a major obstacle).
2. There needs to be a leader within the business community to reach businesses. 
3. It's important to separate small innovators in the field of plastic waste from larger enterprises and even the providers of CSR support in terms of money since there is the perception that the larger ones are predatory of the smaller ones' ideas and initiative.
4. The dialogue on plastic needs to be intensified with a nostalgic focus on going back to times without plastic.
5. Building on point 4, there is a lot of potential for replacement of plastic with traditional organic materials. 

> Please paste the link(s) to the blog(s) that articulate the learnings on your frontier challenge.
We have a publication that articulates our findings but it will be published in February 2023.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

There were no bottlenecks since the activity was well funded and supported by the GEF SGP. The only challenge was that some of the smaller innovators in plastic waste didn't want to share with larger players. 

> For this frontier challenge, how much of your time did you dedicate to the stages in the learning cycle? Please make sure that your answers adds up to 100%.
## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

In looking for practical solutions, this was the best approach, starting with the focus group; the survey was supported by The University of the West Indies; and the Lab's own observations with the GEF SGP team served to make sense of the solutions and their applicability and potential for receiving funds. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

There are many activities happening with respect to innovation away from plastic or to deal with plastic waste. The invitation to propose solutions in a collective context was deemed the quickest way to identify suitable solutions. The GEF funding window was open for the short time and so speed was a key consideration.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The experiments are ongoing and because we partnered with GEF SGP, all of the recipients of funds are NGOs. They are all implementing the solutions and reporting on their impact at a community and national level. 
1. Cashew Gardens Community Council (CGCC): This project will develop an edible spoon as well as a green market, at which the community will sell their spoon and garden produce
2. The Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, UWI: This project will use waste plastic filament to develop a local stem kit for youths
3. National Centre for Persons with Disabilities: This project will use waste plastic to produce tools for PWDs, will set up a community garden for PWDs and will establish an online marketplace for products made by PWDs
4. CEDAW Committee of Trinidad and Tobago: This will install benches with gender messaging in public spaces
5. Rotary Club of Port of Spain West (RCPOSW): This project will prototype equipment for collecting plastics in rivers
6. Alliance of Rural Communities of Trinidad and Tobago:	This project will expand the production of natural, sustainable packaging as alternatives to plastic packaging
SHIFT! Caribbean	Mentorship and capacity support to ensure successfully completion of the 6 other projects.






> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The University of the West Indies is a recipient of funding. Their project relates to turning waste plastic into filaments that can be made into prosthetics. Apart from that, The UWI depended on the Accelerator Lab's support to increase the uptake of a survey instrument on household perspectives on plastic.  

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Not applicable. 

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

The Solid Waste Management Company Limited (SWMCOL) was a partner for distilling information from the event and subsequent publication. In this case, they supported the UNDP. The results of experiments in 2023 will determine how we engage going forward.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

The project partners/implementers are all new to the UNDP, however, since funding is provided through the GEF, our interaction is not direct at this time. Our findings and insights will determine how we engage with SWMCOL going forward.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

This project was a partnership with the GEF SGP. They provided the funding for the experiments/projects. 
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The Lab needed the funds from the GEF SGP to fund the projects and will need the support of SWMCOL to explore scale up. At present, the main benefit was the support of SWMCOL for endorsement. The solution holders are the small NGOs and academia.
