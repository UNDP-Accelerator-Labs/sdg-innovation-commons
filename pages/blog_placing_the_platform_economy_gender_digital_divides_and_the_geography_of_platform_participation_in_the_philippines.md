PLACING THE PLATFORM ECONOMY

Foreword

It has been said time and again, but it bears repeating; It
is astounding to witness Filipino resilience throughout
the past years permeated by the pandemic. Truly,
COVID-19 has widely impacted people in the
Philippines, especially the vulnerable sectors such
as the poor, the elderly, women, and children. The
country experienced a slump in employment with the
unemployment rate reaching as high as 17.7 percent
in April 2020. The underemployment rate was high
at 18.9 percent in April 2020 (vs. 13.5 percent in
April 2019). Furthermore, during the enhanced
community quarantine implementation, two thirds
of businesses stopped operations. Despite these
losses, Filipinos were quick and steadfast to adjust.
Among the measures quickly adapted during such
unprecedented times is to shift to digital.

Many businesses, including those of small
entrepreneurs, began to use digital technologies
to make their businesses thrive. These new age
entrepreneurs include Filipinos who had recently
started a business after losing their jobs to the
pandemic. In a UNDP Rapid Response Survey of
MSMEs with 285 respondents, digitalization was
the most popular demand strategy for both female
(70 percent) and male (52 percent) respondents (or
62 percent overall). Shifting to a digital economy
by providing digital training and expanding internet
connectivity to MSMEs was considered vital in
facilitating national economic recovery.

This report titled “Placing the Platform Economy:
Gender, Digital Divides, and the Geography of
Platform Participation in the Philippines” highlights

Dr. Selva Ramachandran
Resident Representative
UNDP Philippines

the rapid growth of the use of digital platforms for
business, commerce, or social interactions or what
can be called as the Platform Economy. It especially
tells the story of how digital platforms have been
used by women in the Philippines to cope with the
COVID-19 crisis, especially on ensuring financial
stability, balancing their responsibilities (such as care
work, community, or other economic responsibilities),
or upgrading their skills. Platform Economy is seen
to be a great equalizer – enabling women and other
sectors to access more opportunities to contribute
to economic activities, while also juggling other
responsibilities.

The report further emphasizes the value of going
beyond closing the digital divide by having a
place-based and localized approach to promoting
inclusion in digital interventions, including those to
be implemented by the Philippine government in
light of the Mandanas-Garcia Transition.

This report is the fruition of the work of the authors
namely, Jerik Cruz and Emille de la Cruz, as well as
the valuable feedback from Dr. Rafaelita M. Aldaba
of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The
UNDP staff and consultants, who helped in finalizing
and packaging the report, are also fully recognized
in the acknowledgements section.

The Philippines has a growing need and potential
for digitalization. The UNDP remains committed
and steadfast in strengthening partnerships and
the technical support to provide the much-needed
assistance in making this digital shift in the Philippines
successful and effective. We hope that this can
open possible areas of collaboration among various
development partners and stakeholders.

May you find this report enlightening.

Abstract

Despite long-standing barriers to the mass adoption
of digital technologies, the Philippine government’s
imposition of lockdowns in response to the COVID-19
pandemic has facilitated a dramatic expansion of
the country’s platform economy. Akin to the broader
rise of the knowledge economy, the rapid growth
of the platform sector could come with substantial
“gender dividends”, given the greater rate of women’s
participation, lower pay gaps, and increased flexibility
that can allow women to finesse their care and
economic responsibilities. Yet much less attention
has been devoted to how geographically-embedded
advantages and interventions continue to be decisive
in shaping prospects for participation in the sector.

Harnessing case studies of leading local efforts
to promote inclusion in the platform economy,
as well as empirical analysis of the Philippines’

2019 National ICT Household Survey, we provide
preliminary evidence of key forms of socio-spatial
variation in the sector’s expansion as well as the
ability of women and other marginalized groups to
participate in it. Even successful inclusion initiatives
confront a range of spatially-related impediments
that go beyond the conventional digital divide,
while quantitative findings suggest that surmounting
digital and skills barriers remain necessary yet still
insufficient for encouraging women to maximize the
socioeconomic opportunities in digital platforms. The
role of a more place-based, localized approach to
promoting inclusion—especially critical in light of
local government resources increasing due to the
Mandanas transition—is likewise borne out by the
Philippines’ largest success to date in encouraging
the growth of knowledge economy opportunities
nationwide: the business process outsourcing sector.

1. Introduction

Like the rest of the global economy, the COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in the worst economic crisis in the
Philippines’ postwar history (World Bank 2020). Kneecapped by the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well
as the series of lockdowns imposed on the country’s major economic growth zones, the resulting contraction
spurred a surge in unemployment and business closures starting in March 2020, which the country has
yet to recover from as of March 2022. Current economic statistics paint a grim picture: between 2018 and
2020, more than 42,000 registered businesses nationwide seemingly vanished from the Philippine Statistics
Authority’s (PSA) List of Establishments (see Figure 1), with the overwhelming share of losses concentrated

2

among registered microenterprises. Moreover,
the shock posed by this crisis to the Philippines’
working population has been even more dramatic.
After reaching record lows in 2019 (Figure 2),

both unemployment and underemployment levels
practically tripled throughout the first wave of
quarantines in 2020, and have remained at elevated
levels since.

PLACING THE PLATFORM ECONOMY
Yet the COVID-19 crisis has also spurred a groundswell
of societal shifts that are poised to leave their mark
on the Philippine economic landscape. Among the
most conspicuous of these transformations has
been the breakneck growth of the country’s platform
economy: having already gathered momentum
throughout the past decade due to rising social
media penetration and the dynamism of the business
process outsourcing (BPO) sector (Soriano 2020;
Thompson 2020), digital platforms have evolved into
an economic lifeline for the hundreds of thousands
of Filipinos whose lives have been upended by the
pandemic. For instance, data from the Department
of Trade and Industry (DTI) show that the number
of enterprises involved in online retail trade has
swelled from 1,848 to 88,575 over the course of
2020 despite the broader contraction posed by
the pandemic (DTI 2021; Desiderio 2021). Platform-
based employment has likewise grown by leaps and
bounds, with the Philippines reportedly leading the
world in terms of the growth of its online freelancing
sector in 2020 (Payoneer 2020), and comprising
the sixth biggest contributor to the global online
freelance market during that same year (OLI 2021).
In the broadsheets, anecdotes abound as to how
numerous micro, small, and medium enterprises
(MSMEs) have supplemented their brick-and-mortar
revenue with e-commerce sales (IFC, 2021) while
displaced workers are replacing their lost income
with earnings from platform-mediated delivery jobs
(Canivel, 2021).

In turn, these trends have fueled debates on how
these forms of digitalization4 might reshape countries’
economic geography and open new channels for
recovery in the post-pandemic period. On one
hand, the integration of economic activities into
digital platforms has been hailed by observers for
its potential to reduce transaction costs, improve
productivity and efficiency, create new tax bases,
and generate new jobs and commercial opportunities
in information and knowledge-intensive industries
(OECD 2019; Serafica and Oren 2020; World
Bank 2020b). On the other, the platform sector’s
transformative potential is widely recognized to be
constrained in the short term by severe digital divides.

In the Philippines, for instance, owing to the
concentration of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) infrastructure in leading metropolitan
hubs and their environs, more than half of Filipino
households (57 percent) reportedly did not have

internet access as recently as 2018 (Quimba 2020;
United Nations Broadband Commission). For Filipino
women, such spatial inequities are compounded by
long-standing gender inequalities that circumscribe
their participation in the sector. While recent studies
have found that women are more likely to engage
in platform work and e-commerce, these studies
also suggest that they are more disproportionately
saddled with the sector’s job security and social
protection deficits relative to their male peers
(Bayudan-Dacuycuy and Baje 2021) in addition to
being more adversely affected by the COVID-19
pandemic.5 In the midst of these recalcitrant socio-
spatial divides, the common view of big business
representatives that the growth of the platform sector
constitutes one of the most important pillars of an
inclusive recovery (Reyes 2021) may be vulnerable to
a fallacy of “synecdoche” (Amin and Graham 1997)—
over-identifying “recovery” largely with sectors and
activities that can be readily digitized, and innovation
with only one particular component thereof.

How is the Philippines’ ongoing digital transformation
interacting with these socio-spatial inequalities? In this
paper, we examine trends concerning the Philippine
platform economy’s development and expansion,
focusing specifically on its repercussions on the
country’s preexisting digital and gender divides.
Complementing previous empirical research in
the Philippines (Albert et al 2021; Dacuycuy and
Baje 2021; Tabuga and Cabaero 2021), we adopt
a mixed-method research design, integrating case
studies of local efforts to advance marginalized social
groups’ platform sector engagement with empirical
analysis of a nationally- and regionally-representative
ICT household survey to examine how social
and spatial forms of exclusion have conditioned
sector participation. As we demonstrate, a more
geographically-attuned perspective facilitates a
more detailed understanding of how socio-spatial
divides could constrain the evolving dynamics of
the Philippines’ digital economy. This perspective
also highlights the practical potential of “blended”
approaches—online services combined with
localized, place-based interventions—to maximize
the sector’s socioeconomic dividends for women
and other marginalized groups: an approach made
even more relevant by the Philippine government’s
move towards “full decentralization” with the
implementation of Executive Order (EO) 138 (also
known as the Mandanas ruling) starting in 2022.

4 Also described as “digital transformation” in this paper, this term refers to the various changes prompted by the advancements in and growing use of digital
technologies (Albert, 2020)
5 As an example, a 2021 International Finance Corporation (IFC) report has documented a decline in the gross merchandise value of women-owned e-commerce
firms with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, from 106 percent that of male-owned businesses in 2019 to only 79 percent in 2020.

2. Women, Place, and the Philippine Platform Economy

Encapsulated in the Philippines by the increasing
prominence of social media applications (e.g.
Facebook), ride-hailing/logistics services (e.g. Grab),
and e-commerce portals (e.g. Zalora), the rise of the
platform economy6 (also referred to in this paper as
the platform sector) has entailed the emergence of
new digital ecosystems which are fundamentally
reshaping the terms with which its participants
interact and transact with one another. As defined
by Kenney and Zysman (2016), these platforms
essentially comprise new business forms facilitated
by the emergence and adoption of new technologies
(e.g. cloud computing, big data analytics) which host
and mediate access to digitized commercial and
labor markets, with the latter involving what is now
commonly known as “gig” work. “Gig” work, in turn, is
usually subdivided into “crowdwork”—geographically
flexible project-based work engagements hosted on
web-based platforms—as well as “on-demand work”
entailing task-based jobs allocated via location-based
applications such as Lalamove (de Stefano 2016). In
both cases, the majority share of such work entails
the mediation of the client-worker relationship by
the digital labor platform at stake (Hunt and Samman
2019; ILO 2021).

More generally, the growth of the platform sector
can be viewed as the latest development in the rise
of the global “knowledge economy”— a services-
led growth regime in which economic returns are
increasingly predicated on access to high-level
soft and technical skills as well as ICT infrastructure
(Thelen 2019; Wren 2021). To the extent that the
platform economy intensifies such services-oriented

structural transformation, it has also been associated
with three major socioeconomic sea-shifts that
are still being wrestled with in both advanced as
well as developing economies. First and most
fundamentally, since the knowledge economy
places a greater premium on education, levels
of educational attainment—higher education,
in particular—have become even more crucial
determinants of socioeconomic status and mobility
than in manufacturing-led economies, where training
for industry- and firm-specific skills can be provided
in-house by companies and through Technical and
Vocational Education and Training (TVET) systems
(Hall 2021; Ansell and Gringich forthcoming).
Secondly, given the increased dependency of
higher-productivity services on skilled human
resources, the platform sector could intensify
social and economic cleavages between urban
zones where the skilled labor forces necessary for
globally connected, knowledge-intensive production
are typically located, and cities and rural areas
which lack such a human capital base (Ansell 2019;
Iversen and Soskice 2019). And thirdly, though
the knowledge economy requires higher-level
skills among individuals to engage productively
in it, most of these skills are non-manual in nature
and place a greater premium on non-routine
social interactions as a base for more cognitively-
demanding collaboration in the workforce; this
has meant that both the platform sector and the
knowledge economy have expanded opportunities
for women with such capacities to participate more
extensively in ICT-intensive sectors (Iversen and
Rosenbluth 2010).

2.1. The Philippine Platform Economy’s “Gender Dividend”:
Chances and Constraints

In keeping with this recent literature, there have been
indications that the platform sector could also yield
a substantial “gender dividend” in the Philippines as
well as in other developing countries. Indeed, women
in the Philippines have generally been found to be
on par with men in terms of computer and internet

usage, as well as more avid users of mobile phones
than the latter (Tabuga and Cabaero 2021). Both in
terms of e-commerce as well as online work, they
have been empirically documented to be more
likely to leverage digital platforms for economic
purposes, harboring a significant margin over men

6 As noted by Albert (2020), discussions on the platform economy are often not distinct from those on the broader digital economy, which is commonly understood
as the ensemble of transactions facilitated by the internet (Bukht and Heeks 2017).

PLACING THE PLATFORM ECONOMY
not only in purchasing more goods and services, but also in engaging in online selling activity (see
Figure 3). Indeed, in a separate 2020 survey run by the Philippine Institute of Development Studies (PIDS)
with participants of the Department of Information and Communications Technology’s (DICT) digitaljobsPH
program, women (and younger persons) have also been found to be more likely to participate in crowdwork
(Bayudan-Dacuycuy and Baje 2021)—a finding which dovetails with studies conducted with both American
and Indian crowdworkers (Berg 2016).

FIGURE 3. Utilization Levels of Digital Platforms by Gender, 2019

Source: Tabuga and Cabaero (2021)

The higher participation rate of women in the platform
economy is linked with several advantages that
the sector usually confers on them. Certainly, like
in other developing countries where this economy
has taken off (Berg et al 2018), crowdwork has
been characterized by higher compensation levels
compared to other domestic opportunities, as well as
the absence of gender pay gaps (Bayudan-Dacuycuy
and Baje 2021). But perhaps even more decisive
has been the touted flexibility of platform-based
work and commerce (e.g. remote work, flexible
hours), which eases the trade-offs that women must
normally finesse between their traditional care roles
and their capacity to earn (Eviota 1992). Strikingly,
surveys of women crowdworkers in the Philippines
generally report flexibility and existing housework
responsibilities as among the leading motivations
for their engagement in platform work, whereas
men’s considerations focus more on their ability
to pursue new interests (ILS forthcoming; Soriano
2021; Bayudan-Dacuycuy and Baje 2021). In the
same vein, DICT statistics confirm that women’s
participation in e-commerce is mainly undertaken as
a supplementary source of income, with homemakers

and self-employed women comprising more than
one-third of female online sellers (Tabuga and
Cabaero 2021; Albert et al 2021).

Yet despite this “gender dividend”, the growth of
the sector has also elicited a growing number of
criticisms. As already mentioned, grave disparities
in access to ICT technologies have remained a
long-standing issue: in 2019, a mere 13 percent of all
barangays/villages in the Philippines were reported to
have had a full range of access to all ICT infrastructure
(Albert et al 2021). This has been paralleled by
dramatic education and skill-related disparities, with
only 39.8 percent of the population estimated to
have at least one of the ICT skills enumerated under
SDG Indicator 4.4.1 (ibid). However, increasingly
prominent have been the regulatory gaps pertaining
to the sector, most especially with respect to labor
policy, but also in areas such as cybersecurity, data
privacy, digital taxation, and the broader business
environment (World Bank 2020). Through dynamics
of “policy drift” (Thelen and Streeck 2005; Pierson
and Hacker 2010), the proliferation of non-standard
employment arrangements in the sector has facilitated

6

the expansion of precarious work and the general
casualization of labor (Ofreneo 2013; Carre 2020;
Soriano 2021), since crowdworkers and on-demand
workers are typically classified as contractors, self-
employed individuals, or independent service
providers (Hunt et al 2017; Garcia and Pacis 2019).
In fact, existing studies suggest that these labor
regulation gaps and their adverse effects on
employee protections are of greater concern to
women: according to a 2020 survey, the lack of
job security was the single biggest challenge that
women crowdworkers in the Philippines reported
experiencing (Tabuga and Baje 2021).

In addition to the access and regulatory gaps outlined
above, Filipino women’s historically disproportionate
care responsibilities (Eviota 1992) could also cancel
out the work flexibility and income-generating
opportunities available to them in the digital economy.
A PIDS study on Filipino women crowdworkers found
that their time on digital labor platforms decreased

2.2. The Problem of Place

Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine
government has taken significant steps towards
addressing these challenges. For one, the DICT has
launched a National Broadband Plan and Free Wifi-
for-All program to strengthen public internet access
in more remote regions of the country (DICT 2020),
as well as the digitaljobsPH initiative to deliver free
ICT training and capacity-building opportunities to
prospective platform sector workers (DICT 2021).
Additionally, as elaborated in the next section, the
Technical Education and Skills Development Authority
(TESDA) has dramatically expanded and strengthened
its TESDA Online Program (TOP) in the middle of the
pandemic (TESDA 2021; ADB 2021), even while there
have been legislative efforts to strengthen protections
for gig workers who are otherwise classified as self-
employed or independent contractors (Terrazola
2021; Fernandez 2021).

However, a consistent pattern that can be observed
from ongoing government initiatives as well as the
broader policy literature on the platform economy
is that they have tended to de-emphasize the
contributions that place-based, geographically-
embedded interventions can make in strengthening
the engagement of particular places and localities
with the sector. Not unlike the predictions of futurists
in the 1980s highlighting the submerging of face-to-
face interactions in “electronic networks and spaces”
(cf. Amin and Graham 1997), the “theory of change”

as their care duties increased, with time on the
platform dropping to zero beyond 3 hours of care
work (Bayudan-Dacuycuy and Baje 2021). With the
ongoing COVID-19 crisis hindering schools’ reopening
at all levels and a complete return to onsite work,
women’s unpaid care burdens have been escalating
from its pre-pandemic baseline (UNESCAP 2021).
Considering that Filipino women have been spending
up to 13 hours a day on such responsibilities during
the pandemic (Oxfam 2021), the tangible benefits
of platform work for most of them could very well
be minimal at best. These care responsibilities can
potentially affect women entrepreneurs’ e-commerce
performance as well—per the DICT’s 2019 National
ICT Household Survey (NICTHS), while more women
respondents compared to men are selling online,
the men appear to earn more, a finding which again
could be linked to the women’s greater share of care
and domestic work burdens in the home (Bayudan-
Dacuycuy 2020).

animating both international and national policy
approaches towards the sector appears premised on
the belief that once infrastructural and skills-related
barriers to participation are overcome, individuals
should be able to maximize the opportunities
available to them in the digital economy. In this, the
approach to promoting platform participation bear
striking similarities to “in the air” conceptions of the
development of urban innovation clusters (Capello
1999; Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose 2017), which assume
that learning and innovation spillovers proceed
automatically once the basic skills and infrastructural
determinants of knowledge-intensive production
are provided.

Though it is true that infrastructure and skill divides
are critical constraints to strengthening the sector’s
inclusivity, this approach risks missing out on the role
of spatially-specific factors in advancing the platform
sector, and the knowledge economy in general. Far
from being confined to the digital sphere, for instance,
in-person interactions among clusters of businesses
and skilled professionals have been found to be
crucial diffusion mechanisms for continuous learning
and innovation in the enterprise sphere (Scott 1998).
By being more closely located together, participants
in online platforms are better able to exchange
tacit knowledge, encourage common learning,
and facilitate the spread of incremental innovation
practices among their peers (Amin and Graham 1997).

7

PLACING THE PLATFORM ECONOMY
Similar research in urban economics has accentuated
how dense, in-person interactions contribute to
increased productivity among knowledge economy
workers by promoting exchanges of ideas and
information and human capital externalities (Glaser
and Gottlieb 2009). Most recently, comparative
political economists have echoed these very same
ideas in examining the increasing concentration
of multinational firms in geographically-embedded
skill clusters: rather than circumventing space, the
dynamics of knowledge-intensive production by such
enterprises are in fact increasingly confronted by the
need to “co-locate” skilled workers who can tap into
urban networks of only partly codified knowledge
and competencies (Iversen and Soskice 2019).

The validity of these arguments has been somewhat
affirmed in the latest research on the platform
economy. In reality, rather than spreading evenly to
areas where infrastructure gaps have been filled,
it appears that the platform economy has instead
expanded the most in areas that already hold
preexisting technological, political, economic, social,
and spatial advantages for the needs of intensive
platform activity (Graham and Anwar 2019). In other
words, rather than expanding without regard to
geography, the prospects for the platform sector’s
growth remain conditioned by localities that can boast
specific place-based advantages for e-commerce
and platform work, which include broader business
environment and institutional capabilities, as well
as the formation of dense economic networks of
learning, skill, and knowledge exchange (Goswami
et al 2012). In fact, the very need for more place-
based interventions to foster the development of the
platform economy is borne out by the Philippines’
most noteworthy historical success in advancing
knowledge-based, ICT-intensive industries: its
promotion of the BPO sector. Box 1 discusses a
number of place-based interventions that have been
undertaken to foster this sector’s growth in urban
areas around the country, and their connection
with the uptake of the platform sector within the
same localities in recent years. These place-based
efforts promoting the country’s world-renowned
BPO industry in its urban hubs remain to this day an
underappreciated source of positive spillovers for
the expansion of the Philippines’ platform economy.

BOX 1. Growth Lessons for

the Philippine Platform
Economy from BPO
Development in
“Next Wave Cities”

“The beauty of the BPO industry as a vehicle
for rural development is that a unit can be set
up as a greenfield project virtually anywhere. All
you need is a committed local government unit
(LGU) that is willing to put up the infrastructure.
Other industries, like tourism and agriculture,
are limited in terms of location.” This quote
by Microsoft Philippines’ National Technology
Officer Dondi Mapa, cited in a 2015 Oxford
Business Group analysis on the Philippines’
BPO industry, underscores the significance of
local government actors in the growth of one
of the country’s most prominent “sunshine”
sectors. As noted by the research cited and
case studies developed in this paper, the factors
that are presently advancing the Philippines’
digitalization—a workforce proficient in English
and comfortable with technology as well as a
functional ICT infrastructure, among others—
can be credited to the same strategies that
facilitated the expansion of the country’s BPO
industry. Apart from human capital and digital
infrastructure development, the examples
outlined below highlight the importance of
measures that leverage a more localized focus
in the industry’s growth, potentially serving as a
model for directing the trajectory of the domestic
platform economy.

The expansion of BPO companies beyond
the historical economic hubs of Metro Manila
and Cebu have played a critical role in the
Philippines’ long-standing dominance in the
industry (Oxford Business Group, 2015). Mindful
of the potential saturation problems that may
arise due to the concentration of BPO operations
in these two cities (Tholons, 2014), targeted
support by industry leaders and government
stakeholders such as DTI and DICT moved to
encourage BPO investments in areas designated
as “Next Wave Cities’’ (NWCs) in the mid-2010s
(Kleibert, 2014; Del Prado, 2015). Through this

2.3. Leveraging Local Government
for Localized Solutions

The strategies employed in advancing the BPO
industry as outlined in Box 1 can serve as a roadmap
for LGUs seeking to harness the opportunities of the
digital economy for their localities. Given how their
revenues—and, in turn, their responsibilities—are set
to expand due to the Mandanas transition beginning
in 2022, LGUs could be especially well-positioned
to design and deliver such place-based efforts that
can drive the sector’s growth. Box 2 below furnishes
additional details on the upcoming execution of
this EO.

initiative, NWCs such as Davao City in Mindanao
and Dumaguete City in the Visayas became
the focus of “ICT Roadshows’’ designed to
increase local stakeholders’ awareness on the
advantages the BPO industry could bring to
the local economy, as well as capacity-building
seminars aimed at enhancing local ICT expertise.
One notable example was the Rural Impact
Sourcing project, which delivered workshops
on ICT skills for virtual assistant jobs as a way
of fostering the digital and economic inclusion
of disadvantaged communities located at the
NWCs’ economic peripheries. The upskilling
focus of this project eventually served as
the blueprint for DICT’s digitaljobsPH, which
continues to provide free digital skills training
to aspiring platform workers primarily via the
Department’s regional offices.

National- and regional-level efforts alone may
prove insufficient, however, as illustrated by the
varying levels of BPO investment of Baguio City
in Luzon and Bacolod City in the Visayas, both
NWCs. A study analyzing how Bacolod attracted
twice the amount of investments as Baguio—
despite the latter initially exhibiting more positive
investment attributes (e.g. larger talent pool,
existing industrial zones, lower electricity
costs due to milder weather) than the former—
traces this outcome to the enabling conditions
(e.g. setting up an ICT park, creating an ICT-
focused school) Bacolod’s local government
constructed for the outsourcing companies
interested in operating in the city (Kleibert,
2014). In contrast, Baguio’s reception towards
potential investors was noticeably cooler, as local
actors’ concerns about the potential effects of
inward labor migration resulted in a lack of local
government support for BPO activity in the city,
which translated into concrete negative signals
such as the lack of adequate office space (ibid).
This example underlines the influence of local
institutional actors, whose agency in global
digitization processes can be often overlooked,
and the critical roles they play in co-shaping the
processes integrating their communities into the
worldwide digital economy.

PLACING THE PLATFORM ECONOMY
While the Mandanas ruling’s implementation stands
to give LGUs the fiscal resources that can position
them as leading actors in the advancement of the
Philippines’ platform sector, concerns surrounding
their absorptive and service delivery capacity deficits
(Diokno-Sicat 2020; World Bank 2021) point to
potential roadblocks. According to a 2021 survey
jointly conducted by the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) Philippines’ Pintig Lab and the
DILG that was distributed to the Philippines’ 1,715
provincial, city, and municipal LGUs, 59 percent of
the respondents indicated that they do not use any
digital systems to monitor their programs, projects,
and activities (Cruz and La Viña, 2022). This finding
highlights the primarily analog nature of approaches
to local governance in the country—likely to be a
critical constraint on many LGUs’ prospective efforts
to reap the gains of the digital economy. The survey
also found indications of geographical unevenness
in LGUs’ ICT system use, with significant disparities
among regions (for instance, 42 percent or almost half
of the Bicol region’s LGUs employ digital monitoring
tools, compared to 26.2 percent in Central Luzon and
22.7 percent in Eastern Visayas) and cities typically
more apt to digitalize their systems in comparison
to municipalities (ibid). These asymmetries in digital
transformation—which can signal LGU readiness in
advancing the digital economy—echo the research
cited in the previous section that emphasizes the
relevance of local factors in maximizing the country’s
prospects in the platform sector.

Ultimately, as Graham and Anwar (2019) argue, the
platform economy does not so much do away with
geography as instead leverage it. Beyond existing
discussions of the country’s persisting digital divide
and decent work deficits, policy approaches towards
developing its platform economy hence stand to
benefit from a more spatially-attuned understanding
of fostering economic clusters of areas, workers, firms,
and institutions within them to engage productively
with opportunities in the sector.

BOX 2. Executive Order 138 and
the transition process for

Local Government Units

The framework for the “full devolution” of
mandated responsibilities in Section 17 of the
Local Government Code (LGC) is outlined in
EO 138, series of 2021, which was released
by the Duterte administration following the
Supreme Court’s 2018 decision on the case
of Mandanas et al. v. Ochoa et al. (commonly
referred to as the Mandanas ruling) stipulating
the reallocation of responsibilities as well
as resources from national to subnational
government levels starting in 2022 (EO 138,
2021). The biggest shift in the Philippines’ local
governance framework since the passage of
Republic Act 7160 or the LGC of 1991, the EO
triggered a transition process for both national
government agencies (NGAs) and LGUs, which
includes the latter’s formulation of devolution
transition plans (DTPs) delineating how they will
assume the functions and infrastructure that the
former will devolve to them from 2022 to 2024.
The EO also requires the establishment of a
Growth Equity Fund to provide fiscal assistance
to “poor, disadvantaged, and lagging LGUs” as
well as a Committee on Devolution to oversee
the roll-out of the devolution process. In addition,
per the EO, LGUS are to develop a Capacity
Development Agenda (CDA) that will inform
the capacity-building interventions that will
be provided to them by the Department of
Interior and Local Government (DILG)’s Local
Government Academy as well as other NGAs
during the transition process.

Released on August 11, 2021 by DILG and the
Department of Budget and Management (DBM),
the Joint Memorandum Circular on Guidelines
for LGUs’ DTPs specifies the components of
these plans, which were to be submitted on
October 13 (barangays), November 12 (cities and
municipalities), and December 12 (provinces)
2021. Per the Circular, LGUs are to indicate (a) the
state of the functions, services, and facilities that
have already been devolved; (b) the projected
timeline of their assumption of the full devolution;
(c) their CDA; (d) the recommended modifications
to their Organizational Structure and Staffing
Pattern; (e) their resource mobilization strategy
and local revenue forecast; and (f) performance
targets for devolved services and functions.
Owing to the projected drop in National Tax
Allotment transfers to LGUs due to the COVID-19
pandemic along with other likely fiscal gaps, the
resource mobilization strategy was included
among the required information in the DTPs.

3. Facilitating Broader Engagement in the Platform Economy:
Case Studies

If place-specific interventions and/or investments
are crucial to ensuring the dynamism of clusters
of platform- or knowledge-based work, are such
patterns reflected in actual experiences in terms
of promoting more broad-based engagement with
the sector, particularly for women? As indicated
earlier, we assess this claim in greater detail via
a mixed-method research design that combines
case studies of local initiatives promoting greater
engagement in the platform economy with a
quantitative analysis of DICT’s 2019 NICTHS survey.
The case studies discussed in the following section
include the aforementioned TOP spearheaded by
TESDA; two women-led microenterprises that were

beneficiaries of DTI’s Kapatid Mentor Me (KMME), the
Department’s leading MSME development program;
and Virtualahan, a social enterprise expanding access
to platform work for marginalized demographics,
such as persons with disabilities (PWDs) and
indigenous peoples. Though these initiatives have
successfully delivered major opportunities for women
and marginalized groups to engage with digital
platforms, we nonetheless find that persistent socio-
spatial inclusion challenges highlight the need for
more dedicated place-based interventions, whether
in terms of in-person components, strengthened
logistics, and/or dedicated business support
measures.

3.1. Governance: TESDA Online Program (TOP)

Apart from employment and business activities,
another dimension of daily life that largely had
to be conducted remotely due to the pandemic
has been education (UNESCAP, 2021), including
in TVET. Yet unlike most of the country’s schools
which quickly had to devise their own digital learning
systems, TOP was already available online during the
Philippines’ first wave of lockdowns in 2020. First
launched in 2012, TOP enables registered users to
access free modules on various TVET courses via
the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) format;
completing a course will qualify them to take TESDA’s
National Certification (NC) assessments. According to
eTESDA program manager Jacqueline Ali, TOP was
originally envisioned as a way for the agency to reach
populations who traditionally encounter difficulties
in availing of TESDA’s on-site classes, such as single
parents and PWDs. But with almost 3.5 million users
(as of October 2021) and counting—more than double
since its initial launch—TOP has rapidly come to be
considered as TESDA’s flagship learning platform.

Per data from eTESDA, the division overseeing TOP,
the most in-demand courses on the platform since
the pandemic began are related to work that could
be feasibly conducted from home, such as culinary
arts (e.g. cookery, baking), entrepreneurship, and
specialized ICT skills (e.g. cloud administration). In a
May 2020 survey conducted by TESDA with 7,000
TOP users as respondents, results revealed that there
are more women users than men on the platform.
Furthermore, the survey found that TOP users are

generally college graduates working in urban areas
(chiefly in NCR and Regions 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8) whose
primary motivation for using TOP is for upskilling— a
finding consistent with previous research.

Yet despite the high level of women’s participation
in the program, the survey also revealed that they
generally recorded lower completion rates (i.e. less
timely completion pace or account abandonment)
compared to male users, which eTESDA officers
suspect may be due to women users’ need to juggle
domestic responsibilities. In addition to increasing the
number of priority courses, eTESDA is thus revising
TOP modules to be more “bite-size”, with the idea
that modules that can be accomplished in a shorter
amount of time can better accommodate the care
responsibilities that likely impede women’s progress
on the platform. Moreover, beyond TOP, the division is
also working with external partners to develop online
courses for “lifelong learning” and “21st century skills’’,
as outlined in the agency’s TVET PH 4.0 framework
designed to prepare Filipino workers for the Fourth
Industrial Revolution (TESDA 2020).

Despite TOP’s success in reaching millions of
Filipinos during the country’s periodic lockdowns,
as with education in general, online learning has
clear limitations for TVET. According to Chief TESD
Specialist Katherine Zarsadias of TESDA’s Policy
Research and Evaluation Division, considering the
general state of internet connectivity in the country,
the digital divide affects not only its students but

11

PLACING THE PLATFORM ECONOMY
its trainers as well, which hampers their overall
ability to teach effectively. For trades or professions
that are especially reliant on tactile learning (e.g.
welding, electrical installation) and tacit skills (e.g.
BPO customer service), online classes are helpful
up to a certain extent, but hands-on training is
essential to enable students to achieve mastery. The
in-person element is also crucial for the assessment
side of TESDA’s operations. Given how TESDA’s
NC credentials facilitate aspiring migrant Filipinos’
job applications overseas, the demand for these

certificates remained strong even at the height of the
country’s lockdowns, prompting TESDA to continue
with face-to-face NC assessments by adapting these
to comply with the required health protocols and
guidelines. Where regular in-person classes are not
yet possible, online training initiatives such as TOP
should therefore be complemented by place-based
efforts as much as it is possible, which is particularly
urgent for activities that cannot be properly mastered
in the home.

3.2. E-Commerce: Sandria’s Delicious Concept
and Audrey’s Confectioneries

A “Success Story” featured in DTI-Central Visayas
(Region 7)’s official webpage, Minglanilla, Cebu-based
Sandria Cadusale started Sandria’s Delicious Concept
(SDC) in 2010 on the strength of her signature
“barquiron” (barquillos-filled polvoron), which she
first started selling to friends and colleagues in
between her full-time government job. Thanks to
enthusiastic word-of-mouth that eventually reached
the DTI regional office, Ms. Cadusale was accepted
as a KMME mentee in 2018— the Department’s
main project for scaling promising micro-enterprises
across the country. Through the 6-month mentorship
program as well as free technical assistance from
various government agencies, Ms. Cadusale learned
the finer points of marketing, bookkeeping, and food
safety that enabled her to improve her product line
and gradually position them for exports. By early
2020, she was fielding inquiries from local and
overseas retailers for her products and had expanded
her personnel accordingly. Yet like nearly all micro-
and small enterprise owners in the country, the onset
of the COVID-19 pandemic required her to quickly
redirect her business’ trajectory. Although SDC was
already situated in the “essential” food industry,
Ms. Cadusale decided to expand its focus beyond
barquiron by diversifying into frozen foods, meat
products, and ready-to-eat meals, gaining supplier
contracts with government offices and private
companies that brought inrevenues comparable to
pre-pandemic levels.

In between navigating the new aspects of her
business, Ms. Cadusale participated in DTI-supported
initiatives aimed at facilitating MSMEs’ transition to
e-commerce during the pandemic. Through the
“E-Taas ang Pinay MSMEs’’ online training program
held from July to September 2020, Ms. Cadusale
and other women entrepreneurs throughout
the country learned about the fundamentals of
integrated digital marketing and received online

promotions for their brands on partner platforms. Ms.
Cadusale’s takeaways from this program as well as
her participation in virtual trade fairs amplified her
business’ online presence, drawing order inquiries
from supermarkets and resellers in the Philippines
and overseas (e.g. Japan, Canada, United Arab
Emirates, USA). However, although SDC’s official
website and social media pages have been useful
for marketing purposes, sales from its e-commerce
channels such as Shopee have been middling. For
Ms. Cadusale, this relatively low sales volume—along
with the mushrooming costs of internet connectivity
(as more of her operations moved online, she was
obliged to upgrade her internet package from a
personal to a business account, costing her nearly
PhP3,000 per month) and individual courier shipping
costs that drive down profits even further—makes
selling on e-commerce platforms secondary to her
overall business strategy.

Branching out into more “pandemic-proof” food
items has also been crucial for the Cebu City-based
Audrey’s Confectioneries, which was launched in
2013 by fellow KMME alumni Audrey Regis. Pre-
pandemic, Audrey’s Confectioneries’ caramel-
flavored dried mango line—a twist on one of Cebu
City’s biggest exports—were mainly sold at an
upscale supermarket’s branches nationwide and at
the Mactan-Cebu and Ninoy Aquino international
airports, with the airport sales comprising 50
percent of the business’ monthly total profits. By
early 2020, Audrey’s Confectioneries was ordering
new packaging and exhibiting at trade shows
abroad in preparation for product exports, which
was facilitated by the commercial exposure and
specialized assistance the business has received
since Ms. Regis’ participation in KMME’s 2018 run.
But with the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020,
the abrupt reduction of travel and tourism-related
activities throughout the country depressed foot

12

traffic at Audrey’s Confectioneries’ usual points of
sale. The steep drop in the business’ revenues
due to the strong association her enterprises with
the tourism sector obliged Ms. Regis to tap into her
savings, let go of non-production staff, and develop
new product lines that are likely to be more viable
in the ongoing pandemic context.

Like Ms. Cadusale, Ms. Regis participated in the
“E-Taas ang Pinay MSMEs” online training program.
By this time, she had been able to secure a loan from
DTI’s Small Business Corporation to help finance the
production of frozen vegetable samosas to be sold
in Cebu supermarkets; she would eventually add
Cebu chorizos (spicy sausages) to her product line in
2021. Applying the e-commerce sales and marketing
techniques Ms. Regis learned from the MSME online
training programs helped maintain distributor interest

3.3. Platform Work: Virtualahan

Established in 2015 in Davao City following
founder Ryan Gersava’s difficulties in finding formal
employment as a PWD, Virtualahan is a social
enterprise that provides marginalized jobseekers
(e.g. solo parents, former inmates) with 5 weeks of
online training on digital marketing and other relevant
ICT skills, with the goal of helping them find work
on digital labor platforms. Nearly a decade since its
launch, approximately 50 percent of Virtualahan’s
500-strong graduates have been finding crowdwork
jobs on platforms (e.g. Upwork, Onlinejobs.ph), 30
percent have been employed by partner companies
such as Accenture, and the remaining 20 percent
work with Virtualahan or are undergoing various
apprenticeships. In a focus group discussion
(FGD) conducted with four of Virtualahan’s women
graduates, they highlighted the flexibility of platform
work as its main advantage, reflecting the research
on the sector’s gendered dynamics outlined above.
Platform as well as (primarily home-based) BPO work
enable them to earn income while working remotely
and/or at their own pace—an arrangement that can
better accommodate their personal circumstances
and/or care responsibilities compared to the typical
employment structures in the Philippines.

Despite these opportunities, however, certain
structural and place-based constraints that
Virtualahan women graduates experience appear
to tangibly delimit their career options in platform
work. Per Community Development and Human
Resources Head Rose Villamor, many of them feel
compelled to accept the first job available in order
to provide for their dependents as soon as possible,
giving them a smaller range of options which could

in Audrey’s Confectioneries’ caramel-flavored dried
mangoes, including from a major international retailer.
Yet like with SDC, the low volume of individual
e-commerce sales as well as the outsize shipping
costs exacerbated by the pandemic made online
orders unsustainable for the business overall. As of
February 2022, Audrey’s Confectioneries diversified
its operations to include a bakery in addition to
the samosa and chorizo production, which have
collectively generated enough revenues to keep
its production personnel employed. For Ms. Regis,
e-commerce in itself does not appear to be suitable
for tourism-oriented and non-essential products like
her mango delicacies, and until the pandemic-related
travel restrictions ease, diversifying into products that
are more reliably in-demand are critical for MSMEs’
survival at this time.

reduce their total earnings over time. The frequent
inability of graduates who are mothers to accept
full-time remote opportunities is also a common
scenario, owing to the need to care for children
during the day, leaving the night shift as their only
viable option which in turn negatively affects their
health. In addition to these, they still have to contend
with the long-standing issues generally encountered
by Virtualahan graduates, such as burdensome
treatment costs for PWD-related ailments and
significant internet connectivity expenses that are
necessary for their digital work; as Ms. Villamor notes,
the need for reliable ICT infrastructure explains why
the vast majority of Virtualahan graduates reside in
metropolitan areas.

To mitigate these problems, the Virtualahan team
provides job coaching assistance and organizes
community-based peer support networks, which help
transmit the tacit knowledge that can enhance its
graduates’ prospects in platform work. Virtualahan’s
sustained networking with local actors also serves to
expand their graduates’ employment options (such
as in regional BPO branches) as well as to expand
their reach beyond their established hubs in Davao
and NCR. According to Ms. Villamor, Mr. Gersava’s
active outreach to the Cebu and Marawi city LGUs
culminated in the 2019 workshop conducted for
Lapu-Lapu City Jail inmates and in the 2021 training
for students who experienced the siege of Marawi in
2017. Through such outreach work, Virtualahan helps
equip underrepresented groups in the country with
the ICT skills necessary to enable them to benefit
from the Philippines’ growing digital economy.

PLACING THE PLATFORM ECONOMY

4. Beyond the Digital Divide:
Empirical Analysis

The case studies outlined in the previous section drive home the point that the platform sector’s dynamics
remain subject to socio-spatial disparities that overlap with—but can be distinct from—the digital divide. Even
while the TOP and Virtualahan are extending learning opportunities on engaging with platform work to millions
of Filipinos, its own proponents attest to the need for in-person learning for tacit skills and tactile knowledge
that require either a physical or social presence. Similarly, against the much-ballyhooed opportunities that
e-commerce has been augured to offer for microenterprises such as DTI-KMME beneficiaries SDC and
Audrey’s Confectioneries, the promise of digital platforms remains circumscribed by spatial constraints,
such as logistical costs as well as embeddedness in sectors where activities cannot be readily digitized (e.g.
tourism). In this section, we complement these insights with more general evidence of trends in platform
participation in the Philippines. For this, we examine trends from DICT’s 2019 NICTHS as well as separate
waves of Facebook’s Global Survey of Small Business (GSOSB) conducted in 2021.

4.1. Disparities in Digital Access

As DICT’s 2019 NICTHS was designed to be a
representative sample of household trends in
ICT usage down to the regional level, we begin
by providing regional-level descriptives. In this
respect, Figure 4 generally confirms what is known
about disparities in ICT access as well as economic
development and urbanization: the 32.3 percent
share of households with internet access in
Metro Manila (NCR) is more than six times that of

the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim
Mindanao (BARMM)7 at 5.1 percent, with regions that
tend to boast greater internet access typically being
located on Luzon island (NCR, III, CAR, IV-A, I, II),
followed by the regions in the Visayas (VIII, VII, VI) and
Mindanao (XII, CARAGA, X, XI, and BARMM) island
groups. In general, more urbanized and economically-
developed regions tend to have better internet
connectivity at the household level.

FIGURE 4. Share of Household Internet Access by Region, 2019

7 BARMM refers to the poorest region of the Philippines, where the country’s Muslim population is predominantly concentrated.

15

PLACING THE PLATFORM ECONOMY
However, the estimated national household rate of access to the internet is only 15.7 percent. This number
is less than half of previous estimates of the number of households with some form of internet connection,
which had previously been pegged at around 43 percent (Quimba 2020; World Bank 2020). Indeed, placed
in substantive context, a household rate of access to the internet of 32.3 percent in Metro Manila already
falls below levels that one might otherwise expect from the most affluent area within the country. Even the
equivalent figure for individual (as opposed to household) internet usage indicates a national usage level
of roughly 37.4 percent, which remains below previously calculated levels. This suggests that the level of
disparities in digital infrastructure access may have been underestimated in previous studies.

FIGURE 5. Share of Individuals with Online Buying/Selling Account by Region

Share with Online Buying/Selling Account (%)

Source: Authors, DICT-NICTHS

These disparities in internet connectivity are closely
associated with the share of individuals with accounts
for buying and selling on digital platforms. Though
the NICTHS does not have dedicated questions
asking whether individuals engaged in crowdwork or
on-demand work, it does feature a section focused
on the extent and form of respondents’ participation
in e-commerce activity, a regional-level summary of
which is provided in Figure 5. Overall, the national
rate of participation in the e-commerce sector (as
of end-2019) appeared to be rather low, and—to
a greater extent than household internet access—
skewed towards the country’s leading economic

growth poles. Only around 10 percent of individuals
reported holding an account for buying and/or selling
goods and services online, with Greater Manila
(NCR, IV-A, and III) leading the regions, followed by
CAR (where Baguio City is located, see Box 1) and
Region VII (where Metro Cebu is located). As with the
internet connectivity figures, Luzon-based regions
generally performed best, followed by the Visayas,
and then Mindanao, with the Zamboanga Peninsula
(Region IX) and BARMM featuring the lowest rates
nationwide. Indeed, the rates of account ownership in
Metro Manila are more than 12 times that in BARMM.

16

4.2. The need for place-based interventions

At first glance, these manifestations of the digital divide appear to indicate that addressing internet (and by
extension, digital platform) access gaps and skills deficits are among the most crucial interventions needed
to enable broader-based participation in the Philippines’ digital economy. Yet ICT access and skills, while
a necessary condition for platform participation, are hardly sufficient ones. As has already been pointed
out, the country’s experiences in fostering the BPO sector and other ICT-intensive industries suggest that
broader place-based interventions to transform localities into digitally-connected clusters of economic
activity have a crucial role to play in realizing such potential.

To provide evidence of this point, we partly replicate the analysis of Albert et al (2021)8, which examined
the correlates of NICTHS individual respondents’ engagement with online selling/e-commerce, but also
investigate the correlates for online buying. We include practically the same set of variables employed by
the aforementioned study, but also add whether the household of individual respondents had any kind of
computer.

8 Albert et al (2021) undertake a logistic regression, with individual engagement in online entrepreneurship as their dependent variable, and gender, age, age squared,
marital status, household head status, completion of an ICT course, completion of basic education, completion of college, access to internet, and residence in an
urban area as their explanatory variables.

Selling and Buying for Women and Men, Urban Areas*

Source: Authors, using NICTHS data

Our resulting statistical estimates are substantively
similar to that estimated by Albert et al (2021).
In general, a respondent’s gender has a strong
significant relationship with engagement in online
buying and selling. As shown in Table 1 above, a
typical female respondent in an urban area basically
has a 1.2 percent chance of being someone engaged
in online selling, while a typical male only has a
0.9 percent chance. The gap is even wider with
respect to participation in online buying, with the
typical woman in an urban area having a 5.9 percent

chance of using digital platforms for purchasing
goods and services, whereas the equivalent figure
for men is 4.0 percent. In Figure 6, we should note
that this association between women and increased
platform participation is robust even when we re-
randomize the NICTHS dataset (using non-parametric
bootstrapping). This trend is in line with what has
already been mentioned about women’s slightly
greater rates of participation in the platform economy,
though overall levels of participation are visibly low.

18

FIGURE 7. 95% Confidence Intervals of Estimated Effects of Improving Internet,

Digital Skills, and Computer Access on e-Commerce Participation

Source: Authors, using NICTHS data

How would bridging the most prominent
manifestations of the digital divide affect these
low rates of participation? In Figure 7, we show
the results of a simulation where we predicted the
effects of fully remedying the digital divide for all
individuals nationwide (i.e. all survey respondents)
without household access to internet and computers,
and without digital skills training (referred to in
the NICTHS as the completion of a short ICT
training course). In both panels of the figure, the
bars demarcate our confidence intervals of the
effect of fully addressing a particular digital divide
dimension on individuals’ engagement in either online
selling (left panel) or online buying (right panel). As
can be seen, addressing the digital divide has a
significant effect on inducing online buying behavior,
with computer access enhancement providing an
average improvement in individual online buying
activity nationwide by about 7.8 percent, internet
access by 6.3 percent, and digital skills training by
around 2.8 percent. In practice, these increases more
than double the women and men’s chances to buy
products and services online, as shown in Table 1.

Yet relative to online buying, the figures for
improvements on the selling side of e-commerce
are minuscule: fully addressing the digital divide

for household computer access leads, on average,
to an increase in the chance of engaging in online
selling by only 1.3 percent, 1.5 percent for internet
connection, and 1.2 percent for digital skills. Given
the considerable resources that need to be spent by
the public and private sector (as well as households)
to be able to address such divides in the first place,
this increase seems to be a low return-on-investment
in terms of the effect generated. While the NICTHS
itself does not have any data related as to whether
respondents were recipients of other government
programs and initiatives, these surprisingly minor
effects of bridging the digital divide on catalyzing
increased online entrepreneurship can be viewed
as suggesting that while addressing this divide is a
necessary condition for promoting e-commerce, other
measures are needed to facilitate more productive
engagement by individuals in the platform sector. As
we have previously pointed out, the Philippines’ track
record with the BPO sector could provide a more
appropriate framework in promoting the platform
economy, specifically in terms of advancing local
economic clusters of entrepreneurs and professionals
and the formation of supportive knowledge networks
by means of place-based interventions.

The importance of place-based interventions
based on more careful analysis of local conditions
is likewise highlighted by high levels of the likely
effect of closing the digital divide on e-commerce
at a regional level. Reanalyzing the regression
model used for generating Table 1 as well as
Figures 6 and 7, but this time using a specification
which allows for varying-effects across regions9,
we find that the effect of closing the digital divide
will be most pronounced in regions that already
have dense economic activity. In general, Figure 8
above shows that the region-specific effects of fully
addressing the digital divide for internet access,
computer access, and digital skills on online selling
are comparable to those found in Figure 7: in most
regions, the increase in probability in participation in
online selling only amounts to about one percentage
point. However, we also observe number of positive
outliers, where completely addressing the digital
divide promises to have a magnified effect on online

entrepreneurship, such as Region IV-A (for internet
access), NCR (for computer access), and Regions
III and IV-A (for digital skills). While our specification
does not allow us to say whether the increased
economic development of these outlier regions
is exactly what is driving this greater effect, it is
nonetheless consistent with our argument and the
historical experience of the Philippine BPO sector.
Increasing the take-up of the platform economy,
though obviously relying on the availability of digital
infrastructure and skills, will also hinge on promoting
local economic dynamism and business activity.
These general trends in which platform economy
participation dynamics differ dramatically from region-
to-region (generally appearing more pronounced in
economically developed ones) attests to the need
for more context- and locally-informed economic
measures that have been thus far discussed in the
existing policy literature on the sector.

9 Specifically, we use a non-linear mixed effect specification with region-varying coefficients.

An important caveat to the empirical results just
presented in this section is that they have mostly
been based on the 2019 NICTHS, and that the onset
of the COVID-19 pandemic may have substantially
altered some of our trends and results. Yet while it
is true that many businesses have shifted more of
their operations online, this has hardly meant that
e-commerce has become MSMEs’ most important
source of revenues. In fact, as shown by Figure 9,
the opposite appears to be true based on Philippine
data from Facebook’s 2021 Global State of Small
Business (GSOSB) survey: both during February
2021 (when the country was under more relaxed

lockdown restrictions) as well as in August 2021
(when Greater Manila was again placed under the
most restrictive community quarantine category), a
decisive majority of small business respondents to the
GSOSB survey received less than 50 percent of their
business revenues from digital platforms, with the
largest share of firms having no such platform-based
returns whatsoever. These trends more than one
year after the pandemic’s onset affirm the continuing
significance of place-based interventions that can
support business efforts, not only to more effectively
leverage platform opportunities, but also sustain their
brick-and-mortar sales.

The importance of this approach is further reinforced
by examining enterprise responses as to their
digitalization plans in the August 2021 wave of
the GSOSB. While the majority (49.1 percent) of
the local MSMEs surveyed reported planning to
use in-person and digital operations in roughly the
same measure, it is also worth noticing that these
firms’ preferences remained tilted towards using
only in-person operations (16.8 percent). Certainly,
there remains about one-fourth of respondents
who expressed interest to move towards more
digital-heavy operations, but this means that, if such
business plans were to be realized, the great majority
of businesses would continue to have sizable in-
person functions. In other words, while the COVID-19
pandemic has indeed nudged the Philippine MSME
sector to increasingly adopt digital strategies as a
coping measure, these survey results indicate that
in-person and place-based operations will remain
a critical—if not the most pervasive— form of MSME
activity for the foreseeable future.

5. Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has driven game-changing shifts for the Philippine economy, with digital platforms
having emerged as a crucial socioeconomic lifeline and service delivery mechanism in leading economic
hubs across the country. As various observers have argued, this digital transformation harbors significant
gender-equalizing opportunities for women’s work and entrepreneurship—yet substantial barriers to the
realization of these opportunities continue to exist. To this end, this paper has emphasized how interacting
spatial and socioeconomic divides in the Philippines’ economic geography have thus far limited the
“inclusivity dividends” that have been reaped thus far in the country’s ongoing digital transformation. Our
case studies of efforts in delivering ICT skills development online (TOP and Virtualahan) and in facilitating
women-led MSMEs transition to e-commerce (DTI-Region 7’s KMME) reveal striking space-related barriers
that continue to impede equitable access to the platform sector’s socioeconomic opportunities. Indeed,
a common theme that has emerged from these cases has been the need to conceive and approach the
rapidly-expanding platform economy not in dichotomous (i.e. digital versus analog) terms, but rather with
respect to the dynamics and features of their geographic embeddedness.

21

PLACING THE PLATFORM ECONOMY
A crucial assumption motivating much recent policy
initiatives promoting the platform economy in
the Philippines has been that the most pressing
constraint for equalizing access to its economic
opportunities has been the country’s persistent
digital divides, manifested in terms of access to ICT
infrastructure, technologies, and skills. Though true
to an extent, the results of our empirical analysis
suggest that ameliorating digital disparities, by itself,
will not address other critical conditions needed
for strengthening access to the sector by social
groups that are already disadvantaged by the
Philippines’ broader socio-spatial inequalities. Due
to geographically-related disparities that can only be
addressed in the medium-term, as well as sector-,
skill-, locality-, and even firm-specific differences on
activities and processes that can be readily digitized,
significant areas and demographics within the country
remain unable to transition fluidly and/or fully into the
digital economy. This behooves a more fine-grained,
place-based approach towards the promotion of
the platform economy and socioeconomic inclusion
initiatives related to it—one that can more deftly
integrate digital and non-digital activities across
different sectors as well as facilitate better access to
the sector within sub-national economic clusters of
enterprises, professionals, and networks. As noted
earlier, the 2022 Mandanas transition, if managed
effectively, stands to equip LGUs with the resources
that can enable them to advance such approaches
in their respective localities.

To be able to realize the gains of the burgeoning
platform economy, both national and local policymakers
as well as their partners in the private sector and the
development community would be well-advised to
pursue the following measures:

• Reform social protection schemes: while the
flexibility of platform work has been a major
draw for women who are also saddled with
care and household responsibilities, the lack
of social protection coverage for those in the
sector unduly exposes them to labor market
uncertainties, with women being especially
vulnerable to such dynamics (as highlighted
by the Virtualuahan FGD participants). Indeed,
while Republic Act 7699 or the Portability Law
aims to establish a unified social security system

•

nationwide, allowing for portable social security
benefits from private and government sources,
a wide range of work undertaken on digital
platforms is not sufficiently formal for men and
women undertaking such “crowdwork” or “gig
work” to access such protection schemes
(Dacuycuy and Baje 2021).

To mitigate such risks while better allowing them
to adjust to market fluctuations, government can
furnish and/or expand unemployment insurance
programs, which will furnish platform workers with
income to smoothen periods of insecurity while
also supporting the reskilling and/or upskilling
activities that likely need to be undertaken in
between jobs (TESDA 2020). These programs
can be funded from various sources, including
both tax and non-tax contributions, and can also
be administered via online platforms to more
directly reach those already involved in the digital
economy. Creating insurance schemes that
combine both contributory and non-contributory
systems, and that cover both unemployment
protection and upskilling needs, seem promising
options to overcoming the lack of enrollments
of platform workers on existing social protection
schemes (ibid).

• Provide care services: as mentioned in this
report, a major reason why women in particular
are drawn to platform work—yet are also unable
to maximize its dividends—are their persisting
care responsibilities. Helping them meet these
responsibilities by means of dedicated public
services as well as other “care-sensitive” policy
measures (UNESCAP 2021) are hence imperative
to enhancing economic inclusion in the platform
sector. Among others, strengthening child care
services, promoting uptake of remote working
arrangements, and encouraging different
government agencies and LGUs to recognize
unpaid care work in planning and budgeting
processes are immediate steps forward that can
be taken on this front (ibid).

• Recognize platform workers as workers:
while there have been attempts in recent
years to reform labor laws to accommodate
crowdwork, such as House Bill 8817 (“The

24

Freelance Workers Protection Act”), there appear
to have been no legislative breakthroughs as of
February 2022 in recognizing crowdworkers
as workers with rights to organize and with
access to entitlements afforded to other types
of workers (e.g. hazard pay). Recognizing that
crowdworkers are employees would also permit
the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE)
to intervene on behalf of gig economy workers
(e.g. delivery riders) in the case of labor disputes,
as well as enable platform workers in general to
organize with trade unions and secure collective
bargaining agreements. Beyond these, it is also
crucial for government to look into strengthening
labor rights protections for emerging types of
platform workers (e.g. domestic workers who
are also participating in platform work), such as
by amending the Kasambahay Law and other
relevant legislation (Garcia and Pacis 2019).

Enhance skills development programs: due to
its technical requirements, addressing gaps in the
existing stock of skills needed to engage in the
digital economy in addition to promoting general
digital literacy is crucial to addressing lingering
inclusivity gaps in the sector. Though already
an urgent national priority prior to the COVID-19
pandemic, the public health and economic crisis
that has triggered the widespread displacement
of jobs and businesses has made facilitating
the acquisition of such technical skills even
more imperative. Certainly, as the examples of
TESDA’s TOP and DICT’s digitaljobsPH initiatives
demonstrate, it has been possible to sustain—if
not expand—such skills development and training
systems even in the midst of the pandemic.
Building on such programs and extending new
training opportunities via digital platforms can and
should be a part of the government’s strategy
for making the platform economy more inclusive.

•

• Yet to be able to reach more disadvantaged and
isolated groups and to strengthen training in
areas that are less amenable to digital delivery,
“blended” versions of these programs can be
piloted and rolled-out with LGUs, as well as
the regional bureaus of national government
agencies. At minimum, the government may want

to explore maximizing the digital connectivity
opportunities afforded by the “Free Wi-Fi for
All” hotspots in LGUs across the country to
reach less-connected demographics, while
simultaneously building on the remote learning
approaches that have been experimented with
since the pandemic’s onset. To ensure that such
initiatives also address gender gaps in skills,
measures can also be taken to maximize the
women’s participation in skills training areas that
have previously been tilted towards men, such
as in data management and analysis, modeling
and simulation, and use of statistical software
(Albert et al 2021).

• Develop local economic clusters for the digital
economy: the Philippines’ landmark success in
diffusing the BPO industry to the country’s “Next
Wave Cities” (now known as “Digital Cities” in an
ongoing initiative conducted jointly by DICT and
the IT and Business Process Association of the
Philippines) illustrates the historical contribution
of spatially-attuned and place-based efforts
in encouraging the spread of knowledge
economy opportunities beyond the Philippines’
metropolitan cores. Government programs
aiming to leverage the platform economy as
a vehicle for economic inclusion can adopt a
similar approach, emphasizing the development
of local e-commerce and freelancing clusters
that are supported by a range of supportive
infrastructure and services. To illustrate, the
implementation of DTI’s KMME program in Region
7 provides some indication of how this can be
achieved by LGUs for e-commerce, in addition
to accelerating MSMEs’ digital development by
promoting a better local business environment
and increasing their ease-of-doing-business
via the adoption of MSME- and startup-friendly
policies and services. In terms of advancing high-
level skills, Virtualahan’s track record in placing
its graduates in ICT-intensive jobs attests to how
community-based support can strengthen the
accessibility of crowdworking for marginalized
groups, thereby boosting their localities’ capacity
to participate in the digital economy.
