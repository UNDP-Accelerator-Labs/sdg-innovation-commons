## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Find innovative mobile solutions with solar energy for small street/ informal businesses carried out by most vulnerable (youths and women)                                           
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that many youths and women in Cameroon to earn their living, they have small street business. Due to lack suistainable of energy solutions, sometime their encounter, many losses and we need to find a solution for this.    

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

According to officials’ data coming from the Central Bureau of Census and Population Studies (BUCREP) of Cameroon and stated by the National Institute of Statistics of Cameroon (INS) inside it report on the characteristics of the population, the Cameroonian population in 2019 was estimated at 24,348,241 people, 50.6% of whom were women. The same report stated that 63,7% of this population are youths between 0 and 24 years old. Those populations group are at the same time those who are less represented in the different sphere of decision making and are often marginalized and unemployed, which are source of vulnerability. That is why some youths become street youths, for instance, it is estimated that there are more than 7,000 street youths (men and women facing houselessness and lack of employment) in Cameroon, the vast majority of whom are between the ages of 15 and 25. Between men and women there also a huge gap in term access to decent employments. For example, according to the Global Gender Gap Report 2022 of the World Economic Forum (WEF), 90,1% of women workers are in the informal sector. So, must of the working population of those target groups are in the informal sector. Some of them have small street business selling usual products. Women have generally fixed positions and youths are generally mobile in the streets. But all of them encounter the issue of conservation of perishable products and insecurity for those working at nights, due to lack adaptable source of energy. This yield often the time loss of products, decease of income that have that automatically increase their vulnerability. We have the hypothesis that if there is a mobile solution using solar energy, this can help address this issue and help enhance the resilience of those vulnerable youths and women. 

        

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The added value that our Accelerator lab is bringing to solve this challenge is that we will use innovative methods and tools like collective intelligence and prototyping to better assess and address this challenge, which involve unusual development actors.   

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

In short, our challenge is to help vulnerable people like street youths and women to strengthening their resilience though better conservation of their products and more security of their small business with mobile sultion using solar energy.

## Learning questions
****

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What is the most suitable and suistainable energy solution for small street business for youths and women ? 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

 To answer the learning question, those methods and tools will be using to better asses the pain and understand well the challenges of those youth and women (using of sensemaking), identified potential available solutions (using solution mapping) and develop/customized the most suitable solution (using co-creation and prototyping). 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is not enough official information on street youths and actors of the informal sector. So those new data sources could help to address those GAPS. 
## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Local authorities (mayors) with their municipalities can benefit for this work. The Ministry in charge of the urban development (MINHDU) can benefit also because one of it missions is "preparing and implementing integrated social development strategies of the various urban centres", better managing small street business can contribute to this mission. The CO can also benefit, because the solution can be scale-up and contribute to socio-economic inclusion for youth and women and help to achieve the UN key principle "Leave no one behind."
