COVID-19
Response in Iraq

Update #5: April 2020-March 2021

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In line with UNDP’s Global Integrated Response and the WHO Iraq Strategic
Preparedness and Response Plan, UNDP launched the project “Support for the
COVID-19 Response in Iraq” in April 2020. To ensure agile, quality implementation
in a rapidly evolving operational context, UNDP leveraged existing mechanisms and
in-house resources to support its COVID-19 response in Iraq. The implementation
of UNDP’s COVID-19 response has relied on the operational platforms of the
Funding Facility for Stabilization (FFS), the Iraq Social Cohesion Programme and
the UNDP Iraq Accelerator Lab. This report recaps cumulative progress one year
since the Project’s initiation.

Since COVID-19 was first detected in Iraq in March 2020, the level of spread in
the country showed a steady increase until mid-year. Fluctuations took place dur-
ing the third quarter, with a downward trend in new cases by the fourth quarter.
The beginning of 2021, too, saw a decline in the number of COVID-19 cases in
Iraq. However, the trend reversed with a second wave of confirmed cases from
February to March. The trend continued well into April. At the end of March, Iraq
had 41,043 new COVID-19 cases (see Figures 1 and 2),1 with the highly contagious
SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant (previously known as “B.1.1.7”) considered to be spread-
ing widely in the country, with an increased impact on younger Iraqis.

To curb the steep increase in COVID-19 cases, Iraqi au-
thorities reimposed restrictions and curfews in mid-Feb-
ruary 2021. In early March, Iraq began its vaccination
campaign and received the first round of COVID-19 vac-
cines through the COVAX Facility later that month.

UNDP has made progress in its support to selected
healthcare facilities. By the end of March 2021, rehabilita-
tion works were completed in Anbar (Fallujah and Rama-
di), Babil (Hillah), Basra, Dhi Qar (Nasriya), Diyala (Baquba),
Dohuk, Karbala, Kirkuk, Maysan (Amara), Najaf, Ninewa
(Mosul) and Tikrit, creating a total capacity of 240 beds
to treat COVID-19 patients. An estimated 5,002 patients
(2,098 women) have been treated in the facilities.

The procurement and provision of medical equipment and
essential personal protective equipment (PPE) for all lo-
cations is underway. 180 ventilators and patient monitors,
ten defibrillators and 180 aspirators have been delivered
to eight healthcare facilities. A total of 17,952 N95 respira-
tors have been provided to facilities in eight governorates.
Given the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in Iraq,
and specific needs in the governorates, UNDP expand-
ed its support to Sulaymaniyah and Wasit. Additionally, in
Dhi Qar, additional rehabilitation needs have also been
identified. By the end of the reporting period, UNDP was
supporting a total of 19 healthcare facilities across 17 gov-
ernorates.

The “Corona in Iraq” awareness platform launched in
April 2020 continues to be operational. The platform
was redesigned after its initial rollout and has recorded
a total of 211,139 cumulative views.

Furthermore, the Karbala ‘Spatial Data Infrastructure’
(SDI) system supported by UNDP in 2020 continued to
be operational. The system provides analytical data re-
quired to enable improved decision-making processes.

The post-COVID-19 Socioeconomic Response Plan
(SERP) for Iraq was formulated in 2020 with UNDP tech-
nical support, leveraging its integrator role to support
the UN Resident Coordinator and bring together the UN
Development System (UNDS). In coordination with the
UN System in Iraq, UNDP continued its socioeconom-
ic assessments to identify the impact of COVID-19 and

the fall in oil prices on key sectors and vulnerable pop-
ulations in Iraq. By the end of the reporting period, five
policy papers had been launched.

UNDP has completed an additional review of the pro-
ject’s implementation status. With the continued spread
of COVID-19 in Iraq, UNDP extended the project’s oper-
ational timeframe until 31 December 2021. This excep-
tional extension will allow UNDP to complete the ongo-
ing rehabilitation work in healthcare facilities (including
work in Sulaymaniyah and Wasit), and complete the pro-
curement and delivery of medical equipment and furni-
ture for the remaining locations.

UNDP continues to recognise the implementation chal-
lenges and risks posed by such an evolving context.
These are reflected in an updated Project Risk Analysis
(Annex 1).

UNDP has also seized opportunities across its Country
Office to provide additional support to pandemic re-
sponse and recovery. The initiatives, which are imple-
mented by existing projects beyond UNDP’s dedicated
COVID-19 response project, are described on Page 7.

UNDP has supported the operationalisation of two online platforms to raise
awareness of COVID-19 and facilitate the monitoring of new cases.

Launched in April 2020, the “Corona in Iraq” platform remained operational
during the reporting period. The platform focuses on (i) raising awareness on the
symptoms and risks of, as well as combat misinformation about, the COVID-19
virus; (ii) offering a symptom tracker to encourage users to seek appropriate
medical advice; and (iii) providing a geographical overview of emerging COV-
ID-19 hotspots.

The “Corona in Iraq” platform was established in partnership with the Govern-
ment of Iraq (GOI) Commission on Media and Communication and UNICEF.
UNDP coordinated with the Ministry of Health and Environment, Commission on
Media and Communication, WHO and UNICEF to inform the guidance and public
information provided through the platform.

At the end of March 2021, there have been 211,139 cumulative views of the online
platform, exceeding the target set when the platform was designed. The symp-
tom tracker also continued to be used. The redesign of the platform, reorganisa-
tion of information and new branding was completed in Q4 2020, together with
an online awareness campaign conducted in partnership with Asiacell. These
efforts contributed to increasing interest in the symptom tracker, demonstrated
by a 13 percent increase in visits to the platform.

The Karbala ‘Spatial Data Infrastructure’ (SDI) supported by UNDP in 2020 to
track and trace COVID-19 using modern geographic information system (GIS)
technologies continues to be used by the Karbala Governorate.

Priority equipment is being provided to the Central Laboratories in Anbar, Dohuk
and Erbil to enhance their capacity to process COVID-19 tests, relieving the bur-
den on Iraq’s Central Lab in Baghdad and, overall, expediting testing times. The
equipment includes the critical RT Polymerase Chain Reaction - PCR machine (3)
and Biosafety Cabinet Class II (6). The procurement of the laboratory equipment
is being undertaken in coordination with the Ministries of Health and was at the
final stages of review by the end of March 2021.

Leveraging UNDP’s procurement systems, the provision of PPE continues to
progress despite global supply chain and logistical challenges. Progress has
been made in the distribution of part of the PPE package, while additional
procurements continue. A cumulative total of 17,952 N95 respirators have been
delivered to 8 governorates (Anbar, Basra, Diyala, Dohuk, Karbala, Najaf, Nine-
wa and Salah al-Din). 43,200 surgical gowns and 96,000 pieces of gloves have
been procured through UNDP’s Global Procurement Unit (GPU) and delivered to
Iraq, with distribution taking place in April. An additional contract was signed to
procure components of the PPE package for 13 healthcare facilities in 12 gover-
norates. This includes protective goggles, face shields, scrubs, N95 respirators,
gowns, hand sanitizer, and sterile and non-sterile gloves.

Since initiating UNDP’s response offer, adapting to the evolved needs, as of
March 2021, 19 designated healthcare facilities were identified in the 17 targeted
governorates of Anbar (2 locations3), Basra, Babil, Dhi Qar (2 locations4), Diyala,
Dohuk, Diwaniya, Erbil, Karbala, Kirkuk, Missan, Muthanna, Najaf, Ninewa, Salah
al-Din, Sulaymaniyah and Wasit. UNDP identified these facilities in coordination
with the Ministry of Health and local authorities. The facilities are being support-
ed through the rehabilitation of infrastructure and the provision of medical equip-
ment and furniture (based on identified needs) to make available the necessary
space and facilities to strengthen the ability of Iraq’s healthcare system to safely
treat cases of COVID-19.

By the end of the reporting period, medical equipment — including 180 ventilators
and patient monitors, 10 defibrillators and 180 aspirators — were delivered to
Anbar, Basra, Dohuk, Diyala, Karbala, Kirkuk, Najaf, Ninewa and Salah al-Din.

Additionally, medical furniture (including medical beds, overbed tables, bedside
cabinets and IV holders, 180 each) has also been delivered to eight governorates
(Anbar, Basra, Dohuk, Diyala, Karbala, Kirkuk, Najaf, Ninewa and Salah al-Din).
Medical furniture for four additional governorates (Babil, Dhi Qar, Kirkuk and
Maysan) were at the procurement review committee stage, with approvals received
in April 2021.

Field Assessments are being completed, and Bills of Quantity (BoQ) are being de-
veloped for Sulaymaniyah and Wasit governorates. An extension of rehabilitation
support for Dhi Qar is also proposed, for which BoQ development is in progress.
The procurement processes are to be undertaken from April to May 2021.

In addition, the rehabilitation of the Medical Fluid Factory in East Mosul (Ninewa)
is under implementation, and the technical evaluation for the supply and installa-
tion of an Oxygen Generator Plant for the COVID-19 Hospital in Dohuk has been
completed.

Output 2
Integrated crisis management and response is strengthened to enable the Government of Iraq to maintain core
functions and manage its response

2.1. Coordination meetings

facilitated among the
UN Country Team on
the post-COVID-19
response plan
provided with technical
advisory support by
UNDP

2.2. UNCT Iraq’s multi-
sectoral, Post-
COVID-19 Recovery
Strategy developed
with technical support
from UNDP

The UN Country Team (UNCT) in Iraq relied on the coordination structure outlined
in the UN Framework for the Immediate Socio-economic Response to COVID-19
(April 2020), with the coordination structure led by the Resident Coordinator’s
Office (RCO), OCHA coordinating the humanitarian response, WHO the health
response, and UNDP the socioeconomic response and recovery.

For increased efficiency, coordination continued to be aligned with the UNCT
Programme Management Team and Priority Working Groups (PWG). In addition,
upon request, UNDP provides technical support to the UNCT meetings, the
Resident Coordinator’s Office/Development Coordination Office (RCO/DCO) and
the PMT.

The Socio-Economic Response Plan (SERP) was made available in English and
Arabic by Q4 2020.

2.3. At least 25,000 people
reached through social
cohesion activities

At the end of Q4 2020, UNDP finished implementing social cohesion activities,
achieving the following results:

2.4. Local Peace

Committees, Youth
and Women’s Groups,
and Community
Based Organizations
supported to work
collaboratively to
respond to immediate
community needs
arising due to
COVID-19

To support families who have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19
pandemic due to the lack of access to services and difficulties earning an
income, UNDP provided four Community-Based Organisations (CBOs) with
low-value grants to distribute life-support packages and hygiene products,
raise awareness on health and COVID-19 prevention guidelines and sanitise
public spaces, including school exam centres, healthcare facilities and municipal
buildings, in coordination with 18 Local Peace Committees (LPCs) in cities and
towns in Anbar, Ninewa and Salah al-Din governorates. All CBOs completed the
distribution of packages to 6,000 families, awareness raising and sanitisation of
public spaces in their respective governorates, reaching 64,181 people (30,365
women, 15,377 youth) and sanitising 124 locations.

UNDP provided a second round of low-value grants to previously selected
CBOs, ensuring that an even greater number of vulnerable families will be
supported in Anbar, Ninewa and Salah al-Din.

Finally, to support local youth and women’s groups in their social cohesion
efforts and to combat the stigma and negative stereotypes associated with
COVID-19 in their communities, UNDP selected a cumulative total of 17 initiatives
proposed by youth groups and 10 initiatives proposed by women’s groups to
receive small grants to implement initiatives directly supported by a CBO. 17
initiatives proposed by youth groups (7 in Anbar, 4 in Diyala, 4 in Ninewa and
2 in Salah al-Din) and 10 initiatives proposed by women’s groups (6 in Anbar, 2
in Ninewa and 2 in Diyala) have been implemented. Selected initiatives include
awareness sessions on drug abuse and mental health, rehabilitation of schools
in different districts, and the establishment of a virtual book club, which provided
women of different backgrounds with an opportunity to discuss feminism, the
role of women globally and the issues they face within their communities. Some
11,033 people (4,194 women and 3,291 youth) have been reached.

Output 3
The social and economic impacts of COVID-19 are assessed to enable the Government of Iraq to define short-
and medium-term recovery strategies

3.1. At least 6

socioeconomic
needs and impact
assessments (SEIAs)
completed

3.2. Impact assessment

Iraq

Undertaking strategic SEIAs was a priority for UNDP. Therefore, the focus has
been on the following thematic issues identified as priorities in the context of
Iraq, and findings continue to be released through a series of Policy Papers.
UNDP has made a concerted effort to work in partnership with UN Agencies in
undertaking these assessments, leveraging the comparative technical expertise
of each. By the end of March 2021, five out of the six planned assessments have
been completed.

UNDP had in place a team of technical experts to support the SEIAs, led by a
Senior Coordinator. Since the start of the SEIAs, the team has included experts
on macro-economic issues, social cohesion, resilience and environment, and
social protection. IMPACT/REACH Initiatives continues to lead on the field-based
research required to assess the impact on household vulnerability.

UNDP is also supporting the ongoing ‘Informality Diagnostic: Iraq’, led by ILO in
collaboration with UN Women and IOM.

LESSONS LEARNED

The Need for Agility

The need for agility has been central for UNDP to re-
spond to the evolving needs and ensure the quality and
completion of activities in the rapidly evolving operation-
al context. UNDP adapted existing project management
systems, operational processes, and in-house human
resources, including the safe mobilisation of technical
capacities in the field to support the COVID-19 response.
Given the increasing complexities in the operational
context and the recent levels in the spread of COVID,
UNDP has reviewed implementation timelines to enable
the completion of activities (including assessments) and
ensure a full handover to Iraqi authorities. Additionally,
UNDP demonstrated agility by initially presenting three
possible rehabilitation scenarios for project support.
This served to guide planning for healthcare facility re-
habilitation activities. However, upon completing field
assessments in each target location, the rehabilitation
activities were geared to meet the specific needs identi-
fied. For example, this resulted in some locations having
rehabilitation Scenario 3 and some locations requiring a
hybrid of Scenarios 1 and 2.

Implementation and Monitoring

Implementation has been supported by FFS technical
experts from the medical and engineering teams in the
five liberated governorates. New engineering teams
were recruited for all other governorates to implement
activities under the supervision of FFS central engineer-
ing teams in Baghdad and Erbil. 39 engineers have sup-
ported the implementation and monitoring of UNDP’s
COVID-19 response. While field presence has been crit-
ical, UNDP has ensured that necessary safety measures
are in place, and all field teams are provided with the
required PPE.

UNDP partnered with CBOs, LPCs, and youth and wom-
en’s groups to ensure community engagement when im-
plementing social cohesion activities. These groups and
mechanisms have been vital in reaching out to vulnera-
ble people, building trust within their communities and
providing information and support during the pandemic.

After the effective launch of the Corona in Iraq Plat-
form, the Accelerator Lab’s monitoring system was ini-
tiated to measure the use of the platform and impact of
its messaging. Data showed that the number of users
began to decrease by mid-2020. The decline indicates
that people were not actively seeking COVID-19-related
content as much as they did when the site was launched
during the lockdown period in April, when the demand
for reliable information was high. The Lab has also iden-
tified that this decrease could be due to the saturation
of information regarding COVID-19 and post-lockdown
changes and adjustments in lifestyle. Through its Design
Thinking Methodology, the Lab identified the need to
adapt the platform to the changed context and promote
more engagement and competition-based learning. Ac-
cordingly, adjustments to the platform were made.

Procurement

The dedicated UNDP Iraq Service Centre was leveraged
to provide the necessary operational backstopping for
quick, efficient and transparent procurement processes.
Using this dedicated procurement team has enabled a
quick response in moving the healthcare facility rehabil-
itation processes forward. Furthermore, this allowed the
rapid identification of ways to address procurement-re-
lated challenges. Given high global demands and logis-
tical bottlenecks, some procurement challenges (e.g.
orders being cancelled on short notice and delayed
clearance processes) persist, requiring UNDP to contin-
ue to exercise agility.

Gender Mainstreaming in
UNDP’s COVID-19 Response

Gender-sensitive approaches are incorporated from the
onset into a range of activities, for example:

• Social and economic needs and impact assess-
ments: The SEIAs have a gender focus, understand-
ing that women and girls have different experiences
and face different challenges when it comes to the
impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

• UNCT Iraq Socio-Economic Response Plan (SERP):
The SERP has mainstreamed gender to reflect the
different needs and challenges women and girls face
in the current context.

• Women’s engagement in social cohesion activities:
By the end of 2020, UNDP had received proposals
for community initiatives from women’s groups in An-
bar, Diyala and Ninewa to build social cohesion dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic. UNDP supported the
implementation of 10 initiatives (6 in Anbar, 2 in Nine-
wa and 2 in Diyala), which provided women with an
opportunity to discuss a range of issues and topics
openly. In addition to providing financial support to a
women-run factory that produces masks, gowns and
medical vests, CBOs also provided marketing and
business skills support for SMEs and are running a
women’s book club.

LOOKING AHEAD

Risks and Challenges

The implementation of UNDP Iraq’s COVID-19 response
has not been without risks and challenges. Throughout
the project, the operational context has evolved rapid-
ly and continues to evolve. Therefore, UNDP has been
working to mitigate these risks as far as is possible. A
risk analysis, which is continuously updated, is provided
in Annex 1.

UNDP Iraq COVID-19 Response Update #5 (April 2020-March 2021)

BOX 1. ADDITIONAL COVID-19 RESPONSE SUPPORT THROUGH UNDP IRAQ

Recognising the far-reaching impact of COVID-19 on Iraq, UNDP has seized opportunities across its
portfolio to provide additional support to pandemic response and recovery. The following initiatives were
implemented through existing projects beyond UNDP’s dedicated COVID-19 support project, and are
described here to present a comprehensive overview of related activities.

Security Sector: In collaboration with the
Ministry of Interior, UNDP supported police of-
ficers in Iraq to continue their functions amidst
the COVID-19 pandemic by providing personal pro-
tective equipment (PPE). This support was made pos-
sible following an agreement with the Government of
Canada to repurpose US$75,000 from the Security
Sector Reform/Rule of Law programmes. Through two
consignments of PPE, UNDP provided a total of 4,250
medical face masks, 4,300 bottles of hand sanitiser,
2,000 boxes of examination gloves, and 2,500 box-
es of face masks to the Ministry of Interior. The PPE
supports local police officers engaged in COVID-19
response activities in Baghdad, where the spread of
the virus has been the highest in the country.

The development of an e-learning system for police
training financed through repurposed funding from
the Government of the Netherlands is well underway.
In February 2021, the E-Learning Platform for Local
Police, as an alternative to in-person police training,
was launched in collaboration with the Ministry of In-
terior’s Training and Qualifications Directorate (TQD).

The first course available to users is a training pro-
gramme on standard operating procedures for crim-
inal investigations. The course is designed for police
officers working in various functions, including first
response, crime scene management, forensics and
investigation. Work is also in progress to produce
modules for the rest of the courses on Improving Ef-
fectiveness in Local Policing (IELP) and Mid-Level Po-
lice Management, including voice recordings, editing
the filmed material and course assessment quizzes.

The platform is currently undergoing a trial period to
receive real-time user feedback. Further adjustments
are being made to ensure the platform is user friend-
ly and accessible to all relevant stakeholders. In the
meantime, the MoI TQD is developing a policy to
formalise the eligibility of officers who complete the
E-Learning Platform courses for promotions and ca-
reer advancement opportunities.

The platform, which is a first-of-its-kind initiative in
the MoI TQD, is expected to improve opportunities
for training, career development and specialised edu-
cation. It will provide options to continue training with
minimal disruption as COVID-19 restrictions continue
in 2021.

Social Cohesion: Through the Integrated
Reconciliation Project, 2,700
life-support
packages — consisting of non-perishable
food items and hygiene products — were dis-
tributed to households in Anbar and Salah al-Din in
2020. Additionally, UNDP contracted a community re-
porter in Ninewa to produce two videos on social co-
hesion during the pandemic. The first video, which
has been produced and widely shared, stressed the
importance of maintaining strong, communal social

connections during the pandemic. UNDP has select-
ed a media production company to produce graphics,
advertisements and short videos in preparation for
the nationwide campaign on social cohesion and
overcoming the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic. To complement the information shared by
the campaign, continuous discussions will be held
with UNDP’s Accelerator Lab to ensure messaging is
aligned and consistent once media products are de-
veloped.

Livelihoods Support: UNDP resumed its
livelihoods support programming in June
2020 and continued as of March 2021
through the Funding Facility for Stabiliza-
tion (FFS), Iraq Crisis Response and Resilience Pro-
gramme (ICRRP) and Headway Projects, providing
critical support to boost economic activity in target
locations in Iraq.

Awareness Raising: The “Let’s Beat Coro-
na” awareness campaign9 was implement-
ed in 2020, following an agreement with the
European Union to repurpose funding from
the Supporting Recovery and Stability in Iraq through
Local Development (US$36,733) and Strengthening
the Long-Term Resilience of Sub-National Authorities
in Countries Affected by the Syrian and Iraqi Crises/“-
Headway” (US$134,770) Programmes. The Headway
Programme is financed by the EU Regional Trust Fund
in Response to the Syrian Crisis (“Madad Fund”).

Working in close collaboration with government and
NGO partners enabled access and community en-
gagement. The campaign adopted a multi-pronged
approach and several creative tools to maximise
outreach, interest and engagement. Doing so also
demonstrated that ‘infotainment’ and the use of inno-
vative, light content makes messaging appealing and
relevant to the younger generation.

The campaign involved both offline and online compo-
nents. The offline campaign distributed an estimated
70,000 awareness items in 5,389 neighbourhoods,
hospitals and public places (e.g. shops, markets, phar-
macies and checkpoints) in 10 governorates (Anbar,
Basra, Dhi Qar, Dohuk, Erbil, Halabja, Missan, Ninewa,
Salah al-Din and Sulaymaniyah).

The online campaign reached 31.7 million people, in-

UNDP staff movements within Iraq will be
guided by the safety and security rules and
regulations of the Government of Iraq and
UNDSS.

UNDP staff and third-party contractors will
be provided with PPE to enable engaging
with implementation of activities.

UNDP staff and third-party contractors will
not enter isolation facilities.

If rehabilitation work is undertaken in
health facilities already treating COVID-19
patients, staff and third-party contractors
will be provided with full PPE.

UNDP Medical Officers and Health and
Safety Officers working on the Project will
closely monitor the accurate and full use of
PPE by staff and third-party contractors.

Contractors that undertake rehabilitation
work will be required to ensure workers are
provided with the required PPE. This re-
quirement will be specified in the contract
signed with UNDP.

UNDP Iraq will secure the required approv-
als from the Government of Iraq to ensure
safe passage for equipment and supplies
to be provided through the Project.

UNDP will also coordinate with WHO and
the Health Cluster regarding the support it
will provide, in order to help leverage any
complementary support services provided
by non-state service providers.

The Project has also proposed to provide
PPE for health sector staff in order to help
safeguard them from exposure to the virus.

which will address the same
topics and use similar features,
which might, in turn, affect the
number of visits to the Plat-

Mitigation Measure

Responsibility

This is a global challenge over which UNDP
Iraq has little control. However, in order to
mitigate against this risk, UNDP will ar-
range, if/when needed, for partial delivery
of orders in order to take advantage of all
available supplies and accordingly secure
delivery of items in smaller batches.

try, delays in delivering goods
to the designated healthcare
facilities and the end user
could be experienced due to
restrictions on movement be-
tween the governorates put in
place by the GOI and KRG.

In consultation with the Minis-
try of Health and Environment,
UNDP aims to deliver the most
critical medical equipment
needed to provide high quality
care for COVID-19 patients.
Some of the medical equip-
ment (e.g., ECMO) requires
a high degree of technical
expertise and incurs some
significant expense to operate
and maintain.

Due to its complex nature,
there is a risk that targeted
governorates may have limited
technical capacity to utilise
the ECMO and limited financial
capacity for the procurement
of patient starter kits that are
required to operationalize the
system.

Importing medical items through KRI may
be accelerated by (1) regular follow up
with KRI authorities by the LO Access and
Exemption for customs clearance and (2)
extending the KCMA approval period from
60 days to 90 days to enable the required
permits to be obtained

UNDP is proactively working to obtain all
needed facilitation and access letters from
the central government, respective gov-
ernorates and the KRG Joint Crisis Coor-
dination Centre (JCC) to allow movement
between governorates by the suppliers to
deliver the medical equipment and furni-
ture.

In order to mitigate these risks, UNDP has
confirmed with the Public Health Directo-
rate that each governorate has adequate
capacity (i.e., technical human resource
capacity, and financial capacity to main-
tain the supply of the Patient Starter Kits
needed to use the machine) to run two
ECMO machines. Accordingly, UNDP has
decreased the number of ECMO systems
that will be provided to each governorate
from the originally proposed five to two
machines.

In order to ensure each governorate has
the needed technical capacity, UNDP re-
quires that the supplier provide orientation
to each facility receiving the ECMO. Moreo-
ver, the Ministry of Health’s ICU Committee
has agreed to provide a detailed training
on the operation and maintenance of the
ECMO for medical staff who will be respon-
sible for operating them, once the equip-
ment is delivered and installed.

UNDP will continue to maintain a zero-tol-
erance policy for SEA and will continue
to further strengthen its accountability
mechanisms to mitigate SEA-related
issues within the office and project teams
through enhanced sensitisation and aware-
ness-raising about SEA and mechanisms in
place to report cases.

Staff and partners will also be sensitised on
SEA and trained on how to prevent SEA.

At the time of designing UNDP Iraq’s health systems support
offer, it was challenging to predict the exact nature of rehabilitation
support, given the fast-evolving needs in the country and given
the uncertainty of how COVID-19 would affect each governorate.
Therefore, UNDP initially proposed 3 possible rehabilitation
scenarios that may be required to create the space for treating
COVID-19 patients. Based on the field assessments, responding
to the ground reality and needs in each target Governorate, the
rehabilitation support did evolve as UNDP maintained a level of
flexibility. Therefore, rehabilitation support has resulted in creating
the space in the form of AIIRs, rooms and wards.

2 healthcare facilities (Ramadi and Fallujah) overall supported
with the full package of support (rehabilitation, medical equipment
and PPE).
