# Iraq Expands Blended Learning Initiative to Enhance Higher Education Skills

### [[0:00]] So I'm rolling, so just tell me your name, your title, and I consent to this interview\.

I'm Noor, the head of experimentation from Control Office Iraq, and I consent to this interview\.

### [[0:19]] Right, over to you for the first question\.

### [[0:24]] Could you tell us more about an ad activities that you carry out and will you share?

### [[0:55]] So could you tell me about and the activities you would like to share?

[[tools:How might we]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Beyond borders]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
Yes, sure, there is a lot, but let's do choose one of them\. It's about blended learning initiative with the Minister of Higher Education and Scientific Research in Iraq\. Actually it is\. It was a start at on as I remember in 2019, and we start with them at the beginning, a few meetings to understand what they need\. Then we began to to make a mapping signals of change to identify what the signals that we can identify in a education, a higher education system in Iraq\. One of main things that we found we need to work on the professors in, in the university and public university in Iraq\. Because as you know that after COVID, through the COVID\-19 that we move with the e\-learning and that we found that there the skills that the professors have is not aligned with the e\-learning and technology and digitalization\. So we start with them to to know how can we support them to be have a skills by to use the blended learning, not only the the traditional learning or in person in a class teaching\. So through our working with them that we found we need to start the R&D from the beginning, not in at the end the steps or after experiment the the project we start to research and know well how can analysis the situation updated information for all the project that we work with them initiatives\. And this is first the second things that we if we start with people that they didn't continue with us the project, we will stop at the and one step, one of the steps that we work on it and did complete it\. So we decided to use a local people, a local expertise that we have and see what they need of skills\. We train them and then we start with them to writing the the blended learning teaching methods curriculum for all professors that get lines of teaching in a university\.

### [[3:45]] OK, very nice\. What was the development issue that you were addressing concretely?

[[skills:Digital skills]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[tools:Desk review analysis]]
Yes, specifically that we found that all the professors in Iraq when they move to to digital learning or online teaching, they they use the same the same tools and method in like the traditional way and any class\. So that make a problem in in different level\. The first one about the deliverables that they they they they they aim to to the student\. The the second things that the mindset of student direct to the to the to the digital learning\. The three The third things that we found that there is a a lack of digital skills in a in a in a teachers and professors and otherwise that we found that the students have advanced skilled in in digital\. So they be they there's a gap between students and professors at the the last things that emphasize us to yes, we need to work on that\. It's a test or exams, and there's a different exams between the any class exam and and in this an online exam that test and that will affect on the quality of teaching, quality of skills of knowledge that the graduated people that will or young people that will have\. So this is the then let's say the main issues and then the sub issues that we found challenges that we found great\.

### [[5:44]] And how did you ensure diverse stakeholders perspective were considered and how did they input shape your R&D journal?

[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
Yeah\. Actually the main things as you know that the accelerator lab is focusing on the localized local things, human needs things\. So the main things that we did from the start, from the disc review that we did with the with the ministry and the expert, we start to diverse the stakeholders that we will deal with them\. We start with the students, but we didn't deal with the student at the end\. We deal with the professors and the, the committee who write the wrote the the curriculum\. But from the beginning we start with the student, ask them a lot, and then go to the department that gets that, that get the the trainings for the professor to get the license inside each university\. So we met a lot of head of these departments, we met a lot of the trainer that gave this training to the, to the, to the professors\. And as also we in the, in the design steps and in test experiments and the end of the process, we deal with them with the, with the professors that who had the expertise in teaching method, but they didn't have the skills in the blended learning\. So we 1 of people, one of the expert that experts in the blended learning, we asked him to, to train these professors from the beginning about the blended learning methods\. Also, we engage the privacy university because they have a money at the end and they they like to engage with the public sector\. They need to be a presence in this, in this process\. So we engage them in the testing and and diffuse catalyze the the, the, the process in this\. One of the interesting things that we found at the beginning the the ministry, they they didn't feel that they are comfortable to work with the private sector\. But at the end when they start working with them that they found their role that will be really big in this in, in, in this initiative because as and they are like a financial resources for the for the public sector\. So the partnership between them that will be fantastic and they, they will begin ask us that, OK, we will building a partnership with this private university and with this privacy without we embed in the OR intervene in this process of partnership\.

### [[9:04]] Interesting\. And what was the outcome of your R&D journey?

[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[skills:Pitching skill]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
The first one, we developed updated blended teaching method curriculum\. So knowledge production, it's around 7 specialized, each specialized in teaching method have a facilitator guide\. This is first outcome\. The second outcome that we now we have around 60 trainers, experts in blended learning teaching method\. And the third outcome now and then we will train not we will train actually the these trainers and these experts trained around 1000 professors in university and they will complete that five years with 550\-6000 professors in the university\. So I think this is one of big outcome that that we achieve\.

### [[10:13]] And how did you work? Did you work impact sustainable development?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Finding new alternatives]]
[[tactics:Undertanding the community]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
One of main things that we found in through the the testing and scaling up the because we already asked them even we hand over the project to the ministry and the management that with minister, but we still asking them about the process that we they, they are doing it\. And firstly, for, for, for us for learning\. And if they're they need any support in any level of intervention, for example, when they are starting to start to, to make a TOT training for to get more trainers about the blended learning, we found that they they need a TOT skills more than knowledge skills and blended learning\. So we support them in in interactive teaching, training of trainers, experts to and the training and give them all tools that they need\.

### [[11:27]] And how did you engage with policymakers, private sector communities or other key actors to catalyse further change or impact? Yes, on your R&D?

[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Beyond borders]]
[[skills:Pitching skill]]
[[principles:Immersion and engagemen]]
Yes, I, I talked about the, the private sector\. So I will move with the policy maker\. Actually, one of the challenges that we face that we found through our work that there is a different department in a ministry that the first one, it's about the building the capacity of professors and teaching method\. But there is another department that is relative the alliances of teaching in a university and there is a different test, there is a different training\. But at the end, if you get a teaching method training, you can test them and give them that the license\. Why you do double duplicate the work, duplicate the effort\. So one of main things that we work and are actually it's a big challenge and we spent a lot of time with the ministry\. How can we change the policy and may unify their work together and make the people or the department that working on alliances work with the Department of Human Resources just to to to facilitate the project\. Not only the project, the the the process at all the user journey of the professors through getting the the teaching method trainings and license and be a professors inside the university\. This is the first thing\. The second things through the launching the project, we start to work with all the college that have specialized in teaching method\. We worked with all the CDC inside the public university in Iraq and we start to not only specify the geography that we give the training, we move each month in one university to to let's say, publicize the project and use, let's say in a marketing way, use a word mouth way\. Tools make the the professor themselves proud and have ownership\. They began to talk about it\. So that will let's say a bottom up approach to push the ministry and change the policy and they change the policy at that\.

### [[13:59]] Thank you very much\. Thank you so much\.

Thank you so much\.

### [[14:05]] Can I ask you a couple of questions about embedding in the country office because I noticed in your Petra Kucha you mentioned that\.

### [[14:23]] The control office is specific embedding within UNDP, how we embed within UNDP?

Yes, sure\. You're saying country office say the UNDP country office? Yes, yes, yes, yeah\.

### [[14:33]] So just tell me a bit about how the work you are doing is now being having an uptake in your country office?

[[tools:Portfolio approach]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Portfolio approach CPD]]
[[tactics:Creating space for emerging themes]]
Yes, actually the, the control office starts to two things\. The portfolio approach\. We we started working a portfolio approach after experiment to portfolio before\. So now let's say in, in the fuse or to catalyze the the portfolio approach inside the country office\. So the senior management start push us to work in, in, in this approach\. But at at the same time they see how can we mobilize that? How can we formalize what the modality that we can we can work on it? So at the March of this year, they announced that the we create a new unit, it's integration and innovation unit inside the control office\. This unit will work on a portfolio approach and will support the the whole pillars, programs and project and also the operation side to implement two things\. The first thing is the portfolio and that's portfolio will embed on the new CPD that will start on February next year\. Yes, this is the main things that we we worked in a control  
Yeah, that's great\.

### [[16:01]] And how just offhand, how do you feel about the fact that your work has been picked up in that?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Well being]]
Actually they asked something that's interesting\. At the end, they ask why you smile through the meeting now at the beginning, you face the challenges about that, but they ask why are you smiling now? Because we talked about that in three years, but now we hear it from your side, not from our side\. So that make our happy\. Firstly, this is first, the second thing that now we have authority inside the control office to know what's happened in the project with the insight, with the learning that and that help us for development, help us for in the research and help us how they embed the local solution inside the control office more and more\. Yes, this is one\. Yeah, I love that smile on you\. Why are you smile on you?
