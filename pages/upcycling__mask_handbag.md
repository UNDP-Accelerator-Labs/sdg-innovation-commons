Innovator: Jochebed Naumi

A lot of masks were used during the Covid lockdown in Vanuatu. Jochebed saw that most citizens carelessly threw masks around Port Vila town and it became a  problem. She then saw the potential of repurposing the used masks into a product. Thus, she sew a handbag only using used masks and the rope with jeans. She and her mother own a local business where they mostly upcycle materials into products and are sold in marketplaces. She plans to introduce this product into her business in the near future.
