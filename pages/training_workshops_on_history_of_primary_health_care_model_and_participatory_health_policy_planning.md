> Description

Community health agents and other staff of the territorial Family Health Units have very little historical perspective about the relationship between primary health care policy, human rights frameworks regarding health and citizen participation in policy making. This appears to limit their understanding and appropriation of participatory policy making and management tools that are mandated but underutilized by the ministry of public health. This led us to develop the following hypothesis, which is the focus of our experimental intervention in this learning loop: If we provide Family Health Unit workers training in the history of the Primary Health Care perspective, the role of participation, and the use of participatory planning tools, then they will appropriate these tools and make use of them in identifying their operations and priorities.
