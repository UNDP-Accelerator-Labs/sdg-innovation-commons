## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Embedding innovation in country office [led] projects
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Can the Accelerator Lab team provide a continuous research, development and innovation function within our country office?

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The Accelerator Lab team in North Macedonia has been collaborating with projects from all three units within the country office, in which we have either provided support/ or led processes connected to research, development and innovation components within existing projects. Notably, we have been doing this within the projects: National Development Strategy,  Air Pollution, Youth project(s) etc.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Labs are uniquely positioned to offer research, experimentation and solutions to ongoing processes led by our country office that benefit from a more innovative approach, model, way of thinking.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



Embedding innovation, new ways of thinking and providing actionable intelligence to UNDP led processes.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Can the Accelerator Lab team provide a continuous research, development and innovation function within our country office?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



For the National Development Strategy process we intend to use: policy pilots, foresight and community mapping in our continuous support towards the country office in pursuing the development of this strategic document and process.

For the 'Air_Pollution' and youth projects, we will use: behavioral insights and research to contribute to the efforts behind these processes.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Developing these interventions within existing CO projects is usually done mostly internally, and we try to open up the work by introducing new approaches, and proposing modalities to work together. This allows us to pilot and experiment small scale initiatives an generate new insights that can feed in back to the programs. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Processes that have been developed within the NDS project, can easily be used and replicated in different programmatic spaces [example: Dream Labs as a foresight/citizens engagement tool]. 

Same goes for the behaviour nudges that have been developed within the airpollution project.
