enterpreurship education

> Brief description of the innovation

Entrepreneurship education, seeks to to create students who are iniaters of business. The current education system produces only students that can take up the already available jobs. This results in more job demands and less availability of jobs. With entrepreneurship education, students can have the ability and knowledge to start up their own business and employ others. What we need is to have inniaters of business projects and how to run them unlike simply waiting for employment.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This will ensure that most teachers for example are running successful schools or business that can support their organisation. 
The target is the unemployed teachers and students as clients. 
When students learn about how to start up businesses and are given loans to implement it will generate revenues that will help to reduce poverty and depending on government jobs.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation is designed to empower the learners starting from grade 10 up to college or university. 
The implementation plan... Is by starting working with the production unit making them more effective, every learner should benefit from it and see the value of those production at personal, school and national level. 
For example, if 5 learners in a class doing agricultural science, have a project to raise 100 broirer chickens. At the end of the day when all the chikens are ready and sold out they will have the skill, experience and knowledge and money to help them with what they need. Teachers and schools can simply get a percentage from the  chickens.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will broaden the market and complement with the markets. Learners will be independent and will be able to address the need of the people in the society through different projects.
