> Title of the innovation

The radio movement. With branded tshirts labeled 'listen to the Radio'. We need to understand that the radio is always louder and goes far much beyond and wide even in the remotest areas of our country. Our movement is moving steadily with the partnership of local leadership in communities an also we have written to the independent broadcasting authority to recognise our movement so that we can reach the masses out their using different radio stations.

> Brief description of the innovation

The radio movement (listen to the radio)
It is a movement trying to rejuvenate the old memories of getting information through the radio before the onset of social media. We have realised the influence of social media of today's learners and the general population at the moment which has adversely affected our education system because alot of learners spend time on social media and not on school work lately. The believe the radio stations mandate are to inform, entertain and educate. In this regard, the Radio stations can be used as a medium of teaching and learning as it were in the past because the Radio stations goes far much beyond and wide web in remotest areas of our country were internet is not available. With this pupils will have primary learning from the radio stations before secondary education is reached in a class setting with a teacher present. So this movement is a remind to learners, general public and radio station owners that we can still again start teaching and getting the most relevant information through the radio because the radio is always louder and its content is always authentic, verified and factual before it is broadcasted unlike social media content which is difficult to know if it's authentic or not.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The Innovation has already started making money through the selling on branded t-shirts and putting our articles in known magazines such as the Catholic owned "icengelo magazine".
Our market target is every citizen of our country as long as they have heard about a radio. We have so far distributed and150 tshirts since we started this movement using our meager resources and it as sustained the movement to keep on growing.

If given access to the prize money being offered by this challenge, we will ensure that our products are readily available in all corners of the country for people to ware our tshirts and continue spreading the word of listening to the radio thereby setting a reminder in people that the radio is still relevant even today. Profit realised will push many in school and also help buy radio cassettes to radio champions.

> Technical Feasibility

Our Innovation criteria is to meet the aspirations of all concerned parties throughout country with the help of radio stations and the selling of t-shirts which are branded with our message of 'listen to the Radio'.
We have written to the independent broadcasting authority to recognise our movement because our aim is bring our nation to be well informed an done educated through the radio as it were back in the days. We are implementing our Innovation from the grassroots working with community leaders, church leaders and various school authorities within our catchment area. We are then going to move at district, provincial and national as earlier indicated but not leaving out all the masses using the branded t-shirts and through community radio stations.

Through this innovation of listen to the Radio, it because a reminder to parent, radio station owners and the learners themselves on how they can learn their school and academic work through the Radio as they go about doing their day to day activities.
