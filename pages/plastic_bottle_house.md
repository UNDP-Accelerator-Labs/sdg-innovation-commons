AfriCraft joined hands with FEMINA and NipeFagio to create an information center for environmental care at Coco Beach in Dar es salaam. In view of the immense problem of pollution of the ocean by plastic waste the center was built out of plastic bottles, transforming plastic bottles into useful products.
