Formula for a Sustainable Future: Celebrating Women and Girls in Science

Formula for a Sustainable Future: Celebrating Women and Girls in Science
February 10, 2024

In a world striving for sustainability and inclusivity, the presence of more women and girls in science is imperative. Their unique insights, creativity, and problem-solving abilities bring new perspectives and approaches to tackle environmental, social, and economic challenges. By embracing gender diversity in scientific pursuits, we build solutions that are comprehensive, equitable, and address the needs of all individuals and communities. Empowering women and girls in science not only drives progress towards a more sustainable future but also fosters a culture of innovation and collaboration essential for building a truly inclusive society.On International Day of Women and Girls and Science, meet three UNDP colleagues determined to create a better world.

I started my academic journey with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics, Physics and Statistics from Banaras Hindu University, and followed it with a postgraduate degree in Statistics and Population Sciences. After pursuing my doctorate in Population Sciences, I stepped into the development sector.Having spent more than two decades in this field, I am proud to have woven tales of impact, contributing towards the achievement of SDG 3 (Good Health and Wellbeing), SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reducing Inequalities). Everyday, I champion women’s health, safe abortion, contraception, and immunization by providing technical support for monitoring and evaluation of internationally funded programmes. I have planned, commissioned, and executed various research and evaluation studies, capturing lessons for programme improvement, and generating knowledge products. Committed to progress as a female leader in health, I am now pursuing the 'WomenLift Health Fellowship’, inspired to continue my journey to create a safe, healthy world.

As an Electronics Engineer and a data scientist with training from India and USA, I tackle environmental and social challenges through cutting-edge technology. At UNDP, I have pioneered breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT) using open-source frameworks. My technological innovations bring vital evidence and cooperation among wide range of actors to enhance climate resilience in agriculture, combat air pollution, and make AI more inclusive. I envision a future where digital technologies take the centre stage in driving transformative impacts in our lives. I see immense potential in Tech4Good to elevate our impact on complex development challenges, amplifying efficiency, and fostering collective action across development ecosystems. The Tech4Good revolution requires more women in STEM, jointly paving an inclusive and exciting sustainable future. On the 9th International Day of Women and Girls in Science, I wish all women and girls success and excellence in their scientific pursuits.

As a woman in science working in the development sector, I feel my journey highlights the crucial role that women play in achieving the three pillars of Sustainable Development: economic prosperity, social justice, and environmental integrity. Through the prestigious INSPIRE fellowships & the Newton Bhabha Fellowship, I have had the opportunity to work with world-class research facilities such as the University of Manchester and the renowned Indian National Environmental Engineering Research Institute CSIR-NEERI, immersing myself in diverse areas of work to showcase practical application of science in solving societal challenges. A vivid memory from my early career has been a field visit to assess water quality in central India, where conversations with the locals exposed the impact of environmental degradation on communities. Another enriching experience was working on the Open Defecation Free programmes in Maharashtra, highlighting the need for solutions that addressed both sanitation and social needs as we strived to make the country open defecation free. Investing in women in science is imperative for to address social and development challenges effectively. Owing to their diverse perspective, comprehensive and sustainable solutions can be developed. Their talent and insights can create a gender-inclusive world where the collective well-being of humanity is advanced.
