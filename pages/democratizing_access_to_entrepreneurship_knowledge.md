## The Problem

Access to information, knowledge, connections, and opportunities continues to pose significant challenges for businesses in Bangladesh, hindering the growth of entrepreneurship in the country. The distribution of entrepreneurial knowledge and opportunities remains uneven and limited to a privileged few. There is a notable lack of coverage on topics such as business establishment in Bangladesh, local markets, emerging trends, prominent companies, and influential figures. Business education in Bangladesh also pays scant attention to the local entrepreneurship scene.

Entrepreneurship is a social phenomenon affected by numerous factors. Given the inherent difficulties involved in starting a business, young individuals seldom delve into studying local entrepreneurs. Moreover, societal attitudes often view entrepreneurs with skepticism, which discourages many from considering entrepreneurship as a viable career path.
## The Solution

This knowledge platform goes beyond conventional sources, providing a unique perspective that is not widely found elsewhere.
