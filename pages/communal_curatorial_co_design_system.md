## Communal curatorial co-design system

Creation and implementation of the "Community of curatorial practice" from the Barbados Museum and Historical Society regarding the co-design of artistic and cultural exhibits rooted in shared meaning and identity. The practice is derived from the Lave and Wenger concept of a community of practice, which speaks to a social theory of learning based on relations among persons, activities and the world over time. The concept was adapted for the Museum by developing a curatorial community with shared interest in the development of exhibitions in a co-curated manner in order to develop a continual practice of review of exhibition material and provision of community feedback. Sustainability is also key with relationships being built through shared learning in the process.&nbsp;
