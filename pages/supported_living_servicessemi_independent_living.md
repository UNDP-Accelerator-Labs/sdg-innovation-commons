> Title of the innovation

Supported Living Services/Semi independent Living

> Brief description of the innovation

In this independent living service, young persons with mental health disabilities,   are going to benefit from this project.  There will be inclusion.  They are going to be on a program of daily activities,  each service user (young persons) , will have a personal program , depending on their needs.  I shall  endeavour to employ some care givers, to assist in executing this project diligently.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The innovation shall help generate income from the government and indeed, well wishers. I shall workout on how much  allowance each beneficiary will receive  but this  will only  be  determined  by the amount of money  that will be in the coffers . I shall also  be drawing an income . For transparency purposes,  I would like to have someone independent to monitor
the way the funds are going to be utilised, as every penny is accounted for.

> Technical Feasibility

With supported  living, I would need to rent private accommodation that have reasonable rentals, I am going to require a lot of support from the gov't.  The aim of this project,  is to teach the young persons on how to look  after themselves,  when they move into their independent accommodation in the community and  minus supervision

> Anticipated Social Impact

I would like to  concentrate  on young persons with mental health  issues.  I want the system to help me set up semi independent social housing.  This can enhance  the lives of the young  persons that I have mentioned.  The need to fill included  in society.  They need to be rehabilitated and participate in activities, just like other people in society.
