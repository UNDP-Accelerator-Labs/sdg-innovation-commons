This is an electronic travel aid which fits on top/lower part of the white cane that guides and directs a visually impaired person to follow smooth pathways. This is a low cost solution to reduce accidents, discrimination and violence of virtually impaired persons. This stick facilitates both hearing and visual impaired users as it uses sound and vibrations as alerts. It also uses ultrasonic ranging to detect obstacles, informs the user about day light, low power consuming and has a rechargeable battery.
