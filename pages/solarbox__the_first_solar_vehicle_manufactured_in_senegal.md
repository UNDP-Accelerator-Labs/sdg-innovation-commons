## Summary

> Add the summary here

Solarbox is a completely new senegalese environmentally-friendly mobility solution designed and manufactured by the start-up bearing the same name. This innovation was born of the need to reduce environmental impact while meeting the mobility needs of the population. The solution shows that it is possible to design solar-powered vehicles from scratch.  
## Description

> Add the description here

The solarbox consists of a container that takes the form of a fleet of electric vehicles powered exclusively by solar energy. It combines solar charging &amp; container mobility. Each Solarbox powers 5 electric 3-wheelers &amp; 2-wheelers. The choice of the 3-wheels is justified by the restrictions on the circulation of assembled standard cars in Senegal.
