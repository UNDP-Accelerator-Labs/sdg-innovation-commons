> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

The Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) has installed solar powered streetlights along the Suva-Ba corridor, Fiji. Each streetlight will operate for approximately 13 hours at a time, from dusk till dawn. The solar lights are powered by the sun's energy, and in turn will offset carbon emissions and reduce the country's electricity generator diesel consumption. It is an innovative and environmentally-friendly adaptation approach that harnesses sustainable energy solutions to  provide essential infrastructure.

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

25 solar streetlights would use 6,570kWh of energy from the sun and: Offset 3,357 kg of carbon emission Save electricity generator diesel consumption by 1,932 liters Equivalent to planting 23 trees

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

This solution can be easily replicated in other countries
