> Descripción de la experiencia

To guarantee social distancing during COVID pandemic, small shops in Ecuador have blocked their entrance with furniture or improvised barriers that allow interaction and visualization, but work as a barrier. Products are touched only by shop owner. Lines are organized outside with paint marks one meter apart.
