> Type of the Solution

Community Initiative

> Affected Sector

Energy

> Description of the solution

Röstånga energy community is a group of neighbours that enables members to acquire their own photovoltaic systems, and other renewable and energy-efficient energy solutions, at an affordable price. They reduce costs by cutting out the middleman and handling planning, purchasing, assembly, installation, and commissioning within the cooperative's framework. At the same time, members contribute with their own time and skills.

> Socio-economic effects

Reduced energy costs, enhanced energy democrary

> Type of Measure

- 3. mitigation measures

> Type of sub-measure

- 5. (none)

> Who led the solution

- households/individuals

> Timescale of implementation

- medium-term (2-4 years)

> Other Notes

On finance: The cooperative model is in this case more cost-effective than for an individual house to install solar panels. To further incentivize the adoption of solar energy, this approach could be combined with government subsidies or business models increasing afforability.
