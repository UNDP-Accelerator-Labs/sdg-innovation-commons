> Title of the innovation

Farming and pig production and vegetables

> Brief description of the innovation

We will commence on the pig farming which is incoparated with vegetables farming and crop farming which will help as animal feed . The vegetables will be supplied the the local people as food , the was from pigs will be applied as manure while the vegetables which will remain will be given to pigs as food. The project is potentially employing about 8 people initially but the number will increase after 2 year to 16-20 workers. The pigs which are the main produce will be sold for meat until 5 years when we are projecting we be able to processing some of the meat, to make sausage on bacon and other meat products which will have increased the number of workers. This will help employ both men and women for various farm work on permanent and temporal employment.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The produce will be sold for cash and the returns used to pay the workers and reinvestment to grow to the business to our projected earnings. It will help provide a variety of both relish and vegetables which will be produced all year round. There is usually some cut in vegetable supply when water from the stream dries up , but this will ensure alround year food. Out crops will help to make feed and the animal waste as manure and it will be an employer of both women and men. The market for the vegetables is both the local traders who will be ordering an also we plan on supplying local chain stores butcherirs and Zambeef. They are a few pig farmers though they are unable to have supply piggs all through the year but only once in a while and the vegetables are only done by ZNS KALENDA which only does cabbage and tomatos. There are also going to benefit by getting manure which will be given to some of the workers.

> Technical Feasibility

There are the Chinyama farms who are doing the same business and have been expanding and we intend to follow up on them for mentorship and training of some of our staff.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will gone employment to a few people who will have food an necessities for their families and beneficiary of the manure which they can use in their farming. The vegetables will help provide relish that anyone can afford and hence help and cater for almost everyone.. The current Market for pigs overwhelms the people who currently in business we will help increase on the supply.
