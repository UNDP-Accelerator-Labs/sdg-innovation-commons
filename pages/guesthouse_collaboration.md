Guesthouses on Alifu Alifu Dhigurah have established an informal price control understanding whereby all the guesthouse owners and operators agree on the minimum price that they will not go below and discuss on ways of maintaining service standards across the island. This has allowed the island to maintain is market position, despite competing markets in the Atoll.
