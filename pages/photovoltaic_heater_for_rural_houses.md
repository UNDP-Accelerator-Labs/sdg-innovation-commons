> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Communities from the Andes in Ecuador live in high levels, from 3,000 to 5,000 meters above sea level, where temperature is low and rural families have no access to heating. This low cost solar energy heater represents a possible solution for poor households. I has been developed as a research project in Escuela Politécnica Nacional.

> Please insert a link to the solution. 


> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Prototype

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Applied research (analytical studies and tests only at the laboratory level) Prototype in a simulated environment (Validation of a prototype, whether full-scale or not, that has the ability to function in conditions similar to its final application, corroborating the results obtained; but its operability is still at the laboratory or simulation level).

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?




> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

Information is provided in attachment.


> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?
