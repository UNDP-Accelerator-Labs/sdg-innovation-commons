## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Generative Artificial Inteligence for Quality Education and Research  

 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that developing countries like Cameroon often lag far behind developed countries in the field of education and research, yet the potential is there, and we need to find digital innovations like Generative AI that can help to reduce, if not close this gap.   

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The history of this challenge is that developing countries like Cameroon in the domain of Education and Research are some time don't have appropriated equipments et adapted infrastructures. Cameroon also has a huge social-cultural and cultural diversity. Those have a negative impact on updated and contextualized educational contents, creativity spirit that is relevant for research and innovation.    

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



Finding the solution to this type of challenge means understanding and testing how new tools and emerging technologies such as generative AI platforms work, and thinking ahead to find possible solutions. This is not very often the case for a traditional development project which would already come up with a ready-made solution and which very often doesn't take the risk of embarking on an exploratory path which is likely not to be the solution. On the other hand, you have to leave the beaten track to find innovative solutions to this type of challenge. In contrast, the Acc Lab is better equipped to explore the various possible solutions to this type of complex challenge.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



We wanted to learn and understand ow can Generative AI contribute to improving quality education and research to impact the development of Cameroon ?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



Solutions to this challenge require the use of collective intelligence and a certain amount of foresight, because artificial intelligence is an emerging technology and no single person can currently claim to master all its potential and risks.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



These new sources of data have enabled me, for example, to fill the data gap on the accessibility of certain education-related infrastructures in the different regions of Cameroon.  
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Those who could benefit from this work are the entire educational community in Cameroon (Ministry of Education, teachers, students, etc.), as well as researchers and academics, because artificial intelligence has enormous potential to help develop these skills in Cameroon.
