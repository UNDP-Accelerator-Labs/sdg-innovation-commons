Autonomous infrared contact-less thermometer can check the body temperature of people entering a building from a distance and upload the results to a cloud storage platform. This device can be mounted on common surfaces like doors, apartment gates or community halls and eliminates the need of having staff to physically stand and monitor temperature.
