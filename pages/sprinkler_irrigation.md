Description: The mechanism works through a network of pipes that transport water to the sprinklers, which use pressure to trigger it. Basically, it seeks to imitate the way in which rain would naturally irrigate these plants.

In this case, the implementation of this irrigation produced better quality potatoes and quadrupled the production compared to traditional irrigation.  

Interesting feature: This type of irrigation ensures to be able to water the entire plant and provides the necessary moisture to the entire soil.
