Baytna Baytak is a civil initiative launched by young, dynamic, and politically independent volunteers and community organizers whose initial mission was primarily to secure housing for healthcare professionals working at the forefront of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Baytna Baytak assists needy individuals and families without regard to religion, sect, gender, or nation of origin. In the wake of the tragic Beirut blast, Baytna Baytak’s expanded its mission to support emerging needs and response efforts. We are now actively working on relocating displaced citizens who have lost their homes due to the explosion.
