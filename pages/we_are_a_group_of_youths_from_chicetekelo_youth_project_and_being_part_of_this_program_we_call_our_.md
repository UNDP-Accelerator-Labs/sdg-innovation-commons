We the plastic management group from chicetekelo youth project, we are given one of the places or building under chicetekelo where all operations are done an this includes the grouping of the plastics materials(HDPES and PETs from the streets and from designated areas especially eating places and malls where we have taken our big bins after they are full and there after,we remove lids from them, compress the bottles, pack them and finally take them to the industries for sale.

This is helping us youths from chitekeko in terms of having a thing to do after completing our secondary school instead of wandering about looking forward to finding somewhere a part time can be done from. Market wise, it helps plastic industries to have more materials to produce their products and our project can grow if we can be helped with a compressor in order for us to be compressing more materials than using hands because this makes us sale few bottles. It has helped the environment free from plastic materials  anyhow and also climate change.
