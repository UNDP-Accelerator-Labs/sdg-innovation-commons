## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Building resilience of rural small holder farming communities to effects of climate change. 


## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that many small holder farmers in rural areas do not have adequate access to weather data to help manage their farming activities in the face of increasingly irregular weather patterns. 



> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



The challenge grew from a learning cycle to scope and address economic drivers of insecurity and conflict between herders and farmers with interventions across the agriculture value chain in Benue State. 

We found that farmers had limited tools and knowledge to deal with climate change, which is one of the drivers of insecurity and conflict in the State. We also saw that there was minimal knowledge sharing between the rural small holder farming communities, innovation ecosystem and Research and Development communities. 

Most farmers acknowledge that the weather patterns are changing but do not know what to do about it. Their livelihoods are negatively impacted and this impacts as they lose seed, input and sometimes maturing crops due to this situation.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab engaged farmers across different parts of Benue State, mapping gaps in the agricultural value chain and support systems and engaging partners that are are developing innovative solutions to these issues. It is worth investing resources in this challenge because the costs of these crises in the State continue to rise and are also affecting other States in the country. 



> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



We are testing the impact of sharing timely weather data and climate smart farming tips in building the resilience of rural small holder farmers to climate change. 


## Challenge classification

</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.



The Agrometeorological department of NIMET will share crop weather calendars for selected crops, weather forecasts and climate-smart agricultural farm management practices with the small holder farming communities we are working with.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



Can we reduce losses incurred on agricultural input, crops and labour due to erratic weather patterns by 30% by providing small holder farmers with weather data and climate-smart practices?



> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?


- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods &amp; tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



We will leverage collective intelligence and co-creation in determining the type of data required by the small holder farming communities and making these available to them. We intend to use behavioural insights to identify and deploy key information on the most preferred and most accessible platforms for the farmers. We plan to use data visualisation to make our work and insights more accessible to a wider range of partners. 



> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?



These data sources will help us understand the scale of losses caused by small holder farmers due to erratic weather patterns, get timely feedback from the farmers through the experiment and the type of weather shocks to expect in the communities we are working in. 


## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



We will need to loop back and collaborate with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture to leverage their resources to grow this initiative if it's successful.
