> Title of the innovation

Dronewave Solutions - Precision Agriculture

> Brief description of the innovation

Precision Agriculture
The innovation is focusing in the use of drones in agriculture. Where cameras on the drone will collect data by capturing fields, then use Ai software to analyze images into reports such as Stand Count, Plant Population, Plant Stress, Weed Control, Pest Damage, Disease Detection,
Waterlogging, Flowering, Eagle Eye Report, Drought, Potential Yield and Nitrogen Status which will help farmers;
•	Capturing large fields in a very short time with high level of accuracy
•	Better understand crop performance in an all-in-one solution. 
•	Enabling farmers make more informed crop management decisions
•	Improve current high labor demanding processes i.e. Manual field scouting and spraying using hand held sprayers.

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

•	Will make money by charging farmers on plant analysis and spraying services. 
•	The innovation will help farmers save crops, increase their yields and in return make more money.
•	The innovation will improve the hard labor manual process like plant scouting and hand spraying processes through aerial operations.
•	Target customers includes Large Scale Farmers, Medium Scale Farmers and Cooperative Farm Groups with 10 acres+.
The prize money will allow us to;
•	Purchase a drone for plant and crop analysis, 
•	Advertisements our services and become operational.
Value addition - Utilizing precision agriculture methods, such as drone data solutions, has a host of environmental benefits;
•	Applying spot treatments to selected areas versus treating the entire field as a homogenous;
•	Conserves resources and prevents potentially harmful chemicals from reaching outside their bounds. Herbicides, pesticides, fertilizers used for variable rate prescriptions won’t leak into water sources when spot treated. This aids in water conservation, as farmers will only use water where it’s necessary.

> Technical Feasibility

Innovation Design
•	The drone design we will be using in precision agriculture for both plant/crop analysis and for spraying is the Multi-Rotor. The Multi-Rotors are made of a central body and multiple rotors that power propellers to take flight and maneuver the aircraft. These usually have four rotors (quadcopter), but can have as many six or eight (Hexacopter and octocopter). Once in the air, multi-rotor drones use fixed-pitch propeller blades to control the vehicle motion by varying the relative speed of each rotor to change the thrust and torque produced, allowing a unique range of movement. This presents some advantages when used for precision agriculture. 
•	Example existing prototypes - quadcopter drones DJI Phantom Series, Hexacopter drones is the DJI Agras Series.
Implementation Plan
1st Quarter - We intend to start with plant &amp; crop analysis service to targeting Medium and Cooperative Farmers.
2nd Quarter - Have strong online presence on social media platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn &amp; Tweeter) and Website.
3rd Quarter –. Sign strategic partnerships (Zambia National Farmers Union, Agro-dealers and agronomists).
4th Quarter – Purchase spraying drone and expand our services to Commercial Farmers.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The social impact of drones has been acclaimed due to their affordability, flexibility and safety.
•	Drones can be used to handle the most dangerous tasks without exposing or endangering any human life. E.g. Field scouting with drones will save farmers lives from possible snake bites that can happen during manual field scouting.
•	Drones will also improve to quality health of farmers, as farmers will no longer be doing the hard labor farming process such as manual field scouting or spraying their fields using hand held sprayers.
The use of drones in the agriculture industry is steadily growing as part of an effective approach to sustainable agriculture management that allows agronomist, agriculture engineers, and farmers to help streamline their operations, using robust data analytics to gain effective insights into their crops. Crop monitoring, for example is made easier by using drone data to accurately plan and make ongoing improvements, such as the use of ditches and evolving fertilizers applications.
