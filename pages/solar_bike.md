Save the green environment from carbon emission and save money which spent to buy fuel: The aim for my product is protecting our green environment by using carbon free vehicles and adapting sustainable growth by using renewable energy which cannot have any cost for energy source.
I have developed a carbon free solar bike that can work using renewable energy called solar system. 
Due to this technology the environment will be keep in green and the vehicle owner will not cost any money to provide energy for their vehicle this will make them resource saver like money and time which will spent to buy an fetch fuel. 
We can sustain the business by converting fuel car by solar car and by giving them fuel information about how electric car impact positively upon economy, environment and other aspects of our life.
