Sustainable tourism can be a viable pathway to achieve economic empowerment, particularly of informal workers of Bangladesh. Cooperation between indigenous minorities and Bengalis living in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) - a major tourist destination of the country - is key to achieving this. To formulate solutions to this end, the Bangladesh Accelerator Lab conducted several extended field visits to this region and, in consultation with the locals, identified a portfolio of solutions to address the plethora of prevalent challenges and promote sustainable tourism in the CHT. One of the challenges is that local farmers in the CHT are currently not getting the just price for their produce, with agricultural products grown in very remote regions being sold at a very low price. For instance, mangoes are sold for 5-taka per kilogram whereas actual market value is around 60 taka per kg and papayas are sold for 20-taka per kg against a market value of 120 taka per kg.   To address this issue, in consultation with the locals, one solution that has been identified is that if tourism is promoted in these areas, the agricultural produce can be sold at a higher value which will create additional revenue for the locals.
