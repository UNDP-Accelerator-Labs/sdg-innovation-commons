Not long ago, the idea of Libya as a travel destination seemed like a distant dream. A country rich in history, culture, and natural beauty had long been overshadowed by years of conflict and isolation. But change is in the air. The narrow streets of Tripoli’s Old City are once again buzzing with life, motorsport enthusiasts are gathering in the Sahara, and—perhaps most tellingly—the world is starting to notice. With the recent launch of Libya’s e-visa system, the country is taking concrete steps to open its doors to international visitors. This signals a renewed commitment to welcoming the world and reclaiming Libya’s place on the global tourism map.From the cobbled alleys of Al-Madina to the golden dunes of the Great Sand Sea, Libya is slowly but surely stepping back onto the global tourism stage, driven by grassroots initiatives, a spirit of adventure, and an unexpected group of ambassadors—foreign social media influencers.

A New Spotlight on Libya’s Heritage Libya has long been a crossroads of civilisations—Phoenicians, Romans, Byzantines, Ottomans, and Amazigh communities have all left their mark. Today, a renewed sense of pride in this heritage is taking root. The ongoing restoration of Tripoli’s Old City(link is external) is a symbol of this revival. Once neglected, its whitewashed buildings, historic mosques, and vibrant souqs are now being carefully restored, turning the district into a cultural hub. Visitors can sip Libyan tea in the centuries-old courtyards or explore through artisan workshops nestled between stone walls.Cultural festivals are reactivating public spaces. Music spills from hidden courtyards. Local artists are painting new life into old walls. Landmarks like the Karamanly House Museum, once a crumbling relic, now stand proudly as a window into Libya’s past. This isn’t just about preserving history—it’s about making it part of everyday life again. International travel influencers also play a role through videos capturing the majesty of Sabratha’s seaside ruins(link is external). They are reaffirming the narrative. These stories are shifting perceptions, highlighting Libya not as a forgotten or fragile place but as a land of untapped adventure waiting to be explored.

The Rise of Motorsport and Adventure Tourism Libya’s tourism revival isn’t only about reconnecting with the past—it’s also about new experiences.In the Sahara, adrenaline-fueled desert rallies are transforming Libya’s vast landscapes into international sporting arenas. Events like the Ghadames Desert Rally(link is external) and the T-T Desert Rally(link is external) are attracting drivers from across North Africa, the Middle East, and even Europe. These rallies showcase Libya’s breathtaking dunes(link is external) and rugged terrain, proving that the country isn’t just a place of ancient wonders—it’s also a playground for the bold. For thousands of Libyan spectators, these events are more than just races; they are celebrations. They unite communities, ignite local economies, and spark renewed pride. The dynamic imagery shared on social media is also reshaping how Libya is seen by the world: as a destination for adventure, endurance, and connection.

Making Travel Easy: The E-Visa One of the key barriers to tourism—visa access—is now being addressed.In 2024, Libya launched its e-visa system(link is external), streamlining what was once a lengthy and complicated process. Instead of navigating embassy bureaucracy or waiting months for approvals—now, travelers can apply online and receive their visa within days. In addition, Libya offers visa-free entry for 8 countries(link is external), further boosting accessibility for regional travellers. These efforts, paired with increased hospitality investments and infrastructure, these changes signal that Libya is open for tourism like never before.

Looking Ahead: A New Chapter for Libyan Tourism As part of its support to economic diversification in Libya, UNDP has been working with the Ministry of Economy to explore emerging sectors with growth potential. Among them, tourism stands out as a powerful opportunity for sustainable development and job creation. Using the Three Horizons strategic foresight approach, UNDP’s Accelerator Lab facilitated a collaborative process with government counterparts to envision the future of tourism in Libya. Over the course of two months, the Lab introduced the methodology and trained Ministry teams on how to apply this method across various industries, including tourism, which emerged as a sector with significant potential for Libya’s future growth. This engagement culminated in the “Café of Innovation and Ideas event: an interactive policy dialogue that brought together 65 participants from the government, private sector, academia, civil society organisations and youth leadership. In the tourism-focused session, participants mapped out Libya’s current tourism in Libya. Over the course of two months, the Lab introduced the methodology and trained Ministry teams on how to apply it across different sectors. Key challenges were acknowledged: limited infrastructure, outdated policies, and the need for greater security assurances. However, the conversation quickly turned to opportunities. Ideas such as promoting Libya’s landscapes to filmmakers, developing tourism-focused mobile apps, and producing adventure tourism documentaries emerged as feasible next steps. The vision for the future was ambitious: A strong national tourism strategy. Skilled professionals. Public-private partnership. A compelling national narrative powered by digital platforms and media. Even medical tourism was flagged as a potential area for growth.
The momentum is building. What was once unthinkable is now becoming increasingly tangible. With each event hosted, influencer video shared, or traveller welcomed, Libya takes another step toward reintroducing itself to the world.

One thing became clear from the Café of Innovation and Ideas: Libya’s tourism potential is no longer a matter of “if”—but “when.”
