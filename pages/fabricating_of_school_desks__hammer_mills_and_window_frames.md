> Brief description of the innovation

My names are Chileshe Webster kateka, l stay in kitwe, copperbelt province, I happen to be the last born in our family of 11, l completed School in 2003, at mwense Secondary school with a School certificate, also did metal fabrication and welding at kitwe trades school, l used to work in the mines with different companies as a boiler maker from 2007 to 2020 and acquired alot of experience, Now l have a workshop were I fabricate things like, hammer mills, window frames, grill doors, school desks, windows, wheelbarrows and other things.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

My innovation is an income generator once capital is injected, FIRSTLY I' ll start the windows frames, when capital is given, we will buy material to make window frames and door frames, once that is done, we will ask government through the district commissioner and or the permanent secretary and aquire contract's to supply these door/ window frames to newly belt government/community schools and not forgetting houses in our community which also needs this... SECONDLY, the hammer mills, after fabricating them,  again we have to go to government and offcause some NGO'S  for contracts to supply to communities in the remote areas by use of diesel propelled engines were there is no electricity. LASTLY, the desks, these are highly wanted materials from both government schools and private schools, if given an opportunity to make and supply desks, definitely we will have alot of income and create alot of jobs for my fellow youths.

> Technical Feasibility

After finishing up with my innovation that will be designed to customers specifications and the prototype for clients to see,  It will attract a lot of customers. To implement all this innovations, a good working environment, expansion of the workshop, bring in  materials, labour and  PPE, an injection of about, $10,000 is required to implement this plan.

> Anticipated Social Impact

My innovation is based at recruiting and bettering the lives of many youths ( gender equality ) alot of youths both qualified/ unqualified are languishing in our communities without jobs, So once this innovation is supported and funded,  an estimate of about 500 to 700 youths will be employed in the first quarter of the year.
