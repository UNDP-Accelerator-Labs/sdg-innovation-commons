## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

The Innovator's journey: A systemic approach to supporting Innovators
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the innovation ecosystem in Zambia is fragmented with actors working in silos, opportunities are many and unknown by the innovators, thereby creating an environment that is working against each other. The result has seen some innovators struggling to reach the Growth Stage as the playing field is perceived as unequal while the more opportunistic innovators attempt to take undue advantage of the uncoordinated eco system. The lack of a coordinated framework to guide the operations of innovations is playing against the obvious advantage that the sector offers.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In Zambia the AccLab work has translated into broad reaching initiatives that are aligned to systematically embed the AccLab learning cycle with different implementers ranging from government institutions to interested off-takers, taking the lead in implementing different parts of the cycle. Set up in 2019, the Lab has been testing and scaling new solutions with the aim of creating the fastest learning network on development solutions though the National Innovation Initiative (NII) being implemented with the Ministry of Technology and Science through the National Technology Business Centre (NTBC) and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), with collaboration from the Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority (ZICTA) and Patents and Companies Registration Agency (PACRA. The NII has facilitated the identification of over 200 verified local solutions from across the country, ranging from Digital Agricultural Solutions aimed at improving the resilience of Small-Scale Farmers in the face of climate change, access to alternative sources of Energy, Digital Financial Solutions and Digital Education and Health Solutions that are hoped to accelerate progress towards the SDGs. The NII success in leveraging a diverse portfolio of partners including Government Agencies, Research Institutions and Private Secor in scouting and supporting local innovations annually from 2020 that address developmental challenges has resulted in an online Solutions Atlas that serves as a repository of over 3,000 solutions that respond to the local context guaranteeing sustainability as they are backed by local knowledge and resources. Furthermore, the NII has directly supported 50 innovators to improve their ideas and prototypes, certify and register intellectual property rights, amongst which 18 have already undergone business acceleration programmes with 20 more earmarked to begin in 2022.   As a continuation of the NII process to empower innovations with experimentation process of the AccLab learning cycle, in 2021 the AccLab tested an approach to embed experimentation at an institutional level to support innovations by partnering with three national research institutions, namely  the National Institute for Scientific and Industrial Research (NISIR) and the Copperbelt University (CBU)to provide testing and experimentation mentorship to  8 NII innovations that focused on energy and climate change. The aim of the programme was to test an institutional approach to experimenting in real world to improve and strengthen commercialization of the innovations by: §  Equipping Innovators with business development skills required to support the innovators to scale their innovations into viable businesses Showcasing improved innovations with a business case to potential off-takers   Leveraging on these partnerships the AccLab is exploring the capacities, knowledge and resources available to accelerate the rate of achieving the SDGs in Zambia. This is expected to be achieved through home-grown initiatives that reflect the specific context of communities in Zambia but also build on locally motivated solutions with high potential to deliver the anticipated impact. The scaling aspect of the learning cycle is positioned to augment the newly introduced Ministry of Technology and Science in its mandate to operationalize the Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) 2020 Policy. Innovation’s prominence in the nation’s agenda calls for an institutional framework to provide guidance on the support required for an innovator to scale their innovation through the different stages of their cycle. Government acknowledgement that innovations are a driving force behind Science and Technology as well as Research and Development resonates with the UNDP AccLab’s to promote locally sourced innovative solution to development challenges.  The Accelerator Lab therefore seeks to co create the Innovator’s Journey design based on the lessons learnt in supporting innovations in the country and from the voices of partners andinnovators within the ecocystem. The Innovator's Journey spells out the process by which innovations can be supported from ideation to growth stage – a framework that maps out an innovation's life cycle.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The UNDP Zambia AccLab compliments efforts of the government using its convening power and its experience across the Accelerator Lab network working with governments to support the innovation ecosystem. As a trusted partner the Acclab intends to support the government in creating a sustainable ecosystem that supports innovations grow within the country by creating a conducive environment through policy, regulation, coordination and strategic partnerships with the private sector to support the growth of innovations.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

1. What has been the impact of AccLab innovation initiatives on the Zambian innovation ecosystem?
2. Where is AccLab support best required to strengthen the innovator journey in Zambia
3. What does an Innovator's Journey in Zambia look like?-  An Innovation journey is a process by which innovations can be supported from ideation to growth stage – a framework that maps out an innovation's life cycle and the innovation ecosystem with corresponding specific roles of the Ministry of Science and Technology and other key stakeholders at each stage of the journey from beginning to the end, while identifying potential entry points for the UNDP Accelerator Lab
