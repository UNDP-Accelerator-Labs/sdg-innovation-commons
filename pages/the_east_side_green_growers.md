This innovation is all about promoting a healthy life style of green eco friendly plants,which are grown in a very eco friendly natural environment.This innovation has a very big impact on society cause it will bring so many jobs to the local people who will be working in the fields.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will bring jobs for the manual workers who will be working in the fields were these green plants are planted,in order for these plants to reach maturity there is a large process that needs to be done in order for the plants to reach  full maturity.These plants will be then sold to the local market which is bringing a healthier community for those who consume these plants and fruits,which is beneficial for both the farmer and the buyer of the products.The grand prize will help me the farmer boost this innovation to a whole different lavel, to the extent were I can start to import these products to other provinces and countries which also involves other business to take part in these innovation for example the transport sectors will be involved when transporting the products to other provinces or countries which is good for business for all business sectors  cause there is an intertwined collaboration which profits everybody.

> Technical Feasibility

The current design is on a 1 &amp; half acre Which consists of  only crops.  My innovation is disigned in very flexible way,when the production of plants is boosted up I will get also into animal realing of broyler chickens which lay eggs each and every day and these eggs will be also sold at a specific price &amp; some eggs will be incubated for the supply of more broyler chickens which is beneficial for both I the farmer and the farm workers because some of the money will be added to the plant production which is bringing up the salary and the farm inputs.
