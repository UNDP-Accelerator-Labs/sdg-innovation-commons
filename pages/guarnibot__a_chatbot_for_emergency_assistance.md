## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

How can young university students offer solutions to citizen participation challenges using technology?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we train interested youth with some background knowledge in the use of civic

technologies for participatory governance THEN we can develop new experiences

and use innovative tools at local levels that broaden the scope of

participation

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

It consisted of a 40-hour internship, developed by one of the winning teams of the Civic Technology Hackathon held in March 2023.

During the internship, the students set out to implement a technological solution that can help in the registration and rapid assessment of damages and needs after a disaster. They worked with the Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council of the city of Villeta. Disaster Risk Management seeks to avoid or minimize the negative impacts of natural disasters through prevention, preparation, response and recovery, with the aim of protecting people and resources.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Participants and tutors of the training program, citizens representatives of neighborhood risk management committees of the city of Villeta

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We ask participants to record their development process in a log, and then write a learning blogpost, with guiding questions that we offered. To collect citizens' opinions, we held a meeting where we validated the tool, and recorded videos with their comments.

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

5 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

The hypothesis was proven. During the internship, students responded to the challenge of implementing a technological solution that could assist in the rapid recording and assessment of damages and needs after a disaster. They chose the city of Villeta, a city close to the University headquarters, and worked closely with the Municipal Council for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction, which seeks to prevent or minimize the negative impacts of natural disasters through prevention, preparation, response and recovery, with the aim of protecting people and resources.

The students learned that the Council focuses mainly on the most vulnerable neighborhoods in the district, where each community has a coordinator in charge of recording risks, damages and needs, which are then sent to the Municipality, where the Management Council, responsible for coordinating assistance If necessary, you can use the information to articulate response efforts. It is a collaborative effort that involves the Municipality, other local institutions, the private sector and citizens, so transparency in the process is crucial. The chatbot was designed so that, in the context of an emergency, territorial coordinators can evaluate needs and route them as quickly as possible.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Two months

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

We wish to be able to work on risk management, in coordination with other programs of the country office

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Not right now

> Considering the outcomes of this experimental activity, which of the following best describe what happened after? (Please select all that apply)

- This experiment did not scale yet
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

An essential consideration in the development of GuarniBot was the geographical context in which the tool was deployed. In areas characterized by vulnerability and limited resources, access to technology is severely restricted. In recognition of this circumstance, a solution was devised that could be universally adapted. Given that mobile phones are prevalent among families in most instances, and text messaging is a familiar communication method, the designed solution aimed to ensure inclusivity.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

After conducting research, the team had formulated an idea for developing a chatbot, but they encountered several challenges along the way. Initially, the cost of implementing a chatbot, with the intention of deploying it on WhatsApp due to its widespread use, posed a significant hurdle. Despite multiple attempts to create a WhatsApp-based chatbot, the team ultimately decided to launch their first fully functional prototype on Telegram.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

It is our intention to take advantage of the knowledge and networks that we established in this experience for actions of the UNDP Social Inclusion program, which works on disaster risk management.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Throughout this developmental phase, the student team received support from various entities, including the UNDP Acceleration Lab team, mentors associated with Codeando México, and the Disaster Risk Management Council. The experience proved to be excellent for the team's professional growth, enhancing their understanding of the challenges faced by individuals residing in risk-prone areas. This endeavor facilitated the integration of theoretical knowledge gained at the university with practical, real-life challenges.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

From the users’ test conducted with Municipal Council coordinators and volunteers, we learned what are the most important features to improve in the next iterations of this tool:

1. Although the chat includes all national emergency contacts, it is also important to include local contacts.

2. The ability to access or automatically connect to the location and contacts of the contacts should be included based on the location of the reports.

3. The chat should provide the possibility to update contacts of community leaders and coordinators, as these individuals may change.

4. After large-scale weather emergencies, internet service can sometimes take a while to be restored, which means the chat may not be usable. Therefore, a functionality should be developed to allow users to temporarily save responses and then synchronize the information with the central database once the phone accesses a network, which can be located at strategic places during the emergency response.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

GuarniBot facilitates swift and efficient communication of early warnings regarding natural disasters or risk situations, empowering individuals to implement preventive measures promptly. The data gathered by the chatbot can undergo analysis, assisting authorities in making precise, data-driven decisions. Furthermore, it fosters citizen engagement by maintaining a real-time record of needs.

The developed chatbot exhibits universal applicability, suitable for use in any city or town. Its high adaptability allows for customization to align with the specific requirements of municipalities seeking to implement it. The team envisions that their experience will contribute to Villeta's emergency management capabilities and advocates for the widespread adoption of civic technology in risk prevention.
