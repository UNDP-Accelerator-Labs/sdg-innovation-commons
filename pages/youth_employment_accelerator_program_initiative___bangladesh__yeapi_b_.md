Youth Employment Accelerator Program Initiative – Bangladesh (YEAPI-B)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to design a scaleable online microcredential scholarship program for Bangladeshi youth to learn new digital skills demanded by the world IT-market which will accelerate their employment in the rapidly growing local business process outsourcing (BPO) market and better prepare them for the 4th Industrial Revolution.  

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The business process outsourcing (BPO) industry has grown at a staggering rate, and Market Watch projected a world demand of $353-billion by 2024, and only about half of the demand has been fulfilled by the market, and thus presents a big opportunity for the YEAPI-B initiative to address. India, the Philippines, China, Canada have been the leading BPO countries, and the demand presents a huge opportunity for Bangladesh youth to participate in this globalized market, offering its youth skills to the world market while staying in the country, while earning dollars for the economy—through the power of cloud computing and the internet.  The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and IT-enabled services in Bangladesh have been maintaining a double-digit Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the last ten years. Also, the domestic market share of local IT/ITES firms is growing rapidly, which is reducing the country's import dependency. Despite being much smaller than global offshore leaders like Philippines and India, the IT/ITES sector in Bangladesh has been demonstrating one of the highest growth rates indicating huge domestic and export potential. However, in order for Bangladesh to compete with the two powerhouses in the region—India and the Philippines—we need to ensure the availability of a large pool of skilled personnel that is proficient in the new digital skills demanded by the world IT-market and those required to provide services at the top of the BPO value chain. Currently, export earnings contribute only 20% as the local BPO companies mostly cater to the domestic market. For BPO industry to absorb Bangladesh youth entering the workforce and reduce urban educated youth unemployment in the country, a mechanism must be introduced to quickly upskill CSE/IT graduates with the most in-demand digital skills that would allow them to secure employment in the BPO industry and contribute to Bangladesh’s presence in the global BPO market.

Employment skill requirements is rapidly evolving with growth in the local BPO industry and demand changes in the world-IT market.  Demand for high-level digital skills is rapidly growing, while demand for mid-level digital skills is falling.  Tertiary graduates in Bangladesh struggle to find jobs and require upskilling.  Female graduates in Bangladesh are far more likely to be unemployed two years after graduation and are in need of targeted support and encouragement to continue pursuing a career in the ICT industry.  Long periods of unemployment are common for tertiary graduates in Bangladesh.  BPO employers in Bangladesh are seeking higher level technology skills.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The year of the covid-19 pandemic 2020 marks a departure from the past—majority of the 1.5-billion students went to study through online learning. Bangladesh is no exception. According to the UGC Online Survey of June 2020 together with ADB, around 96% of private universities in Bangladesh continued school via online, 32% among public schools. This shows that the appetite for online education has increased, and that it is timely to introduce an initiative like YEAPI-B.    Value Proposition: AccLab will carry out the relevant research, design, awareness raising, and promotion of MOOC to improve education and workforce development among youth in Bangladesh. AccLab will produce a Policy Brief where all learning will be summarized including relevant research, policy options and course of action on utilizing MOOC for professional workforce development. The AccLab is best suited for such value addition as it requires forming unusual partnerships, tapping into new data sources, co-designing innovative online microcredential scholarship pathways, generating new learning on skill trends and industry demands, and organizing innovation programs including hackathons. It is worth investing in this challenge because the learning that will be generated can contribute to reducing one of the major crises in Bangladesh - youth unemployment. The YEAPI-B challenge can create rapid skilling, is scaleable and holds the potential to impact hundred of thousands of youth, especially females by equipping them with the necessary skills to secure decent employment in the ICT/BPO industry. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Bangladesh AccLab is accelerating the employment of youth, especially girls in the ICT industry by designing a scholarship pathway for them to learn new digital skills and acquire microcredentials through leading online learning platforms.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

Pilot Stage (Year 1)   Step 1: Candidates selection of the Foundational Online Course.  An announcement of the YEAPI-B offerings to all universities and polytechnics will be broadcast by social media. Any student can apply for the single course. This foundational course in Google IT certificate course will be free. This course can actually immediately help the certificate holder with potential entry job in the market. For the pilot year about 1,000 learners will be selected.   Step 2: Training online using MOOCs-online course on Google IT certificate for 1,000 Scholarship places.  This will be for 4 to 6 weeks.   Step 3: Training online using MOOCs-online course on a Nanodegree Specialization. The top 1,000 learners will be selected for the second stage training on a chosen Nanodegree Specialization.  A typical Nanodegree Specialization takes about 4-to-6 months to complete.   Step 4: Job-market linkage to the BPO Market. Even before the completion of a Nanodegree, there will be a job-matching algorithm using data science and artificial intelligence to match the learner skills to the job market. This will ensure appropriate placement of the skills acquired to the needs of the market—including online job market fairs and matching with job boards in the world job market.   Scale up (Multi-Year Programme)  The Scale-Up Programme will be informed by informed by the year 1 pilot, and adjusting the programme based on learning experiences by the learners.   §  In the multi-year scale up, a total of 10,000 learners will obtain scholarship to take the Google IT certificate course, and the top 1,000 will be awarded with Scholarship to complete a Nanodegree Programme. At this scale, Bangladesh will be competitive in particular IT-skill area of specialization. The choice will be determined by an iterative process of matching skills to jobs in the global market, and informed by market signals from cooperating companies, and target technologies. The choices could be assisted by machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence.   CSE/IT Departments in public and private universities can play a critical role in achieving the above goals in the scale-up phase.
