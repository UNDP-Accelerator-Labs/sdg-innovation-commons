## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) Embedding innovation. One insight from the process [expanded through several learning cycles] of redesigning our public policy-making process through our support of the development of a ‘national development strategy’ #NDS in North Macedonia, is that national institutions and key societal actors were opened to embed innovation and adopt an approach towards the process with the intention to redesign how we design our strategic documents. In this process we proposed a methodology that was built on the pillars of:  i) building strategic policies as living document with embedded strategic aims and flexibility,  ii)  building these strategies as frameworks for experimenting, iii) pursuing strategies and policies that adopt a systems approach to development challenges. This methodological approach was [in July 2021] adopted by our Steering Committee comprised of all four deputy prime ministers of the country, MPs and members from the Academy of Arts and Sciences in North Macedonia.  2) Working on this process the Accelerator Lab learned, through mapping the existing national strategies that: a lot of them expire in 2020/2021, and that will inevitably leave a strategic policy gap, that will need to be filled. We also noted through that mapping exercise that existing strategies were all built within one institution [one ministry or government entity]. We also learned something that has been reported in EU reports but also other investigations from CSOs – which is the lack of coordination and communication among institutions in the development and implementation of documents like these, but also, the evident lack of communication from public institutions on the goals and progress of the activities in these strategies with the public. 3) Engaging the community. In the design phase of this process, we activated the nexus between national institutions; international and local expertise, CSOs and academia in a process of co-creation of the methodological outline we should follow when developing this policy. A methodology and governing structure that would welcome using new development models, adopt the principles of systems thinking, and propose a governance structure that would enable cross-silo work among national institutions. Guided by the principle of ‘leaving no one behind’ we ensured that the methodology includes engaging with vulnerable groups as a core stakeholder for this process.  4) Comparative analysis. In the design phase of this process, a comparative analysis was done, outlining the development of policies like these in our region, but also some other examples around Europe and internationally that would be useful for us. This document was not only useful for this process, but for our country office team as well.  5) Digital platform. In the design phase of this process, we also proposed a digital platform built on comparative experiences from other countries, as an enabler of a two-way communication between the national institutions and the citizens.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The key challenge for this process, was that soon after the government adopted the methodological approach and governance structure of the proposed model for the development of the NDS, we faced with instability in the government, which led to a change in the Government. We ensured that there was a transfer of knowledge between the institutions before the change was made, however we lost some time, waiting for an outcome of that restructuring.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

We used surveys and focus groups (as our first step) to learn more about the citizens’ perceptions about the public policy-making process. We focused on pursuing a survey with a representative sample of our country and did the focus groups with a particular focus on marginalized communities in our society. We wanted to hear directly from the citizens about what works and what doesn’t work in our planning processes and embed the improvements in our design.  We also mapped the key societal stakeholders, and created an engagement plan with them, based on that mapping exercise.   Throughout the process,  direct interviews with national institutions, were done in order to determine the capabilities within our institutions to carry out the development and implementation of the NDS.  We encouraged CSOs to produce documents that will give their perspectives on: the open data flows within our institutions, the interplay between the EU accession process and the potential development of the NDS, as well as the interplay between local and national development plans in our country.  We used visual 3D mapping within our country office, to better visualize the NDS process, inspired by a Prescing Institute training that we all attended.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

All of the methods mentioned above have not be used for this particular area thus far within our country office. So, colleagues and partners were very open towards using them because it gave us a different perspective of the issue,
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Our core partners were Civil society organizations from our country, that were included from the early stages of this process in co-creating with us and the partners a range of documents needed for this process. They also co-designed and gave insights that feed into the methodological proposal. 

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Within this process we collaborated with the Macedonian Academy of Arts and Sciences, that were a part of the Steering Committee for the development of the ‘National Development Strategy’, as well as a key consultation partner for us in the design phase of the methodological approach. We had several programmatic meetings with the Academy, mostly focusing on our idea to use the Doughnut Model of Economics as a building block for our methodological approach. They provided us with their analysis and reports within few thematic areas [environment and air pollution] as inputs for our preparatory phase of the NDS process.   Moreover, within the team of experts that we collaborated with, we worked alongside three professors from the state university in our country, all coming from the field of economics, with whom we did the mapping of strategic documents of the country in the realm of economics and business. 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Within this process we had consultative meetings with the Chamber of Commerce, as well as the consultative team of economists and private sector champions of the DPM for economic affairs – where we presented the design of our methodology for the development of the NDS.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Within this process, we collaborated with a series of government partners, including: the Cabinet and the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic affairs.  The DPM and his cabinet were our partners in this process, they participated in every step of the process, including our co-creation sessions for designing the methodological outline and governance structure of the NDS. They also worked with us on preparing the core documents that informed our proposal on how to organize the NDS formulation process. The DPM has been an advocate for our systems approach in designing public policies, and the tools that we’ve been using. He was invited by our regional office to take part in the ‘EU-UNDP Joint Partner Forum: Embracing Complexity & System Innovation, and its Implications’ where he advocated for the tools and approach, we have been adopting in our joint work. Within this process, we organized a working session with selected champions from our public institutions, a lot of them working within the sectors that we have envisioned to take an active part in the NDS. During this session we discussed the proposed methodological outline for the NDS, and our idea to enable better horizontal integration and dynamics among national institutions. We had representatives from the offices of the 4 Deputy Prime Ministers, the Secretariate for European Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and members from the academia, all contributing with ideas and commenting on our methodology and proposed governance structure.   In this process we were determined to collaborate with national organizations [mostly CSOs and members from the academia], as well as an international organization that will help us channel some of the latest thinking and development practices. We worked collaboratively with all of them, including our national partners and the British Embassy and RCO. Our co-creation meetings involved all actors.   

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Working closely together with the DPM’s office on the creation of a design phase of strategic document was new to our country office, and although we have other processes with his Cabinet, working on this was new. What was also unique was the method in which we organized the process, the combination of international and national organizations working with national institutions through our team on a co-creation process was not common for our country, so that was a special process for us. 

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

In this process we worked closely with the RCO office in our country, and with other UN agencies. Particularly we collaborated quite closely with the UNHCR team on developing the principles for the methodology that will ensure that no one is left behind from the planning process. We co-wrote one article together with their Innovation Lead and had them on board designing the stages of the process. We had several consultative meetings with our UNCT aimed at identifying the areas where other UN agencies can contribute to this process.  
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

In this process, we produced several new insights that were beneficial to the process, but also for our country office as a whole. The mapping of key strategic documents, as well as the key stakeholders in our society was useful for this process, but also identified potential interventions for our country office as well. Moreover, we used the Doughnut Model of Economics as one of the building blocks for our methodological approach, something that  has previously been adopted only at a city level, that allowed us to experiment with, when creating the methodology for the national strategy.  As many other countries, our society has been struggling with pursuing policies that span over the next elections and invite cross-sector planning and monitoring, so our methodology tackled that, and proposed principles that can easily be tranfered for the development of other documents and strategies.
