## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Nampaka Nkumbula

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

10 November 2022

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Informality, Financial and Digital Literacy, Impact of COVID- 19 on businesses and building resilience

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

In Livingstone, Zambia a baseline study carried out by UNDP revealed that Small Scale Cross Border Traders (SSCBTs) work in a fragmented and unstructured environment which is characterized by a plethora of challenges, chief among them being the inability to utilize digital solutions in trading, logistics and financial/savings management. The Covid-19 global pandemic has exacerbated these challenges by expanding a communication and logistical gap between SSCBTs, their suppliers, and transporters. Specifically in Livingstone, Zambia the Cross Border Traders income and participation on trade has been eroded by the lack of trading opportunities, thereby reducing their ability to restart their trading activities.  

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

We sought to learn whether bridging the digital divide could unlock trade barriers for women and youth small scale cross border traders in Livingstone, Zambia. The aim of the experiment is to understand the impact of the use of digital apps that aim to target the saving and trading constraints experienced by the CBTs. We hope to learn how providing CBTs, particularly women and youth, with access to these innovations will improve their trading practices and access to credit supporting their resilience in light of the disruption experienced by COVID 19 travel restrictions and associated costs have had on their businesses. The objective of the experiment is to generate learnings by testing interventions targeted at improving CBTs trading, resilience and livelihoods.

## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

1. We want to learn what the adoption patterns are of the Village Savers amongst the SSCBTs 

2. We want to learn whether using the Village Savers will improve the SSCBTs business continuity amidst COVID19 public health movement restrictions 

3. We want to learn whether using the Village Savers Apps improves financial Literacy and inclusion amongst SSCBTs 

4. We want to learn whether using the Village Savers will improve the SSCBTs livelihoods

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If SSCBTs are offered access to an online low-cost transparent savings model, then SSCBTs will improve their savings behavior and have access to low-cost credit 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Engage with CBT Association Select 100 CBTA Livingstone members, comprising of youth and women who trade in blankets, groceries, cooking oil, clothes, agriculture products, house furniture& appliances Introduce the interventions to all 100, training them in basic financial and savings management and allow 75 will self-select/ enroll to form the Treatment group by forming savings groups, 25 will make the control group.  Train the 75 on the use of the Village Savers app and have them participate in co developing the Market place app identifying the main suppliers  that need to be contacted and enlisted unto the app across the border

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

1) 18.2 % of CBTs reported that their businesses had grown during the Experiment period. 

2) 85% reported that they felt that village savers had an impact on the way they conduct their business by giving them a source of capital. 

3) On average savings had grown during the experiment period by USD 200 per savings group. 

4) The maximum loan an individual could access before the experiment was USD 70, by the end of the experiment an individual could access on average USD130. 

5) At endline 96.4% reported that participating in a savings group has increased their savings and 88.7% reported an increase in income. 6. 95% had attended the Financial Management and Literacy training conducted by Village Savers and benefits reported were financial discipline particularly on savings record keeping and knowledge on how to order goods online and sale online.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Alignment of data collection methods; Covid 19 travel restrictions; Community politics; CBTs Association lack of information on trade, tax, gender issues, lack of access to feature phones for the participants; digital literacy levels of the participants

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Projects working with savings groups; COVID 19 recovery projects; Projects aimed at improving financial literacy and access to TFI, projects aiming to improve social security of informal workers

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Projects working with savings groups; COVID 19 recovery projects; Projects aimed at improving financial literacy and access to TFI, projects aiming to improve social security of informal workers

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

Yes. The current experiment was a proof of concept and therefore many costs were subsidized for the use of the app, other iterations would have to be run to prove the business case of the innovation

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Although the Experiment was focused on increasing financial inclusion, CBT resilience and livelihoods, there is a need for complimentary interventions to support a conducive environment for the uptake of innovations. I.e consider supporting participants with digital skills training, hardware for access to digital solutions, increasing awareness of trading practices information on tax and improving relationships and trust with government immigration and tax agencies to facilitate trade

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Yes, Social Protection and Livelihoods for informal workers/traders, it would be important to consider only targeting economically active informal workers/traders.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The sense and explore heavily influenced the experiment, the initial design of the experiment was reshaped post community immersion (sense making) and during onboarding of different partnerships. Post experiment monitoring showed that the social protection programme and interested financial institutions were able to bring on board complimentary interventions for the sample. For example, the National Pension Scheme Authority (NAPSA) onboarded 20 CBTS onto the Informal Sector Social Security Scheme, post experiment. Steering Committe chaired by the local municipal and input in capacity building programs targeted to CBT Association members based on findings from the sensemaking.

> What surprised you?

1) Post implementation monitoring showed that of the five savings groups established for the experiment, 4 were still running savings cycles with an increased member pool. 

2) Trading items and countries CBTS trade with are dynamic in nature and change according to demand of goods, weather The results of the Post Implementation survey amongst the sample showed that from the endline (June 2022) to post implementation survey (September 2022) inter-country trade had increased from 36.5% to 40% and trade with Zimbabwe had also increased from 9% to 20% whilst trade from South Africa has reduced from 37% to 25%. This could be attributed to the change in weather as most of the goods brought in from South Africa are winter blankets and during the hot season due to lower demand of the product the traders begin to sell alternative goods such as Groceries, Home Appliances and Agricultural goods.
