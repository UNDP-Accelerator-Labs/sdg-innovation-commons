Community-Based Tourism for All Co-creation Journey
NOVEMBER 27, 2023
‘Small changes in understanding can create a lot of changes and impact many lives.’
Tourism is one of the main drivers of Thailand’s economic development. The UNDP Accelerator Lab has fostered Community-Based Tourism (CBT) as one of the main pathways to foster sustainable tourism by applying the principle of ‘by the local people for the local people’. However, the tourism landscape has changed rapidly in the past few years, calling for adjustments in the sector. Inclusive tourism is one that can have a major effect on the industry as global demographic trends are shifting. Thailand's tourism needs to foster this kind of tourism that allows everyone, regardless of their abilities, to enjoy the tourism experience – make it 'tourism for all'. This is not only to drive the Leave No One Behind agenda but also a market opportunity not to be missed.
Community-Based Tourism for All Co-creation Journey will take you on a journey toward various examples drawn from collaborative work between UNDP Accelerator Lab Thailand, DASTA, Nutty’s Adventures, Siam Rise, and the pilot communities in Sukhothai and Suphanburi. With the co-creation approach, persons with disabilities (PWDs) are involved in every step of the development process. You will be surprised at how working with users and key stakeholders can lead to innovative solutions that may have never crossed your mind before. It is also important to translate the lessons learned and efforts on the ground into the policies that foster Thailand’s tourism to move towards inclusive tourism and stay ahead of the curve in the global tourism landscape.
