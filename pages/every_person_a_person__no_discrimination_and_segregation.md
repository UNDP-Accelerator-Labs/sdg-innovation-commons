Our innovation is having a play park that Carters for children with special needs as well as children with no disabilities.
The park will have equipment  like swings, trampolines jumping castles seesaws, slides and other equipment that carters to the children with special needs as well as children without disabilities

A  well stocked restaurant where people can buy food and drinks
Have a section where parents with special needs children and adults visiting the play park who are interested, are taught simple sign language and how to take care and handle children with special needs.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The play park will generate income by charging an entry fee at the entrance for children without disabilities, adults and children with special needs so that there is no segregation or discrimination as well as charging a fee to host birthday parties and braiis.
So since there will be a well stocked restaurant at the play park, it will help the individual running the restaurant and the people supplying the food to also generate income.
Our target market is children with special needs and their parents but we are also encompassing children born without 
disabilities because we want them to know, understand and accept that even children with special needs (physical and intellectual disabilities) can do what other children do, be part of society and contribute to society instead of just being locked away in their homes.
The challenge prize will help the business grow through the income that the park will be generating which will help us improve and equip the park with better equipment as time goes by.
When it comes to the environment, we will ensure that all paper and plastic litter is recycled by putting labels on the bins so that the waste is thrown in the right bins.

> Technical Feasibility

Our implementation plan will start by buying a piece of land, registering our business with the relevant authorities and buying equipment for the play park.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our play park will help improve the lives of children with special needs by helping them to develop mentally and physically thereby improving their health and well being.
This innovation is relevant because it will help the children with special needs know and understand that their disabilities might  make them different but it does not stop them from doing what children born without disabilities can do. For children born without disabilities, it will help them understand that children born with disabilities should be treated equally and not discriminated or segregated against. Once that is understood, we will have a better society in future that encompasses and treats everyone equal despite the disability they are born with.
