Avec ces kits mobile de production du biogaz, chaque ménage pourra économiser en moyenne 4kg de bois par jours et donc 120kg par mois. Le kilogramme de bois coûte en moyenne 250fcfa donc 1000f d'économie par jour cet 30000fcfa  d'économie en moyenne par ménages et par mois.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

None for now. Just limited means of making the product readily available in the market
