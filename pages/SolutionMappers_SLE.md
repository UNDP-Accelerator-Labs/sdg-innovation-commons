# Solutions Mapping Accelerator Labs: Empowering Youth Innovators in Sierra Leone

### [[0:00\]\]So welcome to this interview\.

Thank you\.

### [[0:02\]\]Can you tell me your name and your position in the?

My name is Akinyemi Scott Boyle\. I'm also known as Aki\. I'm head of Solutions Mapping Accelerator Labs earlier\.

### [[0:14\]\]Thank you\. So Aki, my name is Hazel and I'm going to ask you a few questions regarding the R&D journey that you've experienced since the time you joined and now\. So could you give me the R&D story that you wish to share? Think about the title short title that you would want to give that R&D story\.

If I was to give it a title, I'll say something around ecosystem strengthening for young innovators\. I think that would be a title\.

### [[0:55\]\]So OK, so tell me about the R&D journey\. Where did it start?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
OK, so basically the story just culminates the work of the ACT lab since our inception and where we are currently\. And basically it starts off with the solutions mapping exercise we did and our solutions mapping process of identifying innovative solutions all around the country\. But because of the context of our country, we kind of really focused on young people\. We see that young people are mainly more involved in innovative practices, thinking creatively\. So we try to, let's say channel work focusing on youth\. So the basic part of the story is we did this solutions mapping, we had a database of solutions, different sectors, different focuses, waste management, energy, clean water\. So it was a broad spectrum of different solutions\. But we were basically thinking how we could support the ecosystem for innovative thinking and solutions rather than saying, oh, let's focus on one particular solution and see how we go\. So it's about supporting the ecosystem that these innovative solutions were being created in and were and how we and how we support them\. So one thing we found out after we did the solutions mapping, we went on solutions safaris to meet innovators, see their prototypes\. The level or standard of some of the prototypes were a bit low because obviously the young people did not have access to let's say proper materials or high or modern equipment to create a prototype\. So they were using scrap metal there what they can find there\. So it became difficult for us to say, OK, we like this solution, we like this idea\. Let's do an experiment on this, an example I would give a young man developed a PICO hydro system for electricity attached to like to be attached to like a water source\. But the generator of itself, it would have been unsafe, you say, to run an experiment on it\. So what we were thinking is like, OK, what we could do is support all the innovators in improving the design of prototypes\. The give them proper access to the materials they needed to develop these prototypes\. And apart from the physical design aspects of the prototypes, also give them soft skills where they could be able to, let's say, pitch about this particular solution and get them out there, you know, So what we were thinking is, look, OK, in Sierra Leone, everything is supposed to cost on Freetown, Freetown, Freetown, capital city, bright lights\. We needed to have spaces in the regions where these innovators could go if they have an idea\. And let's basically build and break and design and improve the designs of their prototypes\. Yeah\. So this came up\. This led to us basically having or designing an idea of having regional hubs, regional innovation hubs to support the innovation ecosystem\. And this in turn led to UNDP designing a program around the Unipod, OK, which the accelerator lab was at the forefront of, let's say designing the proposal and our approach was\.

The UNIPOD, yes, it's based in Freetown\. It's about innovative space within the universities\. Let's try and do something like that in the regions and they can feed into this main facility\. So it's like a hub and spoke approach\.

### [[6:10\]\]OK, yeah\. All right\. So I have two follow up questions\. Of course we've talked about interacting with ecosystem\. I would want to know if you used any tools or methods or skills to engage the ecosystem for this program\.

[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Working with ecosystems]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
So obviously the ecosystem we have the different actors for the innovators of course we as I mentioned we did a grassroots solutions mapping where we developed a tool trained some local leaders through the district councils to go into their communities basically sensitise communities on let's say collating or describing what they were, what innovative solutions were happening within their communities\. So that was one of the tools we used, one of the methods we methods we used\. We also had a toll free line where people with innovative solutions can call and they would have direct contact with someone in the lab who could transcribe what they were explaining that their innovative idea or prototype or solution that they have\. From there we would go out to them and conduct face to face interviews, see the prototypes they developed and how they how they worked, how it could be improved and how we could, let's say work with them to, if possible, run an experiment on it and see what we could learn from it\. So that was for the innovations part, for the partnerships, it was basically just being very intentional in meeting with the key actors within the ecosystem\. So luckily for Sierra Leone, we have University Limcoquin which is a Malaysian university, but it's it's it's based in SIA, Leon\. And their focus was really on creative technologies\. So they had a real let's say background in in design, in computer aided design\. They were the partner who really brought that in for the innovators in terms of designing on a computer and then fabricating\. After that we worked with entrepreneurship support organisations because we wanted to give the innovator soft skills to, as I mentioned, build a business model around a particular solution which they had\. One thing we found basically there are no new ideas\.

### [[9:28\]\]There are no new ideas\.

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
Most ideas like the young people are coming, you will probably seen them somewhere before, but it's how you relate that particular solution within your context, within your community\. That's where the innovation really comes in\. So it was about validating your business model for your let's say community where you are your that that business model maybe in the city would fail, but in your community the particular business model you have for your solution could make it successful\. So that's how we really try to build the partnerships around that having the different stakeholders to supporting that\.

### [[10:13\]\]OK, So that was my follow up question, my second follow up question\. So you have actually answered the two questions that I had\. But looking back to what you have explained on setting up an innovation hub at country level where these innovators which are an ethic or who you are an ethic could be assisted in terms of refining their innovations and linking them to business development opportunities\. Is there specific development issue that you see this innovation hub is addressing or there are multiple development issues that you're targeting to address\.

[[principles:Always increase social capital]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[skills:Creativity]]
Well for us we were working around the youth employment perspective\. Sierra Leone has a very large youth population and unemployment and underemployment is really large\. So there is a lot of university students who are not being employed, not being employed in fields where they have studied\. And there's also a lot of unemployment from young people who have not gone to formal education\. So our thinking was, look, the only way we see that we could help was to get them the frame of mind of how can this solution bring me a livelihood?

### [[11:50\]\]Yeah\.

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tools:GIS systems]]
[[tools:Design]]
So that was the reason why the, look, the focus was really more on the ecosystem rather than saying, OK, this particular solution is in water, let's address because if you if we're taking every single solution and saying, OK, let's do a particular address a particular challenge from each of these solutions, it would have been, it would have been a lot\. So we were just trying to see how could we do something more encompassing that would support a larger group of young people where the focus will be on improving their livelihoods with the solution that they have, that supports their community and also gives them a living\. And when established a goal, they can actually create jobs for other young people as well\. So that was really our focus in terms of developmental challenge\.

### [[12:51\]\]All right\. OK\. So looking back on your journey, what you have explained so far, you started with an ethane local solutions, building that, building the solutions into a database and then moving forward into building a project which provided the platform for these innovators to refine their innovations and scale them to market\. Looking at this journey, are there things that you would do differently if you would start again, if you understand what would we do differently?

[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
That's a that's a tough question\. What would we do differently? I think I should have thought about this question before so, so now the accelerator lab is thinking more open R&D rather than I think that approach we were doing was focusing on specific artisanal solutions, although the main focus wasn't really on the solution rather on improving the livelihood of the innovator in themselves\. So looking at the open R&D approach, maybe we could have focused let's say on a particular area, let's say be more data\-driven in terms of the innovators we supported and why? Because it was, it was general in terms of the potential or what people thought, OK, this, this innovation is a novelty in as I said, nothing is new but is a novelty for that particular area or the country\. And maybe having it more focused and having more data\-driven to say, OK, let's have let's focus on five solutions at just this area and building partnerships around that specific sector\. So although we did work with the government agencies in terms of when we were running our experiments, if we had an experiment in agriculture, we would involve the Ministry of Agriculture\. But for the whole, let's say supporting the ecosystem, maybe we could, I don't know, maybe be a bit more intentional in focusing on a particular solution or solutions that address a particular challenge\. I don't know if that makes sense rather than just having abroad and really focuses on the livelihood approach\.

### [[16:24\]\]So looking at what you have just shared and in terms of the project that you're working on now, is there a room for you to add these other reflections of what you do?

[[principles:Transparency and Honesty]]
[[principles:Prioritize transparency in methods and openness in sharing data and results]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
Oh, yes, definitely\. So now we're definitely picking up our signals from government partners\. So for example, currently there's a really big push for digital skills and Interion\. So we we've partnered with the National Cybersecurity Coordination Centre in Sierra Leone Agency and they want to really build up the capacity base for cybersecurity in country because it's very weak\. So for that to start that off, we are going to do like focusing more on data collection from the universities, the lecturers and the students to see what level they are currently in terms of cybersecurity\. And then from the design, how we can go around the approach of design, how we go about implementing that particular project\. So this comes back to what Charlene mentioned yesterday about are we project, are we all project managers now\. So it's a bit difficult\. We're moving in\. We're trying to be solution mappers, but then we have to go a bit with what the government agencies and the development partners are asking for\. So it's a delicate balance\.

### [[18:13\]\]OK\. So here's all right\. It's time\. Thank you\.

Thank you\.
