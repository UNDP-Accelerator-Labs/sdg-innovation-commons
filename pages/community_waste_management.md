## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

The activity intend to test the behavior change and the adoption of a new community waste management system that value the recycle and organic waste 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF the citizen see the value in managing their organic and recycle waste  THEN they will be actively engaged in community waste management. SO THAT they can get incentive from the Community Waste Management structure to reduce their waste collection fee or other benefits. SO THAT the community would have a more efficient and self-sustain waste management structure. SO THAT less waste end up in landfill, burnt or littered

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

- Baseline survey on community behavior on waste management - Identify the "Waste Champions" using persona of the Rapid Ethnography Study - Training of Trainers to the "Waste Champions" - Co-design and installation of the recycle bins and homebiogas system - Testing of the usage of the facilities

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Quantity of recycle waste collected and sold Quantity of organic waste collected and transformed Number and frequency of people using the facilities

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

QR code scan on the facilities Weighting of recycle waste sold to Wongphanith Weighting of liquid fertilizer sold 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

3 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 50-99

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

60% of the time of the experimenter.
