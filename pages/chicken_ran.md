> Brief description of the innovation

I Choolwe Phiri, a second year engineering student at the University of Zambia came up with the idea that my friends and I who are fellow students at UNZA as well could start raring chickens as an alternative way of generating money to help us with the daily money related issues we face as students.
My uncle already owns a small chicken ran but has more than enough room that we could use to rare our own the picture I'll upload under prototype is a picture of the chickens he's currently raring.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The money we will generate from raring the chickens will help us with the daily financial challenges we face as students .
Our target market are the students them selves and the staff members at school.
We intend to create a delivery system as well so that we can simply deliver the chickens to the students as soon as the make an order

> Technical Feasibility

A chicken ran big enough to rare 300-500 chickens is already available
All that's require the the capital to buy the chicks, feed, drinkers, feeders, medicines and of course an amount to pay someone to watch over the chickens during the time we're in school

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation improves the students lives in that they'll no longer need to walk long distances to buy chickens 
They'd be able to save energy and time because we could simply deliver the food to them
