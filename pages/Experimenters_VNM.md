[[ai_summary:Giang, head of experimentation at UNDP Vietnam, discussed an R&D activity aimed at transforming fossil fuel motorbikes into electric vehicles for daily goods delivery in ancient cities in Vietnam. The experiment involved collaborating with local partners, including a People's Committee and Research Institute under the government, to develop tools and methods that catered to shippers' needs. Key principles guiding the project included putting beneficiaries at the center of design, adapting and changing as needed, and ensuring inclusivity through diverse stakeholder mapping and engagement. The experiment ultimately led to improved CO2 emissions, economic benefits, and increased public trust in UNDP's work, as well as enhanced city reputation among tourists. To improve future endeavors, Giang would prioritize spending more time on consultation with stakeholders and government partners to ensure quality and timing of the project.]]

# "Transforming Vietnam's Last Mile Delivery Service with Electric Vehicles"

### [[0:00]] I'm recording, but what I want to ask you first is for your consent to say your name, your title\. And I give consent to be recorded today\.

Yeah, Yeah\.

### [[0:16]] Say your name\.

Yes\. OK\. My name is Giang\. I'm head of experimentation, UNDP Vietnam\. I'm concerned that you can make record, but when it publish maybe I need to ask my RR permission for sure\.

### [[0:33]] Yeah, we will\.

Yeah, OK\.

### [[0:35]] We won't put it out without your information\. All right, if the floor is yours\.

### [[0:39]] OK, thank you\.

Thank you\.

### [[0:40]] Then could you tell us about an activity, an R&D activity that you would like to share?

Yeah, actually we have a quite a lot of R&D activities\. I want to share the most recently activities that we have done in an ancient capital in Vietnam is where city\. So we conduct a small experiment to transform supers that who deliver groups and groups everyday by motorbike and they use fossil fuel motorbike\. And now we want to test if they can be transformed to electric motorbike to ship goods every day\.

### [[1:32]] OK, so, so when did you start this?

I started it last year\.

### [[1:39]] And what did the situation look like? Yeah, Before you started the experiment?

[[tactics:Asset mapping]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Allies and champions]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
Yeah, we make a research and we understand that the last mile delivery service is in, in Vietnam mostly used by motorbike\. And because we have very small lanes, more road to the houses\. And that's why shippers use mostly motorbike to ship their goods\. And it emits a lot of CO2 and the CO2 emission is quite high for that delivery service\. And we work with our colleagues at the time, they also run an E mobility project in that city, but they haven't thought of shippers\. They just want to promote EEV for whoever won that vehicle in the city\. But then we see that the shippers who deliver goods by motorbike every day we emit more CO2\. And that's why the idea start and, and after the three, three months experiments, we had some result to confirm the benefit of transforming from fossil fuel vehicle to electric vehicle to reduce CO2 emission and also to gain better economic benefit for the cheapest\.

### [[3:17]] OK, so during you mentioned that you were working with your colleagues, So these were the colleagues in the country office\.

Yes\.

### [[3:26]] Were there any other partners that joined you in this journey?

Of course, the idea started at the office but inspired by our local partner is a People's Province of People's Committee who committed to build a greener city and design A circular economy road map for that city\. So we work with Research Institute under that province\. We also have different high level meetings with the vice chairman, the chairman and they all always support for what UNDP do there especially towards sustainable development goals\.

### [[4:14]] Did you work with government partners at all?

Yeah, that that Research Institute is under the government and it's the government institute\. They are very active\.

### [[4:24]] OK\. And could you tell us about your tools? What tools did you select as part of this journey?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Human centering and adaptability]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
It's, it's not only a journey with shippers that using motorbike to ship goods everyday, but it's also a journey to transform public servants\. Because firstly, when we started with them, they, they also felt overwhelming with a lot of meetings, long meetings and long discussion\. But step by step they understand that it's helpful\. So we introduced to the public servant different tools that we used, including how we design the experiment, the AP testing, the simplest 1, the AP testing and the design thinking, how to think, how to think differently instead of justice, focusing on the shippers, but look at widely to see different stakeholders among that shippers\. To understand deeply the system and how it work and who involve and who we can influence and who can influence the whole system and ethnography research we use when we work with shippers to interview them, to observe them on during their daily work\. To understand what they do and what they think is consistent or not or what is the difference and what motivation that encourage them to transform or what is what are the barriers that prevent them from transforming to other electric vehicle\. Yes, that is the basic tools that we use, but during and also other tools for meetings that like we facilitate workshop\. So it's the common for our club\. But that's how to put a central human central design is also the way we put shippers and in the central of the whole design and implementation of the experiment\. So I think collaborating made it easier for you to gain their trust and adopt the methods and tools\.

### [[6:57]] Were there any instances where you had resistance from some of the stakeholders?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
Yes of course\. Whenever you change something, you make them change something new it needs time\. First we have two main stakeholder there is public servant and the shippers\. So the public servants at first not totally resistant, but hesitate to adopt new method to they are willing to do but a bit hesitant because they have to like job to be done quickly\. So but what we introduce let them what to be done can be can take longer time\. So at first they have some hesitance, but later they see it OK and they follow our guidance\. For the shippers after the experiment, they already see the result, the benefit of changing from fossil fuel to electric vehicle to ship daily but stay still hesitant because it's a big investment for them to invest\. So what we do at the at the time, we also have a rotating fund of the of that immobility project\. And we use that incentive for of like a starting phase to promote the, the uses of the EV for that shippers\. And step by step it work\. But at the beginning they, they feel not so confident about the quality, about the quality of the motorbike and also about the traction installation system\. Many, many question\. But later they see it work and they believe on that\. And the final result of this is the that project expand to other two cities with more and more shippers that want to join\. So we start with very small and it can expand more\.

### [[9:26]] So it was great that you had a minimum viable product to test and then it started gaining popularity so that other municipalities and cities started taking them over, right\. Could you tell us a little bit more about some principles that guided your R&D work?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
Yeah\. The key principle we use that we never impose what we thought in the design and during the implementation, because at the beginning we designed first version and then when we talk with more stakeholders, we cancel it and make a second one\. And then the third one is OK\. And during the implementation, when we observe the way they work and the way they interact with the, during the experiment, we address again\. So the first principle is that the put the, the beneficiaries, beneficiaries in the center of the design and adapt and change and always change to adapt\. That's not impose what we think in\.

### [[10:38]] And then I think speaking of that, were there specific initiatives or were you mindful of the inclusivity being a very inclusive, how did you address those issues? Were you mindful of that? Were there any other considerations that you thought about with regard to inclusivity and involving everybody in the project?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
Yeah, exactly\. It's the key of our work inclusiveness is to ensure the diversity and the collection of different view of different people\. Because with one problem, different people will look at it at different angers and that's different\. Make us go thoroughly and have a have a good design of the experiments\. So we involve all stakeholders\. We make the stakeholder mapping you as a tool and so another stakeholder map\. We use very small tool\. They cannot say all the stakeholder map to map all the stakeholder that can involve in the experiment\. Not focus only on the shippers, but many others can be involved, including the trader, the one using the online platform to trade their goods everyday and the delivery companies, the citizens, the governments and women unions, some others that can involve in that\.

### [[12:24]] OK, this is me\. This is this must be a very big initiative\. So I'm sure there are some specific skills that you could recommend that you used as part of running this experiment\. Would you mind telling me a little bit more about those skills?

I think first skill at all is the, the ability to empathize with all the, the stakeholders that involved in that journey\. Because once we empathize with them, we can build the trust and yes, everything can be solved\. Otherwise we will have different views and different expectation\. So when we emphasize deep enough, we can, we can balance the expectation of different parties\.

### [[13:22]] OK\. And then were there any other specific skills beyond doing, doing no harm, just making sure that you've been intrusive? Any other skills that come to mind?

[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Well being]]
[[principles:Give the space to others to shine]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
A skill that I always use is I always put my feet under with no sorry, I really put my feet under the other shoes to really understand what they really want\. And in my with all my message to them informally or formally, I always emphasize what they really need\. What is emphasizing what we offer is to solve that pinpoint or their needs, then it come closer to them\. So it's not only understanding where they're coming from, but also being able to be objective and also putting yourself in the shoes\.

### [[14:31]] Yeah, the people that you're working with and asking the right questions, right\.

Yeah, yeah\.

### [[14:39]] OK, great\. We're almost at the end\. And I want to ask a little bit more about what kind of impact did your experiment have?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tactics:Desiging the pipelines]]
Yes, the biggest, not the biggest, but one of the impact that we get does the bigger trust from the provincial government to our work\. After that's work, when we introduce another experiment related to low carbon tour for this area, they welcome and they and also they also welcome another idea to establish a policy lab within that province to do more experiments in the city\. And the second one, second one is the IT is by me a lot when I heard the shippers say about their experience when they when they join with us the experiment very honest\. They say when I when I use the electric motorbike to for my daily work now the dog stop barking neighbor neighbors stop blaming because there's no noise generated from that motorbike\. And then just something like that\. And the tourists when they see the shippers ship by E motorbike, they so they feel curious, but they also appreciate the way the shipper do\. So they are feeling proud of what they are doing and to view the greener city because that city is very famous on tourism in Vietnam\.

### [[16:32]] Yeah\. So it's contributed positively on all levels, right\.

Yes\.

### [[16:38]] OK\. What would you do differently if you had to do this entire experiment all over again? Is there something specific that you could have maybe reflected that?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
Yeah, even I when I prepared for the design, I already prepared such a long time to like for consultation with different stakeholders\. But in fact, in many situation I was requested to make it faster or the government partner have some pressure on time\. They have many other duties events at the same time\. So they cannot do the experiment as long as I wanted or with the quality that I expected\. So what I can do differently that I will spend more time to work also with the government and also with other stakeholder to, to notice them earlier about the, the, the duration and also the detail of work that we have to do\. Because experiment, experimentation is include a lot of details\. It's not simpler that's designed do A/B and then measure it\. It's a lot of details that they need to pay attention to\. So I still think that I need more time for that consultation in preparation to make sure that all parties understand about the workload and the timing and also the meaning, the meaning, the meaning of what we are doing so they can engage more\.

### [[18:37]] OK\. So to have a broader and collective purpose that would be owned at different levels, right? Is that what you're saying? Yes, So how? OK\. So and it's going to come to my last question, which is basically about the diffusion and catalyzation\. So what strategies or approaches would you recommend to, to basically facilitate a scaling of what you've done?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[tactics:Getting in there]]
[[tools:Design]]
Yeah, so actually what we have done is very small and also very small budget\. And if it's just stop there, it cannot be scaled up\. So first, internally we need to engage with other units, with other colleagues to plug in to, to talk with them, discuss with them and plug in at the beginning of the design of the experimentation to make sure that is a part of the program and later that that program can scale it up\. The idea that's first, first thing internally, externally, that's what we have done until now that we don't do by ourselves everything with the government, but we facilitate the government to buy in and do the experimentation with us\. So that's why the very policy lab was established and not officially, but was established in, in the paper 1st and then do some experiment to test\. And later when, when our club closed, we moved to another position\. The they can continue to do the experiments\.

### [[20:27]] OK\. That's what we aim\. OK\. I think that's great\. It's wrapping up\.

Yeah\.

### [[20:34]] Thank you so much for\.

Thank you\.
