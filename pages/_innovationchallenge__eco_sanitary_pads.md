This solution was mapped thanks to the third edition of the challenge "Innovating together for children and sustainable development", which aimed to boost solutions that had an impact on clean and affordable energy or solid and liquid waste management.
Sanitary pads made of cloth to replace the use of disposable products that currently dominate the market. Offering a solution that does not currently exist in Guatemala for users looking for annual savings, reduce environmental impact, or find a hypoallergenic product.
