> Brief description of the innovation

I am into fish farming, poultry keeping like piggery, broiler chickens, and ostriches. I grow local products like maize, tomatoes, vegetables, and cassava. the agricultural services are to promote nutrition and achieve food security Food and agriculture are the backbone of prosperity, wellbeing, and the economy. This innovation of improving agricultural services which are under SDG NO2  will help tear down the challenges faced by small-scale farmers like me in the agricultural systems. I have put up an irrigation system that is not cheap and easy to maintain. Agricultural  productivity increases would ensure food security for everyone only if access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food is secured. The business contributes to solving these challenges, eradicating hunger and improving food and agriculture systems. Implementing sustainable practices and working in partnership with other actors throughout the agricultural value chain (including input, production, distribution and retail) will be key to the implementation of SDG2.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will generate income for me, the economy, and others in several ways.
It will increase my income in the productivity of crops.
Increase in production of livestock.
Improvement in the efficiency of input use (cost saving)
Increase in crop intensity.
Diversification towards high-value crops.
Improved price realization by farmers.
The shift of cultivators to non-farm jobs.
Agriculture makes its contribution to economic development in the following ways: By providing food and raw material to non-agricultural sectors of the economy, by creating demand for goods produced in non-agricultural sectors, by the rural people on the strength of the purchasing power. 
Agriculture not only helps to feed the large population as the target market but also supports the principal manufacturing industries with raw materials as potential off-takers. it has created jobs for the local people. 
the target market are the Congolese from Sakanya boarder.The value addition of innovation to the environment is to provide employment opportunities for rural people on a large scale in underdeveloped and developing areas. The challenge prize will help me expand and raise the agricultural surplus caused by increasing agricultural production and productivity tends to improve social welfare, particularly in rural areas.

> Technical Feasibility

The land sits on a 5.5 hectares piece of land. l have fish ponds, piggeries, chicken runs for broilers, brooders, ostrich runs, goat stall, and field where l grow other products. With irrigation design, there are many ways to achieve this but the cost is the most important factor. Some fittings, such as valves can get very expensive, so minimizing the number of valves, and also the size of them is important. As the pipe size increases, the price increases exponentially. 
I grow some of our traditional crops such as maize, cassava, and banana as my production base to create a predictable cash flow, but I also try to test many new and exciting crops for the seasons. I constantly try to identify what else I could be growing. My new crops this spring were strawberries, spinach, carrots. Building upon your portfolio of crops is only one strategy in farming and marketing. When l have a lot of crops to offer the markets, l will become more valuable to them. The prototype that exists is fish ponds that l personally built. lt helps the locals to come buy food

> Anticipated Social Impact

Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of our country and many developing countries, and provides the main source of food, income, and employment to their rural populations. ... However, improvements in agriculture and land use are fundamental to achieving food security, poverty alleviation, and overall sustainable development.
The proposed innovation is relevant to the current market because of the high unemployment levels in our neighbouring country democratic republic of congo due to the civil wars that have evolved over the years. if the innovation is funded, it will create jobs for both the local people and the Congolese at the border.
