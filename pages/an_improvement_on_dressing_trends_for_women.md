> Brief description of the innovation

Fashion trends are changing. Zambians want a touch of tradition in their dress. Beaded jewelry coupled with traditional attire are the in thing. Demand is beating supply. I need to up my game by following technology trends in the product line. Otherwise customer confidence will be lost if demand is not met. More training, improved methods of manufacturing and marketing are required.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The products are currently being made and sold on a small scale. However demand is high, and it has helped to cushion poverty in my home. Despite the Covid 19 challenge, and economic pressure, people are ready to buy my products because of the relatively fair price.
The target market is women of all age groups. Especially ages 14 to 70. These gives us a very wide market and prospects of growing are very high. Men are in search of gives for the other gender, so our innovation is bearing fruit. we also need to up our game so that we can become trainers of trainers. More people would like to learn this trade. It's environmentally friendly, because there are no wastages or spirages. Every bead is of some us.

> Technical Feasibility

We have short term and long term plans. In the short term, we introduced the product on the market. The response has been overwhelmed. The wedding dresses designers would like to partner with us, but we can not satisfy the market as for now. This is because production is on a small scale and we have a challenge of durability of the bead work. They snap easily due to the method of finishing.
We have done the implementation, but we need capital injection in order to buy machinery for joining the ends nicely.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation, when successful, may employ teens of thousands of people. This would help end poverty on our people, especially the persons living with disabilities. These are the most marginalized because most of them have little education and in some cases they are in self denial.
