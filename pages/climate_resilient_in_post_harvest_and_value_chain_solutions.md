1. The CSAYN Hub Rwanda has trained over 600 young farmers on climate-smart agriculture practices, resulting in the adoption of these practices on over 1,000 hectares of farmland.
2. Through partnerships with microfinance institutions, the organization has provided access to financing to over 150 farmers, enabling them to invest in their farms and adopt sustainable agriculture practices.
3. The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices has resulted in a 30% increase in maize yields and a 50% increase in bean yields in some areas where the CSAYN Hub Rwanda operates.
 4. The organization has helped to establish 13 seed banks in border areas of Rwanda, which have distributed over 1,500 kilograms of improved seed varieties to farmers, resulting in increased crop yields.
