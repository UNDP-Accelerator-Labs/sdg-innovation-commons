## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Youth Ideathon: Enlivening ideas for youth entrepreneurship opportunities
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that Uganda has one of the youngest and most rapidly growing populations in the world, the country is at a risk of losing the potential benefits of the current youth bulge as many of the youth are unemployed or under employed due to the insufficient creation of decent jobs and skills mismatch. And while jobs are key to moving young people out of poverty, they are also crucial to preventing the type of disenfranchisement that can spill into radicalization and conflict. The few youths that are employed, are in vulnerable employment characterized by low pay and job insecurity. Our youth are not gainfully contributing to the economy despite their unique talents, passion and skills. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Some of the major reasons behind the high youth unemployment rate are attributed to the narrow formal job market and the fact that many youth lack employable skills, access to resources like land and capital. The youth also have a negative attitude and a poor mindset towards certain types of work, education and generally lack role models or mentors to inspire them. Additionally, the overall existing policies also continue to focus on creating job seekers and not job creators.  The education curriculum supports theoretical learning rather than practical and experiential learning.  More still we continue to witness Gender stereotypes where some jobs are perceived to be for a particular gender and some families do not educate their girl chils.  This has resulted into early marriages, teenage pregnancies, increase in crime rate, increase in alcohol and substance abuse, high rural-urban migration and increase in slums, high dependency burden, radical extremism, and poverty.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

The country’s greatest demographic asset is its young and talented youth (18 – 30 years) who constitute over 78% of the population. 80% of Uganda's Youth live in rural areas. With currently about 700,000 young people reaching working age every year, this will increase to an estimated additional thirteen million workers who are expected to enter the job market between 2017 and 2030. 8.8 million young people aged 15-24 years are not engaged in Education, Employment or under any training and 22% of the Adoloscents aged 13- 18 years have left school. The country’s young people if well harnessed are a powerful and rich resource for the country’s current and future social and economic development.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Most of the interventions are siloed hence not solving the actual systemic problems, with the Accelerator lab methodology, we intend to deploy new ways that leverage collective multi-disciplinary and multi-dimensional approaches to sense the current barriers, drivers as we design and co-create interventions.  Additionally, a number of interventions have been deployed to tackle the youth challenges, however, they are not gaining as much traction as they should and in some instances, the problem is getting worse. For example, Youth have widely been thought to be lacking the skills, competencies and knowledge to enter the workforce. This belief that the deficiency is on the labour supply side has resulted in skills interventions . But with no clear link to a real job in the labour market, young people do not find opportunities to apply  their newly acquired skills. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab is working to empower the youth of the country through creating opportunities for education and employment. Through the #Youth4Biz Facility, Youth IDEAthon and other initiatives driving youth innovation, #AccLabUG continues to work with key partners to support Uganda's youth.

We are partnering with the National Association for student Enterprises (NASE) to implement the Youth IDEAthon which presents an “entry-level” opportunity that helps to unearth and nurture creative early-stage and start-up ideas that can eventually feed into the current Youth 4 Business Facility pipeline for the country office. The Youth IDEAthon seeks to attract socially committed Ugandan youth, with entrepreneurial aspirations as innovators and problem solvers in a hybrid interaction and collaborative process of inspiration, mentorship and coaching to develop and refine their ideas for products, services and solutions that ease the way of doing things during and post-COVID 19 Pandemic.
