> Description of the solution

The Bangladesh Eco-cooler designed and developed by Ashis Paul uses thermodynamics Principle called Joule-Thomson effect. The simple air coolers are constructed using affordable, used plastic bottless. As hot air rushes into each plastic bottle, it is pushed to the rim where it begins expanding. This expansion then leads to the cooling in the air as it enters the target room. As air enters the plastic bottle wide part it comes out of the bottleneck with higher pressure and as it quickly disperses into the room its temperature drops.
