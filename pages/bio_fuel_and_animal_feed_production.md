The innovation is about the production of bio fuel and animal fees from groundnut shells and maize cobs . a study has been conducted that shows that groundnut shells can produce huge amount of bio fuel. What makes this project more viable is that these raw materials are in abundant supply as people don't use them commercially to benefit the society.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation is a direct creation of jobs in the society. This is because it will need people to operate the machines, some to gather the raw materials, some to be in charge of marketing, storage and administration. One person can not operate in this project meaning  it will involve the general public hence job creation.

> Technical Feasibility

This project will need some milling machines operated by the production unit. The plan is to start with company registration and other legal affairs with reference to fuel production, take on inspection certificates and permits, land and buildings agenda with the council.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Bio fuel is one alternative that is so dependable in economic growth of the country. This will benefit all Zambians economically as those that own automobiles will need the fuel and those that will be small scale producers will benefit aswell
