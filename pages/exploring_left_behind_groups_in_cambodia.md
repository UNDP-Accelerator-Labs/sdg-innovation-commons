## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

1. Five factors of LNOB (Discrimination, Socio-economic status, Exposure to shocks, Geography, Governance) are outlined below, and provide the basis for collecting evidence of left behind groups within specific country contexts.
2. There is an implicit assumption that the greater number of LNOB factors that explain the vulnerability of a given group, in a given context, the greater the risk that individuals within the group are left behind.
3. According to the LNOB country profiles published by ESCAP in 2022, inequalities are highest in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Vietnam with respect to i) access to (tertiary) education, ii) access to clean fuels, and iii) bank account ownership. In each case, such inequalities are associated with low-income rural populations.
4. While inequality in Cambodia is higher in urban rather than rural areas, the rate of the inequality increase between 2014 and 2019 was higher in rural parts of the country.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

We have finished the Sensing phase which includes the literature review of left-behind groups in Cambodia. This study is implemented by AccLab and the research firm. In January 2024, the key informant interviews and participatory group discussion with left-behind groups will be conducted, followed by the characteristics and intersectionality analysis of left-behind groups.

## Data and Methods

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

We have used the Five Factors LNOB Framework to define who are left behind groups in Cambodia.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The intersectionality analysis of the left-behind groups plays a crucial role in defining appropriate interventions to close the LNOB gaps.
