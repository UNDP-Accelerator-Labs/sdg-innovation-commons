> Title of the innovation

Livestock Feed Production

> Brief description of the innovation

Most Livestock farmers are Searching  for good and cheap food and food supplements for their livestock. The providers who are on the market are too expense, as a result of the high prices of feed livestock farmers are discouraged. to get and expand the Livestock Production in Africa, especially Zambia.

We have decide to start the Livestock Feed Production project, which is centered at inverting the best and cheap technologies to produce Livestock Feed, and supplying the feed at the cheap price to the farmers in order to boost Livestock Production in Zambia, especially to the youth.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Livestock feed production make a major, although largely underestimated, contribution to rural development in developing countries. They produce food, enhance crop production and provide additional economic goods and services as well as cash income. The inclusion of livestock feed and livestock diversifies and increases total farm production and income, provides year-round employment and disperses risk. Sales of livestock products provide funds for purchasing crop inputs and for financing farm investments. Livestock often form the major capital reserve of farming households and, in general, enhance the economic viability and sustainability of a farming system.
