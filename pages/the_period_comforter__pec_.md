> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

After proper development of the innovation, marketing the innovation and providing services to meet the customers needs, pricing the innovation according to  how affordable it can be purchased and also reducing the costs spent in production .  This can boost my profits and my sales. Other existing businesses  such as technical, electrical  and maintenance businesses can improve  because in producing alot of products , electric components will be required, technical functions and tests will be required and also maintenance team will be needed to test the product thereby improving others businesses.  Materials will be purchased from these businesses there by increasing sales and also employment of maintenance personnel.  My target market are gynaecology clinics and hospitals, pharmacies and chemists, reproductive health organizations and physiotherapy clinics, some schools and the public. The challenge prize will help develop the innovation properly so that it can be properly marketed  and also increase the products of the innovation. The prize will also help start up the business. The innovation can help reduce the use and disposal of plastic bottles that are sometimes used to ease the pain.

> Technical Feasibility

The period Comforter is in three parts; the head brace , the body suit and the bracelet.  The head brace is a band like device that contains vibrators responsible for massaging the stress nodes of the head .  The body suit contains an electric pelvic bag, vibrators, electric motors and heat patches. The electric pelvic bag is responsible for providing hot or cool conditions to ease the pain in lower abdominal area and to ease the pain especially during cramps. The motors and vibrators are responsible for massaging the stress points in the limbs, the back , neck and feet while the heat patches is used to reduce 
 swelling in the ankles and the feet. The bracelet will be used as a controller for the suit and brace, functions are to be added to it to provide options the user can pick to suit thier needs. The innovation  is still being developed and assembled but it will be tested and will tested for marketing to the some customers to see the value and how valuable it is and if it meets thier needs.

> Anticipated Social Impact

This innovation will improve the mental, physical and reproductive health in females. It can be used by females:on their monthly period, with fibroids,that have reached menopause, with gout and arthritis, urinary tract infects. People with stroke can use this device for therapy at home . Because these tend to reduce the  work productivity in women and also some girls and women tend to miss school, work and exams because of the unbearable pain and some don't even perform as expected  due to the pain  this innovation may be use to avoid these situations. This innovation is important to the current market because it can increase revenue, increase employment rates and also the increase functionality of other existing business.
