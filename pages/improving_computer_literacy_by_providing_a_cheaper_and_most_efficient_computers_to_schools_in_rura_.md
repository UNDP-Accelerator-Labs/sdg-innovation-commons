> Brief description of the innovation

With introduction of Computer education in all Schools county wide, which is necessitated by rapid increase in Technology advanced there will s an urgent need for every learner to have basic Knowledge of computer skills and at basic computer programming. The major challenge has been provision of computers/Laptops that are fast enough to help learners. My Innovation is based on a high tech Raspberry Pi 4GB RAM running an ARM CORTEx processor. It has WiFi, Ethernet, Bluetooth and it comes with basic programming languages and tools such as Scratch, Wolfram and Python.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

With introduction of Computer education in all Schools county wide, which is necessitated by rapid increase in Technology advanced there will s an urgent need for every learner to have basic Knowledge of computer skills and at basic computer programming. The major challenge has been provision of computers/Laptops that are fast enough to help learners. My Innovation is based on a high tech Raspberry Pi 4GB RAM running an ARM CORTEx processor. It is fast and it runs on Linux, it will enable the learning of computer skills by students very easier. Teaching will be aided and learners will be exposed to a lot of high technology that will motivate even more.

> Technical Feasibility

It’s based on a Raspberry Pi an SoC chip. It has a 7” display. It is housed on a 3D plastic modeled plastic cover. It has 4GB  RAM and has Linux based office suite called LibreOffice and multiple programming tools for basic programming skills suitable for learners.

> Anticipated Social Impact

It will enable all the learners to have quality computer  resources especially in the rural areas, it will also motivate teachers due to presence of this high end technology but most importantly it will bring about a culture of Programming and software development due to exposure of kids to this technology in their High school.
