Transdermal patch that will deliver ARVs slowly into the body. A transdermal patch is a medicated adhesive patch that is placed on the skin to deliver a specific dose into a blood stream. The patch will be short term which will deliver the drug up to 7 days. This patch ensures that patients will no longer be required to take the drugs on a daily basis.
