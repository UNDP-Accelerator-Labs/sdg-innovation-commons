The solution is the cooperation of several neighboring restaurants that share the kitchen to keep the business running. Due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, many restaurants in Georgia were closed. Lack of customers and the bargain of the regulations made the business unprofitable. To maintain the business open and at least some of the staff, three neighboring restaurants decided to run only one kitchen that would serve all three menus. The solution required a rearrangement of tables to meet the Covid-19 restrictions and create a menu-bundle. Shared space allows them to receive more visitors, while at the same time keep jobs of at least some of the personnel.
