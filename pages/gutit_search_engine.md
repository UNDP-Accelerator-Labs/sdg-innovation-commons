> Title of the innovation

Gutit Search Engine

> Brief description of the innovation

Gutit is a globally inclined, privacy-based commerce search engine cutting across local, national and international business entities. The search engine revolutionizes search results ranking methods from  cost-driven predicates that dilute the quality of search results to the end-user, to simplified, cheaper and consumer-driven (consumer satisfaction and quality) predicates for business entities, while also improving the quality of search results to the end-user. This is achieved through the platform's encrypted e-wallet and conference chat components used in the keyword-moderation process that directly affects business entities' search results rankings. Gutit, through its encryption-based email system revolutionizes global email communication, where no user email records or login (private key) credential records shan't be maintained by the company, guaranteeing the user and business entities freedom from subpoenas from any governmental agencies across the globe as well as hacking. The platform's encrypted browser guarantees secure web-browsing.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Gutit's revenue model shall be via keyword sales, for those business entities that attain preset consumer satisfaction and quality thresholds; advertising, email subscriptions for business entities and consumers alike; and corporate email subscriptions. Business entities shall have less need to pay exorbitant rates for Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of their websites to gain their way up in search results, as consumers will play a role in either propping their websites up or down, depending on consumer satisfaction. The target market is two fold: First, businesses whose need and want is reduced SEO cost and ease of carrying out the tasks they usually pay SEO companies to get their websites ranked high for keywords online. The second target market are business entities and consumers whose need and want is online privacy and secure global email communication. The challenge prize will be critical in further development of the product to include video and audio aspects to the conference chat as well as development of mobile apps as currently, the platform is only  web-based.

> Technical Feasibility

The search engine is designed in a list- and- map-search fashion, with integrated  encrypted email, browser, chat and e-wallet subsystems. The prototype ready is that of the email, chat (text for now), and list-and-map-search. The launch road map entails Zambia as the first market and Nigeria and South Africa as the second market, while the developed markets become the third market through an assortment of go-to-market strategies, including virality, magazine and newspaper publications, radio, etc.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Millions of jobs shall be created globally through this innovation as people, regardless of their gender and age, shall be able to sign up on the platform and work from the comfort of their respective homes on their own computers and smart phones as  keyword moderators, agents and supervisors. These folks shall be paid according to how much work they do. Moderators in each country/state will fall under a specific set of supervisors. There
