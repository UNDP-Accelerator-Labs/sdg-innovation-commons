MDM WASTE MANAGEMENT is a waste collection company that collects waste with aim of fighting climate change and waterborne diseases,,we collect waste from households, companies,Lodge's, schools etc

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Through the collection of waste, our customers pay a sum of k100 per month for collecting waste for them by doing so we generate revenue, and with the covid 19 , we have developed an application called MDM-EWASTE, that enable us to easily locate our new customers and also it helps them to make payment online to avoid hardcash which can spread the infection, the application operate in the same way an UBER operates, only with us, we have a platform were clients can interact and also do business using our application, in other words we also provide our CUSTOMERS to our CUSTOMERS who are doing different businesses. This is something different we have brought in the waste collection industry, the application also provides an education platform that aims at educating our customers on the dangers of waste mismanagement, and the dangers of climate change, that comes as a result of not taking good care of the environment.

> Technical Feasibility

The waste collection company and the application are currently working, though the application is not yet on Google play store due to financial challenge, but it's in a zip which is only unveiled to our customers. The waste collection is designed to collect waste every Monday in households and other INSTITUTIONS, we have 1 light 2 tone truck that we use to collect waste with, and 3 youths that are employed. The application has a prototype and his used as earlier explained in the previous answer box.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Our country as in many years been said to be one of the dirtiest country, which is attributed to the how many times we have had chorela and how many people have died due to the same infection. With the local authorities having few machineries to fight waste mismanagement especially in households, we thought that it is important to step up as youths to create a private waste collection company to help the community and local authorities educate people on waste management and collect waste especially in homes, so that our city can be clean and green. We believe that what makes us more relevant.
