## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 



Local Engagement is Crucial: Engaging with local government officials, such as Mr. Ekwaranyu Amrapal, can lead to valuable insights and potential collaboration opportunities. Their firsthand experiences and willingness to support initiatives can be instrumental in addressing the challenge effectively.

Innovation and Customization: The development of a three-wheeled motorcycle tailored for people with disabilities highlights the importance of innovative solutions. Customized vehicles can significantly improve the mobility and independence of individuals with disabilities, and this innovation has the potential to transform lives.

Awareness and Advocacy: Despite existing laws, low awareness and compliance regarding accessibility issues persist. This emphasizes the need for awareness campaigns and advocacy efforts to not only create awareness but also streamline legal processes and promote compliance. Collaborative efforts with stakeholders can drive change in this regard.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)


- Our work has led to a significant change in public policy at a national or local level
- Our work has been picked up by UNDP or the government and has now expanded geographically in our country

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?



Empowering Communities of Riders with Disabilities: To empower communities of riders with disabilities, the UNDP Accelerator Lab can collaborate with local disability advocacy groups and organizations. These partnerships can offer training sessions, workshops, and skill-building programs for individuals with disabilities interested in riding customized motorcycles. These sessions can focus on safe riding practices, vehicle maintenance, and addressing the specific needs of riders with disabilities. Moreover, the Lab can work on establishing peer support networks where experienced riders can mentor newcomers, providing valuable guidance and encouragement.

Engaging Garage Mechanics: Collaboration with garage mechanics is crucial to ensure the maintenance and repair of customized motorcycles. The Lab can organize training programs for mechanics to equip them with the skills needed to work on these specialized vehicles. Additionally, creating a network of certified mechanics who are knowledgeable about accessible vehicle modifications can help riders access reliable services. Providing incentives or recognition for mechanics who actively support this initiative can also encourage their participation.

Creating Awareness for Government Officers: Raising awareness among government officers is vital for streamlining legal processes and promoting compliance with accessibility laws. The UNDP Accelerator Lab can organize seminars, workshops, or training sessions specifically for government officials responsible for transportation and disability-related policies. These sessions can highlight the importance of accessible transportation and the benefits it brings to the community. Engaging local government bodies and advocacy groups can facilitate these awareness efforts and promote collaboration between government agencies and disability organizations.

Creating Awareness for the Public: To create public awareness, the Lab can initiate awareness campaigns and events. These campaigns can include public demonstrations of customized motorcycles, accessible transportation expos, and educational materials. Leveraging social media, local media outlets, and community events can help disseminate information about the challenges faced by people with disabilities and the solutions being implemented. The Lab can collaborate with local influencers, disability activists, and celebrities to amplify the reach of these awareness campaigns and promote a culture of inclusivity.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?



Interviews: Interviews with individuals with disabilities, government officials, mechanics, and other stakeholders provide qualitative insights that official data sources may not capture adequately. These interviews can uncover personal experiences, challenges, and perspectives that shed light on the lived experiences of people with disabilities regarding mobility and accessibility. This qualitative data can help identify nuances, barriers, and unmet needs that quantitative data might miss.

User Journey Data: User journey mapping involves tracking and documenting the entire process that individuals with disabilities go through when using transportation or attempting to access various facilities. This method helps identify bottlenecks, pain points, and areas where accessibility falls short. It provides a holistic view of the mobility challenges faced by individuals with disabilities, including their interactions with different stakeholders and the emotional aspects of their journeys. This data complements quantitative data sources by offering a more comprehensive understanding of the problem.

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?



Learning from Existing Innovations: Identifying and learning from individuals or organizations that have already worked on similar solutions provides a wealth of knowledge and experience. This approach allows the UNDP Accelerator Lab to tap into existing innovations and leverage the expertise of those who have faced similar challenges. By understanding what has worked and what hasn't in the past, the Lab can avoid reinventing the wheel and build upon successful approaches.

Unpacking the System: Solution mapping involves identifying key stakeholders, processes, and components within the system related to the challenge. By connecting with individuals or organizations involved in modifying motorcycles for wheelchair users, the Lab can better understand the ecosystem surrounding accessible transportation. This includes recognizing the roles of mechanics, government regulations, user needs, and potential barriers. Unpacking the system in this way helps in identifying bottlenecks, areas for improvement, and potential collaboration opportunities.

Validation of Ideas: Learning about the innovations and challenges faced by others in the field provides a reality check for the Lab's own ideas and initiatives. It allows for a practical assessment of the feasibility and viability of proposed solutions. If similar innovations have faced certain challenges, the Lab can proactively address those issues in its own initiatives.

Building Collaborative Networks: Engaging with innovators and experts in the field of motorcycle modification for wheelchair users can help build a collaborative network. These connections can be invaluable for future partnerships, knowledge sharing, and access to resources and expertise. Collaboration with those who have experience in the domain can accelerate progress and increase the likelihood of successful outcomes.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?



Gain Deeper Insights: Innovation methods like solution mapping and engagement with unusual partners brought real-world experiences and expertise into the learning process. This depth of understanding would not have been possible through traditional research alone.

Access Rich Qualitative Data: New forms of data, such as user journey mapping and interviews, provided qualitative insights into the lived experiences of individuals with disabilities. These personal perspectives enriched the data and uncovered nuances that quantitative data could not capture.

Unlock Local Knowledge: Unusual partners, like Royal Enfield and government officials, brought local insights, networks, and resources to the table. Their involvement facilitated access to on-the-ground knowledge that would have been challenging to obtain otherwise.

Facilitate Holistic Learning: The combination of these elements allowed for a more holistic and multidimensional understanding of the mobility and accessibility challenge. It enabled the Lab to consider diverse perspectives, innovative solutions, and practical challenges, leading to more comprehensive insights and potential solutions.
