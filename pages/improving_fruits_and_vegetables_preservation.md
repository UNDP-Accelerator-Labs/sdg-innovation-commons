## Title

Improving fruits and vegetables preservation
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that we want to make available to stakeholders on the fruit and vegetable supply chain, the most efficient and cost-effective means of maximizing the amount and quality of produce that make it to market.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Available official reports from the ministry of agriculture, FAO and GiZ all show that a significant ratio of fruits and vegetables produced is wasted due to harmful harvest methods, transportation, and display on market shelves.


Oftentimes, the fruits and vegetables are harvested to late, are stacked during transportation or when on display for sell.


While there are existing industrial or modern solutions like refrigeration, etc., most stakeholders on the supply chain don't have the means to acquire such technologies, e.g. connection to the electric grid, access to financial facilities, etc.


Thus, producers, transporters, whole and individual sellers and even buyers rely on grassroots solutions like produce drying, preservation in dark, humid places, immersion of leafy vegetables in water, etc.


Research and observation have proven that these grassroots solutions have little to no effect on prolonging the lifespan or quality of produce. This situation has a negative impact on national food security and the profitability of the agricultural sector that employs more than half the population and contributes to nearly 30% of the GDP.

Discussions with producers and wholesellers have highlighted the urgency to make the sector more profitable.


The CO is also interested in investing in transformation units to be installed in remote areas at the benefit of local producers and farmers.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The lab has done prior exploratory work on the topic of produce preservation, bringing stakeholders from all areas (public, private, international organizations) to the table.


Is it worth investing resources on this topic because it is a potential opportunity of a joint project between FAO and UNDP, but also a chance to secure food availability in the housewife's shopping basket and further the reach of SDG 12.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Digging deeper down the rabbit hole of fruits and vegetables preservation in Togo, the local Acclab is looking into low-cost solutions to extend produce lifespan from harvest to market. You have / know some? Please share!

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What are the effective fruit and vegetable preservation solutions that can be picked up by the different stakeholders on the supply chain to significantly reduce produce waste?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Crowdsourcing through a call to contribution of projects, prototypes, working solutions proven to prolong produce lifespan.


Ethnography and particularly observation to collect data on key issues faced by stakeholders and painpoints that need addressing to ensure that our work is related to targeted publics.


Solutions Mapping to identify unmet needs and opportunities of solutions developed by people in response to current state of the challenge.



> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Official data in the field is outdated and gives a broad perspective of the issue of fruit and vegetable preservation in Togo.


We hope that through qualitative data from close observation, history of transaction, relationship maps, and people shadowing when possible, as well as interviews with solutions providers such as transformation unit owners we can better identify weak links in the supply chain where to contribute innovative solutions in order to make a difference.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

UNDP and FAO are looking for interesting opportunities to collaborate on through a joint project or programme.


Producers and farmers or other people in their communities are looking for business opportunities. We have identify women associations willing to invest in food and produce transformation (paste, juice, etc.)


The ministry of Trade and the ministry of Agriculture are promoting the industralization of the agricultural sector and should be interested in any effort to make transformation units more accessible to local communities. It is to be noted that an effort of promotion has been to decret October as the month of local consumption. The success of such an initiative depends on the strength of the local production and the availability of raw material.
