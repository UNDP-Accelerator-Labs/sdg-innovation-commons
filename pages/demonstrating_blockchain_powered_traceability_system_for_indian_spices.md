## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Demonstrating Blockchain-powered Traceability System for Indian Spices.
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to increase transparency, accountability as well as quality in the spices value chain in India.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

India is the world’s fifth-largest economy with a total GDP of USD $2.94 trillion and expected to become the world’s third largest economy by 2025. India has halved the incidence of multidimensional poverty by lifting 271 million from the most vulnerable sections of society out of poverty during 2005-2016. In the “decade of action” towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (2020-2030), the country is facing challenges like rising intra-regional inequalities, with higher concentrations of poor in rural India, and threats posed by climate change to livelihoods.   In this context, UNDP India’s Strategic Plan has been designed to be responsive to three urgent priorities of India namely: eradicating poverty; structural transformations; and building resilience. As part of the “building resilience” work programme of UNDP India, the Accelerator lab is currently working on the focal areas of Climate Resilient Livelihoods and Air Pollution.   Under the Climate Resilient Livelihoods theme, the lab is striving to enhance the resilience of small-holder farmer which is an important national priority.    The Specific Challenge Statement: How to ensure equitable returns to spice growing farmers of India?   India is the largest producer (and consumer) of spices in the world- with export value worth USD $ 4 billion every year. One of the major challenges that small farmers face is ensure quality and transparency at every stage in the value chain. This is due to difficulty in monitoring and validating data at every stage of the value chain [1]. This is further aggravated during the covid pandemic when the agriculture supply chains are strained, less transparent and working sub-optimally during this period. The application of blockchain technology to enable traceability across the agricultural value chain is a plausible solution which the Lab is seeking to explore.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

India has more than 140 million families (approx. 700 million persons or 52% of total population) dependent on agriculture, 80% of these are small farmers with less than 2 hectares of land.  Resilience of small farmers in India is important from the context of multiple sustainable development goals - Climate Action, Zero Poverty, Zero Hunger and Partnerships. India is the largest producer (and consumer) of spices in the world- with export value worth USD $ 4 billion every year. The domestic consumption of spices in India is also over 1 billion dollars annually.  Often the spices consignment face export rejections due to quality parameters and food safety issues. There is no robust mechanism to monitor spices processing data and validate it at every stage of spices value chain. The farmers also depend on middlemen to connect them with the markets due to which they lose on the profit margins.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Given the development challenge of traceability in agriculture commodities, our lab intends to co-design and implement a farmer-centric, transparent and robust blockchain platform for Indian spices, while leveraging existing systems and technologies available among our development partners. We expand on this more in the following section as well.   Through this development challenge our lab will address the following learning questions: 1. How to enhance transparency and accountability across all stakeholders in the value chain   2. How to ensure quality of Indian spices throughout the spices value chain using blockchain?  3. What is the potential to scale-out the blockchain initiative to new commodities and geographies? 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP AccLabIndia & SpicesBoardIndia jointly developed & tested blockchain based traceability system for Indian spices. Efforts are underway to scale up this platform across major spice growing regions to ensure transparency, quality & traceability in spices value chain in India.

<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

Accelerator Lab India jointly with Spices Board India under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India has developed and tested a blockchain based traceability system for Indian spices. Global Standards (GS1) organization is the technical partner for demonstrating field traceability of spices while NEC Corporation is the technical partner for blockchain platform development. Cabinet Office of Japan is the donor for this pilot initiative. The UNDP Accelerator Lab India and Spices Board India's joint pilot initiative on blockchain powered eSpice Bazaar platform envisages to provide complete farm to market traceability thereby ensuring quality of spices.  Over 3000 farmers from Guntur and Prakasam districts in Andhra Pradesh, India growing Chili and Turmeric were onboarded to the platform and their farm specific data was uploaded to the blockchain system. Field level traceability from selected farms was also demonstrated in the pilot locations. The pilot successfully demonstrated the usefulness of blockchain in traceability of spices. Blockchain also provides numerous advantages of seamless trading and transparency which will also be explored when the solution is scaled up across major spice growing regions in India.
