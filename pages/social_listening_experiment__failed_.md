## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

For the completion of this challenge, Acclab needed to procure the services of the research company, which would support the lab in the sentiment analysis around covid19 vaccines and their uptake. Therefore e-tendering documentation was prepared the tender was announced. Here are the findings from the process:

1. Even though there are a lot of research companies on the Georgian market the interest towards the tender was very low. only 2 companies participated in the tender.  

2. There is a skepticism towards the research-based actions since the government has been acting based on their own perception rather than research findings.

3. Internal processes of the UNDP does not allow the quick and easy procurement of services, which took more time than anticipated 

4. Initially, Lab wanted to use the AI tool for the assessment of sentiments through social media, however, there was no local capacity for the elaboration of the AI tool. Even those companies, which claim to be AI-oriented refrained from participation even though they had an interest. More AI-based local experiments could benefit the culture of using this technology and strengthen the failure acceptance attitudes.

1. Both tenders failed because of the UNDP tendering platform, specifically, in the platform, where the documents are supported to be uploaded there is a box for the indication of the overall cost of the proposal. However, the tendering rule says that the cost should not be disclosed by the bidder. which is confusing, because the box for the overall cost indication is not disabled and both times bidders indicated the overall costs. to solve this problem, the box of the overall cost should be disabled for such tenders or even deleted from the system.

2. Based on the procurement unit requirements, we were told to come up with a budget projection of the tender, however, this was supported to be done without the market research (direct approach to the potential bidders), which makes the price estimation difficult. therefore, we were advised to hire an expert, who would make the price estimation, however, to hire this expert, there are additional processes and rules to be applied. overall it takes around 3-4 months to prepare the documentation, announce the tender and (hopefully) contract the winner, which is a big timeline for the Lab required to work in an agile manner.  3. It took around 10 months to persuade the UNDP management to proceed with this research.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

For the procurement of respective service for research we had to do sense making and analyze who are the actors on the market and what are the best ways to analyze the public sentiments, therefore these types of researches were selected.
