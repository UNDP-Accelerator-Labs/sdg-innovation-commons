Innovator: Department of Fisheries

Narrative: The villagers of Tanna Island controlled their ocean resources using custom tradition techniques since 2011. However, some did not respect the ways of traditional fishing and violated the sacred area. The department of Fisheries stepped in and officially protected the area under the law of fisheries department, earlier in 2021. It is currently an official conservation area, as well as a fishing village that will benefit the community of Imanaka and Tafea Province as a whole. It is also a site where fishermen can go to fix their boats, and buy fishing gears and will also be a research facility for the department of Fisheries.
