## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Remarks & Challenges:
- Psychological wellbeing of Females is poor.  
- Poor ventilation in the kitchen  
- There is no significant role for males (complete dependence on females)
- The eldest daughter is highly expected to leave school because of her father. An early marriage is also expected. 
- Absence of family social activities that bring male and female family members in one place and time. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If spatial changes were made in houses with negative gender exclusive spaces, then these interventions will positively change the behavior family members towards more equitable gender norms/roles

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

We will:
- Redesign the court to be a more gender-inclusive space for the male and female family members.  
- Provide the physical elements “objects” that would promote a better studying environment for the daughter. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

individuals, groups, and social interaction

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Shadowing of participants, in-depth interviews

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1.5 months implementation - 3 months waiting period - 1 month post assessment

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk
