Innovator: SPC/GIZ and elders in Futuna Island

Narrative: The mara technique is a food preservation method developed by the people of Futuna Island wherein unripe bananas are preserved over 2 years. It is a common technique that benefited the Futuna community from generation to generation, especially during cyclone seasons when food is scarce. The SPC-GIZ project documented the elders in Futuna explaining the Mara Technique and created a Bislama language guidebook and manual that anyone in Vanuatu can use to preserve bananas when severe cyclones or tropical disasters hit in the future.
