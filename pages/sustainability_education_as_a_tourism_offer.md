Rasdhoo Island Inn is a guesthouse operating in Alifu Alifu Rasdhoo whose primary tourism offer is based on sustainability education. The guesthouse works with educational institutions to offer young adults an opportunity to experience a long holiday in the Maldives, which incorporates elements of sustainability education, including exposure to marine education and conservation as well as community-based activities designed to provide an opportunity for cross cultural exchanges between guests and the local community. Most of the guests come in groups and stay for about a month on average and engage in activities such as regular classes, team building and bonding exercises, diving and other sea-based excursions, community cooking classes, beach clean ups etc. Additionally, various initiatives such as providing guests with reusable bottles and a water cooler on site for refilling, blocking huge chunks during the day as time that guests will spend outside of their rooms engaged in activities are introduced to reduce the environmental footprint.
