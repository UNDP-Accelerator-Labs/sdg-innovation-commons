## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

By using behavioral science, we explored three pillars of the waste separation system: 1. Public awareness: whether the citizens of Tbilisi and Batumi have enough awareness to separate plastic waste at source; 2. Infrastructure: whether placement and design of the waste bins increase the desirable behavior 3. Communication campaign: which messages better nudge citizens to adopt waste separation practice. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

Our hypothesis consisted of two parts: 1. If we provide adequate wasting infrastructure, Tbilisi and Batumi residents already have good awareness to sort waste and they will do so. 2. If we develop an efficient communication campaign, we will be able to increase the number of households that sort waste.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

The experiment run for 8 weeks.  Stage 1 (1-4 weeks): container placement in all experiment areas.  Stage 2 (5-8):  communication campaign - distribution of flyers and posters

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

1. Kilograms of collected PET waste; 2. Quality of the collection (share of collected PET plastic in the total collected waste)

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

There were two treatment and one control group in each city. 6 experiment areas in total. First, we placed special containers in all experiment areas for four weeks. After four weeks, we introduced a communication campaign with two different types of messages (one message per treatment group). We measured how much plastic we collect in each treatment group against the control group to understand which message worked better.  Following is the waste collection and measurement process: When at least one bin within the area was around 70% full, our volunteers who monitored the areas called the dedicated car for waste collection. The waste from each group was collected separately. After collecting the waste, it was weighted and the amount recorded. Then the sorting facility would do a control separation and weight PET plastic. The difference between total collection and 'pure' PET plastic would give us the "quality of the collection" indicator. The amount of PET plastic was our key indicator of the message's success.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Our hypothesis consisted of two parts: 1. If we provide adequate wasting infrastructure, Tbilisi and Batumi residents already have good awareness to sort waste and they will do so. 2. If we develop an efficient communication campaign, we will be able to increase the number of households that sort waste. By adequate infrastructure we mean:  1. wheeled, metal wired containers with a solid lid and a hole for the bottle disposal. The design ensures transparency: the users can see what's inside, the lid protects the bottles from flying away, and the hole ensures that nothing but a bottle-sized object can be disposed of.  2. The containers should be located next to the existing municipal containers in the residential neighborhoods in close proximity to the residential buildings (200 meters radius) to ensure smooth disposal of the plastic waste alongside other household waste.  3. The containers should be placed in the residential neighborhoods, not in public areas such as parks or schools to create a sense of ownership in the community. 2. Efficient communication campaign is a campaign that can be easily replicated in other communities without extensive community work. In our case, the communication campaign included the distribution of flyers door-to-door by local volunteers and the placement of posters in the designated areas of the residential buildings. Besides, all containers should clearly state that it is meant for PET plastic bottles only, include a municipal hotline for questions and instructions on how to dispose of plastic bottles. Additionally, containers placed in the treatment groups had communication messages too.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

Although the treatment areas and control areas we selected for the experiment are very comparable in terms of socio-economic development, detailed spatial/socio-economic analyses showed some minor disparities: some areas have more economic activity, which negatively affected the waste collection rate. I'd recommend run such analyses before running the experiment to improve area selection. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

12 months (but it was quite affected by the Covid-19 restrictions)

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

34 000$

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

The results were unexpectedly good (1,7 tones of PET in 8 weeks from 40 containers), thus the cities continue waste collection in the areas and because our volunteers formed a strong community, the monitoring of the bins continues. 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The lab received an offer from UNDP Economic Development Portfolio to support them with a design of a waste separation system for one of the biggest city - Telavi.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

During the experimental stage of the project after the installation of the containers showed that in fact the population living in the areas of the project implementation was eager to use new containers for separate collection of plastic bottles. Right after the installation the containers have been used leading to quite quick fillment of the containers. This led to one of the main finding of the project: Even the offering of infrastructure is already enough for people to start separating at least one type of waste.  During the monitoring we discovered that people bring separate bags full of bottles to the containers. Even when they were full these bags were not dumped in the usual trash but placed on the side of the containers or just next to them.  The quality of the collection was very high from the beginning. The KPIs of the Project stated the overall collection quality of 50% at the beginning, 60% in the middle of the 8 week period and 70% at the end of the project.  In reality the data in Tbilisi showed the quality of collection started from 66 to 85% across different groups on the first collection fluctuating between 67-79% in the implementation areas and 79-82% in Control group in the first 4 weeks of the experiment before the introduction of the Communication campaign.  In Batumi the quality rate in the first 4 weeks was between 66% and 78% in the implementation groups and 73-83% in the control group before the communication campaign.  The introduction of the communication campaign raised the quality collection up to 79% in the implementation groups in Tbilisi and up to 81% in the implementation groups in Batumi.  These high quality of collection proved wrong the assumption that the population is not ready to separate waste.  We consider one of the main findings of the project is that even just offering infrastructure with clear information plates is already enough to boost the separate collection on a sustainable level.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

The biggest challenges along the project we faced during the infrastructure building phase.  The increase in prices of the containers and the inability of the producer to deliver containers in time significantly influence the timing. The design of the containers itself presented minor complications for the collection process in Tbilisi. More conical shape would provide more ease in emptying the containers with the truck equipped with a multi-lift system. In Batumi the trucks are different with no mechanism to hold the lid when emptying the contents in the truck so it was a more complicated process. However, through the 8 weeks monitored collection both waste operators learned how to collect the plastic in a way that works for them.  Tear and wear was also a concern. The original stickers on the side of the containers didn’t prove to be a good solution so they were replaced by a sturdier version made from PVC (the printing was done straight on plastic not glued as a sticker). It increases the price of the container but provides necessary durability.  Another challenge related to the infrastructure was the lack of necessary inventory and warehousing facilities in Tbilisi. As Tbilisi does not yet have the necessary presses and warehouses to store the collected plastic a third party contractor was engaged in the process. Its warehouse is located 40 km away from Tbilisi making the logistics of the collection more time-consuming and complicated. The car spent twice as much time delivering waste there than if the same facility was in one of the municipal bases in the city.

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

UNDP Georgia's Economic Development Portfolio, which runs an EU-funded project EU Innovative Action for Private Competitiveness in Georgia, one of the goals of which is to establish Extended Producer Responsibility. The approach was not actively implemented because there was an assumption that waste separation and recycling won't work in Georgia due to the low awareness. The experiment proved that it can be implemented. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Any donor institution, state/municipal agency, or NGO aiming to use behavioral science to nudge population to sort plastic waste.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

1. Be place-specific: the entry point for the experiment was to complement the existing waste disposal habits of the residents. Think about where to place bins to make plastic disposal easy. We recommended using existing municipal waste collection points as a reference.  2. Check waste collection vehicles before buying the containers. It should be easy for the waste collectors to empty the bins. Our containers' design followed existing standard containers, which can be lifted by the collector car automatically.  3. Beware of informal waste-pickers. In some areas, we had to put a lock on the lid to prevent stealing plastic during the experiment.  4. When selecting experiment areas, make sure they are comparable.  5. Plan logistics carefully: collection routes should be efficient. In our case, the waste treatment location was quite far from the experiment areas, which made the process inefficient in terms of time and fuel consumption.  6. Hire a local language editor for the communication campaign in case your BI expert isn't from your community. 7. Be sure communication materials are legible and contain culturally acceptable graphic language. 8. Some posters were torn down, be sure to have extra to replace asap to maintain the impression that the bins are taken care of. 9. Mobilize local volunteers to monitor the bins and distribute the communication materials. Flyer uptake from locals/neighbors was very high in our case. The overall experience created a strong local community that sustains the project after UNDP's exit. 10. Train municipal staff/waste operators on how to monitor the waste. We used a simple excel sheet. Make sure that everyone in the chain knows its role and has contact numbers.  11. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

No, BI experiment should be redesigned for the specific task.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

The experiment was run together with Solution Mapper, while explorer did not participated. I'd love to have the explorer contribute by helping us scrape social media posts on the topic to better define what kind of communication messages would work better. 

> What surprised you?

The average feedback to the new containers that we received during the community outreach campaign was that people were very happy with the new bins, they supported the introduction of separate collection and stated that we all need to take care of the environment. During our talks with the population we’ve heard a lot of support and words “you are doing a great job”. We noticed that active citizens advocated the benefits of separate collection and recycling to people who didn’t believe in it. This showed civic support and a basis to further development of infrastructure of separate collection in both cities. Some people were bringing clean bottles in plastic bags and leaving them near the container, not putting the bottles inside. Our guess is that the attitude towards the recyclables is that it is still "garbage"/ "dirt" and they don't want to touch it. However, the design of the bin preempted the situation and addressed it adequately.
