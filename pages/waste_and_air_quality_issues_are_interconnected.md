## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. Waste and air quality issues are interconnected in Ukraine  2. Working with two problems simultaneously creates synergetic effect and bring to focus different solutions  3. Using nature as an inspiration generate new and often unusual solutions (e.g. nature based solutions such as composting, biomimicry fermenter and so on)  4. Visualizing Ecosystem of Air Quality organizations in Ukraine created value for the actors by showing possible partnerships and synergies   5. The biggest solution to air quality problems connected with open burning lays in agricultural waste management - and this is were we would like to go in 2023

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

1. Number of the actors (including UNDP) do not see open burning as an important problem  2. Looking for simple community and/or nature inspired solutions is not seen as valuable (normal way is to look at the technical big scale interventions)  3. Biomimicry seems to be a too radical innovation option for UNDP 4. To sustain momentum a strong commitment and dedicated time from UNDP Programme/project staff is required. Limited human/financial resources of the Lab does not allow to plan a full-fledged project.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Air quality monitoring data are missing, systematized data on organizations working with the issues is missing, hyper local knowledge on peoples behavior is missing, knowledge about alternative solutions is missing   

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

To get the better understanding of the system of Air Quality, its problems and possible solutions   
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

CID- Center for Innovation Development

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Junior Academy of Science: we co-create Biomimicry Challenge 

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

IsoBar: co-create "do not burn compost" campaign https://xn--80aalpbbxbf1d5ah.xn--j1amh/

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Environment: developed open for public map of fires in all territory of Ukraine

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Junior Academy of Science brought number of youth interested in STEAM to our Biomimicry ground  IsoBar managed to turn our insight into very visual and impactful media campaign.

> If applicable, which UN internal partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

-// N A

 Accelerator Lab developed a System Map and the Catalogue of Air Quality Organizations acting in Ukraine. The System map and the Catalogue allow to understand the complexity of Air Quality area in Ukraine and build alliances for achievement of low-emission and climate-resilient policy goals. The Ecosystem can be accessed in two main views: 


1. Ecosystem perspective: https://kumu.io/ecosystems/undp-ecosystem-v12#untitled-map  


2. Database perspective: https://airtable.com/shrrqhAGVtPuDQlPD
