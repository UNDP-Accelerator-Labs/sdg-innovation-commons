## Concentrated Solar Forming is a novel, eco-friendly method of melting and remolding plastic developed to function entirely off-grid by harnessing the sun’s radiation as a heat source. Using a Fresnel lens, solar energy is concentrated to generate the high temperatures needed to melt recycled HDPE, eliminating the need for electricity and reducing carbon emissions. This carbon-neutral process makes plastic recycling more accessible and sustainable, especially in small communities or remote areas with limited infrastructure. To support the process, a simple, flat-pack injection mold device has been designed using commonly available materials, allowing easy assembly without the need for specialized tools. While the system successfully transforms plastic waste into durable new products, it does present challenges in maintaining consistent and specific heat levels required for precise molding.
