> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

Julius Kewir TANGKA  

> What is the address and preferred way to contact the solution holder?

Renewable Energy laboratory, University of Dschang. 

P.O Box 373 Dschang. 

Tel: 677589794 

E-mail : tangkajkfr@yahoo.fr, www.juliustangka.org

> Does the solution holder have any institutional affiliation in country?

Yes, University of Dschang

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Too much heat losses from conventional three stone fireplaces and other energy efficient stoves. Our scientific and technological analysis in the laboratory indicates that the most performant energy efficient stoves   have an overall energy transfer rate of maximum only 25 % meaning that much of the heat supplied to the cooking pot is wasted. I am proposing a locally made heavily insulated  cooking, baking, and pipe water heating rocket stove with proper heat flow which increases the energy transfer rate efficiency  to 60%

> Is this solution DIY / open source or IP protected?

- DIY / open source

> Will the solution holder be able to train others (including end-users) in using or replicating the solution?

- Yes

> What is the unit cost of this Solution along with any additional cost for maintenance and training?

The unit cost if 250,000 Frs CFA with no maintenance costs. However if massed produced with a small iron smelting plant the cost could get down to 200000 frs CFA. 

> Is this solution a prototype or product?

- Product

> If this solution is a product, is it available in the market (off the shelf) or advance order has to be given?

- Available in market
- Advance order has to be given

> What is the Technological Readiness Level (TRL) of this solution?

Technical and economic feasibilities both positive. All materials of construction are readily available in most villages. However the heat exchanger pipe that heats water and also acts as chimney has to be sourced in big cities  

> How much has this solution already been diffused? Is there potential feedback from end-users available?

?Publication on social media has received over 5000 views and 300 commentaries. A few have been installed in Yaounde, and foumban since this stove was developed a year ago. Was recently (two weeks ago) presented in an international conference at the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance in Nairobi, Kenya.  We have received another invitation for a conference in Kigali at the PACJA commonwealth heads of state conference from June 20 to June 25th 2022

> Are there any efficiency benchmarks for this solution (eg. how much energy does it save; how much cheaper does it produce energy than current market rates/ current household expenditure / cost per kW h)?

Our laboratory analyses and tests energy efficient stoves for the public. We hardly get any stove with an efficiency of up to 25 percent. This one is 60 percent. This gives even 60 percent wood savings compared, to other stoves.

> Are there any other potential bottlenecks affecting cross-border or in country diffusion of this solution?

No particular bottlenecks however scarcity of cast iron plates might hinder mass production. We however have a cast iron smelting plant now which will soon go operational.
