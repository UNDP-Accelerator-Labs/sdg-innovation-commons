## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Supporting local innovators to support an inclusive innovation ecosystem 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that there is increasing traffic congestion in the capital causing a loss of time, and road noise and air pollution.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Between July 2019 to June 2020 alone, 6702 vehicles were imported with the highest import reported in January of 735 vehicles that month. Thimphu dzngkhag alone has 59887 vehicles registered till date. Light vehicle comprises 65% of total vehicles in Bhutan. This increase in vehicle import is attributed to the rise in income of families, urbanization, access to easy credit, affordability, vehicle quota and lack of efficient and reliable public transport system. An efficient and reliable city bus service can reduce the number of private cars on the roads and thus reduce traffic congestion, minimize air and noise pollution and most importantly lead to cost savings for people and the country as a whole from reduced import of fuel and spare parts. It will also have a disproportionately beneficial impact on the poor as they will not have to purchase cars or spend on more expensive taxi services. In the case of Thimphu City, the spread of urban areas and urban lifestyles has led to a high demand for mobility. The inability of the government to provide reliable and efficient urban transport can be seen as one of the main causes for increased demand for private light vehicles in rapidly growing urban centers like Thimphu. An official of the Bhutan Post shared that the introduction of bus services for some schools in Thimphu saw a dramatic reduction in car numbers and also saved on wear and tear of public infrastructure. Study has also found that one bus for ferrying students has led to reduction in about 49 cars to the school twice a day. Studies have shown that the present number of buses are about 41 percent short of the desirable levels. This gap is expected to be closed as the government plans to deploy more new buses in Thimphu. The City bus Office will soon be purchasing 60 additional buses to address the challenge of bus shortage. However to facilitate the efficient and smooth flow of the bus services, reliability of information to the users is critical. Till date, there has been no efforts to streamline the information on buses to the service users.

Despite the pandemic, the import of vehicles increased by five percent last year. The total number of motor vehicles in the country as of December 2020 reached 112,058 from 106,681 in December 2019. In terms of vehicle ownership and distribution, 53 percent of the vehicles are registered with Thimphu region, 33.4 percent under Phuentsholing region, 6.6 percent under Gelephu region, 4.9 percent under Samdrupjongkhar region and 2.1 percent under Mongar region. The total number of taxis increased by 11.6 percent or 601 last year. Region-wise, the number of taxis increased by 13.8 percent in Thimphu region.  Similarly, taxi numbers increased by 9.4 percent in Gelephu region, 8.2 percent in Mongar, 7.1 percent in Samdrupjongkhar region and 6.8 percent in Phuentsholing region.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

1. The capital's air quality is worsening  2. People are willing to use public transport if its clean and reliable 3. Import of car has been consistently increasing

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The City Bus Office, Thimphu, UNDP and Druk Infinity Technologies, a local tech startup initiated by a local innovator has partnered to develop an app that will provide real time information to the users. The proposed app will encourage and promote the use of public transportation by making information on public transport available in a timely manner. To formalize the partnership , the City Bus Office, UNDP and Druk Infinity Services will enter into partnership to ensure sustainability of such initiatives. Maintain and provide the app and its services for use by the public at no cost for a minimum period of three years. The functions and features of the app to be covered hereunder includes: Up-to-date information on city bus fare, schedules and routes as provided by the CIty Bus Office. Protect data of the users and not share with third parties, without prior written consent from the users. Accelerator Lab will be partnering with an unconventional partner to prototype a digital solution for the public transport system in the country. Currently, people are wasting time making assumptions about city bus schedules. Using a GPS tracking function , passengers would be able to see arrival updates in real-time, directly from the transport system.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Will the city bus app help address traffic congestion in the capital? Is there an behavioral change towards an increase use of the public transportation system incase a mobile app is designed to provide real time alerts on the whereabouts of the bus?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

There is a lack of information on what the citizens feel on the use of public transportation mobile apps. User journeys and ethnographic data will fill gaps in terms of validating and question the assumptions often made by service providers.
## Closing
