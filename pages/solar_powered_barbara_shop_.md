> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is about powering my barber shop with solar energy. This is archieved by simple budgets like solar batteries, solar panels, inverter and charge controller. The system can power Barber machines, charge phones, Television, radios and lighting for 8 hours daily. This is innovation is vital especially when the country is undergoing shortages of power to power the whole nation.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I intend to package my innovation in one portable device. The device can be sold to not only barbershops but also homes on off-grid and/or on-grid houses as backup power device. As you know this energy is clean to the environment and sustainable. This innovation l believe can improve people's lives in rural areas.

> Technical Feasibility

The innovation is simple: it basically uses a solar panel charging a battery through a charge controller. This is connected to a portable inverter which in turn provide AC power. I have captured and attached my prototype. Refer to it.

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will really improve people's lives in terms lighting and continue services provision for those engaged in small scale businesses like barbershops etc.
