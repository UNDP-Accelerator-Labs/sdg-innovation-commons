Feasibility Study Report

INTRODUCTION, SCOPE and METHODOLOGY
Improving power and heat supply appears to be a key for Rural Health Clinics (RHC) being
operational during working hours. Indeed, rural health clinics need reliable and uninterrupted power
and heat supply to provide the standard medical services. This objective was defined by the Ministry
of Healthcare of Uzbekistan within the framework of the ‘Health-2’ World Bank (WB) Project which
is focused on helping poor families to improve their health by developing health care system,
providing family members broad and good access to health care services as almost the entire
population is living within two kilometers of a rural health clinic.

The key objective set up by both WB Project Health-2 and the Ministry of Healthcare is to make the
medical equipment supplied by the WB and other donors, operational during cut off of the power
supply. This is an issue of power reservation and security but not replacement of grid with Renewable
Energies (RE) technologies. Indeed, almost 90% of rural health clinics are connected to the grid and a
first activity of the project is to identify how many hours the medical equipment is out of operation
due to power failures. Another question is about energy efficiency: in order to limit the substitution to
grid failures, it seems necessary to have an energy management approach and check on possible
replacement of equipment intensively consuming power with more energy efficient equipment.

The second condition that may limit medical equipment operational includes lack of heating during
winter season. As there is also lack of natural gas (mainly low pressure on the grid) there is lack of
heating and hot water in the rural health clinic during winter season, therefore, the staff in rural health
clinic is unable to work. Solar panels made in Uzbekistan can provide some warm water when low gas
pressure or lack of gas supply takes place during a cold day, and this will allow radiators not to be
frozen and destroyed. It could also be possible to save the natural gas in spring and summer time by
providing hot water directly from solar panels. For heating and hot water a global approach including
energy efficiency can be proposed in order to ensure the medical staff to be working and medical
equipment to be operational.

The scope of the feasibility study is outlined in the Terms of Reference for the International
Consultant (Annex 1). The first mission took place between 9th and 20th of April 2007, the second
mission took place between 20th of May and 2nd of June 2007 and the final mission will be held during
21-28 of August 2007. They were carried out by Yves LAMBERT, an independent international
renewable energies and energy efficiency specialist. It consisted of 10 + 12 + 8 days spent in
Tashkent.

The first mission took place partly in the field for visiting the five rural health clinics selected for the
project. The consultant worked closely with the government counterparts, project management,
national consultants and direct beneficiaries (mainly the Ministry of Healthcare) (refer to Annex 2).

The national and international consultants analyzed all relevant sources of information such as the
project document, national consultants’ reports, and other data considered as useful (refer to Annex 3).

The consultants observed the field conditions and elaborated activities to be implemented within the
project to select the best solutions for each of the five rural health clinics.

The output of two missions is a draft Feasibility Study Report, to be discussed and completed during
last mission. This draft Feasibility Study Report is composed of 8 chapters corresponding to the terms
of reference and agreed by the different partners of this project.

During two missions held, the International Consultant was accompanied by Project Manager and
often by UNDP Renewable Energy Advisor.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The solutions identified to improve power and energy efficiency and their reliability in the five
selected rural health clinics confirm that problems can be solved with different technical equipment
depending on each rural health clinic peculiarities and medical equipment already installed or to be
installed during next three years.

Feasibility Study Report

For power supply, installation of batteries/accumulators and uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
seems the simplest way, with some experiment using photovoltaic (PV) systems. Considering the
demand side, some refrigerators can be replaced but the main action has to be undertaken concerning
the lighting: replacement of incandescent bulbs for low consumption energy efficient lamps.

For heating and hot water supply several solutions can be tested: new efficient gas boilers with
regulation, boilers with combined burners, electrical heaters, solar water heaters, etc. On the demand
side, the main identified solutions include insulation of rural health clinic buildings and pipes,
checking efficiency and in some cases replacing radiators, controlling and regulating the temperature
inside the buildings.

In order to choose between the various solutions, reliable information was required: power cuts
duration and frequency, lack of natural gas or frequency of low gas pressure duration periods and
frequency. Unfortunately, such information is not available and depends on sources. Same difficulty
about electricity and gas consumption: data collected from various sources are not coherent, and
expenses for electricity and gas consumption do not correspond to real consumption. Therefore, we
have to select some assumptions and choose a solution to be based on the expected consumption and
saving, as well as on the other criteria which have been classified by stakeholders.

These different solutions are detailed in Chapter 8 “Selection of optimal solutions in selected rural
health clinics”. For UMAROV and BAYMUKHAMEDOV rural health clinics, as they are both of
type 2, we have limited the list of improvements to be made in UMAROV rural health clinic in order
to have a basic solution to be compared with BAYMUKHAMEDOV rural health clinic after
implementation of the efficient and innovative solutions proposed. DJEYKHANABAD rural health
clinic is installed in the same building that the Hospital, so solutions have been proposed for both
parts, and this may serve as an example for improvements to be implemented in other hospitals.
Solutions for PAKHTAKOR and JUZIM-BOG rural health clinics present some differences, so it
would be possible to compare them after implementation and monitoring; due to their localization,
results of monitoring will be useful for further dissemination, particularly in remote areas and in the
rural health clinics that are not connected to the power grid.

Feasibility Study Report

BACKGROUND
At present, large-scale reforms are being executed in the public health sector of Uzbekistan.
Establishment and development of the rural health clinics (primary health care) is the priority of the
national policy. The strategy for the primary health care reforming is focused on improvement of
quality and effectiveness of the medical service provided to the population, and is based on
integration of modern medical technologies, preventive health care, training of general practitioners,
strengthening of financing and management of primary health care.

To carry out the reform, in 1998-2004 the Government with assistance of the World Bank
implemented a pilot project (Health-1) in five provinces of the country: Fergana, Navoiy, Syrdarya,
Khorezm and Karakalpakstan. The objective of the project was to examine and test how the primary
health care system in rural areas can be reformed. The ‘Health-1’ project proposed and tested
restructuring of the multi-stage health care system to the two-stage, by that reducing the maintenance
costs of medical institutions. In addition, the project introduced a system where people get the first
medical aid from a certified physician rather than from a medical attendant’s assistant.

Positive results of the project persuaded the Ministry of Healthcare to develop a new ‘Health-2’
project. A grant from the Japanese Government funded the project preparation work. The Health-2
project aims to extend and deepen the scope of the primary health care reform across all regions of
Uzbekistan. In line with the Agreement on Development Financing signed between Uzbekistan and
International Development Association (IDA), Health-2 project was launched in 2004. This project
will provide 2,200 rural health clinics with up-to-date medical equipment. Other components of the
project will focus on making medical products more accessible, continuous medical education and
improving quality of medical services. The project will also distribute best practices and lessons learn
on financial and general management received from piloting during Health-1 project.

The Uzbek Government and international donor organizations have allocated substantial funds into
rural health care infrastructure. However, the majority of rural health clinics have faced certain
problems with power and heat supply during the recent years. The reasons are, in the first place,
interrupted heating and hot water supply caused by problems with unstable natural gas and power
supply to medical facilities (low gas pressure and frequent power failures), especially in winter
season. Moreover, some problems with reliable cold water supply occur in summer season. These and
other factors have made a negative impact on quality of medical services provided, medical
equipment operation and capability of emergency medical aid.

Development and implementation of all possible options of uninterrupted and reliable power and heat
supply to the rural health clinics, including integration of modern energy efficient and renewable
energy systems (e.g. use of solar energy for electricity generating and water heating needs) into
existing conventional energy infrastructure, provides the potential for more efficient and effective use
of the medical equipment and more comfort conditions for physicians operation and patients
treatment.

However, rural health clinics in Uzbekistan have some peculiarities. They are rather well equipped
with various medical equipment such as emergency aid, laboratory equipment for medical tests,
sterilizers, dental and physiotherapy equipment etc, which consume quite significant amount of
energy. The average electric power required for this equipment operation is varying in the range of 7-
13 kW, and average thermal power is in the range of 16-50 kW. Moreover, rural health clinics differ
in premises size and facility design as some are located in the buildings built specifically for medical
purposes, others in premises adapted for medical needs. They also range in scale (large regional
health clinics and small rural posts). Rural health clinics are located in various climatic zones such as
foothills, mountain areas, deserts, and valleys. They also differ in the water, power and heat supply
infrastructure; most of rural health clinics are connected to the grid but heating is provided by boilers
firing the natural gas coming from gas pipelines.

Within the framework of the UNDP’s “Feasibility Study on Improving of Power and Heat Supply
Reliability in Health Rural Clinics of Uzbekistan” Project, technical and economic assessment of

Feasibility Study Report

options have to be implemented in order to equip the rural health clinics with Energy Efficient (EE)
and Renewable Energy (RE) systems, notably the plants that transfer solar energy to electric and
thermal power that can be integrated into existing conventional energy infrastructure to improve
reliability of power and heat supply has been implemented.

Developing the options for reliable power and heat supply has take care that rural health clinics are
equipped with a quite big number of medical equipment that requires substantial amount of electric
power. It is also necessary to have enough power for lighting, communication, and in many cases for
reliable cold water supply. Therefore, a combination of conventional and EE and RE systems has
been considered. Thus, photovoltaic systems may be used for off-grid power supply for lighting and
emergency equipment operation in case of power failure. Solar collectors can be used for autonomous
hot water supply in summer season as well as for pre-heating of water for space heating needs in
winter season to reduce natural gas consumption. Moreover, some local and foreign manufactures of
PV and solar water heating systems licensed and certified according to national standards are
available in Uzbekistan. These companies are able to meet the future demand in such equipment, and
provide full cycle services such as installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance, and after-
sale service. The options proposed have been adjusted to the relevant budget resources available in
rural health clinics and to the budget for medical equipment. They have to ensure efficient use and
saving of energy and fuel, to be coherent with budget available and to be replicable at a large scale.

1.2 Representativity of selected rural health clinics

Considering the characteristics of the selected five rural health clinics, they can be considered as
representative for rural health clinics in general in terms of power and heat supply. However, they are
not representative in terms of the different types of rural health clinics (there is no rural health clinics
of type 1 and 4, and only two rural health clinics are of type 2 which represents 50% of total rural
health clinics).

1.3 Medical rooms priority and engineering and construction
characteristics of five surveyed rural health clinics

The priority rooms can be classified as rooms used for technologies of medical-diagnostic processes
(except the dental room) as well as rural health clinic receptions and chief physician rooms. During
the survey, rural health clinic staff recommended that laboratories, room for patients' examination,
procedure unit and physiotherapeutic are classified as the rooms of the major importance.

The following rooms have not been classified as prioritized ones: sterilization room, storeroom, some
of rooms that are not directly involved in the technology of providing medical aid (for instance, chief
nurse room), dining room, kitchen, and other similar rooms.

Supply side analysis: Availability and reliability of utilities

2
and renewable energies
Considering the objective of the Feasibility Study Report as the “improving the reliability of power
and heat supply”, the study has to consider the both sides: supply and demand. Therefore, Chapter 2 is
focused on supply side and Chapter 3 is focused on demand side.

The supply side analysis has considered the availability of utilities (power, natural gas, cold and hot
water) in each rural health clinic selected, and then we tried to estimate the reliability of power and
gas supply. This is quite impossible today because there is metering only in some of RHCs and there
is no control of the reliability. GJSC “Uzbekenergo” recognizes that power cuts shorter than two days
could happen, but they cannot provide give us with data on frequency and duration of such power
cuts. NHC “Uzbekneftegas” does not recognize that there are problems with low pressure of the gas.
Therefore, information collected by the national consultants came from rural health clinics’ staff
memory and some written notes provided by the management of the RHCs, and we are wondering
about the reliability of these sources of information. Estimations and different options have been made
and selected for identification of technical solutions. These solutions are recommended for
implementation during the second phase (piloting of technical solutions proposed) of the project in the
five selected rural health clinics, and they must be confirmed by proper metering and monitoring
before further dissemination during the third phase.

In order to complete this chapter dedicated to the supply side, analysis of availability and potential of
Renewable Energy Sources (RES) has been made, and it shows that the most appropriate renewable
energy source for rural health clinics is solar energy that can be utilized through solar collectors and
photovoltaic panels. The main data on availability of power, natural gas, cold and hot water in the five
selected rural health clinics is presented in Table 2.1.

Reliability of power supply

Power supply system available in all surveyed rural health clinics is provided through transmission
lines of the District Power Supply System (DPSS). Straight questions to rural health clinic managers
about restrictions on power consumption were answered negatively; none of the surveyed rural health
clinics has problems with power consumption restrictions neither for installed equipment nor for
lighting.

In accordance with the data received from managers of rural health clinics, reliability of power supply
in other rural health clinics is rather low, particularly in winter time. Credible and official reasons for
this factor are not known, such data is available for power generating, transporting and marketing
organizations only. We can only make the following assumptions:

•

•
•

there is a general deficit of power in the region in winter time – from November till March
inclusive;
there are power cuts at transmission lines and substations;
frequent power cuts due to malfunction in transformers in connection to their long exploitation
time.

Unfortunately, no records are available to support the considerations about the length of power cuts,
its’ seasonality, frequency, etc. Therefore, information about reliability of power supply is rather
subjective.

Below (Table 2.2) are the answers to the asked questions about reliability of power supply systems,
received based on the polls of the rural health clinics’ staff, as well as information received in written
from the rural health clinic managers.

The problems with periodic power cuts exist in all of the surveyed rural health clinics. The most
unfavorable period lasts from November till March for Tashkent province, for Pakhtakor rural health
clinic this period continues from September till April, while for Juzim-Bog rural health clinic this
period lasts from November till May. Four out of five rural health clinics have no problems with
quality of the supplied power, or such problems have not been mentioned. The exception is
Baymukhamedov rural health clinic, which faces this type of problems.

In all rural health clinics power supply may be switched off during both day and night times.

The most lengthy occasional power supply shut-down period was observed in Umarov rural health
clinic – 7 days. In two other rural health clinics located in Tashkent province (Djeykhanabad and
Baymukhamedov) such shut-downs had durations of 24 and 48 hours respectively. In rural health
clinics located in Aral region such occasional shut-downs had not been observed. In Umarov rural
health clinic the maximal length of “once a month shut-down” is 48 hours. In two other rural health
clinics (Pakhtakor and Baymukhamedov) periods of such shut-downs were 24 and 36 hours
respectively. In Umarov rural health clinic the maximal duration of frequent shut-downs so-called “2-
3 times a week” was 24 hours. For the rest of the rural health clinics such frequent shut-downs had
duration of 6-12 hours.

The most unfavorable conditions during a month without power supply can be observed in Umarov
and Baymukhamedov rural health clinics, the periods reached 20 days and 14 days respectively
(taking into account complaints made by Baymukhamedov rural health clinic about power quality).
For the rest of the rural health clinics these periods averaged 10±1.5 days taking into account night
time blackouts and 2.5-5 days without night-time blackouts.

Another problem may be the reliability of the distribution of power: referring to the example of
Juzim-Bog rural health clinic and the photo of the failing power transformer, power cuts could happen
due to the bad quality of infrastructure.

Reliability and Potential of Renewable Energy Sources (RES)

The most important potential for renewable energy in Uzbekistan can be summarized as follows:

Solar heating of hot water: Development of concepts for more competitive local manufactured
solar panels for heating low temperature hot water based on adjustment of the European solar
heating technology to the Uzbek conditions, has been developed during last years and it is now
operational. The performance ratio has been improved significantly.

As a spin off effect of the large-scale mass production of local panels, the manufacturers may
develop concepts for small-scale solar heating units (tank, panels and supplementary heat) to be
competitive on the commercial market.

Photovoltaic: The use of solar energy for electricity production may be an interesting
opportunity for providing electricity services in remote districts and, thereby, give a new
perspective in utilization and development of remote regions. Solar radiation in Uzbekistan is in
the range of 1.5 to 2 kWh/m2 per day, therefore, considering the efficiency of photovoltaic panels
(12%) and the size of panels (100 Wp = 0.8 m2), 1 kWp (kiloWatt peak) may produce an average
of 1.5 to 2 kWh per day (less than 1 kWh in winter and 4 kWh or more in summer). Watt peak is
a specific unit for PV systems and corresponds to energy produced from photovoltaic system
with solar radiation of 1,000 W/m2.

Passive solar heating or solar architecture: There is a potential for using common sense and
practice in the building design in order to utilize the solar energy as a passive source for heating.
However there is an even larger risk that bad design of the buildings and unsuccessful design of
passive solar heating will result in a considerable cooling demand in summer, which will require
much more fuel energy (to produce electricity) than the saved heat demand. Such solution was
not been examined due to the fact that rural health clinics are still existing and rehabilitation will
be limited.

Wind energy: The use of wind energy for electricity production may, like the photovoltaic, be an
interesting opportunity for providing electricity services in remote districts and, thereby, give a
new perspective in the utilization and development of the remote regions of Uzbekistan. The
technology is fully developed on the international market for quite large production of electricity
that is not in the range of needs for rural health clinics.

Biomass: There is a very little potential for use of biomass in Uzbekistan, however, it is a fact
that some of scare resources are utilized on the country side and that the farm industry produces
some organic waste, e.g. straw, which can not always be utilized. Therefore, the perspective is to
create a sustainable use of biomass by improving the technology and efficiency for the current
utilization of biomass and for using the waste products from farm industry, e.g. by introducing
more efficient stoves and ovens at the market and by manufacturing biomass pellets. Considering
the actual development of biomass technologies in Uzbekistan, we cannot recommend this
renewable energy source.

Geothermal energy: There are geothermal resources in the underground, which today is used
only for medical purposes without re-injection, but not for heating. The most realistic option for
utilization of the source is direct heating of low temperature district heating water via a heat
exchanger and with re-injection of the water. It is of no interest for rural health clinic today but it
could be useful for large hospitals.

Hydropower: Large hydro power plants have been successfully installed in Uzbekistan and there
are a lot of hydro power resources especially in mountain areas. Concerning the five selected
rural health clinics only one can be equipped with micro-hydraulic equipment: water supply for
Djeykhanabad rural health clinic is provided through a pipe connected to a mountain source of
water (a spring) situated approximately 150 m above the rural health clinic; water is stored in a
tank installed near the rural health clinic and the District hospital. So, the resource exists and is
reliable but there is no producer of micro hydro power equipment in Uzbekistan and no guarantee
of maintenance.

Feasibility Study Report

Conclusions: Considering the potential of different renewable energies in Uzbekistan (refer to
various reports concerning this subject) and the level of energy needs in rural health clinics, it
seems that we have to focus on photovoltaic and thermal solar panels in order to produce
electricity and heat. However, solar radiation is not constant and is not reliable, especially in
winter, when there is a shortage of power from the grid. Therefore, it could not be a reliable
and/or an autonomous solution and it must be combined with energy management including
storage of electricity or heat (hot water).

Other solutions like wind, hydro power, and biomass could be used for improving power and heat
supply in healthcare sector but required investments will be very high for a limited energy
demand in rural health clinics. Such energies could be more useful in large hospitals than in rural
health clinics.

(average)

Source: National Consultant/Expert on PV systems reports

Notes:

1) Power consumption of the prioritized equipment and of lighting in the prioritized rooms is

highlighted with grey background;

2) * is calculations for power consumption including equipment to be procured for rural health

clinics under the Project “Health-2”;

3) Power capacity of the installed therapeutic-diagnostic equipment and support equipment (see row
1) in all of the rural health clinics is almost at the same level with difference of about 10% (taking
into account the future equipping of Umarov and Baymukhamedov rural health clinics under the
Project “Health-2”);

4) Difference in installed power for lighting (raw 4) is significant (almost three times) and linked

with:

a) different types and power capacities of lamps installed in rural health clinics,

b) difference in rural health clinic sizes, and areas to be lightened (see the Table 2.1);

5) According to the total designed power consumption (raw 5), four of the rural health clinics
(except Juzim-Bog clinic) are at the same level: with the equipment to be supplied to Umarov and
Baymukhamedov rural health clinics under the Health-2 Project, the difference will not exceed ±
10%;

6) Two times less power consumption of Juzim-Bog rural health clinic can be explained by absence
of power-consuming and support equipment, which exists (or will be supplied to) in other rural
health clinics;

7) Minimal proportion of power consumption for lighting (raw 8) is in Pakhtakor rural health clinic

- 35%, while maximal is in Djeykhanabad rural health clinic – 65%;

8) In other rural health clinics this indicator varies between 40-50%;

9) Share of power inputs for lighting (raw 12) in common prioritized power inputs (raw 8) is rather

big and varies between 59-72%;

10) Thus, it can be noted that the share of power inputs for lighting is large in all of the considered
rural health clinics and that in all rural health clinics the system of electric lighting is not optimal
and shall be optimized. Without optimization, construction of any type of the economic power
backup system becomes a problematic;

11) According to the data presented by rural health clinics, actual averaged daily power consumption

(raw 13) is 2-4 times less than designed value of power consumption (raw 5).

This situation can be explained by the following reasons:

a) data on averaged daily power consumption presented by rural health clinics covers spring-
summer time, when less power is consumed for lighting in comparison with winter time. At
the same time, it is obvious that our calculations were prepared for the “worst-case” period,
which is autumn-winter time. According to our estimations, this factor may result in
difference of 20-30% between the actual and designed values;

b) during calculations of power consumption the periods of blackout were not taken into account
that reduces actual power consumption by not more than 25% according to rural health

28

16/11/2022

Feasibility Study Report

clinics’ staff as well as ours estimates;

c) rural health clinics’ staff provided us with the overrated values on working hours of
equipment and lighting, in practice the actual time is significantly less than the data used in
rural health clinic calculations.

Unfortunately, rural health clinics didn’t present any documentary data to support values on actual
hours of service for equipment. It should be noted that unreliable and unclear data on actual hours of
service for equipment will significantly complicate further work on selecting optimal options for
power backup in rural health clinics.

3.2 Heating, cold and hot water demand
Completing the approach for power consumption, in this paragraph we have tried to identify demand
for heating and hot water. Lack of meters or availability of non-reliable meters does not allow making
a good estimation of boilers efficiency and building insulation. We have seen some local actions such
as plastics on windows frame implemented to limit heat losses but this can be significantly improved.

No credible information is available concerning the actual consumption of natural gas for heating and
hot water supply, therefore, it is impossible to verify the validity of the applied standards: 125 W/m2
or 250 l/day. We can just try to evaluate the evolution of the consumption during last three years
based on the expenses.

In order to provide a temperature of 20°C during working hours and 14-16 during rest of time, we
have to know heating demand and heat losses. Such information can be given by a thermal diagnosis
but the missions of national consultants and the International Consultant arrived too late in spring
(non-heating season), and we have to wait for a thermal diagnosis to be implemented during next
heating season. As an example, heat consumption (125 W/m2) is incoherent with natural gas
consumption but even this data on gas consumption is not credible or reliable. Therefore, actually we
can just estimate the real consumption and heat losses on the basis of theoretical norms and standards
applied for rural health clinic buildings, which are quite different from the European standards. Next
figures are just given to illustrate where the main technical solutions are: boilers efficiency can be
increased and heat losses can be reduce with insulation of ceiling and walls, and introduction of
proper metering; and estimated investments have to be confirmed through the thermal diagnosis.

Figure 3.2 Representation of heat losses in a building

Q1 = General heat consumption
QТ = transmission losses through walling surfaces
QL = Air infiltration heat loss
QH = Boiler heat loss
QS = Solar heat contribution

These figures are only theoretical and have not been confirmed by information gathered in the rural
health clinics. What 125 W/m2 means? Is it an average for the heating season, is the consumption
corresponding to the theoretical temperature (-13°C), etc.? Efficiency of boilers can be estimated as
70 or 80% maximum, and heat losses through ceiling may represent 25-30% instead of 18%. All these
figures have to be confirmed with a thermal diagnosis in order to estimate energy saving potential.
Unfortunately, such diagnosis has to be implemented in winter season only; therefore, we have to wait
for next heating season.

As an example of incoherence: with a consumption of approximately 3,000 nm3 of natural gas in the
type 2 rural health clinic BAYMUKHAMEDOV the average consumption is 130 kWh/m2 during the
total heating season; however, for the type 2 rural health clinics located in Fergana region the
consumption is 15,000 nm3 of natural gas that is 5 times higher. Where are the actual figures? What
are the actual consumption and real thermal losses in rural health clinics’ buildings? Another
approach based on the expenses seems to be more acceptable but the comparison between rural health
clinics is not coherent (refer to Table 3.5 in Section 3.3).

As there is a lack of reliable metering of power and natural gas consumed, we try to get information
using another way: expenses on consumption and expenses for utilities (power, natural gas and coal)
related to the selected rural health clinics are given in the Table 3.4 but they do not seem as more
reliable and coherent.

Note: * - Data provided by the Ministry of Healthcare

Comparison between the five rural health clinics and rural health clinics located in Fergana region
shows a large difference for both electricity or natural gas consumption and the relevant expenses. As
there is no real metering (meters exist for electricity but how we can explain that consumption in
Fergana region is 10 times higher than in Tashkent district?), consumption has been estimated but
expenses do not really represent the consumption and cost of electricity and natural gas consumed.
The first investment has to be contributed into installation of reliable and controlled meters in order to
know the actual consumption and motivate the stakeholders of rural health clinics to monitoring and
reducing their consumption of electricity and natural gas. During the second phase (preferably to be
held in winter), the thermal diagnosis will allow identifying the main heat losses and heat
consumption before installing new equipment and regulation.

Emergency equipment and medical priorities

4
Based on the list of medical equipment to be supplied to each rural health clinic within the WB Health
2 project, we have prepared an abstract of all those units, which needs electricity to be operational,
and we have also discussed with the person in charge of this project what is the priority to be
operational for each of the units of equipment. The results of the medical equipment prioritization are
given in Table 4.1.

The priority equipment can be divided into two groups:

1. Prioritized therapeutic-diagnostic equipment can be classified as equipment, which is directly

used during treatment, medical aiding, and diagnostics.

2. Prioritized ancillary equipment can be classified as equipment, which is used for disinfection
of premises, medical lighters, and refrigerators for storing vaccines, serums, medicaments,
etc.

Dental equipment, equipment for sterilization of instruments, solutions, etc. are not considered as
prioritized equipment due to its high power consumption, and possibility of creating a reserve of
sterile instruments when power supply is available and in the amounts sufficient for the periods when
power failure happens.

Based on the above mentioned, we have considered an alternative variant that is less power-
consuming:

• only electrocardiograph and equipment for analysis should be considered as priority medical
and diagnostic equipment; some of the units have their own autonomous power supply
(batteries) and can be used even during one hour at power cuts;

• only refrigerator for drugs’ storage, medical lighters and equipment for disinfection of
premises should be considered as important auxiliary equipment; depending on quality and
efficiency refrigerators can store drugs at the acceptable temperature during 4 or 6 hours
during power cuts;

• only laboratory, inspection, procedures and physiotherapy rooms should be considered as

important rooms for lighting.

Therefore, total power needs for medical equipment to be provided by Health-2 project can be
estimated as 20 kWh/day. Power needs for the first priority medical equipment are 3.4 kWh/day.

It has to be mentioned that number of working hours for the equipment indicated in Table 4.1 have
been assessed by the Health-2 project experts. At the same time, the energy consumed will be in 1.5-2
times less: for the first priority medical equipment the power needs can be estimated as 2 kWh/day
plus electricity required for lighting. With the replacing fluorescent bulbs and fluorescent tubes with
low consumption energy efficient lamps, electricity needs for the priority lighting can be limited to 1
or 2 kWh/day even for winter period. Thus, for a power cut of 24 hours a storage of 3-4 kWh
seems reasonable with a maximum of 5 kWh for Djeykhanabad rural health clinic considering the
power needs of this clinic plus electricity required for lighting in hospital as this medical facility joints
them both.

Several solutions concerning selection of medical equipment may reduce the difficulty with
reservation of electricity due to the unreliability of power supply: preference has to be given to energy
efficient equipment, or to equipment with autonomous power sources (having their own batteries
and/or their voltage stabilizers). Such solution must be envisaged for further calls for tender medical
equipment to be delivered to rural health clinics.

It is also necessary to have enough power for communication, and in many cases for reliable cold
water supply (e.g. cold water pumping in Juzim-Bog rural health clinic).

As a synthesis of this analysis, the objective is not only the reliability of power supply but more
globally the reliability of medical service from the staff of rural health clinics. Covering needs for
emergency medical equipment and ancillaries during power cuts may partly solve the problem but it
must be considered with the working conditions. Is it possible to assume medical service in a building
which is not heated?

As the electricity needs are limited and linked with duration and frequency of power cuts; however,
heating, providing cold and hot water must also be solved.

Another condition, namely lack of heating during winter season may limit operation of the medical
equipment. As there is a lack of natural gas (mainly, low pressure of the gas supplied from the gas
networks), heating and hot water are not available in the rural health clinic during winter season,
thereby, staff of the rural health clinic is unable to work and serve the patients.

According to the opinions of Health-2 project engineers, the priority rooms in terms of the hot water
supply and heating (in priority order) are follows:

1. Pediatrics room;
2. Inoculations (vaccination) room;
3. Obstetrics and gynecology room;

4. Blood examinations laboratory;
5. Medical treatment room;
6. Doctor consulting room.

As the heating, technical solutions must be implemented in order to get a minimum of temperature (15
0C) inside the rural health clinic premises even during coldest periods to avoid freezing of indoor
heating system (pipes and radiators).

Identification of stakeholders’ role and responsibilities

5.1

Identification of key stakeholders’ role and responsibilities

Establishment and development of rural health clinics to provide primary health care is a priority of
the national health policy implemented by the Ministry of Healthcare. During the first phase (1998-
2004) the Government with assistance of the World Bank implemented a pilot project (Health-1) in
five provinces of the country: Fergana, Navoiy, Syrdarya, Khorezm and Karakalpakstan. Positive
results of the project persuaded the Ministry of Health to develop a new “Health-2” project. A grant
from the Japanese Government funded the project preparation work. The Health-2 project aims to
extend and deepen the scope of the primary health care reform across all regions of Uzbekistan

Therefore, the key stakeholders for this project are:

• The Ministry of Healthcare, its regional departments, and the staff of rural health clinics;
• Regional and local authorities/municipalities;
• Power, heat, and natural gas utilities: GJSC “Uzbekenergo”, and NHC “Uzkekneftegas”;
• Financial institutions and donors (national and international): mainly the World Bank, UNDP and

JICA;

• Private companies and local manufacturers (equipment and services): JSC “FOTON”, SPE

“ENCOM”, etc.

What are the role and responsibilities of each of them?

• The Ministry of Healthcare selects the five rural health clinics and Health-2 project director and
procurement manager were in charge of the call for tender for medical equipment to be installed
in the rural health clinics. Unfortunately, energy efficiency or autonomy of equipment have not
been mentioned and included as specific requirements in the specifications. The Ministry (rural
health clinic administration) is in charge of selecting, planning and installing this equipment
especially in the five selected rural health clinics. Staff in rural health clinic is established based
on a standard procedure set up at the national level;

• Healthcare provincial departments are in charge of district hospitals and complementary
activities implemented by rural health clinics. For instance, they decide about replacement of the
coal firing boiler existed in Djeykhanabad rural health clinic (the total medical facility includes
hospital and rural health clinic). They are assigned with monitoring of rural health clinics. An
annual budget for each rural health clinic is prepared based on calculations made using the
existing norms and standards set up at the national level. A financial ratio (budget per inhabitant)
is determined each year for the various regions (Table 5.1).

(Notice: RHCs in Tashkent region were financed together with Central District Hospitals. Since 2007
they have separate budget).

Investing capacities of the province administration and rural health clinics are limited and they
must consider other possibilities to attract new investments. Budget for every province (oblast) is
a subject to approval at the national level, and it is approved at the corresponding Regional
sessions of local authorities. After identification of key figures, regional health authorities work
out average budget expenses per capita and this is a basis for budget of individual rural health
clinic;

• Rural Health Clinic: Staff list is developed in accordance with the regulations set up at the
national level and it is a subject of approval and endorsement by the Regional Health authorities.
Rural health clinic managers make decision over the issues of staff hiring, setting up their terms
of reference and salaries. Rural health clinic’s staff makes decisions over annual budget
allocations with the concurrence of Regional health authorities and it is now in charge of the
budget management (Table 5.2): each year they have to plan this budget (salaries/wages, social
security, purchase and replacement of equipment and lighting devices, maintenance and operating
(M&O) costs of medical products, costs of power consumption, natural gas or fuel,
miscellaneous), every quarter they check the reality of expenses. Working hours for staff
members to be set up in accordance with the national regulations: from 5.5 hours for dentists to 7
hours for non-medical staff. However, rural health clinic and staff working hours are decided at
the local level and can vary (“floating schedule”) but at the same time should meet the
requirements stated in the Uzbekistan Labor Code (40 working hours a week). Rural health clinic
manager also decides the opening hours, heating needs, and day-to-day decisions.

• Regional and local authorities/municipalities: provincial municipalities (khokimiyats) with the
Ministry of Healthcare are the major responsible implementing agencies for the ‘Health-2’
Project. At local level, various sponsors can take part in the project;

• GJSC “Uzbekenergo” is ready to assist UNDP in the preparation of the feasibility study, but
considers that the five rural health clinics are located at the sites of the 3rd category in terms of the
reliability of power supply: power supply interruption is accepted up to 24 hours! They consider

39

that increasing power supply reliability is not economically feasible and they will not implement
any improvements. They agree with energy efficient and renewable energy technologies which
could be of a great interest for Uzbekistan; but improving the reliability of power in rural health
clinics is not a priority for Uzbekenergo.

• NHC “Uzbekneftegas” considers that natural gas is available for four of the five selected rural
health clinics and thinks that the last one is provided with liquefied gas (which is not the reality)!
From their point of view there is no problem of low pressure of the gas and natural gas is supplied
within the standard parameters. Uzbekneftegas is not concerned with UNDP project because there
is no need to improve the gas supply in rural health clinics;

• State agencies responsible for making decisions on effective and reliable power supply:
Commission on economy of fuel-energy resources under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic
of Uzbekistan;

• Organizations involved into the processes of power supply, development of non-traditional
sources of energy, realization of energy effective projects: Technology Transfer Agency of the
Center for Science and Technologies under the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of
Uzbekistan; Research and Production Association “Physics-Sun” under the Academy of Sciences
of the Republic of Uzbekistan; Opened Joint Stock Company “FOTON”.

• The World Bank representatives in Uzbekistan insist on reliability of power and natural gas
supply in order to guarantee the operating of medical equipment financed by the World Bank and
other donors such as JICA. They are in charge of management, monitoring and evaluation of the
project, the World Bank financing is 40 million USD and in particular 27.13 million USD are
allocated for the primary healthcare development. They are interested to integrate our
recommendations into the procurement procedure for future calls for tender. Concerning the
criteria for selection of solutions, they would give their preference to technical solutions which
may allow operating medical equipment as long as possible with limited maintenance and
operational costs;

• UNDP representatives in Uzbekistan were convinced from the previous experience that
energy efficiency and solar energy technologies could be integrated into existing energy
infrastructure, therefore, they have answered favorably to the Ministry of Healthcare and
WB “Health-2” project to finance and conduct a feasibility study on improving power and
heat supply in rural health clinics. The UNDP project will select and recommend optimal
solutions for rural health clinics for the five ones selected as well as larger dissemination
over the country;

• Few private or semi-public companies and/or local manufacturers are interested in
testing renewable energies and energy efficient equipment to improve the medical

Feasibility Study Report

services provided by rural health clinics; and especially the OJSC “FOTON” and SPE
“ENCOM” that envisaged installing photovoltaic, solar water heating systems, and
energy efficient boilers and heaters in rural health clinics. They both have previous
experiences of installing such equipment in remote areas and they are interested in
dissemination of the proved technical solutions in 3,000 rural health clinics located over
the country. Thereby, they are ready to contribute in selection of technologies, to take part
in further tender bids and piloting of the technical solutions will be selected. Three
experts of these companies have been involved in the UNDP project.

5.2 Development of possible instruments to disseminate this experience

all over the country

Considering the several solutions to be tested in five selected rural health clinics, monitoring and
evaluation is the first action to be implemented in order to identify what are the most appropriate
solutions, depending on various criteria (refer to Section 8.1), and how it could be possible to
disseminate them taking into consideration the limited budget availability for rural health clinics.

As we have already mentioned, today we are missing of a lot of information to be required to choose
and decide about the optimal technical solution to improve power and heal supply reliability in rural
health clinics, therefore the first instruments would be a better knowledge of the situation and
introduction of metering, including:

•

•

•

•

•

•

thermal diagnosis of rural health clinics’ buildings;

exact identification of power cuts (duration and frequency during at least the “winter”
season – from November to May) and natural gas supply failure (metering the gas
pressure) in five selected rural health clinics as well as better knowledge concerning the
power failures occurred in rural health clinics;

installation and monitoring of metering for consumption of electricity, natural gas and hot
and cold water in five selected rural health clinics in order to compare the different
solutions will be implemented;

identification of real needs of power: working hours (per day or week) of medical
equipment, instant maximum power capacity and size needed for refrigerators, etc;

integration of new criteria such as energy efficiency and autonomy for equipment
(boilers, regulation, lighting, medical instruments, refrigerators, etc) installed in rural
health clinic into the procurement procedure for future calls for tender;

identification of difference between types of rural health clinics, climatic regions, main
diseases occurred in the different provinces.

6 Options to improve reliability of power and heat supply
According to the various national consultants, several options could be considered for power supply,
electricity usage, heat supply, space heating, and hot and cold water supply. Therefore, before
selection of these different solutions various options considering the identified problems of reliability
and level of consumption are described below.

6.1 Power reliability and supply

Considering the reports of national consultants (refer to Annexes 5 and 6), the major part of
information about power supply and data concerning the power failures and power consumption are
unreliable, therefore, we have to estimate duration and frequency of power cuts on one side, and
power consumption during these power cuts on the other side, in order to identify the options:

• Blackouts may happen almost every day and could last for long periods (this fact has an
impact on technical solutions using electric power accumulating systems, as no reliable data
available on precise periods of absence of power in industrial electric networks). The most
unreliable period of power supply lasts from November till March. This is 5 months or 125
days = 1,500 working hours. Occasional (extraordinary) blackouts are 168 hours (7 days).
Provisionally the most frequently blackout periods can be assumed as 6 hours. However, we
may also assume that it can be longer. Provisionally, blackout period can be assumed as up to
two days. So, two options have been envisaged: 6 hours and 2 days;

• Electricity consumption and power needs. Based on the data received from rural health
clinics, power consumption varies from 4.2 to 15 kWh/day (Djeykhanabad, hospital plus rural
health clinic), and the main part of power is used for lighting. If we consider the needs for
emergency medical equipment and support equipment (e.g. refrigerator), power
consumption is limited to 6 kWh/day (refer to Chapter 3) that means 2-3 times more than it
was indicated in the information received from rural health clinics; therefore, 3-4 kWh/day
seems a reasonable average power consumption. According to the PV specialist’ report, there
are from 19 (Juzim-Bog) to 42 (Djeykhanabad and Baymukhamedov) lamps inside the rural
health clinics with an energy consumption for lighting varying from 6.2 to 19 kWh/day! For
emergency needs, number of lamps may be limited to less than 10 units, if they are low
consumption lamps consuming 8, 12 or maximum 20 W for 4 working hours/day. Power
consumption for lighting may be limited to 1,000 Wh/day (2,000 Wh/day for Djeykhanabad
rural health clinic plus hospital), refer to Table 6.4. In order to select between the various
options, we consider that emergency needs for power are roughly 3-5 kWh/day. So, two
options have been considered: 1) 5 kWh/day and a capacity up to 500 W that will be used
during the emergency periods (6 hours maximum); and 2) 15 kWh/day and a capacity up to 5
kW that will be used during the longer blackouts (2 days or more) and for all equipment
available in a rural health clinic.

Under such conditions the issue of integration the technical solutions proposed into the existing
internal electrical network available in the rural health clinic could be simplified.

Identification of different options

According to the previous hypothesis several solutions/options could be envisaged:

• Working as usual, if the duration of power cuts is limited to 3-4 hours per day, the risks are
limited. Some of medical equipment has their own batteries, so they are autonomous during
1-2 hours, and refrigerators for drugs’ storage can keep acceptable temperature during 4-6
hours. This option has not been developed in this report but it could be acceptable, if there the
real improvement of power supply to be implemented by the GJSC “Uzbekenergo” will take
place;

•

Independent source of power, such as diesel or petrol generator, with small-capacity UPS to

42

16/11/2022

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

be used during start of generator. After 6 hours of operation the UPS (as source of power)
needs to be charged. It can be used again as an independent source of power after 8-10 hours.
During this time recharging of the UPS can be possible using a diesel/petrol generator of the
adequate power. In order to ensure reliable power supply for a period up to 6 hours during
blackouts, an automatic power generator run by petrol or diesel will be automatically
switched on/off during blackouts. Generator capacity could be from 1 to 5-8 kW depending
on the options. The generator requires periodical maintenance as providing with fuel and
spare parts as well as a specific place for installation. Special fire and safety precautions
should be followed. Generator service lifetime depends on number of hours worked and can
be around 2,000-5,000 hours depending on the maintenance;

•

In order to ensure reliable power supply for a period up to 6 hours during blackouts,
accumulators plus UPS of 10 kVA can be used for temporary (emergency) power supply or
similar one. If the UPS serves more than one consumer, the issue of cable configuration shall
be sorted out and warning system shall be enabled to inform about UPS conditions (e.g. about
accumulator’s capacity), if consumers are located in different offices;

• For larger power supply, it could be covered by using UPS of 10 kVA х 5 or 6 units, or UPS
of up to 50 kVA capacity; however, the cost of such decision very far exceeds 100,000 USD
and we even can not consider such option for capacity up to 5 kW for long duration
blackouts;

• Another solution is usage of photovoltaic panels plus accumulators in the various ranges of
options, from 500 Wp (Watt peak) to 1 or 2 kWp. Investment cost is high but considering the
reliability and lifetime of such equipment it seems interesting to test this solution in 2 or 3
selected rural health clinics. Average costs for a 1 kWp system is around 10,000 USD.

As the last three solutions, it is also necessary to sort out an issue of cable configuration to enable
connection of particular importance equipment excluding possibilities of unforeseen connections in
order to protect power supply from short circuits and overloads.

Remark: These schemes did not consider obligations of electric protection and cabling features.

It is problematic to integrate such equipment into existing internal network of the rural health clinic.
During integration works it would be necessary to make provisions for commutation automatic

Conclusions:

• The issue of improving reliability of power supply can be solved positively;
• The needed equipment can be purchased in Uzbek markets;

44

Feasibility Study Report

• Commissioning works can be arranged;
• Up to two years warranties for the supplied equipment are available.

6.2 Optimization of power consumption

Optimization of power consumption (refer to Annexes 5 and 6) is one of the key issues to reduce the
cost of any standby system of power supply in rural health clinics.

Medical equipment for rural health clinics has already been selected and the procurement procedure
has been launched, therefore, we have to consider the specifications detailed in Table 4.1, and it
seems difficult to replace them now with more energy efficient equipment. However, power
consumption of medical equipment represents less than 20% of the total power consumption, so, it is
more important to focus on the other equipment and especially on lighting, which represents more
than 50% of the actual total consumption in rural health clinics.

Simple analysis of power inputs of rural health clinic shows that in all surveyed clinics there are ways
and approaches for their reduction, including the most important electricity consuming equipment:
refrigerators and lighting.

There are two most simple and widespread approaches to reduce the power consumption:

•

•

approach #1 lies in reduction of equipment’s hours of service, reduction of general lighting
system and shift (at least partial) to local lighting system (table lamps and luminaries);
methods and ways for implementation of the first approach are probably the main prerogative
of rural health clinic’s staff and they can be covered in this report only in the form of the most
general recommendations;

approach #2 lies in replacement of existing equipment with energy efficient equipment with
less power inputs. Methods and ways for implementation of the second approach depend on
rural health clinic’s staff and equipment providers and are mainly related to availability or
lack of funds for procurement of new equipment.

To this end, we would only point out that all equipment (both medical and diagnostic, and auxiliary)
used in surveyed rural health clinics, have been received from the WB Health-1 or Health-2 projects,
therefore, replacement could not be an objective.

6.2.1 Situation and optimization of refrigerators in selected rural health clinics

It appears from Table 6.2 that electric power consumed by refrigerators is rather high, especially at
those rural health clinics, where three refrigerators are operating.

Share of electric power consumed by the refrigerators for drugs’ storage only varies from 40 to 65%
of power consumed by auxiliary equipment in various rural health clinics (even after rural health
clinics re-equipping with specialized refrigerators).

At the same time, there are both specialized (medical) and domestic refrigerators, which consume two
times less electric power than refrigerators listed in Table 6.2, including:

•

specialized (medical) refrigerators of KYOCERA designed for payload volume of 39 l, and at
the ambient temperature of 32 0C they consume 280 Wh/day (without production of ice) and
470 Wh/day with production of ice;

• domestic refrigerators, type ‘Saratov’-452KSh120 designed for payload volume of 100 l and

consuming 630 Wh/day.

Therefore, it is easy to reduce the electricity consumed for priority auxiliary equipment by 500-700
Wh/day using the above specialized refrigerator, and on that basis either to reduce the capacity of
standby power supply (and, therefore, its cost), or to include additionally some the second priority
equipment to the list of the first priority equipment, for example, a cabinet for sterilizing oven.

In order to use medical refrigerator during blackouts, an automatically controlled generator to switch
on/off power shall be needed.

6.2.2 Optimization and replacement of electric lighting system

Considering the average consumption for lighting in the five selected rural health clinics, which
varies from 30% (in Pakhtakor rural health clinic) to 65% (in Djeykhanabad clinic), replacement
with efficient electric lighting system is one of the most important issues for elaboration of
efficient standby power supply. The most radical one is to use so-called power-saving fluorescent
lamps (PSL).

These lamps are characterized with two features:

•

•

they possess all lighting technology characteristics of lamps normally applied for lighting
(for example, filament lamps or tube fluorescent lamps) but consume substantively less
(up to five times) electric power;
their nominal operating duration stated in specifications is 8,000-10,000 hours.

As a comparison, filament lamps (FL) have a stated nominal operating duration of 1,000 hours,
and tube fluorescent lamps (TFL) – 8,000-10,000 hours.

Naturally, application of these lamps should be primarily determined by reasons of economy (cost
benefit analysis), although their current cost in Uzbekistan is 10-40 times higher than the cost of
filament lamps and 2-8 times higher than the cost of tube fluorescent lamps. At Uzbek markets
power-saving fluorescent lamps (PSL) are sold by three groups of suppliers:

• Chinese power-saving fluorescent lamps are the cheapest (1.8-2.5 USD depending on the
capacity), and at the same time they are most unreliable. Their realistic average lifetime
does not exceed 2-30,000 hours. Moreover, in most cases, their starting controllers do not
comply with security requirements;

• Local power-saving fluorescent lamps (manufactured by the OJSC “FOTON”) cost 4.0-
4.5 USD, their average lifetime is 4.5-5,000 hours, and they fully comply with security
standards of IEC 928:1995, IDT;

• European power-saving fluorescent lamps (Philips, Osram, GE, and Siemens) available at
Uzbek market cost 8-9 USD, their average lifetime is 7-9,000 hours, and they fully
comply with security standards of IEC 928:1995, IDT.

To have a clear picture, cost of filament lamps at Uzbek market is 0.24-0.28 USD, and cost of
tube fluorescent lamps is 1.0-1.2 USD. The main characteristics of lamps for lighting are given in
Table 6.3.

3. *** - actual hours of service differ from the operating time stated in specifications because all
manufacturers declare continuous operating time. At the same time, all manufacturers the world-wide show
in their specifications that the resources of lamps might be decreased by more than two times in large
quantities of on-off cycles;

4. **** - number before “/” is taken from the specifications, number after “/” is an actual value.

Based on the data above, replacement of filament lamps and tube fluorescent lamps could become
economically sound and rational (refer to case study in Section 7.4). Even the cost of electricity in
Uzbekistan is 5 times lower than in Europe, replacement of filament lamps with power-saving
fluorescent lamps (locally manufactured) is economically viable after 3,000 hours (2 years) and
replacement of tube fluorescent lamps with power-saving fluorescent lamps is viable after 8,000 hours
(5 years).

An issue of lighting can also be solved through portable sources of light (lanterns or lamps with
accumulators). It is possible to use light emitting diode (LED) stationary or portable lamps, however,
the latter proposal is still under consideration as no data available about its’ reliability, though
lamps’ service life is almost 100,000 hours (according to the manufacturers) with 5 times less power
consumption in comparison with the luminescent energy saving lamps. According to our experience
the service life is about 3-5 years.

Recommendations on organization of lighting in the priority rooms of rural health clinics with the help
of the modern power-saving fluorescent lamps of 20 W (or less) are presented in Table 6.4.

Concluding the recommendations on power consumption in rural health clinics, it should be noted
that, even with power-saving fluorescent lamps, there are some reserves dealing with the optimization
of power inputs for lighting. Those reserves mainly lie in the planning of optimization of
working/lighting time for some rooms, reduction of capacity of applied power-saving fluorescent
lamps as well as wider use of natural lighting. Introduction of these facilities would allow reducing
power inputs for lighting for some 20-30%.

Notes:

1. * - Daily electric power consumption and its monthly shortage are calculated as a subject to rural
health clinic equipment in accordance with the information provided by the WB Health-2 Project;

2. ** - Daily electric power consumption and deficiency is calculated as a subject to operation at

night:
• Umarov, Baymukhamedov, Pakhtakor and Juzim-Bog rural health clinics: refrigerator for
drugs storage and tell-tale light in the form of one power-saving fluorescent lamp of 20 W
operating during 12 hours;

• Djeykhanabad rural health clinic: refrigerator for drugs storage and lighting:

▪

▪

▪

round-the-clock wards: 6 power-saving fluorescent lamps of 20 W
operating during 2 hours,
labor ward: 3 power-saving fluorescent lamps of 20 W operating during 4
hours,
corridor (tell-tale light): 1 power-saving fluorescent lamp of 20 W
operating during 12 hours.

3. *** - Electric power deficiency related to power cuts that has been calculated for winter season

(as the most unfavorable season for the rural heath clinics except Juzim-Bog).

4. **** - Electric power deficiency related to power cuts that has been calculated for spring season

as the most unfavorable season for the rural heath clinic Juzim-Bog.

Based on the data presented in Table 6.5 and considering the peculiarities of the regions where the
rural health clinics are located, differences in duration and frequency of the power cuts occurred,
variations on installed capacities of the main medical, diagnosis, and auxiliary equipment and power
consumed for lighting, it is obvious that:

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

•

•

•

for the four of five rural health clinics, maximal daily deficiency of electricity is close to 5
kWh/day. Exception is the rural health clinic “Juzim-Bog” only, for which this figure is 2.3
kWh/day;

for all five surveyed rural health clinics, average monthly daily deficiency of electric power
considered for the most unfavorable season is ranged from 1.65 to 1.9 kWh/day;

for all five surveyed rural health clinics, average monthly deficiency of electric power
considered for the most unfavorable season is ranged from 51 to 60 kWh.

It has to be outlined that compensation of this electric power deficiency will allow all surveyed rural
health clinics to fulfill their functions to carry out diagnostics, medical treatment, and physiotherapy
procedures.

However, compensation of the above value of electric power deficiency (approximately 50 kWh)
using the standby (emergency) power sources might be unacceptable owing to financial or any other
reasons.

However, a value of 2 or 4 hours of power shortage might be unacceptable owing to financial or any
other reasons.

Based on that, we shall consider an alternative variant that is less power-consuming. This variant is
based on proposals made by the senior managers of Umarov and Baymukhamedov rural health
clinics. An essence of the proposals comprises of:

• only the first priority medical equipment (electrocardiograph and equipment for medical
analysis) should be considered as an important for emergency (consumption basis is
procurement for Health-2 project);

• only refrigerator for drugs’ storage, medical lighters and equipment for disinfection of

premises should be considered as an important auxiliary equipment;

• only laboratory, inspection, procedures and physiotherapy rooms should be considered as the

important rooms for lighting.

1. * - Deficiency of electric power related to the power cuts and calculated for winter season (as
the most unfavorable season for the rural health clinics “Umarov”, “Baymukhammedov”,
“Djeykhanabad”, and “Pakhtakor”);

2. ** - Electric power deficiency related to the power cuts that has been calculated for spring

season as the most unfavorable season for the rural health clinic “Juzim-Bog”.

Based on the data presented in Table 6.6, for an alternative variant, as the less power consuming one
considered for the most unfavorable season in terms of the power supply, the following conclusions
can be made:

•

•

•

for the four of five rural health clinics, maximal daily deficiency of electricity is close to 3
kWh/day. Exception is the rural health clinic “Juzim-Bog” only, for which this figure is 1.9
kWh/day;

for all five surveyed rural health clinics, average monthly daily deficiency of electric power
is 1.3 kWh/day ± 0.4 kWh/day;

for the four of five rural health clinics, monthly deficiency of electric power considered is
approximately 30 kWh/day. Exception is the rural health clinic “Juzim-Bog” only, for which
this figure is 50 kWh/day.

In general, summarizing the data given in tables 6.5 and 6.6, we can conclude that use of the
alternative variant will allow reducing electric power characteristics of the standby (emergency)
power supply (based on the monthly deficiency of electric power related to the power cuts) by
almost 1.7 times.

6.3 Heat supply

Four of the five selected rural health clinics are supplied with natural gas but during winter season
they face the problems of low pressure of the gas, so the boilers cannot properly operate. All gas
boilers are quite obsolete and they are not energy efficient.

In the fifth rural health clinic (Djeykhanabad clinic) the coal firing boiler was out of order and must
be replaced. It has been decided to replace with a new coal firing home made boiler (what about its
efficiency?), which will provide both hospital and rural health clinic with heating and hot water. As
the efficiency of a coal boiler is poor at low level of capacity, it seems preferable to install another
equipment providing hot water during non-heating season.

Business as usual option could appear to be a solution considering the answer of NHC
“Uzbekneftegas”, however, in fact in order to ensure the reliability of services provided to the
population by the rural health clinics, we must identify and select solutions for heating even when low
gas pressure is lower the working/security level for boilers’ operation.

Thus, possible solutions are described in Table 6.7.

Table 6.7 Heat supply solutions

Solution/Options

Description

Thermal diagnosis

Installation of gas meters

Gas vessels

Such diagnosis must be implemented during heating season, so it
was too late to implement them during last season, but they must be
done in the five selected RHCs by the same time of installation of
meters, in order to have a base of comparison before installation of
improving equipment.
In order to identify the real consumption of gas in the selected RHCs
and to evaluate the main changes after installation of new solutions,
it is necessary to install reliable meters and to register the data every
week especially during heating season.
In Umarov and Baymukhamedov RHCs boilers can be shifted to

Feasibility Study Report

liquefied gas. However, there are no conditions to store liquefied gas
in the RHCs (in terms of fire safety requirements and requirements
of local state engineering supervision authority “Gostechnadzor”.
According to neighboring residents, starting from December 10,
2006 up to February 10, 2007 gas pressure in pipelines decreased
down to 50-60 mm in Umarov and Baynukhamedov RHCs.
This happens because the RHCs are located at the ends of gas supply
lines, and there is no possibility to “loop back the pipelines” – to
connect two different branches of gas pipeline to make a loop for
improving gas pressure.
As self-made natural gas firing boilers have been installed in the
RHCs, the Ministry of Healthcare has to replace them with more
efficient boilers. In order to avoid large investment a first option
could be just to replace natural gas burners with automatic control
devices. Price of one set varies from 280 to 320 USD.
Second option: replacement of the existing boilers. Boiler suppliers
are listed below in the Specification Table 1 refer to Annex 8.
Such replacement can be envisaged in Umarov and
Baymukhamedov depending on budget, replacement of burners or
boilers in Pakhtakor and Juzim-Bog RHCs.
This replacement has to be realized before next heating season in
Djeykhanabad RHC and hospital. In Djeykhanabad RHC electric
boilers could have been used as main source due to existing own
transformer stations. This solution has not been chosen by
stakeholders.
Electrical boilers (with the capacity of 25 kW manufactured in
Russia or in Uzbekistan), solar water heaters can be installed for
production and storage (as reserve unit) of hot water for the central
heating of RHCs during shortage or low pressure period.
In order to provide central heating with hot water and to avoid
freezing in the grid it could be possible to storage hot water at 60-65
0C for entering in the grid if the temperature goes down 10 or 5 0C
inside the buildings. A storage tank of 2 or 3,000 liters seems a
minimum to be installed with an automatic regulation.

6.4 Heat demand management

6.5 Hot water supply and demand management

Several options can be recommended (Table 6.9) for using in rural health clinics depending on the
operational conditions (reliability of natural gas supply, power supply, etc.). Business as usual option
could be a solution considering that hot water does not appear to be a priority; so, it does not need any
description.

Table 6.9 Hot water supply and demand management

Solution/Options

Description

Hot water meters

Electric water heaters

Theoretical consumption of hot water in RHCs is 250 liters per day,
but RHCs’ staff informs us about a maximum of 50 or 60 liters per
day at a temperature of 35-40 0C for washing hands. Before
investing in new equipment it seems necessary to know more
precisely what is the consumption and for which usage
(temperature).
To improve reliability of RHC hot water supply, electric water

accumulator tanks with the capacity of up to 50-120 liters can be
used. Heated water can be stored for a long period in well-isolated
tank. Installed capacity of electric heating elements of 1-2 kW
enables storage of water heated up to 65 0C within 4-8 hours.
They have the same advantages like electric ones. Heating is done
through popping of gas with automatics ensuring maintaining the
temperature at the same level. Disadvantage: gas boilers have to be
operational even in non heating season.
Solar water heaters with collector area of 1 m2 and tank capacity of
80 liters can be installed; or with collector area of 2 m2 and tank
capacity of 160 liters. Solar water heaters can be used seasonally or
whole-year. Seasonal solar water heaters are of very simple design
and low cost. Solar water heaters for whole-year’ use are of double-
loop circuit with tubular electric heating element in accumulator
tank which enables to maintain constant temperatures under low
solar radiation.
In several RHCs we have notice that staff is using gas cookers only
for getting boiling water, so it seems more efficient to provide RHC
with small liquefied gas boilers for this purpose. Estimated needs are
less than 3 liters per day, so life time of a small bottle of liquefied
gas could be 2 or 3 years.

6.6 Cold water supply and management

Referring to Table 2.1 some of rural health clinics faces the problems with cold water supply, and
there are risks of cold water freezing in Umarov rural health clinic. Solutions for cold water supply
and demand management are summarized in Table 6.10.

Table 6.10 Cold water supply and demand management

Solution/Options

Description

Water meters and control

Diagnosis of centralized cold
and hot water supply

Cold water storage inside the
building

Checking sewerage systems

Water quality, pressure in the pipe and water meters must be
installed in order to identify the real problems and to know the real
consumption of cold water. Information given by RHCs’ staff point
out low consumption (100 to 200 liters per day) far from the norm
given by the Ministry. Considering conditions of storage in some
RHC, quality control of water could be necessary for sanitary
reasons and control of sewerage system.
A lot of sink and wash hand basin are installed in the RHCs, some
are out of order or not connected to cold and/or hot water pipes, a
diagnosis is necessary in order to select those which must be
connected and prioritized.
Today in Umarov RHC, cold water is delivered 1 or 2 times a month
by trucks in a 3m3 tank outside the building ,so with risks of
freezing. A new storage insulated and /or protected from freezing
seems preferable. The selected solution will have to take care with
access to the RHC which is difficult for trucks.
Sewerage systems are available in the 5 selected RHCs but it must
be repaired in Umarov. So, it seems useful to check each of them

Financial and economic analysis

7.1 Methodology used for cost benefit analysis

“The objective of the cost-benefit analysis is:

To compare costs and benefits of using conventional fossil fuels, business as usual, energy
management and renewable energy sources for energy supply and demand and quantify potential
economic gains or losses on the state level, regional level and/or local level, which can be derived
through utilization of the Rational Use of Energy (RUE) and renewable energy sources, including
consideration of environmental impacts of the renewable and conventional types of energy”.

“The cost-benefit analysis on the state level includes socio-economic (or just economic) analysis, seen
from the point of view for the society as a whole. It is a normal convention in socio-economic
analysis that taxes, subsidies and possible incentives at national level are not included in the pricing of
fuels and technologies, as they can be seen as an internal redistribution of capital within the country
and will not influence on the overall socio-economic result. This convention is followed in these cost
benefit analysis; the analyses and assessments at national level include the assessment of reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions.” (Source: Renewable Energy for RHC. NREL USA 1998)

The cost-benefit analysis on local level (rural health clinics) includes financial analysis for the
investors. In financial analysis, tariffs for electricity purchase, fuel prices at consumer level, and taxes
are included in the pricing of purchase of fuels and energy (but not subsidies considering that tariffs in
Uzbekistan are lower than at the international market) and in the pricing of purchase of technologies.

The methodology, which has been used for carrying out the cost benefit analysis, can be briefly
summarized as follows:

1. Selection and definition of a number of case studies covering the major part of relevant
solutions selected for rural health clinics. Case studies for power supply using diesel
generator and solar PV system in the Uzbek context. Each case study includes business as
usual that is compared with the rational use of energy technologies and/or renewable energy
system;

2. Determination of requirements to financial viability (willingness to invest) for different

stakeholders;

3. Determination of non technology specific assumptions, including:

• Current fuel prices;
• Current tariffs for purchase and sale of electricity and purchase of natural gas;
• Assessment of fuel price development and tariff development.

4. Determination of technology specific assumptions, including:

• Energy balances;
• Greenhouse gas emissions;
•

Investments and operation and maintenance costs (O&M costs).

5. Discussion of financial incentives requirements in order to achieve the minimum set of

requirements;

6. Analysis of economical viability and cost-effectiveness (in relation to CO2 emission

reduction).

The cost benefit analysis is prepared for this project with comparisons of technologies for production
of power or heat on the basis of the case studies (sections 7.3 to 7.6).

7.2 Energy resource tariffs evolution and forecast

Although prices for energy resources and electricity in Uzbekistan have increased (from 400 to
500%) during the five last years, prices for 1 kWh of natural gas is ten times lower than for 1 kWh of
electricity, however, actually the energy tariffs are from five to ten times lower than in European
countries (Table 7.1). Therefore, energy savings and renewable energies are more difficult to justify
from an economic point of view.

Figure 7.1 Economic fuel and electricity prices

Considering the scenarios prepared in 2004 (Source: UNDP Policy brief “Options for Continuing
Energy Reforms in Uzbekistan”, 2007), prices for natural gas remain at the low level, and on the
contrary prices for electricity are at the higher level. As there are 11 kWh in 1 nm3 of natural gas,
it appears that the current prices for electricity are approximately 10 times higher than prices for
natural gas. So, for the cost benefit analysis, results and conclusions may be very different, if we
have to compare new solutions with the substitution of electricity or natural gas.

7.3 Case study: power substitution with diesel generator, accumulator

or solar photovoltaic systems

To provide power in a rural health clinic during power cuts, several solutions have been selected:
diesel/petrol generator, accumulators, accumulators with uninterruptible power supply (UPS), and
photovoltaic (PV) systems with accumulators. In order to compare these solutions, we have
considered that they have to operate during approximately 1,000 hours per year (cumulative
duration of power cuts) providing 5,000 kWh/year (5 kWh consumed during 1 hour power cuts).

The technical and economic assumptions used in the cost benefit analysis are summarized in
Table 7.2.

Compared to tariffs for electricity provided from the grid (45 UZS/kWh in 2007) such costs are

price if we agree that shortage of power is not acceptable at all and we accept to pay “a deficiency

cost” which can be defined as the cost of undelivered medical services to population plus cost of
life if the emergency medical aid can’t be provided plus cost of spoiled drugs, medical tests,
vaccines etc.

A petrol generator is the most expensive solution for this level of power capacity. For a capacity
of generator varies from 8 to 10 kW (as for Djeykhanabad rural health clinic plus hospital) such
solution is more economically competitive.

7.4 Case study: improving electric lighting

Considering that power substitution is very expensive, the first action to be undertaken is to
reduce power consumption in general and especially the power consumed for lighting, which
represents more than 50% of the total power needs in the rural health clinics. Therefore, we have
to compare cost of traditional lighting system with another one that is using the low consumption
lamps. This case study has the following characteristics: 16 lamps (minimum for emergency
service) as in the rural health clinics Umarov, Baymukhamedov, Pakhtakor or Juzim-Bog. Low
consumption lamps (PSL) can be provided by local manufacturers or imported from Europe with
difference in terms of prices and nominal/actual hours of service. Considering the implementation
of security requirements, a minimal operating voltage (170/160 V) and prices, comparison has
been made using the lamps locally manufactured (Table 7.3).

Thereby, without any consideration of reliability of power supply, it seems profitable to change
all lamps already installed in the rural health clinics with power saving ones. This avoids
replacement of lamps once a year, and save money and energy. This action requires more
expensive investments but payback period is only 2.4 years. Therefore, we propose replacement
of all lamps used in the five selected rural health clinics, as well as dissemination of such solution
through replacement of lamps in other rural health clinics when they are out of order. As
incandescent lamps have a lifetime of less than 1 year, they would be replaced within one year
quite everywhere.

7.5 Case study: heat demand saving potential using insulation and

automatic regulation

Three easy and low-cost energy saving measures could be widely implemented:

•
•
•

Insulation of attics: laying down a thick layer of lose mineral wool;
Improvement of window tightness by the mean of weather stripping;
Introduction of an automatic regulation for efficient temperature control in each rural
health clinic including metering and monitoring.

60

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

The only automatic regulation should be an imported technology. There is no doubt that a local
company could launch manufacturing of this component in some months, if a wide market is
developed for dissemination in every rural health clinic.

An average payback of these three measures in Europe is less than one year, due to the expensive
price for natural gas in Europe. In Uzbekistan, even the tariff for natural gas is lower than in
Europe; the Ministry of Healthcare could invest for improving the energy/heating consumption
with the running budget considered for 2-3 civil years. The rural health clinics’ managers should
pay on the basis of the records provided by reliable gas meters. However, today such decision is
difficult to implement because rural health clinics do not pay the real price for the natural gas
consumed: there is lack of meters or meters are not reliable, gas tariffs for 1 kWh is ten times
cheaper than for 1 kWh of electricity, and gas tariff is very far from the international prices.

As the figures concerning the gas consumption, efficiency of boilers, insulation of buildings, etc.
are not reliable, we must have elaborate and use the specific hypothesis concerning the rural
health clinic of type 2 (200 m2):

•

•

•

annual natural gas consumption for the rural health clinic of type 2 (200 m2) has been
estimated as 6,000 m3;

energy efficiency of locally made boilers is 60-70%;

energy saving potential through insulation of ceiling, walls, and windows is 20-30%.

Considering the rational use of thermal energy (heating), comparison of different solutions has
been made (Table 7.4).

Even with a low tariff for natural gas, an automatic regulation presents a good payback period of
2.6 years, thus, it means that it must be implemented in the five selected rural health clinics and
proposed for dissemination in all other rural health clinics. The required investment is cheap and
can be included in the annual budget of a rural health clinic.

As the other investments and considering 2007 year tariffs for gas, the cost benefit analysis shows
that they could be done as an example for testing before further dissemination when tariffs for gas
would increase (in 2012). The first step could be replacement of burners only (instead of
replacement of boilers), with the required investment lies in the range of 280-320 USD, energy
saving potential is 15-20%, and payback period is reduced to 7 years even today.

Combining the three solutions presents a potential energy saving of 58% for an investment of
4,075 USD. With 2012 year tariff the energy saving could be 557 USD per year; and payback
period will be 7.3 years. Such investment is worth for implementing as a test in one of the
selected rural health clinics.

7.6 Case study: hot water production using electrical and solar water

heaters

Considering the potential of solar energy in Uzbekistan, use of solar collectors can save energy
for hot water production and for heating. However, the sun is more abundant in summer, the time
that is out of the heating season, and usually very few days can be without the sun during this
period. During non-heating season, hot water can be provided by autonomous solar water heaters
using simplified solar collectors installed on the roof or at the terrace of a rural health clinic with
the purpose to collect solar energy mainly during this period. Considering the needs for hot water
limited to 50-100 liters per day in the rural health clinic, a solar collector with the area of 1 or 1.5
m2 and with an accumulator tank of 80-120 liters will cover these needs. During heating season
hot water could be provided by a gas boiler.

Therefore, installation of solar water heaters has been analyzed in terms of two situations:

•

•

solar water heater is replaced with a gas water heater (it corresponds to the actual
situation taken place in five selected rural health clinics);
solar water heater is replaced with an electric water heater.

Technical assumptions are the following: Seasonal needs of 60 liters x 200 days x 55 0C = 540
Mcal = 628 kWh = 57.2 m3 of natural gas. Size of the solar water heater is 1.5 m2, and storage
tank capacity is 100 liters.

Comparison of different solutions for hot water supply has been made and is presented in Table
7.5.

Considering 2007 year tariffs for natural gas and electricity, the cheapest solution to produce the
hot water is an electrical water heater. Forecasting for 2012 with assumption of 400% increase of
tariffs, shows that solar water heater could be a profitable solution that includes the energy
saving.

7.7 Specific CO2 emission factors

The following CO2 emission factors are used in the calculations (Table 7.6):

The Table 7.6 shows that the CO2 emissions per 1 kWh produced are highest for the gasoline
engine and lowest for the gas boiler.

Renewable energy technologies do not produce any CO2 emission, therefore, use of photovoltaic
systems or solar water heaters reduces the emission for all energy substituted (Table 7.7). Another
possibility is energy saving.

The main potential for CO2 emission reduction comes from energy saving for heating, and next
one comes from substitution with photovoltaic system to generate electricity during power cuts.

Conclusions on financial and economic analysis

From an economical point of view only one investment is attractive: lighting with power-saving
fluorescent lamps.

For electricity substitution, solutions are acceptable, if we consider a deficiency cost for kWh
during power cuts.

For other solutions, they could be attractive in 2012, if tariffs for natural gas and electricity
continue their increase in order to join the international prices (hypothesis of 400% based on the
situation took place during last five years).

Another consideration (and may be a financing source) is reduction of CO2 emissions; for one
rural health clinic it is only 17.2 tons of CO2 emission reduction but after dissemination in other
rural health clinics (in 3,000 RHC located over the country) it could be more than 50,000
tons of the CO2 emissions avoided.

Selection of optimal solutions and development of their
technical design

Previous chapter shows that financial and economic analysis limits the solutions to the
replacement of power-saving fluorescent lamps for lighting. The other solutions identified in
Chapter 6 present a payback period (break-even) longer than 10 years due to actual tariffs for gas
and electricity. Such approach is more positive, if we consider the lifetime of equipment (from 10
to 20 years) and tariffs expected by 2012.

However, the main problem to solve is reliability of power supply and heating, and the cost
benefit analysis does not take care on lack of medical services. Thereby, it appears necessary to
identify new criteria for selection of optimal solutions. After discussion with several stakeholders
we have prepare and tested a list of new criteria (refer to Section 8.1), and based on them selected
various solutions for the five rural health clinics (refer to Section 8.2). Details concerning the
technical designs of the chosen solutions are given in the national consultants reports (refer to
Annexes 5 to 8).

8.1 Criteria for selection of solutions

Technical, economic and financial aspects have been detailed in the previous Chapters 6 and 7
using a comparative analysis of the different options. After discussion with the main stakeholders
such as the Ministry of Healthcare, and the World Bank and JICA representatives, it seems that
we must have to consider other criteria than technical, economic or financial ones. Here is a list of
criteria and results of appreciation made by the stakeholders consulted (Table 8.1).

Note: * A rough estimation of the cost of priority (1 & 2) medical equipment is 3,000 USD

Considering the results of this consultation, it seems that quite all criteria selected are very
important or important. The first priority is given to the following: avoiding the medical risks,
reduction of economical damage, and reliability of equipment operation, which are very important
criteria. Demonstration of the technical solutions to be disseminated at a cheap price appears also
important. Then, the second series of criteria are lifetime of equipment (more than 10 years), its
easy operation and maintenance by local rural health clinic staff, and opportunity to reduce the
operational costs of rural health clinic.

In order to select the optimal solutions, we have placed them in Table 8.2 to identify what
solutions are corresponded to these criteria.

It is impossible to increase the gas pressure because of the gas supplier monopoly.

There is no supplier or manufacturer of reservoirs for liquefied gas in Uzbekistan and based on
the suggestion made by the National Consultant this option is not recommended.

Instead of replacing the cold water tank, cost of insulation of the existing tank to avoid cold water
freezing has been estimated to 250 USD.

Options for alternative proposal: suppression of one UPS (minus 2,450 USD), and of thermal

As solutions for Baymukhamedov are supposed to be the reference in terms of innovation and
efficiency (show room) the “alternative” is limited to the suppression of insulation of walls, which is
very expensive with a long pay back period: -7,800 = 26,735 USD.

In order to provide this clinic with an autonomous solution for power, another option is the
installation of 1.2 kW for PV system instead of 500 W. The cost increase is + 4,450 USD.

For the five rural health clinics the total amount of investments can be estimated to 132,935 USD
including investments proposed for both the rural health clinic and the hospital located in
Djeykhanabad.

Alternative proposal:

For different reasons we have been asked to prepare an alternative proposal including a provision/
participation for the replacement of the coal firing boiler in Djeykhanabad which is out of order for
many months and cannot be repaired. Another reason is to reduce the amount of investment and to
guarantee the management and monitoring of the project.

In order to limit the amount of such investment an alternative proposal can be envisaged, reducing
capacity of some equipment (UPS in UMAROV, solar water heaters in Djeykhanabad, etc) and
focusing only on 4 RHCs considering that Pakhtakor is not representative of specific type and
location of RHC: type 3 and there are 2 other RHCs, situated in the suburbs of Urgench and not in a
rural area. A provision of 13,000 USD for replacement of the coal firing boiler of Djeykhanabad has
been added in order to answer to the demand of the Ministry of Healthcare/Regional Administration
(15 M UZ Sums+ 10% contingencies).

So the total for this “alternative proposal” is 99,735 USD including a provision/participation of
13,000 USD for replacement of the coal firing boiler in Djeykhanabad.

Whatever is the solution decided, in order to learn from this experience, some funds for management
and monitoring the pilot projects to be implemented during two years, must be added. 12,500 USD
are dedicated to metering and thermal diagnosis (in the first proposal, reduced to 8,180 USD in the
alternative proposal), as a base for monitoring; so the cost for monitoring will be limited to
intellectual activities.

Indeed, after preparing technical requirements for equipment to be procured and announcing the call
for tender bids (3 months), signing the contracts and installing the equipment (6 months), it will be
necessary to monitor the pilot projects during one year to cover all seasons (heating and non-heating)
and to gain an experience from these demonstrations before recommending the solutions for
dissemination in other rural health clinics or hospitals.

Feasibility Study Report

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The main problem regarding this feasibility study is lack of official and reliable data that can be used
for identifying difficulties and possible improvements of power and heat supply. Every one agree with
the fact that there are failures with power supply from grid and natural gas supply from the gas
distribution networks (lack of gas or low pressure of the gas) but we could not get any officially
confirmed information concerning the power cuts (duration and frequency as there are no statistics
data for these problems), and lack of natural gas or frequency of low gas pressure periods. Even some
managers of the rural health clinics provided the project with some relevant figures, nobody knows
about the situation that will take place next 5 or 10 years. Therefore, we have to work with
hypothesis/assumptions only, and one of the first priority activities to be implemented during the
second phase of this project is to record (monitoring) duration and frequency of power cuts in the five
selected rural health clinics and possibly in some other representative areas.

Same problem with electricity and gas consumption: data collected from various sources is not
coherent, and expenses for electricity and natural gas consumption do not correspond to actual ones.
Thereby, we have no a sound basis to compare new solutions with the actual situation, e.g. what is the
real power consumption for lighting? How much the rural health clinics (depending on their geo-
climatic conditions) consume for heating? A thermal and energy diagnosis must be done in the rural
health clinics. Unfortunately, such diagnosis can be realized during heating season only, and it was
too late to make it during the first (feasibility study) phase started in April 2007. Depending on the
actual conditions of insulation of the rural health clinic buildings, and the energy efficiency of gas
boilers, solutions to improve heat supply are not of the same interest (from an economic/financial
point of view) to choose the assumptions and to select technical solutions based on the expected
consumption and saving, and on the other criteria.

However, as we have considered that the purpose of this feasibility study is improving the quality of
services provided to the population by rural health clinics, we proposed a list of criteria which have
been classified by the stakeholders (refer to Section 8.1.) in order to choose the solutions based not
only on the financial consideration, but also taken into consideration the reliability and lifetime (10
years or more) of the equipment, considerations for further dissemination, easiness for operation and
maintenance the proposed equipment by local staff of the rural health clinics, and opportunity to
reduce the operating costs (e.g. through using renewable energy sources). Potential for CO2 emission
reduction has also been identified in order to get carbon financing from the relevant international
funds.

Therefore, solutions identified and selected to improve power and energy efficiency and reliability in
the five selected rural health clinics prove that problems can be solved with use of different technical
equipment adjusted to the needs and peculiarities of each rural health clinic as well as to medical
equipment already installed or to be installed during next three years.

As for the power supply, installation of batteries/accumulators and uninterruptible power supply
(UPS) (proposed for two rural health clinics) with some piloting of application of photovoltaic (PV)
systems (proposed for two rural health clinics) seems the simplest way to test and demonstrate options
on improving power supply reliability in rural health clinics. Considering the demand side, some
refrigerators can be replaced with the energy efficient and energy saving ones, however, the main
action has to be focused on the lighting: replacement of incandescent bulbs with low consumption
energy efficient lamps has to be done everywhere.

As far as the heating and hot water supply, several solutions can be tested: new efficient gas boilers
with regulation, boilers with combined burners, electrical heaters, solar water heaters, etc. On the
demand side, the main identified solutions include insulation of rural health clinic’s buildings and
pipes, checking efficiency and possible replacement of some radiators, controlling and regulating the
temperature inside the buildings.

These different solutions have been detailed in Chapter 8 of the Feasibility Study Report and in the
national consultants’ reports (Annexes 5 to 8). As UMAROV and BAYMUKHAMEDOV rural health
clinics are the same type of buildings, we have limited the list of improvements to be made in
UMAROV rural health clinic in order to allow making a comparison with the BAYMUKHAMEDOV

rural health clinic after implementation of the technical solutions proposed. For rural health clinic
DJEYKHANABAD as a medical facility combined a rural health clinic and a hospital, solutions have
been elaborated for both parts. This can serve as an example for improvements can be implemented in
other hospitals. Solutions for PAKHTAKOR and JUZIM-BOG rural health clinics present some
differences in order to compare them before further dissemination will be recommended, and as
solution can be particularly implemented in remote areas and in rural health clinics that are not
connected to the power grid. Total amount of investments required for solutions for implementation in
five rural health clinics have been estimated to 132,935 USD.

An alternative proposal limited to four rural health clinics has been estimated to 99735 USD including
a provision/participation of 13,000 USD for replacement of the coal firing boiler in Djeykhanabad.
For this alternative the refurbishment of Pakhtakor rural health clinic has been deleted considering
that Juzim-Bog will represent a more interesting example for dissemination especially for non
connected areas.

In order to learn from this experience some funds for management and monitoring the projects to be
implemented during two years must be added, especially for one year monitoring the pilot projects to
gain the practical experience and reliable data and information before starting dissemination in other
rural health clinics or hospitals.

the feasibility study and carrying out of a comparative
analysis of all options to improve reliability of power and

regions
Tashkent, Uzbekistan
3 and half calendar months (15. 03.2007 – 31.06.2007-
approx.), 51 working days
SSA (full time for 51 w/d)

At present, large-scale reforms are being executed in the public health sector of Uzbekistan.
Establishment and development of the rural health clinics (RHC) (primary health care) is the priority
of the national policy. The strategy for the primary health care reforming is focused on improvement
of quality and effectiveness of the medical service provided to the population, and is based on
integration of modern medical technologies, preventive health care, training of general practitioners,
strengthening of financing and management of primary health care.

The Uzbek Government and international donor organizations have allocated substantial funds into
rural health care infrastructure. However, the majority of rural health clinics have faced certain
problems with power and heat supply during the recent years. The reasons are, in the first place,
interrupted heating and hot water supply caused by problems with unstable natural gas and power
supply to medical facilities (low gas pressure and frequent power failures), especially in winter
season. Moreover, some problems with reliable cold water supply occur in summer season. These and
other factors have made a negative impact on quality of medical services provided, medical
equipment operation and capability of emergency medical aid.

Development and implementation of all possible options of uninterrupted and reliable power and heat
supply to the rural health clinics, including integration of modern energy efficient and renewable
energy systems (e.g. use of solar energy for electricity generating and water heating needs) into
existing conventional energy infrastructure, provides the potential for more efficient and effective use
of the medical equipment and more comfort conditions for physicians operation and patients
treatment.

However, rural health clinics in Uzbekistan have some peculiarities. They are rather well equipped
with various medical equipment such as emergency aid, laboratory equipment for medical tests,
sterilizers, dental and physiotherapy equipment etc, which consume quite significant amount of
energy. The average electric power required for this equipment operation is varying in the range from
7 kW to 13 kW, and average thermal power is in the range of 16 kW to 50 kW. Moreover, rural health
clinics differ in premises size and facility design as some are located in the buildings built specifically
for medical purposes, others in premises adapted for medical needs. They also range in scale (large
regional health clinics and small rural posts). Rural health clinics are located in various climatic zones

78

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

such as mountain areas, deserts, and valleys. They also differ in the water, power and heat supply
infrastructure; most of RHCs are connected to the grid but heating is provided by boilers firing the
natural gas coming from gas pipelines.

Within the framework of the UNDP’s “Feasibility Study on Improving of Power and Heat Supply
Reliability in Health Rural Clinics of Uzbekistan” Project, technical and economic assessment of
options on equipping the RHCs with Energy Efficient and Renewable Energy systems, notably the
plants that transfer solar energy to electric and thermal power that can be integrated into existing
conventional energy infrastructure to improve reliability of power and heat supply will be
implemented.

When developing the options for reliable power and heat supply it will be taken in to consideration
that RHCs are equipped with a quite big number of medical equipment that requires substantial
amount of electric power. It is also necessary to have enough power for lighting, communication, and
in many cases for reliable cold water supply. Therefore, a combination of conventional and EE and
RE systems has to be considered. Thus, photovoltaic (PV) systems may be used for off-grid power
supply for lighting and emergency equipment operation in case of power failure. Solar collectors can
be used for autonomous hot water supply as well as for pre-heating of water for space heating needs
in winter season to reduce natural gas consumption. Moreover, some local and foreign manufactures
of PV and solar water heating systems licensed and certified according to national standards are
available in Uzbekistan. These companies are able to meet the future demand in such equipment, and
provide full cycle services such as installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance, and after-
sale service. The options to be proposed have to be adjusted to the relevant budget resources available
in rural health clinics. They have to ensure efficient use and saving of energy and fuel.

B. Overall Description of the Task:

The task of the International Consultant will be to ensure that essential steps in the process of
implementation of technical and economic parts of the Feasibility Study are undertaken, including

1.2. GENERAL, AND ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION DESCRIPTION OF RHCs

1.2.1. Rooms Priority.

Priority Rooms can be classified as rooms used in technologies of medical-diagnostic processes
(except dental room), as well as RHC reception and chief physician rooms. During the survey
RHC staff recommended the laboratories, room for patients' examination, procedure unit and
physiotherapeutic room are to be classified as the rooms of major importance.

The following rooms are nor classified as prioritized: sterilization room, storeroom, some of the
rooms not directly involved in the technology of providing medical aid (for instance: head nurse
room), dining room, kitchen, and other similar room.

1.2.2. All engineering-construction characteristics of the five surveyed RHCs are summarized in
the Table 2.1 below.

Comments:
1. In Jahonabad RHC, apart from RHC rooms, 6 hospital wards and maternity ward are included
2. In Jahonabad RHC, apart from RHC rooms, 6 hospital wards and maternity ward are classified as priority rooms.
3. Increased number of priority rooms (and area) in Pakhtakor RHC is explained by the size of day care hospital which occupies two rooms, while physiotherapeutic room occupies four rooms.

98

1.3. EQUIPMENT AND LIGHTING POWER CONSUMPTION.

1.3.1. The data on design capacity and design values on power consumption for all and priority
equipment of the surveyed five RHCs are set out in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. The equipment currently
being used in the surveyed RHCs as well as the equipment to be procured for the individual RHCs
under the National Program Health-2 are also presented in the same tables.

1.3.2. Priority equipment can be divided into two groups:

1. Prioritized therapeutic-diagnostic equipment can be classified as equipment which is directly used
during treatment, medical aiding, and diagnostics.

2. Prioritized ancillary equipment can be classified as equipment which is used for disinfection of
premises, medical lighters, and refrigerators for storing vaccines, serums, medicaments, etc.

3. Dental equipment, equipment for sterilization of instruments, solutions, etc., are not considered as
Prioritized equipment due to its high power consumption, and possibility of creating a reserve of
sterile instruments during availability of power supply for the times when failure of power supply
happens.

4. Design capacity of the equipment was determined based on either the equipment passport or
equipment label. Hours of service identified based on the data presented by the management of the
RHCs.

1.3.3. Table 3.3 presents data on design capacity and design values of power consumption for lighting
all RHC premises and the prioritized rooms, where all the installed equipment shall be operational
during any power cuts of main sources of power supply.

All of the surveyed RHCs have lobbies and corridors of rather large size and without almost any
natural lighting. Therefore minimal lighting of these premises is also obligatory at least by reason of
movement safety. Based on this we need to take into account lighting of lobbies, corridors and stairs
while preparing calculations for design of power consumption.

Existing system of lighting of these premises under using reserve power supply is obviously
redundant, and therefore inappropriate. Thus, for instance, there are 10 incandescent electric lamps in
the lobby of A.Umarov RHC, while 19 incandescent electric lamps and 8 luminescent lamps in the
lobby of N. Baymuhamedov RHC.

We also need to note that in winter time when daylight hours are minimal, the action period of the
lamps should be not less than 4 hours a day.

1.3.4. From viewpoint of possible use of PV-systems for designing a system of reserve power supply,
the most important aspect is power consumption in autumn-winter period, due to the following
aspects of this period:

a/ high likelihood of power cuts due to its shortage and more higher likelihood of breakages (see
Chapter 4 of the current Report for detailed information);

b/ higher level of energy consumption due to higher common sickness rate (and consequently,
increased number of visits to RHC) and higher level of power consumption of lighting;

c/ the lowest efficiency of PV-systems, due to decreased solar illumination and increased number of
overcast days (see Chapter 5 of the present Report.)

Based on the abovementioned, maximal values (named by RHC staff) of working periods for
equipment and lighting were used in calculations of power consumption.

Clarification to Table 3.4:

2. * - calculations for power consumption by the equipment to be procured for RHCs under National Program Health-2.

103

1.3.6. Summary Data On RHCs Power Consumption:

1.3.6.1. The power capacity of the installed therapeutic – diagnostic equipment and support
equipment (see row 1) in all of the RHCs is almost at the same level with difference of about 10%
(taking into account future equipping of A. Umarov and N. Baymuhannedov RHCs under the
Program Health-2).

1.3.6.2. The difference in installed power for lighting (see the raw 4) is significant (almost three
times) and linked with:

a/ different types and powers of lamps, that are installed in RHCs.,

b/ difference in RHCs sizes and the areas to be lightened (see the Table 2.1.).

1.3.6.3. According to the total designed power consumption (see the raw 5) four of the RHCs (except
Jusi Bog) are at the same level: with the equipment to be supplied to A. Umarov and N.
Baymuhannedov RHCs under the Program Health-2, the difference will not exceed ± 10%.

Two times less power consumption of Juzim Bog RHC can be explained by the absence of power-
consuming and support equipment, which exists (or will be supplied to) in other RHCs.

1.3.6.4. Minimal proportion of power consumption for lighting (see the raw 8) is in Pakhtakor RHC -
35%, while maximal is in Jahonobod RHC – 65%.

In other RHCs this indicator varies between 40% - 50%.

Share of power inputs for lighting (see the raw 12) in common prioritized power inputs (see the raw
8) is rather big and varies between 59%-72%.

Thus, it can be noted, that the share of power inputs for lighting is large in all of the considered RHC,
and that in all of the RHCs the system of electric lighting is not optimal and shall be optimized.
Without the optimization construction of any type of the economical power backup system becomes
problematic.

1.3.6.5. According to the data presented by the RHCs actual averaged daily power consumption (see
the raw 13) is 2-4 times less than design value of power consumption (see the raw 5) в 2 – 4 раза.

This situation can be explained by the following reasons:

a/ averaged daily power consumption data presented by RHCs covers spring-summer time, when less
power is consumed for lighting compared with winter time. At the same time it is obvious, that our
calculations were prepared for the “worst-case” period which is autumn-winter time. According to our
estimations this factor may result in difference of 20-30% between actual and design values;

b/ during calculations of power consumption the periods of blackout were not taken into account,
which reduces actual power consumption by not more than 25% according to RHCs staff as well as
our estimates.

c/ RHCs staff submitted overrated values on periods of work of equipment and lighting – in practice
actual time significantly less than the data used in RHC calculations.

Unfortunately, the RHCs didn’t present any documentary data to support values on actual hours of
service of equipment.

It should be noted, that unreliable and unclear data on actual hours of service of the equipment will
significantly complicate further work on selecting optimal options for power backup of RHCs.

1.4. CHARACTERISTICS OF RHC POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM AND ITS’ RELIABILITY

1.4.1. Power supply system of all of the surveyed RHCs is provided through transmission lines of
District Power Supply System (DPSS). Straight questions to RHC managers on restrictions on power
consumption were answered negatively - non of the surveyed RHC has problems with power
consumption restrictions for installed equipment neither for lighting.

1.4.2. In accordance with the data received from managers of RHCs, reliability of power supply in
other RHCs is rather low, particularly in winter time. Credible and official reasons for this factor is
not known – this data is available only for power generating, transporting and marketing
organizations. We may only make the following assumptions:

104

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

- general deficit of power in the region in winter time – from November till March inclusive (as it was
stated above in section 3.4.),

- breakages at transmission lines and substations.

1.4.3. Unfortunately, no records available to support the data about the length of power cuts, its’
seasonality, frequency, etc. Therefore the information about reliability of power supply is rather
subjective.

1.4.4. Below are the answers to the asked questions on reliability of power supply systems, received
from oral answers of RHCs staff, as well as in written from RHCs managers.

1.4.6 Conclusions:

1.4.6.1. The problems with periodic power cuts exist in all of the surveyed RHCs (see the raw 10).
The most unfavorable from this point of view period continues from November till March for the
RHCs located in Tashkent Region; for Pakhtakor RHC this period covers continues from September
till April, while for Juzim-Bog RHC this period covers continues from November till May (see the
raw 1).

1.4.6.2. Four out of five RHCs have no problems with the quality of the supplied power. The
exception is N.Byamuhammedov RHC, which faces this type of problems (see the raw 11).

1.4.6.3. In all of the RHCs power supply may be switched off during both day and night times (see
raw 8).

1.4.6.4. The most lengthy occasional power supply shut-down period was observed in A. Umarov
RHC – 7 days. In two other RHCs located in Tashkent Region (Jahonobod and N. Baymuhammedov)
such shut-downs had durations of 24 and 48 hours respectively (see the raw 1). In RHCs located in
Aral region such occasional shut-downs had not been observed.

1.4.6.5. In A. Umarov RHC the maximal length of “once a month shut-down” is 48 hours. In two
other RHCs (Pakhtakor and N. Baymuhammedov) periods of such shut-downs was 24 and 36 hours
respectively (see the raw 4).

1.4.6.6. In A. Umarov RHC the maximal duration of frequent shut-downs so-called “2-3 times a
week” was 24 hours. For the rest of the RHCs such frequent shut-downs had duration of 6-12 hours
(see the raw 6).

1.4.6.7. Minimal interval of 5 hours between two consecutive blackouts was observed in Jahonabod
RHC. Typical values for this period vary between 12-24 hours, while maximal values of 48-72 hours
in N. Baymuhammedov and Juzi Bog RHCs (see the raw 9).

1.4.6.8. The most unfavorable conditions during a month without power supply can be observed in A.
Umarov abd N. Baymuhammedov RHCs – the periods reach 20 days and 14 days respectively (taking
into account complaints of N. Baymuhammedov RHC on power quality). For the rest of the RHCs
these periods averaged 10±1.5 days taking into account night time blackouts and 2.5 - 5 days without
night-time blackouts.

Feasibility Study Report

Analyzing the data presented in Tables 5.1-5.10 the following conclusions on similarities and
dissimilarities of the areas where the surveyed RHCs are located from applicability of PV-systems as
standby power supply:

1. Maximal wind speed in all of the surveyed regions is practically the same and varies between 19-23
m/sec. The most unfavorable from installation of PV-systems point of view wind directions (south,
north, north-west) can be observed in the following three out of five surveyed RHCs: Jahonabad,
Pakhtakor, and Juzim Bog (see Tables 5.1.-5.4.).

2.The note on the duration of sunny periods in the area of Jahonabod RHC: the data of Chimgan
weather station (see the Table 5.6.) most likely does not adequately reflect the situation in Jahonabod
RHC. This seems to happened because of the readings of Chimgan weather station were taken in
unshaded area, while Jahonabod RHC is located in shaded area (see the Table 2.1.). Therefore factual
data on duration of sunny periods in this RHC is 20% less than shown in the Tables 5.6.

3. Irradiance by solar radiation (see the Tables 5.9 – 5.10) for all of the regions is almost the same for
all of the regions, and the variations does not exceed 10%. However these 10%, apparently represent
the values of systemic difference of the considered parameter – irradiance is the maximal in the areas
located close to Aral Sea.

It also should be mentioned that irradiance does not fully depends on season - the difference between
maximal and minimal values S does not exceed 10% of this indicator.

1.6. PROPOSALS ON OPTIMIZATION OF POWER CONSUMPTION AT RHC

1.6.1. Optimization of power consumption is one of the key issues for elaboration of FS for
establishment of standby system of power supply for RHC. This is mainly related to the fact that the
designed electric power consumption even for priority equipment and lighting in priority premises are
quite high.

Simple analysis of power inputs of RHC shows that in all surveyed RHCs there are ways and
approaches for their reduction. Review of these approaches and adequate recommendations for their
optimization and reduction – this is a direct way to reduce the cost of any standby system of power
supply.

1.6.2. There are two most simple and widespread approaches to reduce electric power consumption:

- 1-approach lies in reduction of equipment’s hours of service, reduction of general lighting system
and shift (at least partial) to local lighting system (table lamps and luminaries);

- 2-approach lies in replacement of existing equipment with increased power consumption on the
similar equipment, but with less power inputs.

1.6.2.1. Methods and ways for implementation of the first approach – this is most probably
prerogative of RHC employees and they can be covered in this report only in the form of most general
recommendations.

Methods and ways for implementation of the second approach in less extent depend on RHC
employees and mainly related to availability or lack of funds for procurement of new equipment.

To this end, we would only point out that all equipment (both medical and diagnostic, and auxiliary),
used in surveyed RHC, can be divided into two groups:

a/ 1-group – these are all physiotherapy and stomatological equipment, as well as some items of
auxiliary equipment (refrigerators of Soviet manufacture, old medical lighters, etc.), which had been
manufactured in nineties of the 20th century. Obviously, this equipment, used for more than 15 years,
could scarcely be considered as power-saving. Requirements to supply voltage is usual – 220V±10%

Amongst the equipment of this group, there is highly power-consuming equipment (see Table 3.1. and
3.2.), with high installed capacity (~ 500 W) and manufactured by rule-of-thumb methods (for
example, light bath at both Jakhonabod and Pakhtakor RHCs). Of course, the issue of appropriateness
of further operation of such equipment should be resolved by physicians themselves- only they can
impartially and comprehensively decide whether to operate this equipment or not.

b/ 2-group – these are diagnostic and auxiliary equipment received on National Programme Health-1.
Equipment of this group is manufactured and commissioned in the beginning of the 21st century (not

110

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

earlier than 2003) and, most probably belongs to the power-saving category. In fact, this group of
equipment could raise some question regarding practicability of RHC equipping with refrigerators of
large useful capacity, which causes high consumption (despite their efficiency) of electric power.
Requirements to supply voltage are also standard.

1.6.2.2. Situation with refrigerators in surveyed RHC is shown in Table 6.1.

It appears from Table that electric power consumed by refrigerators is rather high, especially at those
RHC, where three refrigerators are operated (see also Table 3.2. and 3.4.).

Share of electric power consumed only by refrigerators for drugs’ storage, in electric power consumed
by the most important auxiliary equipment, varies from 40 to 65% for various RHC (even after RHC
re-equipment with specialized refrigerators).

At the same time, there are both specialized (medical), and domestic refrigerators which consume two
times less electric power than refrigerators listed in Table 6.1. Including:

- specialized (medical) refrigerators of KYOCERA (presumably, US) designed for payload volume 39
l and at ambient temperature 32°С consume 280W*hour/day (without production of ice) and 470
W*hour/day with production of ice;

- domestic refrigerators, type Saratov 452KSh120 designed for payload 100 l and consume 630
W*hour/day.

It is easily seen that use of above specialized refrigerator would allow to reduce power inputs of
priority auxiliary equipment for 500 – 700 W*hour/day and on that basis either to reduce the capacity
of standby power supply (and, therefore, its cost), or additionally include to the list of priority
equipment, for example, cabinet for sterilizing oven.

Decision on implementation or non-implementation of above recommendations should be made by
physicians – specialists in the field of medical care technologies.

1.6.2.3. Efficient electric lighting system is one of the most important issues for elaboration of
efficient standby power supply.

This problem could be resolved by various approaches. However, the most radical one is to use so
called power-saving fluorescent lamps (PSL).

These lamps are characterized with two features:

- they possess all lighting technology characteristics of lamps normally applied for lighting (for
example, filament lamps, or tube fluorescent lamps), but consume substantively less (up to five times)
electric power,

- their nominal operating duration stated in specifications is 8000 – 10000 hour.

For comparison, filament lamps (FL) have a stated nominal operating duration of 1000 hour, and tube
fluorescent lamps (TFL) - 8000 – 10000 hour.

Naturally, an issue of application of these lamps should primarily be determined by reasons of
economy, since their current cost in Uzbekistan for 10 – 40 times higher the cost of filament lamps
and for 2 – 8 times higher the cost of TFL. Such a huge spreading of their cost relates to the fact that
in the Uzbekistan market PSL is sold by three groups of suppliers:

- Chinese PSL, the cheapest (1.8 – 2.5 $ depending on capacity), and at the same time most
unreliable. Their realistic average lifetime does not exceed 2 – 3 thousand hour. Moreover, in most
cases, their starting controllers do not comply with security requirements of IEC 928:1995, IDT,

- Local PSL (JSC FOTON) costs 4.0 – 4.5$, their average lifetime is 4.5 - 5 thousand hour, and they
fully comply with security standards of IEC 928:1995, IDT,

- European PSL (Philips, Osram, GE, and Siemens) in the Uzbekistan market costs 8 – 9$, their
average lifetime is 7 – 9 thousand hour, and they fully comply with security standards of IEC
928:1995, IDT.

To have a clear picture, note that cost of FL in the Uzbekistan’s market is 0.24 – 0.28$, and TFL – 1.0
– 1.2$.

1.6.2.4. All above data, plus information on current cost of one kW*hour electric power in
Uzbekistan, as well as average, minimum (Greece) and maximum (Denmark) costs of one kW*hour
of electric power in Europe, are summarized in Table 6.2.

2. ** - component cost indicated at lower level.

3. *** - actual hours of service differs from operating time stated in specifications because all
manufacturers declare continuous operating time. At the same time, all manufacturers world-wide
show in specifications that lamps resources might be decreased by more than two times in large
quantities of on-off cycles.

4. **** - number before “/” is taken from specifications, number after “/” – actual value.

Based on data described in Table 6.2, it would be possible quite to easily assess conditions, at which
the replacement of filament lamps and tube fluorescent lamps could become economically sound and
rational.

1.6.2.5. Operational costs for light (E) mainly comprise two parts – cost of lamps (Cl) and electric
power costs (Epc):

E = Cl + Epc

During the assessment period Т cost of lamps (Cl) would equal to:

Cl = Lp*(Т/tф+1), where

- Lp – lamps’ price in Column 2, Table 6.2.;

- tф – actual hours of service lamps in column 3 table 6.2.

During the period Т electric power costs (Epc) would equal to:

Epc = Poe*P*Т/1000, where

- Poe – price for one kW*hour electric power in Column 2, Table 6.2.

- P – capacity of lamps in Column 1, Table 6.2.

Apparently replacement of conventional lighting resources (filament lamps and tube fluorescent
lamps) with PSL would be economically sound and rational, should as a result of such replacement
the following conditions is observed:

Ecr ≥ Epsl , where

- Ecr – operational costs for light when conventional lighting resources are used;

- Epsl - operational costs for light when PSL is used.

1.6.2.6. Outcomes of calculations of Ecr, Epsl and E for different conditions are listed in Table 6.2,
and values Т=3000hour and tф fl= 300 hour, tф tfl = 3000 hour tф psl Uzbekistan= 3000 hour tф psl Eur= 5000
hour are listed in Table 6.3.

It should be noted that in Table 6.3, outcomes of calculations for Chinese PSL are not listed, since
they do not comply with the international security requirements (see column 4 Table 6.2.).

1.6.2.7. Outcomes of calculations quoted in Table 6.3 explicitly show that even in condition of low
prices for electric power in Uzbekistan (in comparison with prices in Europe), transfer from

114

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

conventional lighting resources (FL and TFL) to PSL manufactured in Uzbekistan would not yield a
loss (see rows 1 – 4 in column 4 Table 6.3.).

Taking into consideration that the costs of electric power in Uzbekistan would rise and V medium-
term outlook inevitably reach at least minimum level in Europe, transfer of lighting system to the
modern PSL is not only desirable, but also urgent and imperative: that transfer economically sound,
even though European PSL are used (see rows 5 – 8 in Column 4, Table 6.3).

1.6.2.8. Based on outcomes described in the previous paragraph, the National Specialist in PV-
systems strongly recommends to transfer the lighting system in all RHCs (at least in surveyed ones) to
the modern PSL.

At that, question arises on costs for alteration of internal wiring and its adjustment for application of
PSL that quite naturally for RHC, which currently use tube fluorescent lamps (Umarov,
Boimukhamedov and Pakhtakor RHCs.). This problem, however, could be fully avoided if overhead
illumination is replaced with wall illumination (with the help of wall lamp-brackets and wall sockets
that exist in each room – see Table 2.1.).

1.6.2.9. Recommendations on organization of lighting in priority rooms of RHC with the help of
modern power-saving fluorescent lamps of 20 W are presented In Table 6.4.

1.6.2.10. Concluding the section on recommendation for power consumption at RHC, it should be
noted that, in opinion of the National Specialist in PV-systems, there are some reserves with regard to
optimization of power inputs for light. Those reserves mainly lie in the plane of optimization of
functioning time for some rooms (and, hence functioning time of lighting in them), reduction of
capacity of applied PSL, as well as wider use of local lighting. Implementation of these facilities
would allow reducing power inputs for light for some 20 – 30%.

1.6.3. In Table 6.5 data on daily power consumption by priority equipment and lighting of priority
premises at RHC (V kW*hour/day) are present
implementation of
recommendations on optimization of their power consumption.

equipment in accordance with the National Programme Health-2.

2. (**) Night electric power consumption is calculated subject to operation at night:

- Umarov, Boimukhamedov, Pakhtakor and Juzi-bog RHCs - refrigerator for drugs storage and tell-
tale light in the form of one PSL 20W within 12 hour;

- Jakhonabod RHC - refrigerator for drugs storage and lighting:

-- round-the-clock wards 6 PSL 20 W within 2 hour,

-- labor ward 3 PSL 20 W within 4 hour,

-- corridor (tell-tale light) 1 PSL 20 W within 12 hour.

3. (***) Number of days without electric power in spring.

1.6.3.1. From Table 6.4 it is seen that the spreading of size of electric power shortage related to its
blackout is relatively high and comprises 17.5 kWh to 62 kWh on maximum value and 15.5 kWh to
49 kWh on average value.

At that, if extreme shortage of electric power is discarded apparently caused by accidents in power
transmission
lines (for example, one-time deficiency of electric power at Umarov and
Boimukhamedov RHC within 7 days and 4 days respectively), then the most typical value of electric
power shortage is ~ 40±5 kWh.

Indeed, this value seemingly should be considered as source information for selection of optimum
approach for arrangement of standby power supply in the surveyed RHC.

117

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

1.6.4. As it is seen from above, arrangement of standby power supply designed for monthly shortage
of electric power ~ 40 kWh would allow in surveyed RHC to carry out nearly all assignments in full
scope.

However, this value of shortage might be unacceptable owing to financial or any other reasons.

Based on that, we shall consider alternative variant that is less power-consuming. This variant is
based on proposals from the leadership of Umarov and Boimukhamedov RHCs. Essence of proposals
comprise of:

- only electrocardiograph and equipment for analysis should be referred as important medical and
diagnostic equipment;

- only refrigerator for drugs’ storage, medical lighters and equipment for disinfection of premises
should be referred as important auxiliary equipment;

- only laboratory, inspection, procedures and physiotherapy rooms should be referred as important
rooms.

Functioning of exactly these rooms defines ability of RHC to conduct, if not all but at any case, main
and constitutive functioning.

For the sake of objectivity, it should be noted that no one has ever offered such radical proposals so
far. However, we will review above variant and give a status of alternative variant.

1.6.5. Outcomes of calculations for daily electric power consumption and its monthly shortage (kWh)
in alternative variant, which has been mentioned in Clause 6.4 are shown in Table

1.6.6. At that, during these calculations the following were considered:

- power consumption (apart from equipment and lighting, which has been mentioned in Clause 6.4.)
lighting in entrance halls, corridors and stairs, as well as lighting in wards of hospital and labour ward
at Jakhonabod RHC,

- application of modern power-saving lamps for lighting,

- night consumption as described in Clause 2 Clarifications to Table 6.5.,

- equipping of Umarov and Boimukhamedov RHCs as per National Programme Health-2.

Clarification to Table 6.6: *** - Number of days without electric power in spring

It is seen from Table 6.6 that the spreading of size of electric power shortage related to its blackout, in
case of using of alternative variant, is 16.0 kWh to 44 kWh on maximum value, and 14.5 kWh to 38.5
kWh on average value.

118

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

At that, if extreme shortage of electric power (see Clause 6.3.1.) is discarded, then the most typical
value of electric power shortage is ~ 25±5 kWh.

Apparently, very value should be considered as source information for selection of optimum approach
for arrangement of standby power supply as alternative variant.

By comparison of monthly shortage value stated in Clause 6.3.1 (40±5 kWh) with the value given in
this paragraph (25±5 kWh), we can see that alternative variant allows to reduce power characteristics
of RHC standby supply by at least 1.5 times

PART 2. OF THE REPORT OF THE NATIONAL SPECIALIST ON PV SYSTEMS:

2.1. DOWNTIME AND DEFICIT OF ELECTRIC POWER

2.1.1. The following assumptions were made when calculating RHC equipment downtime during the
most unfavorable autumn-winter period:

- duration of one-time daily equipment downtime (Тi) is equal to the period of time during workday
without electric power (from Table 4.1), while total period of monthly downtime Тм is equal to the
sum of periods of one-time downtimes during a month;

- duration of a workday (Тдр) assumed as 12 hours, while total number of work hours in a month –
under 6 workdays a week – is taken as 72 hours.

As for blackouts during spring-summer season, according to both written and oral data received from
RHCs management “there are blackouts during this period, though too rare”. Based on these
statements during calculations of monthly downtime it was assumed that during spring-summer
period total duration of monthly downtime is not more than 25% of downtime during autumn-winter
period.

The only exception was observed in Juzim Bog RHC, which reported about more intensive spring
blackouts compared with winter ones.

Table 1.1 presents data on actual downtime during autumn-winter time and average annual forecasted
downtime for five of the surveyed RHCs (without power cuts caused by breakdowns, which happened
once a season).

2.1.2. If the duration of blackout is equal to the duration of workday, and/or if equipment is meant to
be working uninterruptedly, then it is simple to identify the equipment downtime.

If this is not the case, then it is more complicated to identify the duration of downtime. For instance, if
the duration of downtime was 3 hours during a workday, then does this mean that the equipment
downtime would be also 3 hours? Apparently it is not always true as the equipment which is
operational only one hour a day can be used during the same day when blackout is finished. In this
case there will be no equipment downtime neither electric power deficit.

3. *** - Maximal daily downtime duration caused by one-time (once a month) power cut;

4. **** - Downtime duration during autumn-winter period;

5. ***** - Downtime duration during summer period.

1.3. The problem of identification of downtime duration shall be a subject for discussion between
technicians and medical service providers.

Under such unclear conditions of identification, there are two options for calculation of power deficit:

The first option suggests to calculate total daily power consumption and power cuts during a month in
days accordingly. Product of one volume and the other one would give monthly deficit of electric
power caused by power cuts.

The second option requires differentiation of night time and day time power consumption during a
month, as well as calculation per hour power consumption separately for day and night times. The
sum of products (night time blackouts by per hour night time consumption and duration of day time
blackouts by per hour daily consumption) shall give monthly deficit of electric power caused by
power cuts.

As the way of calculation of power deficit is described in the 1st Report, this report presents power
deficit calculation in accordance with the second option:

1.4. After comparing results of calculation presented in Table 1.2. with the results of calculation
presented in Tables 6.5 and 6.6 of the 1st Report , we may conclude that the second option gives
bigger volume of power deficit compared with the volumes obtained in accordance with the first
option:

- by 25 – 30% for the main power consumption option,

- by 15 – 20 % for the alternative power consumption option.

120

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

Such differences can be explained by different power consumption characteristics of equipment and
different time structure of cutouts.

In the following calculations we will use the results obtained by application of the second option of
power deficit calculation.

2.2. PV-SYSTEM PARAMETERS CALCULATION

2.2.1. The methodology of calculation of PV-system parameters is based on the balance between
power consumption and amount of power which can be generated by PV-panel during some specified
period of time. This period is called base period and can be equal either a day, or week, or decade, or
month, etc. A calendar month is taken is a base period in this report.

The following data are considered to be input data for this process: energy received from PV-system
(NLo) and solar radiation parameter (S); output data would be generating capacity of the PV panel
(Ppv) and storage battery capacity (СBat), which is used as buffer between PV-panel and power
consumers.

The following shall be used to ensure accuracy of the calculations:

- maximum allowed depth of discharge of storage battery (Z). For modern batteries this figure should
not exceed 0.3, since under Z>0.3 their durability significantly reduced;

- losses in charge circuit of accumulators (or controller performance coefficient), as well as losses in a
cycle of accumulators charge-discharge (K Bat),

- temperature coefficient of accumulator capacity (KT Bat),

- losses in circuits of power consumers (KLo),

- voltage (DC) on system output, and invertor’s input (UDC),

- temperature coefficient of PV-panel power (KT PV),

- type of voltage-current characteristics of PV-panel.

2.2.2. This report used a model when daily electrical power demand varied during base period from 0
(when power was supplied) to maximal values (during day time power cut periods).

At the same time, the periods with maximal values of consumed energy from PV-system were
“synchronized” with the lowest solar radiation (i.e. periods of overcast sky). It is obvious, that such
approach in developing model for calculation parameters of PV-system determines the worst
conditions from power generation point of view, and imposes higher demands to PV-system and
accumulators. It also requires knowledge of actual changes of daily solar radiation values during base
period.

2.2.3. Within the framework of the model described in section 2.2., the generating capacity of PV-
panel (Ppv) and storage battery capacity (СBat ) were calculated by the following formulas:

Ppv = 1000*b* NLo .m/ a*Sm(1-KLo)*(1-KBat), where

Sm –total value od solar radiation for the base period (1 month),

NLo .m – total power capacity for the base period (1 month) consumed from PV-system ( Values for NLo
.m indicated in 7th row of Table 1.2.)

b = Uz/UDC, where Uz – voltage needed for charging accumulator (for the system with voltage of UDC
=12 V, Uz ≈ 15 V),

a = Pz/Ppv, where Pz – power generated by PV-panel under voltage of Uz. Usually, this value for the
most types of panels is equal to 0.9. This figure gets closer to 1 as Uz and UDC values increase–This is
one of the reasons for using so-called high-voltage PV-systems.

KBat,- (see 2.1) ≈ 0.2

KLo ,- (see 2.1) ≈ 0.15.

СBat = MAX{ KT Bat/[Z*(1-KLo)* UDC]}*[ ΣNLo .i – (NLo .m*ΣSi)/Sm), where

121

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

KT Bat – temperature coefficient of accumulator capacity. Value of KT Bat depends on the type of the
used accumulator battery (for the temperature of 20º С KT Bat ≈ 1.1),

NLo .i – daily power consumed from the system (precise values of NLo I are shown in the Table 1.2.)

Si – daily solar radiation

In the last formula the summation is made for all of the days of the base period (1 month).

2.2.4. Both of the formulas use the value of daily solar radiation S – solar energy received by the
surface of the PV-panel during daylight hours.

Under current report values of S were calculated on the basis of input data presented by Uzbek
Glavgidromet.

The following defections were used:

- “clear day– a day when sunshine duration (Тя) not less than 80% of duration of astronomical
daytime. (Та);

- “overcast day ”– a day when sunshine duration (Тп) not more than 20% of duration of astronomical
daytime (Та);

- “cloudy day with the average cloudy conditions”– a day, a day when sunshine duration (То) not less
than 20% and not more than 80% of duration of astronomical daytime (Та).

Based on these, the following assumptions over durations of sunshine were made:

- for clear day - Тя= 0.9*Та,

- for cloudy day with the average cloudy conditions - То = 0.5*Та,

- for overcast day -Тп=0.1*Та.

Shadowing with the duration of 25% of the astronomical daytime of the potential area where the PV-
system would be installed was taken into account for the area of Jahonobod RHC location.

When calculating solar radiation during cloudy days (with average cloudy conditions) a radiation
weakened by clouds also was taken into account. Sky radiation was not taken into account in
calculations.

Table 2.1. presents values of S for clear, cloudy and overcast days of December and January in the
areas of all of the surveyed RHCs. It also sets out data on number of clear, cloudy and overcast days,
as well as total values of solar radiation (Sm ) and average data for December and January. For area of
Juzim Bog RHC the above-mentioned data also presented for April.

Feasibility Study Report

2.2.6. Based on the input data shown in sections 2.2.3. and 2.2.4., and on the formulas from section
2.2.3. Ppv values were calculated (generating capacity of PV-panel) and СBat (capacity of storage
accumulator) needed for covering electric power deficit caused by blackouts.

All of the coefficient values included in calculation formulas are shown in section 2.2.2. (for Z) and
section. 2.2.3. (for the rest of coefficients).

To simplify the process, the calculation were made assuming UDC =12 V. Obviously, it is necessary to
take into account advisability of increasing the voltage up to the maximum extent (~ 300V) with the
aim of increasing value of а up to 1 (see section 2.2.3.) and increasing inverter performance
coefficient (decreasing KLo coefficient).

The calculations were made for two ways of RHC power supply: main and alternative.

surface is fully covered by snow) accumulator capacity of 3,000А*h enables to supply power during 2
days to Jahonabod RHC, which has maximal power consumption of 6 kWh/day. During these 2 days
acceptable 30% of the accumulator capacity would be used.

2.3. PV-SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS

2.3.1. This supplement shall be considered as general recommendation on PV-system kitting rather
than instructions to follow.

2.3.2. Selection of types of PV-systems, accumulators, controllers and invertors shall be proceeded
with the selection of working voltage of the PV-system ( UDC in the para 2.1. of the Report 2). From
energy point of view bigger values of UDC are more profitable as losses in both inverter and line
connecting PV-panel with the controller decrease with increasing of the voltage. Therefore, for the
designed PV-systems UDC voltage is selected at the level of 48 volt. This voltage is the most typical
for PV-systems with the installed power capacity between 1 and 3 kilowatt.

2.3.2.1. TSM type of modules manufactured by Telecom-STW (Russia) company is taken as base
type of PV-models. This type of modules has the following advantages:

- relatively low cost of one watt of installed capacity - $ 5.3 including transport and tax expenses.
Price of the selected type of modules is within the range of permitted price intervals – see the Table
3.1. of the report 2.

- availability of wide range of modules in terms of capacity and its’ modifications for the working
voltage of 24 volt. This makes adjustment of PV panel for working voltage of 48 volt more simple
and convenient.

- anti-vandal design of modules .

PV-modules were designed for the working voltage of 24 V, while working voltage for PV-panel is

parameters of PV-panels, as well as corresponding costs.

2.3.2.2. Sealed accumulators, which do not require maintenance, shall be used for PV-systems.

Since such accumulators are not manufactured in Uzbekistan, and transportation and customs
expenditures are considered to be rather high, it was decided to make selection from internal market.

Main characteristics of sealed accumulators, which do not require maintenance, offered by
AQUALIGHT CORPORATION Company (Tashkent city) are presented below:

It can be seen from the table that the price of one A*h accumulator offered in internal market varies
between $ 1.2-1.4, which is 20% below of price level of foreign manufacturers (See Table 3.1. of
Report No 2)

Using data from Table 1.3 and data on accumulator capacity from Table 2.2. of Report No. 2 a type
and number of accumulators as well as its price can be identified. The accumulators generate voltage
of 12 volts, while working voltage for PV-panel is 48 volt. Therefore the number of accumulators
shall be multiplied by 4.

Selection of accumulators was made having in mind minimization of its’ price

2.3.2.3. Type of controller shall be calculated for maximal possible charging current of accumulator
which can be provided by PV-panel.

Taking into account volt-ampere characteristics of PV-module, it can be calculated that accumulator
charging current shall be 10-15% higher than the current under maximal power. Current values under
maximal power, measured under irradiance of PV-module of 1,000 Wt/cm2 and АМ=1.5 are shown in
column 5 of the Table 1.1. Since maximal illumination 10-20% below than 1,000 W/cm2 (see Tables
5.9. and 5.10. of Report No. 1), it can be said that maximal charging current generated by one module
shown in column 5 of the Table 1.1.

2.3.2.3.1. Based on the abovementioned and data from Table 1.2. maximal value of charging current
generated by PV-panel can be calculated. The results of these calculations, as well as corresponding
requirements to maximal values of controller’s current of are shown below:

1. * - Rounded maximal charging current values.
2. ** - Maximal values of controllers’ current for improving reliability of its’ work are overrated by ~
15 - 25%.

2.3.2.3.2. The main difficulty in selecting controller with the required parameters is linked with the
selected working voltage of 48 volt. Most of the controllers designed for the voltage of 12 or 24 volt.

There are two types of controllers available designed for working voltage of 48 volt:

a) C40 type of controller, produced by company XANTREX. It is designed for voltage range of 12-48
volt and for limiting current of 40 A. It can be seen form the Table 1.5 that this type of controller can
be used in PV-systems of all RHCs except Jahonobod RHC. C40 type of controller costs $195
without transportation and customs costs.

b) SPV-PWM-II/10A, SPV-PWM-II/20A, SPV-PWM-II/30A, SPV-PWM-II/40A и SPV-PWM-
II/50A types of controllers, designed for the work of PV-systems with the working voltage of 48 volt
with limiting current range of 10-50A. These controllers are being produced by SHENZHEN
WANFUJING (China) and can be used in all of the RHC.

Costs of controller for limiting current:

- 30А - $ 250,

- 40А - $ 290,

- 50А - $ 350.

The abovementioned prices include transportation and customs expenditures for procurement of one-

off products. Under bulk purchasing the prices can be reduced by 25 – 30%.

2.3.2.4. The following criteria used in selection of inverters:

- possibility to work under input voltage of 48 volt

- output power exceed total power of simultaneously working consumers

- possibility of short-time overload on output power (to ensure operation of refrigerators, TV-sets, and
other electric devices with high starting current)

2.3.2.4.1. Power values for prioritized equipment and illumination of RHC (with the condition of
using energy saving lamps):

It can be seen from the Tables 1.6. that installed capacity of equipment and illumination, which is
needed to ensure power backup (3100±600) watt – for main option and (1700±100) watt– for the
alternative option.

2.3.2.4.2. Thus, for all of the RHCs inverter output power shall be not less than:

- 4,000 watt – for main option, and

- 2,000 watt – for alternative option.

Selection of inverters shall be made individually for every RHC. However it should be noted that
equipping of RHC with modern equipment shall be continued. Therefore National Specialist on PV-
systems believes that RHCs shall be equipped with inverters having margin of output power:

- 5,000 watt - for main option, and

- 3,000 watt - for alternative option

This would enable not only future development of RHC, but also improve operational reliability of
inverters.

2.3.2.4.3. As it was stated in sections 3.3. and 3.4. of the Report No. 2, one watt of output power cost
between $1.2-1.5.

MAP ENERGY Company (Russia) manufactures inverters, designed using principles of low-
frequency transformation, which significantly increases its’ reliability and overload characteristics
(see WWW SOLARHOME.RU). Its’ prices significantly lower: BBP-5 type of inverter with output
power of 5,000 watt cost as much as $1,700, while BBP-2 type of inverter with output power of 2,000
watt -$900 (including transportation and customs expenditures). Using of these inverters would be
very efficient.

Unfortunately, the list of the manufactured inverters has no inverters with output power of 3,000 watt,
and the issue of it’s procurement shall be considered separately.

2.3.3. To summarize the abovementioned, we may calculate estimated cost specifications of PV-
systems for 5 RHCs:

2.4. MANUFACTURERS AND PRICES. MAINTENANCE SERVICES

2.4.1. PV-system market is not developed. Thus in 2006 the following types of PV-systems were
imported to Uzbekistan: Chinese with the price of $8-$11 per watt of generating capacity and Israel
made $10-$14 per watt of generating capacity. Recently Indian PV-systems appeared in the market
for the price of $16-$18 per watt. The abovementioned prices not included transport and customs
costs amounted as much as 15-20% of the initial prices.

2.4.2. According to the information of PV-systems National Specialist there is only one company in
Uzbekistan JSC FOTON producing PV systems with the following installation and providing after
sale services. The PV-systems produced by JSC FOTON cost $9-$10 per W of generating capacity
depending on specification.

2.4.3. At the end of this section we present data on market prices some of the components of PV-
systems published in RENEWABLE ENERGY Magazine, Vol. XV, No. 1 2001 – 2002:

2.6. RECOMMENDATIONS

2.6.1. National Specialist on PV systems has no available data on the costs of other options for
ensuring reliable power supply. It is obvious that proposed PV-system option is rather expensive.
However, is this the main factor to supersede the other factors?

2.6.2. Form O&M point of view PV system considered to be the most easiest system to carry out
maintenance work if the systems use sealed-in accumulators. Good example of almost 4-years
operation of domestic PV-systems can be seen in Kostruba village of Karakalpakstan, which is one of
the most isolated villages of Uzbekistan.

At the same time, all other systems, which could be used for ensuring reliable power supply, require
serious maintenance services. Particularly, using of UPS require maintenance of accumulators, as they
work mainly in buffer mode. Under such conditions using sealed-in accumulators is not
recommended due to higher corrosion behavior. Therefore it is difficult to introduce regular
maintenance of accumulators in Jahonobod RHC, which would include more frequent inspection and
changing structure of electrolyte.

4 out of 5 surveyed RHC have no professionally and regularly maintained electric systems. Only
Jahonobod RHC reportedly has qualified electrician.

2.6.3. Speaking about tariffs, introduction of UPSc with the aim of improving reliability of power
supply would result in increase of power consumption by 15-20% due to losses in accumulator circuit
charge. Apart from that, because of the low quality of energy in N. Baymuhamedov RHC the chargers
should be equipped with special voltage stabilizers, which would result in more losses of power.

Introduction of PV-systems allows the entire medical-diagnostic complex of RHC to switch to
autonomous power supply during spring-summer period due to higher solar radiation (not less than
three times compared with autumn-winter time), resulting in energy-conversion efficiency three times
higher during this period.

Surely, under existing low power tariffs such power losses would not be significant. However, if the
tariffs would reach average European level, then it would seriously impact financial situation of RHC.

2.6.4. There are several RHCs located in remote areas and disconnected from electric power grid.
These RHCs receive electric power by means of subfractional horsepower generators run by diesel,
which results in problems of diesel supply and polluting environment.

The problem of reliable and sustainable power supply shall be settled only through PV due to absence
of hydro resources in these districts.

2.6.5. Based on the above mentioned the National Specialist on PV systems suggests:

To establish 3 (three) pilot PV systems in three RHCs under proposed Project: in N.
Baymuhammedov, Jahonabod, and Juzim-Bog RHCs

All of these RHCs are located in three different locations with different character of power
consumption.

It is advisable to install a UPS-based system in two other RHCs (Umarov and Pakhtakor). Closeness
of these 2 RHCs to big cities would ease providing maintenance of UPSc.

The decision over generating capacity of the abovementioned three pilot PV-systems (main or
alternative option) shall be made depending on financial possibilities of the proposed Project.

PART 3 ANSWERS PROVIDED BY NATIONAL CONSULTANT ON PV SYSTEMS

TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS MADE BY INTERNATIONAL CONSULTANT

3.1. Question 1: To determine cost of installation for various RHCs in terms of economic and
technical approaches

3.1.1. Installation cost of PV system consists of two major parts:

• Part 1 is cost of metal constructions to be required to install PV panels at the site and cost of

accumulators’ placement;

• Part 2 is cost of PV system installation and adjustment at the site selected including costs of:

▪ materials and component parts required for the PV unit such as wires, cables, joints
and fittings, device for automatic switch on of emergency power supply source (in
case if this device will be included into design), etc.
labor cost for PV system installation.

▪

3.1.2. Cost of metal constructions (the first part) depends on installed capacity of the PV system, and,
therefore, a number of accumulators connected to the solar panel. Obviously, the large installed
capacity of PV system the greater cost is required for the installation works.

Moreover, this part of installation cost will be dependent on what option of the PV panel design
(ground or located at supports) the customer prefers (in our case the customer is the Ministry of
Healthcare): according to the data given in the RENEWABLE ENERGY Magazine, Vol. XV, No. 1,
2001 – 2002, ground located option in 1.5-2 times cheaper than option with supports at the same
number of PV modules.

Costs of PV system installation and adjustment (the second part) slightly depend on its installed
capacity. This part of installation cost is strongly depends on the object suitability for integration into
the emergency power supply system, its sizing, number of rooms which should be connected to
emergency power supply source, and other parameters that shall be indicated in the Terms of
Reference for placing the PV system at the concrete site.

3.1.3. Based on the above mentioned, it is evident that the real cost of PV installation can be
determined after receiving the precise terms of reference prepared by the customer (the Ministry of
Healthcare), development of detailed technical design for each of RHCs, and calculation of the cost
breakdown only. Therefore, the detailed development of this matter was not possible in the Report 4.
The possible installation cost for the case if the FOTON Plant will implement the installation has been
indicated indirectly in section 3.2 of the above Report. In this section, it has been said (quoted by the
Report 4) that ‘ cost of PV systems produced by the JSC FOTON that includes installation cost and
cost of after sale service during 3 years is 9-10 USD per W of installed capacity depending on the
providers of the PV system components’.

3.1.4. Without the concrete terms of reference and developed technical design, the very tentative
installation cost can be identified only. It is limited by the national consultant’s experience and
information available about the similar projects.

Based on the above said, data on the costs of

▪ metal construction required to install the PV panels is based on information given in the

RENEWABLE ENERGY Magazine, Vol. XV, No. 1, 2001 – 2002;

▪ metal construction required to place the accumulators and their installation and assembling is

based on the findings made during inquiries of the relevant expert of the JSC FOTON.

3.1.5. Cost of metal construction required to install the PV panels has been determined based on the
assumption that they will be installed at the metal supports above the ground (see section 1.2) and it is
given in Table 1.1. Such a solution was made as it is envisaged a safety (anti-vandal) location of the
PV panels. It has to be again emphasized that each company, which will make installation,
assembling and adjusting the PV system, has to choose together with the customer the optimal
solution to place the PV panels.

3.1.6. Results of the expert’s assessment of the cost of metal construction (stands) to place the
accumulators, and also the second part of cost for PV system installation (installation, assembling,

134

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

and adjustment) got from the queries of the specialist of FOTON Plant are given in Table 1.2.

The assessment made has had into account the follows:

▪
▪
▪

real cost of metal at domestic markets in Uzbekistan (as of 01.07.07);
tentative labor cost required for manufacturing of the stands;
shape of the power supply system available in each of the RHCs surveyed, RHC sizing, and the
required scope of works (see Table 2.1 of Report 3).

3.2. Question 2. To make assessment of O&M costs, cost for technical service and replacement of
components

3.2.1. M&O costs for PV system consists of three major parts:

Part 1 is cost of the current technical service of PV system;
Part 2 is cost of the current and mid-term repairing of the components used for PV system;
Part 3 is M&O costs for PV system that are needed for planned replacement of its components

•
•
•
based on their lifetime.

3.2.2. Current technical service of PV system includes:

•
•
•
•

current technical service of PV panel;
current technical service of connecting lines and switching devices composing the PV system;
technical service of accumulators;
technical service of electronic devices such as inverter and controller.

3.2.2.1. Current technical service of PV panels is the regular and regulated cleaning their surfaces
from pollutions, snow and ice as well as cleaning and preventive measures for contacts and electrical
wires available at the PV modules. Frequency, amount, regulations and technology of the technical
service of the PV panels have to be indicated in the relevant M&O.

3.2.2.2. Current technical service of the connecting lines and switching devices included into the PV
system package has to be made in accordance with the requirements stated in the Regulations on
Technical Operation and Regulations on Safety Measures (official publishing house of the State Power
Inspectorate “UZGOSENERGONADZOR, Tashkent, 2005). The service includes regular cleaning
and tightening the contacts, periodical checking the switching and connecting devices, all types of
fuses, surface of the connecting wires, their insulation, etc. As soon the inadequacies are identifies, the
relevant measures to be undertaken during the current technical service.

3.2.2.3. Current technical service of all types of accumulators is first of all to maintain clean surface
of the accumulators’ bodies and regular cleanup of their clamps.

3.2.2.3.1. In case if the PV system is equipped with the open-type accumulators, amount of the
technical service is quite large, it requires higher qualification of the staff, and use of special materials
(distilled water, sulphuric acid, etc.).

To illustrate the above said, a quote from the Regulations on Technical Service for the open-type
accumulators manufactured by the VHB Firm is cited below:

To ensure efficient operation of the batteries, the following activities shall be implemented:

Monthly:

Visual control of electrolyte’s level and external surface of the batteries.

•
Water shall be added not latter than the electrolyte’s level will reach the lowest permissible level fot
the electrolyte. Operational temperatures above 20 0C and often charges at the increased voltage
increase water consumption. To add water, distilled water that meets the requirements for cleaning
given in Table 4, shall be used only;

Control of voltage level for constant recharging at the rectifier;

•
• Temperature control in the premises;
• Testing operational efficiency of the ventilation system;
• Control of electrolyte’s density:
a)
b)

Selectively for 10% of accumulators,
For accumulators at which the reduced voltage took place during the previous annual testing.

Annually:

Control of voltage at all accumulator batteries. The allowable variation at particular

1.
accumulators can be -0.05/+0.1 V of the rated voltage;

Control of the electrolyte’s density at all accumulators. The allowable variation at particular

2.
accumulators can be ± 0.01 g/cm3 of the rated value.

Note:

1.
rate, they shall be checked monthly;

In case of voltage fluctuation at particular accumulators for the value greater the allowable

2.
greater the allowable rates, they shall be replaced.

In case of voltage and electrolyte density fluctuations at some accumulators for the values

Once during 3 years capacities of all accumulators of the battery shall be checked in the mode of the
constant recharge by the same current as was used during the commissioning.

3.2.2.3.2. For the sealed-in accumulators, the amount of technical service is essentially less. As an
example, the instruction for technical service for such accumulators manufactured by the TOP
POWER Firm, can be used:

Once during 6 months to check voltage of the battery as well as the temperature and voltage at the
monitoring elements, and results shall be registered in the accumulator registry.

Once a year to check the battery’s voltage, and temperature and voltage at each element of the battery,
and results shall be registered in the accumulator registry.

3.2.2.3.3. Comparing the content of the sections 3.2.2.3.1. and 3.2.2.3.2., it is obvious that technical
service of the sealed-in accumulators is essentially simpler, it doesn’t require higher qualification of
the staff and use of special materials. This is one of the main reasons that usage of sealed-in
(unattended) accumulators has been recommended as a technical solution for PV system proposed for
RHCs in the section 4.2 of Report 4.

3.2.2.4. Current technical service of electronic devices (controller and inverter) is a periodic checking
fulfillment of their main functions (according to the operational regulations), cleaning their surfaces,
cleanup the clamps and contacts.

3.2.2.5. Comparison of the scope of works on the technical service indicated in the sections 3.2.2.3 –
3.2.2.4. with data given in the “Unified tariff and qualification reference-book on works and
occupations” (Edition 1, Section: occupations for workers general for all sectors of economy.
Publishing house “Mashinostroenie”, Moscow, 1986) has showed that all above mentioned works
have to be implemented by a technician of RHC that shall have qualification ‘Electrician on repairing
and service of electrical equipment’ of the second or third qualification grades. Taking into
consideration that this staff member will be very likely the only one specialist of such qualification at
the site (RHC), it would be preferably that the person has the third qualification grade.

3.2.2.6. According to the “Unified 22 grade scale for wages and salaries” applied in Uzbekistan, an
electrician on repairing and service of electrical equipment of the third grade has monthly wage of
approximately 44 ths UZS (approx. 35USD) as of 01.08. 2007. Therefore, cost of the current
technical service of PV systems is 420 USD per year.

3.2.3. Costs of the current and medium repairing of the components with which the PV system is
equipped with, is mainly the costs of possible repairing the controller and inverter.

The upper limit for the costs of their repairing can be approximately estimated the following way:

3.2.3.1. According to the data given in Table 1.1 of Report 4, RHCs are not supplied with power
during approximately 30% of the time, or about 2,500 hours per year. This means that time of active
operation of the PV system is 2,500 hours per year, or 25,000 hours during 10 years.

3.2.3.2. Controller and inverter include about 200 electronic devices that operate during 5*106 of
device-hours during 10 years. If it is assumed that an average intensity of breakdowns for electronic
components is λ~10-6 1/h, the number of breakdowns will be equal to 5 breakdowns during 10 years of
operation or one breakdown during 2 years of operation.

3.2.3.3. Based on assessment made by the experts of JSC FOTON, cost of one repairing work for one
sophisticated electronic device is in average 2.5-5% of its total cost. Costs of controller and inverter
are 2,000 USD for the base option and 1,100 USD for the alternative option (see Table 1.7 of
Additions to Report 4). Therefore, cost of one repairing can be 30-100USD, or in average about
60USD per one repairing work. As the frequency of electronic equipment breakdowns can be
forecasted as 1 breakdown during 2 years, the costs of its repairing will be about 30 USD per year.

3.2.4. Costs of planned replacement of PV system components

This primarily includes replacement of accumulators, if their lifetime is less 10 years.

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

3.2.4.1. Accumulators proposed for PV system can be installed in RHC (see Table 1.3 of Additions to
Report 4) have declared lifetime of 7 years. Therefore, accumulators shall be replaced once during 10
years of accumulators’ operation. Thereby, costs of their replacement during 10 years will be in the
amount stated in Table 1.4 of Additions to report 4.

3.2.4.2. Actually, industries manufacture the sealed-in (unattended) accumulators with declared
lifetime of 10 and more years. At the same time, their price differs by 30% from the price for similar
accumulators with declared lifetime of 5 years.

In particular, a firm “VYBOR” offers an accumulator of GPL 121000 type (Manufacturer: Company
CSB Battery Co., Ltd. Taiwan) with voltage of 12 V, capacity of 100 A*h, and lifetime of 10 years for
225USD. But the price for similar accumulator of GP 121000 type with lifetime of 5 years
manufactured by the same company is 180USD. Thus, price difference is not more 30%.

3.2.4.3. it is obvious that use of more expensive accumulators with the declared lifetime of 10 years
for PV systems is more economical valuable. At the same time, taking into consideration that the share
of cost of accumulators in the total cost of the PV system is not exceed 20% (see Table 1.7 of
Additions to Report 4), total cost of PV system will be increased not more than 6-7%. Such approach
allows avoiding replacement of accumulators and, therefore, expenses required for planned
replacement of accumulators. In this case, total M&O costs for PV system to be installed in RHC
will be 450 USD per year (see sections 2.1.6. and 2.2.3.).

Feasibility Study Report

Annex 6. Reports of National Consultant/Expert on
supply and demand side improving, Mr. Petr
Pozychanyuk

Data, Analysis and Recommendations

General Data
The following documents had not been submitted: certificate for equipment installed in RHC,
statement from electric inspection authorities on RHC equipment conditions, dielectric rigidity
testing certificate of wire and cable lines, earth connection testing certificate.

We assume that these issues are OK (Assumption)

Statistics data show that RHC work 3,648 hours annually out of 8,760 possible hours constituting a
year.

According to international consultant and materials collected by National Expert on PV-systems the
RHC equipment mainly works part-time during a day. For extraordinary cases like power-offs or
blackouts, the equipment with power consumption of 500 W would enable main functions of RHC.
To enable more functions the 5 kW equipment would be needed. The issue of averaged data on
energy consumption, which is repeated in many tables, can be considered as some sort of
controversial question when it refers to assessment of power of energy generating equipment. This is
because of the fact that even short-time consumption of peak load values, when frequently repeated,
requires values of power of generating equipment, therefore power load (consumer) can not be
drastically decreased.

This averaged data can show only changes in costs, say for fuel, if diesel or petrol generator is used,
or in recourses of accumulator batteries in terms of charge depth of discharge to asses its’ service
life.

I.Technical Solutions on Five Rural Health Centers
1.A.Umarov Rural Health Center (RHC)

According to Consultant on PV-systems full power consumption is equal to 6,300/14,300 W.
Probably energy generating equipment with the power of 7,000/15,000 W could be needed to meet
the requirements.

Under such conditions the issue of integration into existing internal RHC network could be
simplified.

The most unreliable period of power supply lasts from November till March. This is 5 month or 125
days = 1,500 working hours. Occasional (extraordinary) blackouts – 168 hours (7 days).

Provisionally the most frequently blackout periods can be assumed as 6 hours. However we may
also assume it to be longer. Provisionally blackout period can be assumed as up to 2 days.

Conclusions on A. Umarov RHC:
- main power feed is considered as unreliable.
- Blackouts may happen almost every day and could last for long periods.
(this fact has an impact on technical solutions using electric power accumulating systems, as no
reliable data available on precise periods of absence of power in industrial electric networks)

-

the most appropriate option for A. Umarov RHC seems to be independent source of power, such
as diesel or petrol generator, with small-capacity UPS to use during start of generator.

148

Feasibility Study Report

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196
-

In order to use medical refrigerator during blackouts an automatically controlled generator to
switch on/off power shall be needed.

- There is no fundamental difficulty in this issue, except significant difference in equipment price.

Technical Solution on A. Umarov RHC

Option 1.

а) In order to ensure reliable power supply for the period up to 6 hours during blackouts, for
equipment with the capacity up to 500 W the UPS Liebert UPStation GXT2 – 10 kWA can be used
(capacity is a bit overstated due to starter current of the used equipment and rugged environment)
for temporary (emergency) power supply, or similar one.

If the UPS serves for more than one consumer than the issue of cable configuration shall be sorted
out and warning system shall be enabled to inform about UPS conditions (for instance about
accumulator capacity) if consumers located in different rooms (offices).

Features: After 6 hours of operation the UPS (as source of power) needs to be charged. It can be
used again as independent source of power after 8-10 hours. During this time recharging of the UPS
shall be arranged (it is possible to use diesel (petrol) generator of adequate power).

The issue of lighting can be solved through portable sources of light (lanterns or lamps with
accumulators). It is possible to use LED stationary or portable lamps, however the latter proposal
is still under consideration as no data available about its’ reliability, though according to the
manufacturer lamps’ service life is almost 10,000 hours with 5 times less power consumption than
luminescent energy saving lamp)*.

According to our experience the service life is about 3-5 years.

b) In order to ensure reliable power supply for the period up to 6 hours during blackouts, for RHC
equipment with the capacity up to 5 kW the automatic power generator run by petrol or diesel
depending on price & quality, which will be automatically switched on\off during blackouts shall be
needed. Generator capacity is 5-8 kW (more precise capacity figures can be calculated during
voltage surges on RHC loads)

It is also necessary to sort out the issue of cable configuration to enable connection of equipment of
particular importance excluding possibilities of unforeseen connections. The issue of protecting
power supply from short circuits and overloads. For sure, this issue may be covered by using UPS
10 kVA х 6 or UPS up to 50 kVA capacity with built-in diesel-generator, however the cost of such
decision very far exceeds $10,000 and we even can not consider such option.

Features: The generator requires periodical maintenance, providing with fuel and spare parts, as
well as specific place for installation. Special fire and safety precautions should be followed.
Generator service life depends on number of hours worked and measured by moto\hours. This figure
is around 5,000 moto\hours.

Option 2.
a) In order to ensure reliable power supply for the period up to 2 days during blackouts, for RHC
equipment with the capacity up to 500 watt the automatic power generator with the capacity up to 1
kilowatt run by petrol, which will be automatically switched on\off during blackouts shall be needed
(depending on medical equipment requirements UPS with the capacity up to 500 kVA shall be used
together). During blackouts it will work only during RHC’s staff labor hours.

b) In order to ensure reliable power supply for the period up to 2 days during blackouts, for RHC
equipment with the capacity up to 5 kW, it is recommended to use diesel generator (DG) with the
capacity of 8-10 kW. When needed individual UPS shall be arranged for (capacity up to 1,000 VA).
It will also work only during RHC’s staff labor hours

149

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196
Features: The generator requires periodical maintenance, providing with fuel and spare
parts, as well as specific place for installation. Special fire and safety precautions should be
followed.

It also should be taken into account that energy consumption will increase due to needed charge of
UPS batteries and depend on number of blackouts and its’ duration.. This will naturally increase
power consumption by value of accumulator efficiency factor and losses in equipment.

Remark:
The devices to be connected to such

Conclusions:
The issue of improving reliability of power supply can be solved positively
The needed equipment can be purchased in markets of Uzbekistan
Commissioning works can be arranged
up to 2 years warranties for the supplied equipment.

Problems:
- it is problematic to integrate suggested equipment into existing RHC internal network. During
integration works it would be necessary to make provisions for commutation automatic control
devices as well as protection of power sources from surcharge. To proceed with this more data shall
be obtained on internal networks and RHC possibilities.

Total power consumption is 7,800/16,000 Watt. Probably it would be necessary to use energy
generating equipment with the capacity up to 10\20 kilowatt, which would simplify the issue of
integration into internal RHC network.

Feasibility Study Report

The most unreliable period of power supply lasts from November till March. This is 5 month or 125
days = 1,500 working hours. Occasional (extraordinary) blackouts – 168 hours (7 days).

There are complaints on power quality: 40% of the time the voltage is low (160-170 volt) causing
dysfunction most of the equipment. More detailed study of such low voltage is needed. Such voltage
can be considered as blackout. Probably voltage stabilizers could be used to improve the voltage
quality but it seems to be questionable solution and should be checked.

Conclusions on A.Umarov RHC: According to data presented by National Consultant on PV-
systems the voltage level is low (up to 40% of time) therefore voltage stabilizers shall be added into
the system, but this solution needs to be analyzed and checked.

Power corresponds to load (up to 500 watt and 5 kilowatt)
Option 1.

а) In order to ensure reliable power supply for the period up to 6 hours during blackouts, for
equipment with the capacity up to 500 watt power supply schemes similar to the schemes of power
supply from PV-systems can be used. But instead of solar panels rectifying installation with
corresponding automatic control device to switch on\off alternative power supply.

This solution is acceptable for 6 hours blackouts as well as for
b) blackouts with the duration up to 2 days. The difference is in capacities of accumulator batteries
and its’ power. Also automatic network control device shall be added.

Conditional schematic circuit to illustrate Option 1.

In order to ensure reliable power supply for the period up to 6 hours (power load up to 500 W)
as well as for the period of up 2 days (power load up to 5 W)
(suitability of using this scheme of power supply can proceed from the assumption that during 2
days 30 kWh would be required (15 kWh per day) The assumption in accordance with the ToR)

3.1 Johanobod Rural healthcare (RHC)

It is located in mountain area, 1,500 m above sea level (for this altitude electro-technical standards
for the altitude of above 1,000 m shall be applied , as water boils under temperature of 950С, internal
combustion engine power losses are around 20% that increases fuel consumption per generation of 1
kWh of energy, etc.)

Working hours: around-the-clock work
It is possible significant power consumption for washing and ironing.

There are in-patient hospital consisting of 6 wards and maternity ward in the RHC.

Total power consumption is 17,000 Watt. Probably it would be necessary to use energy generating
equipment with the capacity up to 20 kilowatt, which would simplify the issue of integration into
internal RHC network.

The most reliable period of power supply lasts from November till March. This is 5 month or 125
days = 1,500 working hours.

According to the data presented by National Expert on PV-systems the power supply is not reliable
with high probability of sudden outage in any time of RHC operation for unpredicted periods.

3.2 Conclusions on Jahonobod RHC
Option 1.
a) In order to ensure reliable power supply for the period up to 6 hours during blackouts, for
equipment with the capacity up to 500 kW the automatic power generator with the capacity up
between 600-1,000 W run by petrol, which automatically controls power supply during blackouts,
can be used. There is no low-capacity generators run by petrol with automatic power supply control
device available in Uzbekistan. Therefore generator shall be started manually. Usually prepared
generator can be started within 2-3 minutes. Substitution of power supply blackouts can be arranged
through UPS with capacity of 1,000 VA.

Characteristics: During blackouts power supply shall be switched to independent supply source,
i.e. petrol generator. In this case it is not desirable to use automatic device due to significant power
consumption by automatic commutation control device and its’ high price.

The generator requires periodical maintenance, daily inspections, and providing with fuel and spare
parts, as well as specific place for installation. Special fire and safety precautions should be
followed. Generator service life depends on number of hours worked and measured by moto/hours.
This figure is around 5,000 moto/hours.
(Usually this data are not shown by the manufacturer)

b) In order to ensure reliable power supply for the period up to 6 hours during blackouts, for RHC
equipment with the capacity up to 5 kW the automatic power generator run diesel with the capacity
of 8-10 kW shall be needed. The capacity figures presented to meet reliability of power supply.

The device shall be connected to internal network of the specified equipment to enable no-break
power supply. (Possible connections in accordance with three-phase or one-phase schemes – shall

152

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196
be clarified during designing in accordance actual power supply cabling layout of RHC building
facilities)

Feasibility Study Report

Characteristics: This technical solution would require special outside building place for installation
the generator. Special fire and safety precautions should be followed as well as ensuring fire
protection of stored fuel. Special staff training shall be needed.
Option 2.
a) In order to ensure reliable power supply for the period up to 2 days during blackouts, for RHC
equipment with the capacity up to 500 W the automatic power generator with the capacity up to
2 kW run by petrol, with automatic power supply control device shall be needed (depending on
medical equipment requirements UPS with the capacity up to 1,000 VA shall be used).

Characteristics: the same like in the sub-section a) of the Option 1

In order to ensure reliable power supply for the period up to 2 days during blackouts, for RHC
equipment with the capacity up to 5 kW, it is recommended to use diesel (petrol) generator with the
capacity of 8-10 kW. The capacity figures presented to meet reliability of power supply.

b) Or 2 generators working by turns with automatic control can be used during blackouts in the
network with the capacity of up to 6 kW (if there is a probability of blackout for the period of
more than 2 days) with the possibility of joint work of two generators when needed. In this case
cabling layout is complicated and special commutation and protection systems shall be used.

The device shall be connected to internal network of the specified equipment to enable no-break
power supply. (Possible connections in accordance with three-phase or one-phase schemes – shall
be clarified during designing in accordance actual power supply cabling layout of RHC building
facilities).

Characteristics: This technical solution requires special outside building place for installation the
generator. Special fire and safety precautions should be followed as well as ensuring fire protection
of stored fuel. In case of installation of two generators the layout of the equipment shall be arranged
in a way allowing maintenance activities during functioning one of the devices. The staff shall be
properly trained.

There is an electric pump with the power consumption of up to 1 kW in the RHC. Total power

153

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196
consumption is 15,100 W. The issue would be solved through installation of diesel generator with
the capacity of 16 kW ** with automatic control device. This would simplify the issue of integration
into internal RHC network.

Feasibility Study Report

The most unreliable period of power supply lasts from September till April. During the most period
of diseases peaks (8 month of the year) power supply is particularly unreliable.

Based on available power supply reliability data independent (non-depending from networks)
sources of power supply shall be used.

4.2 Conclusions on Pakhtakor RHC

Due to similar conditions for this RHC the abovementioned options on improving reliability of
power supply to RHC (A. Umarov, N. Baymuhammedov, Jaohanobad, but mainly independent) can
be used (under power consumption of 500 W, 5 kW)

5.1 Juzim-Bog Rural Healthcare (RHC)

Total power consumption is 12,450 W. Probably it is necessary to use energy generating equipment
with the capacity up to 15 kW, which would simplify the issue of integration into internal RHC
network.

The most unreliable period of power supply lasts from November till May. During the most period
of diseases peaks ( 8 month of the year) power supply is particularly unreliable.

According to the presented data for Juzim-Bog RHC independent source of power supply shall be
needed. This solution was already considered for all of the RHCs described above.

For Juzim-Bog RHC the solution combining PV-system equipment with infeed from industrial
network seems to be interesting. Rectifying installation and protection unit shall be added to the PV.
In principle, this technical solution can be applied to all of the RHCs. In accordance with the
requirements (for 6 hours as well as 2 days blackouts) this task can be completed by making
corresponding adjustments to battery capacities and output power. JSC Foton can easily implement
such solution. The reliability of the system would significantly improve.

Capacity of proposed equipment increased by 1.3 – 1.5 times due to absence of accurate information
on:

- Temperature inside the room by season (i.e. no data). There is a possibility of improper heating
in winter. When it is cold, accumulators’ capacity considerably decreases, that is the reason for
increase.

-

In summer, increase is caused by high temperature which adversely affects to resource of
accumulators and electronic modules of equipment. There is a possibility of breakdown at
ultimate operation, power reserve of modules, therefore, is needed.

The second factor is more rational use of resource of equipment. For the most accurate calculation,
it would be efficient to prepare several variants with full-scale tests in real conditions. Then, on the
basis of obtained data, design should be prepared for technical, and if required. For construction part
of the system which provide reliable power supply to RHC. General design, obviously, should
comprise all aspects of power supply, namely electric power, heating, hot and cold water supply,
etc.

Equipment components which can be bought or ordered in local Uzbek market are presented in the

Proposed components comply with ISO 9001 – 2000 (and has appropriate certificate issued by
relevant authority). Sellers of equipment have corresponding licences for business.

It is reasonable that procurement of equipment from little known company is risky at some extent.
Firstly, because of implementation of guarantees, secondly, in provision of spare parts in post
guarantee period. To this end, before taking decision on procurement of equipment, it would be
better to examine data on manufacturer, which type of equipment and to whom it was supplied, and
references; how servicing of equipment supplied and being supplied is carried out and company’s
age. Careful approach in selection of supplier would allow to a greater extent eliminate risks.

In this case, it is optimal to find a supplier, who based on TOR, would be able to supply equipment,
provide its commissioning and secure warranty. Additionally, by separate contract it would provide
equipment maintenance works

Arrangement of equipment servicing

There are no servicing companies that could service the proposed equipment for reliable power
supply to RHC based on proposed technologies (apart from factory made UPS) in Uzbekistan at
present.

All mobile companies and communication companies have servicing centres for similar equipment.
On the analogy of works, servicing centres for air conditioners, refrigerators and other sophisticated
consumer electronics can be reviewed. Usually, these are organised by manufacturers. There are no
problems with spare parts and deliverables, as well as with consumables, at properly organised
servicing centre. Personnel commonly are trained at the premises of manufacturer; they have all
equipment required for testing and maintenance, and issues of transportation and communication are
addressed. There are branches of servicing centre in each province. Works are implemented on the
basis of guarantee and contracts.

In principle, there are companies that could provide servicing, but they put conditions of having a
significant number of objects, uniformity of type of equipment at RHC, i.e. from a limited number
of suppliers. Lack of required calculated figures and data made it impossible to assess cost of
servicing works, production, human resources, transportation, etc. (probably, servicing and
installation issued can be dealt by Foton Ltd., Akkumenergo or any other company, but without
specific proposal I have not had a possibility to discuss those issues with the managers of above
companies).

The Ministry of Health might have a division on maintenance of medical equipment, which can deal
with the matter of equipment for reliable power supply to RHC. Each province should have
branches on maintenance of medical equipment.

Installation costs

With regard to installation of equipment, it can be said that for implementation of those works an
electrician of medium qualification if needed (graduated from electrotechnical college), who can

163

Feasibility Study Report

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196
deal with technical documents, equipment supplied and capable to understand diagrams,
experienced in operating of internal-combustion engines and mechanisms. The electrician would
need an assistant (perhaps, from amongst RHC staff). Scope of works subject to equipping with all
component parts and installation tool will take 3-5 days of erection and commissioning, even if the
most complex technology proposed for RHC is used. Funding of this activity would not exceed
Soum 250,000 (only salary, per diems, and transportation). Costs of materials should be prepared
based on technical design and installation drawings. Separate specifications of materials, equipment
and component parts need to be prepared for each specific item.

There are certainly some technologies which practically do not require any specific works, similar,
say, to switching on the TV-set or any other electrical appliance.

Operational costs

Operational costs (conditionally without labour) include consumables, high-wear parts, as well as
broken-down parts during operation of equipment. Let us consider operational costs of benzine
(gasoline) generator:

-

-

-

fuel, oil

filters (air, fuel, etc.)

ignition device

There are data on replacement of individual parts and components for running hours as per
specification and reference book. (there is a specific list for each item)

Therefore at claimed value of 5000 motor/h, it is possible to calculate approximate list of required
spare parts.

Similar approach for other equipment:

-

-

consumables

spare parts

It is not difficult to make calculations of consumables for each type of equipment, but for spare parts
field experience would be required. Normally, service centres could provide information during
execution of servicing contract.

Cost estimates for 20 years (tentative).

1. Petrol generator has 5000 motor/h. At operation 500 hours a year in average, its resource is 10
years. (Of course, frequent turning on the motor could notably decrease the resource. However,
it would be considered that operation was in normal mode). Hence, for the period 20 years, 1
replacement of petrol generator is needed.

2. Life time of (resource of reliable operation) electronic modules (inverters, controllers, rectifiers)
relay and switching device – 10 years. Hence, for the period of 20 years, 1 replacement is
needed.

3. Accumulators. For starter batteries, period of 2 years are accepted as a life time. For the period

of 20 years, 9 replacements are needed.

Batteries for accumulation of power for UPS* has 5-7 years resources. Hence, for the period of
20 years, 3-4 replacements are needed.

It is appropriate mention here that high temperature has an adverse impact on all accumulators.
Long operation at ambient temperature higher than 30-350С, reduces accumulators’ resource by
half. Generally, certificates shows the resource, when accumulator works at 20-250С, and
further a schedule of resource reduction is given based on temperature and duration of operation

164

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

in different conditions. As such, resource might be significantly less, and more frequent
replacement would be needed.

4. UPS in Uzbekistan’s conditions, when climatic requirements are not observed has resources for

3-5 years. For the period of 20 years, replacement should be done 4 – 6 times.

5.

Life time of wire and cable lines – 10 years. For the period of 20 years, 1 replacement is
needed.

These data should be considered during preparation of feasibility study in future costs section.

Assessment of capacities of RHC personnel to operate equipment on reliable power supply

In order to use equipment, RHC personnel should have certain training.

1. All people involved in operation of electric equipment should have to be trained in use of
equipment and should pass technical test to allow working with equipment up to 1000V with
relevant classification group, in accordance with existing safety requirements and obtaining of
certificate of standard pattern. For RHC, office instructions and recommendations should be
worked out on the basis of current regulations and standards of Rules of Electricity Installation
and Rules of Safety Work.

2. During mass installation of equipment for RHC, it is desirable to organise training in examining
of equipment for reliable power supply to RHC and practical skills on its operation and
maintenance. At the end training, test shall be conducted and certificates of completion issued.

Attention is also drawn to the fact that RHC is an independent entity and as such can add to its staff
list a position of a part time electrician (perhaps, a number of RHCs located in vicinity from each
other would have had one electrician for equipment maintenance). In any event, RHC personnel
need to be trained and prepared.

Energy saving

Task of electricity supply reliability and matter of energy saving contradict with each other. All
equipment accumulating energy or transforming it, say DC into AC or AC into DC, have in essence
cost component. Irrespective of accepted technology, i.e. at goal-setting of improved reliability, we
are doomed beforehand to have increased energy costs, rather than in the case of good power
supply. That depends on efficiency of equipment applied. However, even at application of the most
efficient equipment with reliable power supply, cost of power consumed from autonomous sources
increases at least by 1.5 times.

Things are even worth with energy generating equipment, such as petrol generators, diesel
generators, turbo-alternators, etc. Costs of production of electrical energy from such energy
generating equipment for guaranteeing of high level of power supply reliability are much more
expensive than from the grid.

In this case, would it be more practical to use the state-of-the-art equipment for energy saving? But
this, as a rule, leads to significant rise in price of equipment applied. Apparently, for resolving the
issue of energy saving, it is necessary to make a compromise by weighing the level of requirement
and adequacy, and also practicability adoption of any technology.

Conclusion

Issues of provision of reliable power supply, put in assignment, are urgent. Improving reliability of
power supply is addressed worldwide and immediate in resolving.

I would like to express my opinion on priority level of provision of RHC with highly reliable power
supply equipment. Foremost issue is lighting, next one is equipment for sterilization medical tools

165

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196
and refrigerators for storage of medicaments, and the third one is all other equipment. Based on
these views, I have prepared my technical solutions (I would suggest to discuss this issue).

Feasibility Study Report

However, for certain RHC it is necessary to investigate and eliminate reasons of non-reliable grid.
Nevertheless, something could be done to improve this situation. Even minor reliability growth
would greatly reduce the price of applied technology. It is necessary to randomly revise the lines,
substations for clarification of objective reasons of shutdowns and dumps, and seek for clear
response from district power grid.

This report covers all issued of assignment based on data submitted by the project manager.

1. Introduction

Selection of Hot-Water Supply for Rural Health Care

According to hot water consumption rates (KMK 2.04.01-98) and having in mind local conditions, a RHC would require 150-250 liters of hot water
per day.

Let us consider RHC hot water supply through electrical water heaters (option I) and solar collectors (option II).

2. Technical Features

2.1. Electrical water heater: - possibility of generation of significant volumes of hot water under low-capacity electric wiring and comparatively
low power inputs, which is one of the features of electric water heaters (EWH). Its’ power consumption varies between 1,2 to 2,5 kilowatt, though it
is time consuming process to prepare significant volumes of hot water. (200 liters – 5-8 hours), The design of EWH enables to store the heated water
hot without big power inputs.

Users safety and life time of EWH depend on its’ proper installation. Installation regulations determined by ГОСТ/GOST Р 50571 “Buildings
Electrical Installations, Electrical Code” and manufacturers’ recommendations.

182

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

Life time of electric water heater is 8-10 years. During this period a turbular electric heating element is to be replaced 2 or 3 times.

2.2.

Solar Energy Collecting Panel

Solar energy collecting panel is intended for individual houses, farms, pastures, health-improving, social and other facilities. The device can operate
in field conditions without water supply system as it can be filled in by any available water from any source. When the device is connected to water
pipeline/ watertank, water is supplied automatically as needed through special valve.

The device consists of solar collector with integral reservoir-heat exchanger. Primary coolant circuit contains antifreeze or ethylene glycol solution.
Heating of potable water is arranged in a tank through the heat exchanger. Such collector works all the year round. Under cloudy weather the water is
heated up to 60-65ºС through turbular electric heating element which is integrated into reservoir-heat exchanger. This enables to save up to 70% of
energy annually.

Solar energy collecting panel is to be installed on roof horizontally on-the-mitre 40-42 º towards south. Connection to hot water supply system is
made through using two tubes.
Life time is 15-20 years. Glass and antifreeze (ethylene glycol) are to be replaced during operational time as needed.

Conclusions

Capital investments for procurement and installation of solar collector are $375 higher. However, operating costs for solar collectors would be 65%
lower, and thus, in 2.5-3 years additional capital investments into solar collectors would be fully recovered, and its following operation would be two
times cheaper than electric water heater’s one.

The calculations made under the cost of 1 kilowatt of UZS 43.7. Having in mind annual increase of power costs, during 2-3 years the power costs would
increase by 1.5-2 times, which will result in constant growth of operating costs.

Conclusions (additional)

1.
In order to improve reliability of RHC hot water supply electric water accumulator tanks with the capacity of up to 50-120 liters can be used.
Heated water can be stored for a long period in well-isolated tank. Installed capacity of electric heating elements of 1.2-2 kilowatt enables storage of
water heated up to 65°С within 4-8 hours.

In order to enable continuous hot water supply gas water accumulator tanks can be also use. They have the same advantages like electric ones.

2.
Heating is done through popping of gas with automatics ensuring maintenance the temperature at the same level.

In order to improve reliability solar water heaters with collector area of 1 m2 and tank capacity of 80 liters can be installed; or with collector
3.
area of 2 m2 and tank capacity of 160 liters. Solar water heaters can be used seasonally or whole-year. Seasonal solar water heaters are of very simple
design and low cost. Solar water heaters for whole-year’ use are of double-loop circuit with turbular electric heating element in accumulator tank
which enables to maintain constant temperatures under low solar radiation.

4.

All these options can be recommended for using in RHCs depending on operational conditions (reliability of gas supply, power supply, etc.)

“N. Baymukhamedov”

“Pakhtakor”

“Juzim-Bog”

Self-made natural gas firing boilers are installed in all these RHCs. The Ministry of Healthcare
has to replace them with more efficient boilers. To avoid large investments it is proposed the
three following options:
1. Installation of natural gas burner with automatic device for safety measures, and insulation of
pipes located inside the boiler house.
2. Replacement of the existing boilers with new energy efficient boilers with automatic devices
for safety and regulation.
3. Replacement of the existing boilers with new energy efficient boilers with automatic devices
for safety and regulation. This system has to be equipped with regulation of temperature inside
the premises using temperature sensors (thermostats). The radiators have to be also replaced.

Renewable source of energy:
- solar
- wind
- hydropower
- biomass
- geothermal
- earth heat

As there is no boiler
house in this RHC (it
exists but is not
operational) the
following option can
be suggested:
To install energy
efficient heating
boilers to be
complemented with
automatic devices for
regulating and safety
measures. This
system has to be
equipped with
regulation of
temperature inside the
premises using
temperature sensors
(thermostats). The
radiators have to be
also replaced as they
are not in operational
state too (based on

Increasing gas pressure in pipes

In A.Umarov and N.Baymuhamedov RHCs boilers can
be shifted to liquefied gas. However, there are no
conditions to store liquefied gas in the RHCs (in terms
of fire safety requirements and requirements of
Gostechnadzor [local state engineering supervision
authority]).
According to neighboring residents, starting from
December 10 up to February 10 gas pressure in
pipelines decreased down to 50-60 mm In A.Umarov
and N.Baynuhamedov RHCs.
This happens because the RHCs are located at the ends
of gas supply lines, and there is no possibility to
“loopback the pipelines” – to connect two different
branches of gas pipeline to make a loop for improving

o Mechanism for RHC Budget Formation

Budget for every Region (Oblast) is a subject of approval at the national level, whereupon it is
approved at corresponding Regional sessions of local authorities. After identification of key figures
(budget) regional health authorities work out average budget expenses per capita, which forms a
basis for individual RHCs.

For instance: under average per capita on-budget expenditure of UZS 4,395 the total RHC budget
would be 6 592,5 thousand sum.

• Who makes decisions (RHC, at Regional or National level) and based on what

principles:

o Allocation of annual RHC Budget:

RHC Manager makes decisions over annual budget allocations with the concurrence of Regional
Health Protection authorities.

o Staff number and hiring physicians and nurses, and their salaries:

Staff list is developed in accordance with the regulations set up at the national level, and is a subject
of approval and endorsement by Regional Health Protection authorities during the preparation of
budget cost estimates. RHC Managers makes decisions over the issues of staff hiring, setting up
their terms of reference and salaries.

o RHC Working Hours:

Working hours for staff members are set in accordance with national regulations: for physicians and
middle level medical staff - 6 hours; outpatient reception hours of dentists – 5.5 hours; for
exodontists – 6 hours, non-medical staff – 7 hours. However, RHC and staff working hours are set at
the local level and can be different, so called “floating schedule”, but shall be within timetables
established in accordance with Uzbekistan Labor Code (40 working hours a week for one staff
member).

• Financing of Procurement and Replacement of Equipment and Lighting Devices, and

Equipment Maintenance and Repairs

Financing of procurement and replacement of equipment and lighting devices, equipment
maintenance and repairs are arranged based on leftover principle. First priority is given to financing
of staff salaries, then medicaments, public utilities and RHC economic expenditures as last priority.

• Statistics or averaged data on public utilities expenses in different types of RHCs (type

1, type 2, ...), for the last 3 years:

(notice: RHCs in Tashkent region were financed together with Central District Hospitals.
Since 2007 they have separate budget)

Feasibility Study Report

What are the different criteria which define each type? Is there a criterion linked with utilities?
Period of heating for different provinces?

Duration of period of heating according decree of Cabinet Ministers - 154
days, but local administrations may correct it depending on the weather.
Heating season starts from 15 October every year.

How do they regulate temperature inside RHC?

Staff of RHC regulates boilers operation. Gas supply is increased in
mornings and decreased after RHC closed. Also boilers work is regulated
during working hours.

Construction materials, nb of doors and windows. Are there everywhere insulation of ceiling
(type of insulation) and what for roofs, walls, floor, windows, doors?

Insulation of roofs and ceiling is local – clay. The rest is insulated by staff of
RHC at the beginning of heating period.

Types, efficiency and average age of boilers for heating, for hot water.

Average age of boilers is 4 -5 years, boilers – self-made with capacity from
20 liters to 100 liters.

Types and power/capacity of gas meters and electricity meters.

In RHC it is mainly installed:
gas meters type RG – 10 with capacity 10 m3 / hour;
electricity meters type SACHU 3 phase with capacity 380 volt.

What are the reactions of RHC concerning failure of gas, electricity or water? How do they
manage shortage of gas on one side, of electricity on another side?

Of course reaction is negative. When gas shortage they use coal, wood and
liquid fuel. RHC staff use self-made electric heaters.

Are frequency and duration of shortage different from one province to another?

Yes it is different. In Tashkent region shortages happen less frequently than
in others.

Can we identify different types of failures for gas, electricity and water supply?

It is possible to do it approximately, but to define it exactly it is needed to
provide a monitoring.

Are there problems of quality of gas (low pressure) and of electricity (voltage, frequency)?

Yes such problems exist: low gas pressure in winter time, and low voltage.

Concerning equipment, is there or could it be a political/ecological approach for choice of
equipment: label A for refrigerators instead of C, low consumption bulbs, laboratories
equipment with own batteries, etc

Yes, it is possible to use a political/ecological approach for choice of
equipment.

Are there any risks (if shortage of power or heating supply or low voltage and low pressure of
gas): beside finance loss; vaccines loss.

Yes, there are risks to lose vaccines due to electricity shortage, not proper
sterilization and bad disinfection of instruments.

It should be indicated priority medical equipment for emergency cases and equipment which
necessarily need electricity supply in the list of equipment from Health 2 project, its power
consumption should be also indicated.

Annex 10. Reports of National Consultant/Expert on
energy economics, Ms. Elvira Bikeeva
Task 1. Cost Efficiency Analysis of the Proposed Options

on Improvement of RHC Power Supply

1.1. Brief analysis of the current pricing system in power supply sphere and identification

of possible increase of prices for main types of energy resources.

In order to estimate costs of energy efficiency for different options on improving reliability of RHCs
power supply, identification of its’ economic effects resulting from reduced fuel and power
consumption the following data is needed: prognostic parameters of pricing changes for main types
of energy resources, which would help to use data on dynamics of expected increase in adjusting
conditions of cost efficiency of investment projects implementation.

Thus, state policy on energy resources pricing at the stage of liberalization of economy during 2001-
2005 was focused on reduction of differentiation and transformation of internal market prices
towards its’ significant increase.

Average annual increase of tariffs for electricity during 2001-2005 was about 40-43% (for
comparison: during 1995-2000 - 5-5.5%). nominal values for oil and gas were increased by 26.4%
and 42.3% respectively (against of 5% and 3.7% during 1995-2000.) Dynamics of increasing of
prices for coal and crude oil slightly slowed down compared with the period of 1995-2000, but
remained relatively high - 31.1% and over 41.%.

These trends had an effect on growth rate, incomes and financial situation of fuel-energy complex
(FEC). Price increase resulted in some increase of profitability of power industry production from
negative 12.2% in 2000 up to 8-10% in 2004-2005, while in gas-and-oil producing industry the
situation stabilized at the level of 12-15%. High dynamics of growth of tariffs rates for industrial
customers and population had an effect on changes of price ratio of internal and world prices. If up
to 2000 this ratio was amounted around 10-15% of world level, then in 2004-2005 it constituted 53-
55%. The same trends could be observed in gas industry^ fixed price for gas up to 2000 was around
20% of world prices, while in 2005 – 33-35%.

To ensure stable operation of fuel-energy complex, in perspective, further step-by-step equalization
of internal prices of energy resources with the rate of self-financing production of main types of fuel
and energy resources is envisaged.

Experts estimation on local power industry sector investment needs during forthcoming 5-8 years
are amounted as much as $3.5 billions. Uzbekistan will have to meet 65-70% of these needs at own
expenses, which requires prices and tariffs are to be set at the level enough to cover production costs
and long-term investments.

In order to achieve this target, prices for gas during 2006-2010 shall be increased by 1.9 times, or
18-20% annually, which would result the prices to get close to the average world prices by 34.7
(see Table 1.1, 1.2).

development of energy saving potential. This means, that taking into account consumer qualities of
energy resources in terms of calorific efficiency, price for black oil (mazut) would be lower than
price for gas, which in its’ turn would be 30-35% higher than coal price. In power industry, which
is one of the large fuel consumers, competition between gas and coal can be possible only if coal
market price will be 15-35% lower than gas price. Having in mind consumption qualities of black
oil (mazut) fuel, its’ market price should be 5-10% lower than gas price.

Increase of prices for gas will be accompanied with increase of prices for power and district heating
supply, due to gas share of 75-80% in boiler-stove fuel during production of electricity and heating.
Thus, it is expected, that only due to increasing of prices for gas, electric power tariffs will be
increased not less than by 22-25%. Increasing of investment costs component in power industry
will be oriented the same direction. As a result, by 2010 prices for electric power shall be increased
by 1.5-1.6 times compared with the level of 2006. In accordance with the dynamics of expected

Preparation of data and preliminary calculation of total capital expenditures and operational
expenses on the options of increasing of reliability of RHC power supply

I.2 Improving of electric lighting of RHC
Introduction of more economical system of electric lighting is one of the main conditions of
effective implementation of measures on improving reliability of RHC power supply. It is also one
of the most important priorities in the system of measures on energy savings. In accordance with the
proposed technical decision total number of energy saving fluorescent lamps throughout of the
RHCs is 88 lamps. Total capital expenditures, depending on manufacturers’ price would be from
$616 up to $968, including operational costs at the amount of $176 (see Table 1.3.1).

Feasibility Study Report

The results of the tentative economic analysis showed the following:

- energy consumption after introduction of economical system of lighting is more than 3.8 times
lower than under traditional scheme of lighting.

- Introduction of energy saving luminous lamps would allow to save 5,462 kilowatt-hour of energy
annually, which constitutes 277,0 thousand sum ($218.6) under expected increase of electric power
tariffs up to 0,04 US dollar./kilowatt-hour

- Costs pay-back period for the introduction of modern lighting system would be 2.8 years (under
prices of lamps produced by local manufacturers) and 4.4 years (under prices of lamps produced by
European manufacturers) - this confirms economic efficiency of the proposed project decision.

- In terms of fuel, the savings would be 0,672 t.o.e or 585,1 cubic meters of natural gas.

1.3 Power supply for RHC:

Setting up of standby service is priority task in the system of measures to enhance the reliability of
power supply at RHC. Based on outcomes of analysis of existing problems in power supply,
studying of climatic and territorial properties of the regions basic technical solutions on
enhancement of reliability of their power supply were justified, providing for using as a whole of:
diesel or petrol generators with small UPS; accumulators; UPS; photovoltaic PV-systems. As a basis
of technical solutions given parameters on electric power used by RHC equipment during
emergency 500W to 5kW, daily consumption 3 kWh to 15 kWh were included. Summary of options
for enhancement of power supply reliability at RHC, assessment of capital costs for equipment and
operational costs are given in Table 1.3.1

For RHC Umarova - two options for enhancement of reliability of power supply are recommended:
1. – installation of accumulators for 5 kWh during six hours cutoff: capital costs for equipment will
be US$4,150, operational costs US$685. Project implementation will allow fill up deficit electric

power in amount of 275 kWh Fill up deficit was computed subject to total cutoffs (10 per month) for
the period of the lowest reliability of power supply (five months November-March) that per data
from an Expert might be regarded as 6 hour cutoff. Installation will allow for more than 70% cover
average annual volume of rated deficit of electric power at RHC and to release about 99.0 kg of
equivalent fuel used for conventional production of replaceable electric power, in converting into
gas more than 86 m3 (Table 1.3.2.).

Cost efficiency of submitted technical solution, defined by calculation of a simple pay-back period
of the project, is very low (saving of electric power at the price of US$0.04/kWh will be US$11),
which shows dominant role of enhancement of technical reliability of power supply during project
implementation and rapid achievement of concomitant economic effects – improving of medical
services provided to the population, that in its turn would be efficiently reflected on dynamics of
inputs of services able-bodied citizens into production and business. Similar results are expected
within 2 option - installation of UPS for 5 kWh/day.

For RHC Baimikhamedova –two alternative options are recommended, distinguished by technical
solutions and duration of cutoffs: 1. – installation of photovoltaic PV-system for 3 kWh/day,
installed capacity 0.5 kW during six hours cutoff within one day (1 option), and during six hours
cutoff within two days (2 option).Capital costs for PV – systems for the first option will be
US$7700, operational costs – US$600; for the second option US$8600 and US$650 respectively.
Taking into account only winter season, the volume of turned over deficit, as a result of
implementation of that option, might be 39 kWh and 78 kWh that will allow to cover not more than
8- 16,5% of annual average calculated volume of electric power deficit. Volume of replaceable fuel
will be 14-28.1 kg of equivalent fuel or converting of gas 12.2-24.4 m3 (Table 1.3.3). Cost
efficiency of this option is also low that corresponds to international practice in getting benefits from
the development of photovoltaic systems, but at unconditional concomitant economic benefits.

With alternative 2. option, it envisaged to install accumulators for 5 kWh during six hours cutoff
within one day (1option), and two days (2 option). Capital costs for these options will be US$4150
US$ and US$10980 US$ respectively. Installation of accumulators will allow to fill in more than
312 kWh and 625 kWh of electric power subject to cutoff’s period that provide (during six hours
cutoff within one day) 65% of coverage of calculated volume of deficit as per option for optimized
electric power consumption. And virtually reduce electric power deficit at option 2 (during six hours
cutoff within one day). Volume of replaceable fuel used for conventional production of electric
power would dramatically exceed the volume of replacement, expected for the first option (PV –
systems), and would be either 112.5 and 226.2 kg of equivalent fuel or 97.8 and 196.7 m3of gas
respectively. Technical solutions will also allow resolving the problem of power supply reliability
and obtaining concomitant economic effects.

RHC «Djaikhanabad» - only one (1) option for enhancement of reliability of power supply is
envisaged - installation of diesel or petrol generators with UPS for 15 kWh/day. Capital costs for
project implementation will be US$7225, operational costs - US$1550(Table 1.3.4). Project
implementation will allow filling in electric power deficit in amount of 337 kWh Turned over deficit
was calculated subject to total cutoffs (4.5 times per month) for the period of lowest reliability of
power supply (five months November-March). Installations will allow replacing 337.5 kWh that
would cover for more than 70% of total volume of electric power deficit at RHC. In converting into
gas, replaceable volume will be 105.5 m3 or 121.3 kg of equivalent fuel.

For RHC Pakhtakor –three options of enhancement of reliability of power supply are accepted.: 1.
Installation of accumulators for 5 kWh/day during six hours cutoff; 2 Installation of UPS for 5
kWh/day with installed capacity 0.5 kW; 3 – installation of photovoltaic PV – system for 3 kWh/day
with installed capacity 0.5 kW

Capital costs for implementation of the first (1) technical solution will be US$4150, operational
costs - US$685. Installation of accumulators will allow reducing for 35% of annual electric power
deficit. Volume of filled in electric power on the basis of 4.5 cutoffs for the period of lowest
reliability of power supply (five months November-March) will be 337.5 kWh That will allow to
release from the balance of boiler-furnace fuel used for conventional production of electric power
about 92 kg of equivalent fuel or in converting into gas of 105.5. m3. (Table 1.3.5). Capital costs for
the second (2) option will be US$5150, outcomes of implementation of which will coincide with the
previous options. Implementation of these projects will be entailed with long pay-back period that
evidences low economic efficiency of technical solution, however, with unconditional enhancement
of power supply reliability at RHC.

Capital costs for implementation of the third (3) option for enhancement of power supply at RHC
will be nearly three times higher the level of capital costs of the first and second options and will
comprise US$15100. In given conditions, only during winter time, volume of filled in deficit will be
114 kWh that will allow replacing not more than 32% of annual average volume of electric power
deficit. Volume of replaceable fuel might be14 kg of equivalent fuel or 12.2 m3 of gas. Economic
efficiency of technical solution assessed by the simple index of pay-back period is lower than in two
options proposed above.

For enhancement of reliability of power supply at RHC Djuzim-bog – two (2) alternative options are
proposed, distinguished by conditions of electric power cutoffs and installed capacity of devices.
With the first (1) option, it is proposed to install photovoltaic PV- system, installed capacity -1.0 kW
for 3 kWh during six hours cutoff within one day (I) and the same installation for 3 kWh during six
hours cutoff within one day (II). Capital costs for implementation of this option at various cutoff
periods will be US$10900 and US$11600. Turned over deficit will be 150 kWh and 240 kWh
respectively that allows to reduce by 36.2%-60% of calculated volume of electric power deficit at
RHC «Djuzim-bog» summed up on the basis of 34.5 kWh – total monthly electric power deficit
related with cutoffs. Volume of replaceable fuel at conditional calculation might be 18.4 and 29.6 kg
of equivalent fuel or 16.0 and 25.7 m3 of gas.

Feasibility Study Report

Main conclusions: Preliminary analysis of technical solutions directed for enhancement of reliability
of power supply at all RHC has shown that solutions providing for introduction of photovoltaic PV-
systems would be much more expensive than accumulators systems; UPS; diesel or petrol
generators with UPS, which value of efficiency index put together slightly higher. However, from an
economic point of view, all projects have low economic efficiency, and basically directed to
problems of enhancement of power supply reliability. At the same time, technical solutions have
positive social consequences, lying in reliability and improvement of provided services, rising of
level of population’s health. For improvement of economic efficiency index of technical solutions, it
is necessary to consider the options of power supply not only in emergency state, but also in
operating condition.

1.4 Improving RHC Heat Supply System

The following approach was used for preliminary calculation of cost efficiency and payback period
of capital expenditures for implementation of main technical solutions on improving efficiency and
reliability of heat supply to the five RHCs1:

- at the first stage maximal heat flow was identified – kilowatt

- consolidated indicator of heat flow for heating premises, which is around 125 Watt/m2

where:
according to Expert estimates

- factor of heat flow =0,25

А – Building area (data from the report)
- maximal heat loss of the heated premises in RHC in heat flow is not less than 40% of
(cording to Expert estimates)
- average monthly temperature during heating season for rural areas of Uzbekistan:
- in October - +12,50С
- in November - +5,00С
- in December - +0,00С
- in January - -2,20С
- in February - -0,20С
- in March - +5,60С

Average outside temperature for the considered period is +3,50С

- actual average heat loss in heated premises
=0,4
(180+200) – calculated temperature difference
(180-3,50)- actual average annual temperature difference during heating season
- total heat loss for heating season:

×(180+200) /(180-3,50)

=

×24×182

The following conversion ratio is used for conversion of kilowatt-hour of heat energy into cubic
meters of natural gas: 0,0909.

The results of analysis showed that, expected reduction of heat losses is estimated to be around
30%-60% of total heat losses, except A.Umarov RHC, where the losses would be reduced by 15%
only.

Gas saving would be: 14.3 thousand cubic meters for Baymuhammedov RHC, 11.5 thousand cubic

The economic analyses shows that proposed investments involve high degree of risks and increase
reliability of hot water supply for RHC improving of working conditions for workers and health for
local population.

1.6. Data on stakeholders interested in implementation of projects on increasing of reliability
of rural health care (RHC) power supply:

At present institutional and regulative basis of power supply improvement in rural areas, energy
savings, introduction and development of non-traditional sources of energy are at relatively weak
level. From one hand there are many agencies and organizations involved in the process of
implementation of activities on energy savings and improving reliability of industrial energy and
power supply, including consumers from budgetary sphere.

From the other hand, the results of activities implemented by these organizations are not effective
enough, due to higher priorities, based on traditional sources of energy, set on tasks to ensure
sustainable dynamics of production of main types of energy resources, implementation of programs
on modernization and rehabilitation of large generating supply, sustainable energy supply of
strategically important industries.

However, power industry authorities recognize importance of necessary basic changes in energy
consumption sphere, importance of introduction of non-traditional sources of energy and
implementation of projects introducing more efficient and economically sound power supply
systems, particularly in rural areas as high-priority.

This direction is of particular importance in the framework of implementation of activities on
increasing quality of provided services, including medical ones, throughout the country. The
Government of Uzbekistan developed “Progarmme on Formation of Uniform Strategy of Territorial
Development of Uzbekistan for the Period of 2007-2011.” (Decree of Uzbek President dated April
20, 2006 # Р-2482 “On Formation of Commission for Development of Uniform Strategy for
Territorial Development of Uzbekistan for the Period of 2007-2011”), which pays significant
attention to the development of production and social infrastructure, increasing of qualitative
characteristics of power and water supply, transport, medical and other services ensuring decreasing
the level of regional differentiation in providing services and social benefits.

Therefore, the roles which play state, regional authorities and ministries in implementation of
Health-2 Project will become more important. International donor agencies make significant
contribution to the development of rural health care system and implementation of projects on
improving energy efficiency.

План действующего утвержденного проекта – Design of the approved and operating project

During 1999-2004, ‘Health-1’ Project aimed to strengthening and reforming the primary healthcare
system in Fergana, Navoiy, and Syrdaria provinced had been implemented. The second amendment
had been included into the loan agreement dated of 19 March 2003. According to the amendment,
shortage of water regions such as the Republic of Karakalpakstan and Khoresm province were
included into the “Health-1” project. This has been done due to savings made and without increase
of loan commitments made by the government.

The project objective was establishing demonstration models of the primary medical care services
on the basis of examples of Fergana, Navoiy, Syrdaria, and Khoresm provinces and the Republic of
Karakalpakstan.

Construction, reconstruction, and operation of RHCs and renovation of a set of medical institutions
located in the rural areas became a contribution made by Uzbekistan. Equipping the facilities with
medical equipment and medicines as well as personnel training and introduction of new mechanisms
for financing and management have been envisaged for use of the WB loan funds.

To achieve the above indicated goals and objectives, four major components were included into the
project’s structure:

• Strengthening services provided by the primary healthcare system;
• Training of doctors and nurses of general medical practice;

242

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

• Strengthening the system of management and financing applied for the primary healthcare

system;

• Management of the project.

The following activities were implemented within each component:

I.

Strengthening the primary healthcare system

In five regions of the country, activities on establishing a branched network of RHCs were
implemented. This allowed to simplify organization of the primary medical and sanitary aid (PMSA)
and shift from the many-staged (Medical Attendant and Obstetrical post, Rural Medical Ambulance
Station, Rural District Hospital, and Central Republican Hospital) to two-staged (RHC - Central
Republican Hospital) approach.

Total amount of RHCs equipped within the framework of the ‘Health-1’ project is 677. Among them
214 RHCs are located in Fergana province, 121 RHCs – in Syrdaria province, 89 RHCs – in Navoiy
province, 121 RHCs – in Khoresm province, and 108 RHCs – in Karakalpakstan. Moreover, 20
RHCs were equipped in Samarkand province based on the Uzbek Government suggestion.

To increase access for local population living in remote and isolated rural areas to medical services,
70 units of specialized off-highway vehicles of UAZ type cars and 28 DAMAS cars have been
procured and delivered by the project.

To provide emergency and first aids to rural population living in Navoiy and Syrdaria provinces, a
radio communication system that allows establishing an effective operational radio communication
with the remote and isolated RHCs located at these regions with district, provincial, and national
centers of emergency aid has been installed. 55 fixed and 16 mobile radio communication stations
have been installed in Navoiy province, and 39 fixed and 4 mobile radio communication stations
have been installed in Syrdaria province.

Results achieved

The evaluation of RHCs’ activities showed that actually in comparison with 1998 the number of
visits made to one RHC is increase in 2 times but the number of patients sent to consultations made
by specialized doctors has been decreased by 33.5%, patients sent to hospitals – by 26.8%. This
proves the increased trust and access of rural population to medical services provided by the RHCs.

Moreover, introduction of new approaches of management and financing the rural healthcare
facilities allowed:

•

• Shifting to more efficient financing system based on the amount of the population served
instead of the previous inefficient approaches based on the capacities of the medical
institutions such as number of personnel, area of facilities etc.;
Increasing budgets of the primary medical and sanitary aid (PMSA) due to reduction of
expenses for the secondary healthcare system. For instance, in Fergana province the relative
share of PMSA’s expenses was increased from 13.6% of the total expenses for the
healthcare to 24.3% in 2003. United personal standard was increased from 367 UZS in 1999
to 1,615 UZS in 2003;

• Allocating more resources for serving women and children due to use of sex and age factors

used to determine budget required for the PMSA’s facilities;

• Providing financial sustainability, autonomy and flexibility in management of funds and

personnel;
•
Increase motivation of PMSA’s suppliers in providing medical services to the population;
• Rationalization of the cost structure of budget funds. For example, share of costs allocated
for personnel’s wages and salaries was reduced from 56.3% in 1999 to 54.8% in 2003 but
funds allocated for medicines during the same time period were increased from 5.2% to
6.2%. Share of inefficient expenses dealt with payment of allowances for children that are
under 2 years.

243

UNDP- UZB -03 #00054196

Feasibility Study Report

Therefore, proper conditions have been established for the primary healthcare system, and new
system of medical aid based on the general medical practice is functioning successfully. This allows
having an efficient and quality medical aid for rural population in the nearest future.

The similar objectives on strengthening the primary healthcare system are being implemented by the
on-going ‘Health-2’ Project (2005-2009). Total number of RHCs equipping within the framework of
the project is 2,315 RHCs. It has to be emphases that according to the Resolution of the President of
Uzbekistan #PP-569 dated 18.01.2007 “On measures aimed to efficient usage of Japanese
Government grant provided for improving the primary healthcare system in Tashkent and Djizzak
provinces, and to improving medical nurses’ education”, 114 RHCs located in Tashkent and Djizzak
provinces will be equipped with medical equipment in 2007-2008. In total 3,106 RHCs.

1.2.1. Statistical data based on sizing and types of RHCs

According to the Annex, page 61

1.2.2. Statistical data based on location of RHCs

Number of RHCs located in mountain areas is 20-25% roughly.

Number of RHCs located in remote and isolated areas is 10% roughly.

1.3. How many RHCs are equipped by “Health-1’ and ‘Health-2’ projects?

Total amount of RHCs equipped within the framework of the ‘Health-1’ project is 677. Among
them 214 RHCs are located in Fergana province, 121 RHCs – in Syrdaria province, 89 RHCs – in
Navoiy province, 121 RHCs – in Khoresm province, and 108 RHCs – in Karakalpakstan.

Total amount of RHCs planed to be equipped within the framework of the ‘Health-2’ project over
the country is 2,330 (see Table 1).

Note:

1) In total 401 RHCs do not meet the requirements of the WB among the 1,803 RHCs surveyed by the engineers of the JPIB. 2) In all RHCs
surveyed in the country, cut off the power during daytime takes place, there is a problem with heating RHCs ‘ premises due to lowa pressure of natural gas except the
Navoiy and Kashkadaria provinces. Regular cuts off of power make impossible use of medical equipment as well as cold water supply where it is made using power
driven pumps.
