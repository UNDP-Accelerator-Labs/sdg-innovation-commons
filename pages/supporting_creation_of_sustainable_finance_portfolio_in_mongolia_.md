## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

• Portfolio approach for holistic understanding: The adoption of a portfolio approach offers a significant advantage by allowing multiple stakeholders to comprehend the holistic picture and recognize interconnections within a system. This approach mitigates siloed thinking, linear causality, and reductionism, preventing oversimplification, fragmentation, and suboptimization of the system.

• System mapping reveals interdependencies in SDG Financing portfolio: System mapping exercises has uncovered over 80 interdependent elements crucial to enhancing SDG financing in the Mongolian context. Our analysis categorized these elements into five main domains: government revenue, government expenditure, mobilization of private resources, alignment of business practices, and ODA grants and loans.

• Important role of SDG Impact standard &amp; reporting: The SDG impact standard &amp; reporting emerged as a critical cross-cutting element across the five domains. Recognizing the low level of understanding of these standards in the country, we established a strategic partnership with a local university. Together, we are developing a resource center within the SDG finance portfolio to build and enhance local capacity for SDG impact management and measurement.

• Need for skill development in system management and leadership: The process highlighted a deficiency in skills related to system management and leadership among COs, including A-lab members. It is imperative to cultivate new skill sets within this organization, focusing on the ability to plan, organize, coordinate, and monitor activities and resources within a complex system. Additionally, there is a need to empower members, foster a shared vision, and create an environment conducive to learning and innovation to bring about positive change in complex systems.



> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Our work has not yet scaled

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

Management has not yet reached a final decision regarding the individual or team to oversee the SDG finance portfolio, given its cross-sectoral nature. It is likely that A-lab may need to continue facilitating the portfolio for an additional half-year.

## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

By integrating system thinking workshops, future foresight exercises, and cross-disciplinary brainstorming sessions, we encouraged diverse perspectives and creative problem-solving. This interplay of innovation methods, new data, and unusual partners enabled us to uncover insights that transcended conventional boundaries. We discovered patterns and opportunities that would have been overlooked using traditional approaches alone, ultimately enhancing the impact and effectiveness of SDG Financing portfolio initiatives.
