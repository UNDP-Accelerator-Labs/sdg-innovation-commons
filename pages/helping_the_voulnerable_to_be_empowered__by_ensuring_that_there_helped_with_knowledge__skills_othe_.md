> Brief description of the innovation

Women empowerment program: this is where women in groups of five (5) can be given start up capital for instance a thousand each with interest of 20% spread through six months that is those that are are already in business even those that may want to venture into any business. the payment can be designed in such a way that every week they pay a Fifty Kwacha (K50) towards the amount they borrowed. at the end of 25 weeks they would have serviced their loan of One thousand two hundred (K1,200) that is for that cycle. during the cycle, those that want to save can do that by any amount, at the end of the cycle they can claim what they saved. the saving encourages sustainability and ensuring that even when they have finished servicing their loan, they would have also saved their own money. Therefore, before starting another cycle they to be given what they saved during that period.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

when people have got access to economic resources such as funds, those that are already in business will be able to expand their businesses and those that are not will venture into any kind of business they wish to in order to generate income. Such empowerment's enables individuals to be self sustaining and innovative.  Any economy in the world that should thrive should have small and medium businesses. This is the only way poverty can be alleviated at grass root level. People must be able to generate their own wealth in their various localities. By so doing, it will encourage many people to venture into various income generating activities thereby empowering themselves and others where they carry out their businesses.

> Technical Feasibility

First and foremost, it is aimed at women that are already in various small businesses, empower them with such assistance as time goes on there able to grow their small businesses by venturing in other income generating activities because their resource base would have been boosted. Also this is meant to be a revolving kind of activity, as people pay back, the resource envelope grows thereby allowing others to benefit also from the same program. The weekly recoveries are meant not to burden them with a huge amount to pay at a goal hence making it easy for them to service their loans. In the long run, having seen what others are doing, that would encourage many people to come on board. Women by the way have limited access to finances because of various reasons such as collateral, which in most cases they don't possess. Such an initiative would help them as there will be no collateral needed but they have to identify themselves with groups and with members that they know they will work well with without defaulting meaning members should be able to know each other for easy tracing.

> Anticipated Social Impact

In the light of the economic challenges that we are faced with as a country where very few people are in formal employment we need to create a cadre of people that are able to stand on their own to be able to sustain themselves. Therefore, we should have as many people as possible to venture into various small and medium enterprises as this is the only way we can possibly empower the masses at grass root level.This also includes youths and differently abled because they usually have difficulties in accessing the resources being talked about economically.
