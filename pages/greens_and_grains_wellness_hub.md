> Brief description of the innovation

A restaurant specialized in preparation and delivery of Healthy plant based food, specially tailored to meet clients health needs. We also have various recipe books customized for various Health conditions and age groups. Lastly we offer various Health education classes on Nutrition and Healthy meal preparation in collaboration with various Health personnel including Doctors and Nutritionists.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The food will be prepared and delivered on order at a cost. In like manner, the recipe books will be produced on order as well. Additionally, the health Education seminars will be also be hosted at a fee from each participant.
Being a plant based restaurant, we will require a daily supply of fresh vegetables, Herbs, fruits, grains and nuts. This will call for formation of networks with local fresh food stores and farmers i.e Tuesday Market, Melissa super market et.c. Furthermore, we need to partner with local food courier services e.g Ulendo eats for delivery for our meals to clients. Furthermore, as earlier mentioned, the Health Education sessions will demand collaboration with Health experts including  Medical doctors and Nutritionists. These partnerships will contribute greatly to the growth of these exiting businesses and services thereby broadening the beneficiary pool.
Our target market includes  1.Individuals within our reach who are on a restricted diet and experiencing challenges in managing their dietary needs and 2. Individuals who are looking to transition to eating Healthy.
The challenge prize will help grow our business as we would be able to acquire equipment that will enhance our production, e.g an Industrial blender, a display freezer or specialized storage for keeping maintaining the temperature of the food during transportation.
Research has continued to reveal that a plant-based diet is more sustainable, as it causes less harm to the environment than a meat-based diet. For example, a report published in The Lancet in 2019 concluded that a dietary shift toward plant foods and away from animal products is vital for promoting the health of our planet.

> Technical Feasibility

The restaurant will be stationed at a central location preferable town or any place close to town for easy access to clients. Preparing food and delivery will be on order basis to avoid wastage. We will create an online recipe book tailored to the local setting to which our clients can purchase online or request for a hard copy again to avoid excessive us of paper and wastage in the light of environmental protection. The Health Education Seminars will be organised systematically e.g quarterly.
The restaurant will begin with two staff (chefs) who will be joined by others as demand increases. From inception, advertising through social media and branding will be our methods for sourcing clients. We would also like to partner with hospitals through referrals and renting food canteens and tuck shops.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Health is one of the most important assets that we all need to guard at all times. As important as it is, unfortunately it can come and go by quickly. However, there are some steps we can take to avoid losing it. One is to EAT HEALTHY. Research continues to show that plant-based diet can be beneficial in not only improving our health but also restoring health.
With the coming of the COVID-19 Pandemic, one thing that was clear is that state of one's health was is a great determiner infection and sickness. The presence of underlying conditions and low immunity seemed to be directly proportional to the severity of the infection. As the virus continues to evolve we do not know what awaits us ahead. Having this background in mind, we know from research that a plant-based diet has been associated with improving immunity against disease and infection hence improving and restoring health.
By providing healthy food options for our clients, we are making it easier for them to make healthy choices. By offering health education services, we are creating an enabling environment for our client to make more informed decisions about their Health.
When we have healthy citizens, the nation benefits in many ways e.g productivity and performance is enhanced in all aspects of life leading to growth such as economic growth.
