In 2018, the total global vanilla trade was worth USD 1.47 billion, whereby 1kg of vanilla was valued between USD 350 - 500.  Madagascar was the major exporter amounting to 60.1% of total exports, while Indonesia's exports stood at 5.56%. Indonesia's capacity to produce vanilla made it clear that Malaysia was also capable of producing and exporting high grade vanilla.  Yet, the vanilla industry is wrought with problems: issues of ethics and sustainability, low yield at 40% - making vanilla one of the world's scarcest goods.    The vanilla farm pioneered by Kairos Agriculture is the first smart vanilla farm with patent technology in Malaysia that integrates Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), big data application, nanotechnology and machine learning to sustainably grow vanilla. Its objectives are to:  1. grow sustainable and ethically produced vanilla crops  2. leverage agritech to encourage more young people to venture into agriculture business  3. create jobs and improve the living standards of B40 and disadvantaged groups.   Kairos partners with local institutions for research to improve and enhance crop farming towards optimum quantity and quality of vanilla planting.  The group also has a portable module that can be built in schools collaboratively to help the school sustain an independent income stream with a buyback scheme.  It also adopts various energy and resource-saving technologies that ranges from: 1. chemical-free planting, with the use of recycled crop residue as compost 2. production of Efficient Microbes (EM) with the fruit waste collected from local wet market 3. automated irrigation system that is activated according to the weather 4. rainwater harvesting system and full-LED usage in the farm.
