Achievements Report

Nature-based solutions are catalysts for
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). The SDGs portray a vision of hope for
humanity – a world with no hunger or extreme
poverty, and a world of good health, quality
education, gender equality, clean water,
affordable clean energy and decent work for
all. To achieve these goals, we recognized
that we needed to transform our cities, our
societies, our economies, our consumption
patterns, and most of all, our relationship with
nature, both below water and on land.

FOREWORD

Dear readers,

It is a great pleasure to introduce this new issue of
Development Pathways, a report that takes stock of the
work of UNDP and our partners in promoting sustainable
development in Egypt.

Development is about people. And Development Pathways
brings people and their stories to the forefront—the
people we work for and the people we work with.

In this report, we showcase the many positive and tangible
results achieved through UNDP projects throughout the
country over the past four years.

Behind these achievements lie the day-to-day stories,
determination and inspiration of our beneficiaries, our
government counterparts and development partners.
These achievements have been made possible by the
support, generosity, and investment of our donors.

For more than 50 years now, UNDP has supported the
Government of Egypt in its development pathways,
providing essential policy support to help identify
innovative approaches and mechanisms to secure the
dignity, prosperity and wellbeing of Egyptians while
conserving natural resources for future generations.

Over the past four years we have focused on three main
areas: Inclusive Growth and Innovation; Climate Change
and Environment; Social Inclusion and Local Development.

Throughout this period, we have worked tirelessly to
support job creation and address inequalities to ensure no
one is left behind.

In 2019 alone, we helped create over 260,000 jobs for some
of the most socially vulnerable people in Egyptian society.
By the end of 2022, we hope and expect this number to
have increased to 700,000 jobs.

In partnership with MSMEDA, we have provided technical
support for disbursing 2.9 billion Egyptian pounds as
loans for financing MSMEs. In this way, even despite
the COVID-19 pandemic, we have helped over 630,100
enterprises and created over 960,000 job opportunities.

UNDP was quick to take the technical lead in supporting
Egypt’s socio-economic response to the pandemic, and
we continue to assist in recovery efforts by helping the
government build resilience through securing jobs and
livelihoods and rapidly expanding social protection
networks, systems, and programmes.

As part of our continuous efforts to ensure no one is left
behind, last year we commissioned a ground-breaking
study on the situation of women with disabilities in Egypt
– the first-ever study of this kind in this country and one of
very few such studies worldwide. The findings will help us
to increase the effectiveness of our actions to protect the
most vulnerable in society.

To help Egypt reduce its GHG emissions, UNDP has
supported the Government in its efforts to shift to
renewable energy. In 2018, for example, our Energy
Efficiency Programme helped Egypt to achieve annual
energy savings of 24.5 MkWh, which is enough to provide
power to 8,000 households.

We are also very proud of our projects to save energy. For
example, our project ‘Egypt-PV’ won the “Low Carbon”
category of the 21st annual competition “EI Awards” for
the year 2020 organized by the British Energy Institute,
recognizing the outstanding projects in the energy
sector from both governmental and private institutions
at the international level. This year we are supporting the
Government of Egypt in preparations for hosting COP27.

After a 10-year pause, UNDP Egypt is now again producing
the Egypt Human Development Report. We will continue
investing in human development and putting people at
the very centre of the development process.

UNDP Egypt has now adopted its new country programme
for 2023-27. #FutureSmartUNDP will continue responding
to the socio-economic and health impacts of the pandemic
on people and institutions in Egypt, supporting positive
recovery and building forward better.

And we will continue to invest first and foremost in people
as the main cornerstone of development, working closely
with our many national and international development
partners to improve the lives of millions of Egyptians.

Yours,

Alessandro Fracassetti
UNDP Resident Representative

PARTNERSHIPS FOR
DEVELOPMENT

Empowering MSMEs

Micro, small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of every economy. UNDP has a
strategic partnership with the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Development Agency dating
from 1993. Together we have been supporting the creation of an environment for MSMEs to thrive
as millions of Egyptians work in MSMEs, directly or indirectly, and many more depend on them
for their livelihoods. Our strategic partnership has encouraged growth of MSMEs, job creation (for
women and men, young people and persons with disabilities), and alleviated poverty throughout
Egypt and helped businesses access financial and non-financial services, adopt new technologies
and innovations and also adapt to challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Between 2018-2021 through UNDP-MSMEDA Partnership: 22.5 billion

Egyptian Pounds were disbursed as loans for financing MSMEs which reached
799,530 enterprises and created 1,408,254 job opportunities.

UNDP Egypt’s long term strategic partnership with MSMEDA, has been building
people’s capacities to run their own businesses. Between 2017 and 2020,
MSMEDA held 1,023 training workshops on

entrepreneurship which reached at least 17,139

beneficiaries.

MSMEs Directly Empower Women: 44% of the total number of

beneficiaries are women and 45% of the total were in the age group
between 20 and 35 years old.

23

Development Pathways Issue 2 : Achievements Report
Gender Equality and Women
Empowerment

Women’s participation in all areas of society is essential to make big and lasting
change. Women and girls make up a disproportionate share of people in poverty
and are more likely to face hunger, violence and the impact of disaster and
climate change.

UNDP integrates gender equality into every aspect of its work. Gender
equality and women’s empowerment is a guiding principle that applies to
everything we do.

UNDP Egypt has been recognized with the Gold Gender Equality Seal, a
certification process led by our headquarters.

Building Women’s
Capacities

In 2021, UNDP in partnership with the National
Council of Women (NCW) and the Central Agency
for Public Mobilization and Statistics launched a
“Violence against Women with Disabilities” case
study, reaching out to nearly 6,000 women in
Takaful and Karama. This process helped build
the capacities of 137 women researchers from
the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and
Statistics (CAPMAS), including 17 sign language
interpreters.

24

Strategic Partnership Towards Women
Empowerment

Development Pathways Issue II : Achievements Report

UNDP is working with MSMEDA to mainstream gender equality and women empowerment principles
across MSMEDA’s policies and programmes. The number of women beneficiaries of financial services
reached 50%. In 2019, MSMEDA received the Gender Equality Seal Award from the National Council
for Women and UNDP, becoming the first public institution in Egypt and in the Arab States to receive
such award, and second at global level. The process of obtaining the Gender Equality Seal transformed
MSMEDA, improved its gender balance policies and led to a higher number of jobs created for women.

Prioritizing Women’s Protection

In 2019, UNDP carried out a high-impact awareness campaign in
collaboration with the National Council for Women and the Embassy
of Sweden in Egypt titled ‘The Sailing Boats’ to observe the 16 Days
of Activism against Gender Based Violence campaign. Sixteen
different boats branded with 16 key messages against violence
against women were set to sail in the River Nile, advocating that
everyone should stand up for women and girls' rights.

25

Environment and Climate Change

Egypt recognizes the growing pressures and social vulnerability from climate change and
environmental degradation. The poorest and most vulnerable feel the brunt of climate change
and its impact the most, suffering from lack of access to and water, energy and other natural
resources, while facing disproportionate impacts from toxic industrial effluents. UNDP supports
the Government of Egypt to achieve the national “Vision 2030” and achieve the SDGs by 2030 by
helping to protect natural resources, biodiversity and supporting green growth.

Our strategic partnership with the Ministry of Environment supports efforts to meet international
obligations deriving from global environmental agreements.

26

Development Pathways Issue 2 : Achievements Report

Egypt was able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions due to energy efficiency, renewable
energy, sustainable cities and transport initiatives, with an emphasis on more integrated energy,
mobility, land use, and waste management solutions. UNDP supports the Ministry of Environment
and partners with climate change mitigation and adaptation, also campaigning to have Egypt’s
biodiversity recognized as a central asset for tourism.

Clean and Affordable Energy

To help Egypt reduce its GHG emission, UNDP supported the shift to renewable energy and
in 2018, 1.487 million tons of annual GHG emission were averted. The UNDP Energy
Efficiency project in partnership with the Ministry of Electricity, helped Egypt achieve annual
energy savings of 24.5 MkWh, enough to power 8,000 households.

27

Catalyzing the Use of Solar Energy

Egypt is ready for a faster energy transition to roof-top PV systems. The “Egypt-PV” project-
piloted over a period of several years by UNDP, the Ministrry of Trade and Industry, the Industrial
Modernization Center, the Ministry of Electricity, and the Global Environment Facility lead to
a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in support of Egypt 2030 Strategy for Sustainable
Development and the SDG Agenda.

Development Pathways Issue 2 : Achievements Report
Sustainable Transport for Sustainable Cities

In 2019, UNDP supported pioneering bike-sharing scheme at Fayoum University to revive cycling in
Egypt and offered university students a cleaner and healthier mode of transportation that reduces
emissions & traffic congestion. 14 KM of separated bicycle lanes in Fayoum governorate were created,
along with 12 bike stations across the city and campuses.

Early in 2020, the high-quality bus system pilot project under the Sustainable Transport Project was
inaugurated, marking a new business opportunity for private sector investments in the transport sector
to increase the use of public transportation and reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gases
emissions. The new lines connect the cities of 6th of October and Sheikh Zayed to the Cairo University
metro station and provide a new model in public and mass transportation in Egypt.

30

Climate Change

UNDP has been an advocate for mainstreaming
climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts
into Egypt’s national development plans to fulfill
Egypt’s commitments towards the international
environmental conventions.

In 2019, UNDP continued to support the government
of Egypt with adaptation to climate change and
protection of the low-lying lands in the Nile Delta from
the expected sea level rise, a national priority as per
the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.

111 government employees
have participated in a
6-month training programme
40% of them are women from
different government sectors
in 8 coastal governorates.

A climate resilient Integrated
Coastal Zone Management
(ICZM) Management has also
started with the participation
of all government entities.

Using early warning systems, supported
by UNDP, the government of Egypt has
made unprecedented preparations for
the medicane storm (Mediterranean
Hurricane) that hit Egypt for the first time
in March 2020, and reduced casualties
and economic losses.

2020 witnessed the start of construction works of the
soft dike system to protect the low-lying lands in the Nile
Delta from sea surges during strong storms. Construction
was completed for the first 51 Kms out of the targeted
69 Kms of the dike system, in partnership with Ministry
of Water Resources and Irrigation and funded by the
Green Climate Fund (GCF).

Multilateral Environmental Agreements

In 2019, UNDP supported Egypt’s international environmental commitments
by increasing institutionalized monitoring and reporting through the
production of 2 major reports:

• The Sixth National Report on Biodiversity: To help decision makers track
performance on international biodiversity commitments and mainstream
biodiversity into productive sectors including tourism & education.

•

The first Biennial Update Report to UNFCCC.

32

Development Pathways Issue 2 : Achievements Report

ECO-EGYPT

UNDP supported the Government of Egypt to promote eco-tourism through the presidential 3-year
initiative “Eco-Egypt”, implemented by the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency and UNDP with GEF
funding.

The concept aims to encourage sustainable, responsible tourism for
travelers and reconnect them with Egypt’s many ecological sites and
protected areas. As of 2019, ECO EGYPT turned into a nationwide three
years campaign led by Egypt’s Ministry of Environment under the
auspices of His Excellency President Abd El Fattah El-Sisi. This campaign
led to the adoption of several decrees by the Government, including
banning of single-use plastics in South Sinai. The first Red Sea Marine
Conservation campaign in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
was launched during 2021 as part of the ECO EGYPT campaign. The
main aim of this campaign is to help protect the Red Sea’s marine and
coastal environment.

33

Protected Areas

UNDP supported the establishment of the Green Fayoum Sustainable Destination Programme to
transform Lake Qaroun and Wadi el Ryan PA into an International Standard Green Destination for
Ecotourism.

People living in protected areas are key to the areas’ protection. Improving their livelihoods has always
been a fundamental pillar of nature conservation.

2,400 women

were trained on the production,
packaging, and marketing of local goods.

24 recreational

boats in Wadi Rayan PA
were established for
local communities.

Development Pathways Issue 2 : Achievements Report

“Mainstreaming Conservation of Migratory Soaring Birds into Key Productive Sectors along the
Rift Valley/Red Sea„

We have been helping to raise awareness about the importance of ensuring safe migration of
soaring birds. We have been showcasing how certain sectors such as eco-tourism, agriculture,
energy and waste management could benefit from the presence of these birds.

35

Policy Support for SDGs

UNDP supported the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, through Mainstreaming,
Accelerating and Policy Support (MAPs) to identify accelerators and integrators for achieving the
SDGs in Egypt – this contributes to the development of the overall guiding framework of the National
Sustainable Development Agenda (NSDA) 2030. UNDP also supported long term analysis tools that
support decision making with policies for sustainability and resilience.

By using long-term forecasting, UNDP advanced integrated policies and quantitative evidence necessary
for Egypt to deliver on the SDGs. It proposed several policy packages to accelerate economic growth and
improve social and environmental outcomes. The introduction of the International Futures forecasting
methodology (IFs) and UNDP’s support to foresight contributes to better, future-ready policies.

UNDP provided technical support to the Voluntary National Review 2018 and 2021 development
process. UNDP also provided technical inputs on the impact of COVID-19 on the SDGs, progress on the
SDGs, the impact of 2016 reforms, COVID-19 and the stimulus package on the Egyptian economy.

People at the center of
Development:
Egypt’s Human Development Report 2021

Egypt Human Development Report 2021

UNDP embarked on developing the EHDR
2021 titled, “Development, a right for all: Egypt’s
pathways and prospects” The report provides
an in-depth analysis of key human development
issues such as investing in human capital, women
empowerment, and economic reforms. covering a
critical period in Egypt’s modern history (2011- 2020).
The Egypt HDR 2021 is based on the Declaration on the
“Right to Development”, adopted by the UN General
Assembly in 1986. The Report provides an analytical review of the policies
adopted and implemented during this period and their impact on Egyptians.
Building on those findings and on the Government Action Programme, it puts
forward a set of policies for the future that would further boost the process of
human development that Egypt has initiated.

Development, a right for all:

SDG Financing Strategy to Achieve Egypt’s
NSDA for 2030

UNDP’s value-added lies in its integrator role. With 4 partner UN agencies, UNDP leads the
development of the SDG financing strategy, the costing of priority SDGs, and the Development
Finance Assessment (DFA) which represent the key building blocks of Egypt’s Integrated
National Financing Framework (INFF).

37

Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic

COVID-19 has exacerbated existing inequalities and
created new ones, severely hitting the most vulnerable
people. The COVID-19 pandemic bears the potential to
hinder Egypt’s achievements in relation to macroeconomic
stability and sustainable development. These impacts may
be particularly severe in rural areas and amongst persons with
disabilities (PwDs) and the elderly, due to lower levels of literacy or
lack of access to resources, services and information. Marginalized
women also face a higher risk of COVID-19 infections and fatalities, loss
of livelihood, and increased violence.

Fighting the virus and limiting its spread are needed, while creating more
gender-balanced employment and income generation opportunities
to mitigate the potentially devastating effects COVID-19 may have
on vulnerable populations, and on the achievement of the Sustainable
Development Goals. UNDP worked to ensure that the virus does not reverse
the progress Egypt has achieved while preparing for the future Egypt wants

post-pandemic.

UNDP responds to the pandemic by:

Accelerating the pace of
digital transformation

Supporting micro, small
and medium, enterprises

Protecting citizens
from the virus

Supporting the
national strategy for the
empowerment of women

Supporting COVID-19
diagnostic and testing
efforts on the national
level.

38

New Normal Post COVID-19

UNDP supported efforts to build internal capacities in key ministries to understand changing contexts
post COVID and their implications on the future.

UNDP also led the international policy dialogues on important post COVID issues, such as the future of
big data use for evidence-based policy making, and the future of skills in the digital era and the role of
technical and vocational education (TVET).

Safeguarding Livelihood

UNDP works to support the government of Egypt in developing digital financial solutions to help limit the
spread of COVID-19 and alleviate its socio-economic impacts among the poorest and most marginalized.

To ensure no one is left behind, UNDP supported the provision of health equipment as an essential
input to the Government’s COVID-19 response.

UNDP also supported the Ministry of Social Solidarity (MoSS) by making use of the extensive networks
of the “Waai programme” to advocate for correct behavior vis-a-vis COVID-19 pandemic in the most
disadvantaged communities.

To support MSMEs faster and stronger recovery from the pandemic, UNDP built the capacities of
MSMEDA beneficiaries through e-learning materials, ensuring the effective transition of their products
and services online. UNDP in cooperation with MSMEDA also conducted the largest national survey on
the impact of COVID 19 on MSMEs, data analysis and recommendations were sent to the Ministry of
Planning and Economic Development to inform evidence based post COVID policy making to mitigate
impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable.

Artificial Intelligence, New Vanguards

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 7 million Egyptians with disabilities are among the most
vulnerable groups.

UNDP supported Egypt’s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology
(MCIT), to launch a sign language chatbot, for persons with hearing disabilities.

Wasel is an automated testing service that uses
chatbot and artificial intelligence technology as the
platform for the persons with hearing impairments to
test their symptoms through the online application.
UNDP works to help people with disabilities become
agents of change and facilitates their access to public
services, including employment, education, and health
services.

I have used the Wasel Chatbot service in times
of COVID-19 and have found it very beneficial.
It provided me with some really useful
information.

Protecting the
Planet from
the Virus

In 2020, a Central Treatment Facility (CTF) for medical waste treatment was inaugurated in
Gharbia governorate, with the Ministry of Environment, for sterilizing medical waste without
generating harmful emissions, consisting of persistent organic pollutants internationally banned
under the Stockholm Convention.

The CTF safely treats 5 tons of medical waste every day. The medical staff were trained on
medical waste separation. 5 model hospitals were equipped with the appropriate hardware
to enable the best sorting of medical waste. An online training programme on medical waste
management was developed and will be extended to all waste management officers in Egyptian
hospitals.

Medical Solutions through Digital Technology

Digital technology is enabling rapid responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing the tools of the
digital age, UNDP has joined Telecom Egypt (WE) in the ‘One Million Free Consultations Initiative’
in cooperation with AlTibbi, to provide 1 million remote consultations for free. The initiative is
considered the largest free medical consultation campaign via an online platform, voice calls and text
messages. The initiative has succeeded in offering digital consultations, quarter of which were about
COVID-19.

New Trends -
Accelerator Lab
The Future is Calling, We
are Answering

The speed, dynamics and complexity of today’s social,
economic and environmental problems are fundamentally
different. In 2019, UNDP built the world’s largest and fastest
learning network on sustainable development challenges,
the UNDP Accelerator Labs.

Launched earlier in 2021, the UNDP Accelerator Lab in
Egypt acts as an incubator for the future on sustainable
development challenges and as a catalyst for change,
providing local partners with new approaches to address
development problems unleashing the power of local
innovations, collective intelligence and experimentation.
The Accelerator Lab is working on tackling climate change,
poverty reduction and governance aspects to address
social and environmental challenges to accelerate progress
towards the SDGs and the achievement of Egypt’s Vision
20230.

Working hand in hand with a broad range of common and
uncommon partners, the Accelerator Lab was able to: test with
inclusive solutions, sustainable product innovation, and the
power of solution media; commence the exploration journey
by collaborating with the Small Grants Project & the Desert
Research Center to tackle the issue of salinity in Sidi Salem
and come up with innovative ideas for climate smart crops;
and form new collaborations with different organizations to
leverage the ecosystems and youths’ collective intelligence to
support in mapping local grassroots solutions across Egypt.

Solutions Mapping with Greenish & Rise Egypt

Collective intelligence, solutions mapping, and experimentation is part of UNDPs new offer to
governments and the innovation ecosystem.

For instance the UNDP Egypt Accelerator Lab collaborated with Greenish and Rise Egypt during the
first Greenish environment festival to:

Identifying and mapping out local grassroot innovations across Egypt that address
environmental challenges.

Mobilize a network of solutions mappers across Egypt .

Informing how collective action can be used to learn, connect, and scale local solutions.

During the Lab’s First year, they deep dived into learning what is working and what’s not when it
comes to strengthening socio-economic resilience of vulnerable communities in Nile-delta, affected
by climate change.

Awards

Recognition, whether external or internal, helps UNDP stay on track and keep improving.
Below are some of the awards and acknowledgments we received in 2021.

UNDP Egypt obtained the Gender Equality Seal, transformed MSMEDA and coincided with
improvement in MSMEDA gender balance for beneficiaries, corresponding to more jobs being
created for women.

UNDP Egypt Migratory Soaring Birds project was granted the 2020 Energy Globe Award, for stopping
birds from colliding into wind farms. The project shows Egypt’s promise to protect nature.

UNDP is leveraging internationally recognized eco-tourism certificates to simultaneously increase
standards and attract more visitors and enhance both financial sustainability and protection at the
site who are applying for certificates.

UNDP has helped establish the Green Fayoum Sustainable Destination Programme to transform
Lake Qaroun and Wadi el Ryan PA into an International Standard Green Destination for Ecotourism.
People living in protected areas (PAs) are key to the areas’ protection. Improving their livelihoods
has always been a fundamental pillar of nature conservation.

In 2019, UNDP project on “Mainstreaming biodiversity into the tourism sector”, in partnership with
the Ministry of Tourism, Chamber of Divers and Egyptian Tourism Agency led Egypt to be the first
country in the Middle East to apply the green diving certificate for the protection of the reefs.

Egypt was the only country selected for UNDP support to the Ministry of Environment to successfully
complete trials of UNDP-procured machines with technology that does not use ozone depleting
substances for three very small users (VSU). The best practice will be transferred to Nigeria and then
globalized. Phase-out will continue in 2020, in Polyurethane foam manufacturing, also contributing to
reducing GHGs emissions technologies.

Egypt PV project was awarded the British Energy Institute Award for Low Carbon Category in
2020.
