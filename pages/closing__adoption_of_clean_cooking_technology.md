## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1. There is a lot of duplication of efforts in interventions for adoption of clean cooking technologies.  2. There is lack of assessments of interventions-lack of lessons sharing across partners in energy space.  3. Although efforts are escalated to find sustainable cooking technologies, lack of coordination among partners hinders meaningful impact on the system (chipping at an iceberg).  4. Opportunities are available to upscale gas for cooking but unavailability of small gas cylinders on the market provides no option to people with low incomes to consider gas for cooking.  5. Biogas digesters as cooking technology for cooking at household level is seen as a lot of work to sustain since it requires daily feeding (with animal dung or waste)-which women find it labour intensive and in some instances gross.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

Yes, a financial barrier since the budget for the activities was from a project that was implemented by a government ministry under the NIM modality. As such, the ministry scraped off the activities on justification that similar research was done already although a report on research findings has never been shared with UNDP.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Social media data:  - To understand latest trends in information/perception around innovative cooking technologies and attitudes towards gas for cooking. - To collect up to date information on gas promotion campaigns, offers on sustainable cooking technologies. Primary project data: - Updated research done by partners on cooking fuels and cooking technology efficiencies  These two data types were key in providing up to date information on status of the initiatives for cooking technologies and peoples’ interest on the same.    In-depth interviews: - To understand perceptions and social-economic factors that promote or inhibit adoption of tarpaulin biogas digesters in rural areas. The interviews helped us collect updated and comprehensive compared to the data when compared to the data from the evaluation report  Observation:  Appreciate the status of the installed biogas digesters after years since installation. Data recorded via observations supplemented responses given during interviews. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

The innovation methods helped in understanding who is doing what on sustainable cooking technologies, user preferred technologies, areas in the system that were already responding to interventions. The methods helped identify focus areas, quick wins and challenging areas requiring change.
## Partners

> If applicable, what civil society organisations did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

N/A

> If applicable, what academic partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Mzuzu University: assessing UNDP funded biogas digester implementation to understand technical and social parameters around adoption and lack of adoption.

> If applicable, what private sector partners did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Tetra Tech: understanding the system (existing initiatives etc), jointly writing a concept for applied research.

> If applicable, what government partners (and related institutions) did you actually work with and what did you do with them?

Ministry of Energy: provided institutional knowledge on the implementation of digesters, provided contact list of beneficiaries to be involved in the assessment.

> Relating to your answers above: who of the partners listed were new and unusual partners for UNDP, and what made them special?

Tetra Tech, they are running a nationwide intervention on improving access to clean cooking fuels and technologies. They were therefore essential to provide recent data on status of use of sustainable cooking technologies in terms of what works and what doesn’t.
## End

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn & generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

The interaction with Tetra Tech as an unusual partner allowed deep appreciation for system issues since they have collected vast data on the topic but also gone into areas that are not traditionally paid attention to on the issue and that is assessing efficiency of cooking technologies before they go on the market.
