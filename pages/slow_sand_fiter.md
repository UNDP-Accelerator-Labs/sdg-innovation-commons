Description: These filters are excellent for communities where there is no access to more efficient technologies. Through different layers of sand and gravel, the contaminants are filtered out through the final duct. It is important to emphasize that this type of filter is not effective for viruses, so other purification options should be considered beforehand.

Interesting feature: It is easy to do and can be done without great technification.
