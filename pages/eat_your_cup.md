Did you know that you can eat your coffee's cup?  🥤 Plastic waste from the food and beverage industry is occurring in large quantities every day, which is a global waste issue. However, at present, a group of change maker in Lao PDR came up with a creative and a tasty products.  ☕ "Eat your cup" is a product from a Lao youth that aims to create a change in the consumption of coffee in an environmentally friendly way. Latdavanh or "Marina", a Lao youth who is only 18 years old, makes "eat your cup" and won the 2nd runner-up prize in the Toyota Incubation Program in 2022.  🍪Marina invented this edible cup by using ingredients like chocolate cookies and green tea, which are all plant-based ingredients, without using eggs or butter, so that everyone can eat it, whether they are vegan or vegetarian. This cup is able to receive hot drinks up to 100c and cold up to -20c for a period not less than 1 hour. The good thing about using an edible cup is that you can drink your favorite drink and still eat the cookie later. In addition to filling the stomach, it also helps reduce the amount of waste that may be made from toxic materials such as plastic.  🌎 Also, Marina is a young person who likes and is obsessed with doing business for the society and is also a volunteer of the Zero Waste Laos, an organization that works on raising awareness about environment. Also, "Eat your cup" was born from Marina's experience when she went to study in Japan, where one day her Japanese sister took her to make plant-based cookies and it was a delicious cake. Marina came back to adjust the recipe and experimented with it until it became an edible cookie cup.  🍪Currently, Marina herself is developing a recipe to overcome various limitations and aims to release "eat your cup" soon so that her customers can try it and enjoy a delicious cup with their favorite coffee. The long-term goal of "eat your cup" is certainly to preserve the good environment. But in addition, she also set the goal of sharing the profits in future youth development projects.
