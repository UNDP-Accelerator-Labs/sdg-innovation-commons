> Brief description of the innovation

A Robust and contemporary idea for producing assorted vegetable seedlings  for sale to small holder farmers using Bamboos for the structures of production. Depend purely on local materials to support hortculture sector. Providing technical and back stopping support to the farmers in all their hortculture  crop production at every stage of the process and help in the development  of the value chain systems across the Country. Creatation of the hub for all provincial fruits production through support to the education sector with a concept of planting fruit trees to enhance the nutrition , healthful eating for children and food security

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Our innovativation will reduce the cost of doing business for small holder hortculture  farmers. The cost of seeds have gone up hence the need to use non soil medium technology to produce the seedlings using local structure materials to support the primary producers  small holder farmers for them to meet the off takers 's demand .Our 10 years if extensive research shows that small holder farmers have a serious challenge of producing nursery seedlings for conventional, traditional and exotic vegetables and Grafted  fruits trees.Our concept  feeds into meeting the challenge faced by small holder farmers for the purpose of creating comprehensive supply chain system, generate sales for sustainability and continue to add value to the process by providing high quality  seedlings and support services

> Technical Feasibility

In response to the overwhelming demand.Our concept uses a pull side of business which begins and ends with the markets. We want to build two more shed houses  35x9 metres one for production of 120, 000 Assorted  vegetable seedlings every 6 weeks cycle for sale to small holder farmers as a feed stock into their hortculture primary production , Aggregation and supply. One shed House  to be used for planting rootstocks plants for grafting and budding of various fruit trees to be sold to small holders market at  Country level  using the provincial Agriculture offices for the purpose of networking and information dissemination  and networking. The main objectives are to promote local fruit production and reduce the dependence syndrome of importing each and every fruits consumed in the Country from South Africa

> Anticipated Social Impact

The innovation will provide positive impact to both small holder farmers , off tankers and the consumers. The innovation will create and improve consistency in the capacity of small holder farmers who will produce high quality  and volumes to meet the off takers demands
