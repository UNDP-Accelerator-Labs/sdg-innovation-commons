## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to know what action local youth think they can take in collaboration with other local stakeholders to address air pollution issues in their communities. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If the local youths are trained with innovative methodologies from UNDP Accelerator Lab and Youth Co: Lab, such as sense-making, grassroots innovations mapping, system thinking, co-creation, and experimentation, they will be able to develop creative solution on food system.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

- other

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

A youth social innovation challenge in Chaing Rai province will be launched to create engagement of local youth along with multisectoral stakeholders to identify local innovations and empower youth to develop and test their solutions. The youth social innovation challenge will utilize a wide range of innovative methodologies from UNDP Accelerator Lab and Youth Co:Lab such as sensemaking, grassroot innovations mapping, system thinking, co-creation, experimentation, among others to gain insights on air pollution issue and potential solutions. The Challenge will consist of 5-day training workshops for local youth, mentorship, a local pitching, experimentation period, sharing forum, and a final presentation session. Stakeholders including local government authorities, private sector, academia and experts, as well as local communities will be involved to foster a sense of ownership and localization process.
