## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Improving Public Service Delivery in Rural Area
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the communities in remote rural areas do not enjoy the same quality and accessibility of public services provided by Public Service Centers as in city centers and different approaches for public service delivery should be developed to address the needs of the remote rural communities. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

In the previous learning cycle, we have identified the main challenges of public service delivery in rural areas. Building on the results of the previous cycle, we have identified entry points to test our learning questions that would improve the quality and accessibility of public service in remote rural areas. Accessibility of public services, especially via digital means as it has been actualized by the COVID19, is a top priority of public administration reform. The establishment of public service centers throughout the country aims to improve the accessibility of public services. As the practice shows, the existing approach in setting up Public Service Delivery Centers and service delivery approaches need adjustment for the rural settings as standard approaches tested in urban settings may not reflect the needs of the rural population. Therefore, in rural areas, there is a need for increased citizen engagement.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> 

Public Service Centers are usually located in the district centers and for some local communities, the travel distance can be up to 150 kilometers. One Public Service Center with just 5 staff serves on average around 149,000 people (95k-200k) in pilot districts. The share of services provided online is negligible (around 2 percent of all services provided).

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.


<div class="group">


> 

People, especially, elderly and women, are not well aware of the types of services provided by the Public Service Delivery and have to travel long distances and bear costs associated with such travels to get information, receive the service or be directed to another agency.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

In the first learning phase, the AccLab was able to identify the challenges of local communities in accessing the public service via issue mapping, surveys and open communication. A new communication channel was tested to provide users with an opportunity to share their feedback and possible solutions. Building on this learning, the AccLab will move to the second learning phase and continue its partnership with the UNDP project on "Improving Public Service Delivery and Enhanced Governance in Rural Uzbekistan" to create a space for exploring and testing solutions on improving the quality and accessibility of public services to rural communities. Solutions to be tested include 1) the application of student volunteering mechanism at the Public Service Centers, 2) co-designing the services of mobile public service delivery units, and 3) increasing the public engagement via gamification. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

#AccLab @UNDP_Uzbekistan is making public service delivery more accessible in rural areas through co-design, volunteering and gamification.
## Challenge classification
## Partners

> Who are your top 5 partners for this challenge? Please submit from MOST to LEAST important and state Name, Sector and a brief description of the (intended) collaboration.

</div>



<div class="group">


> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

AccLab will be closely working with the Agency via the joint UNDP project on Improving Public Service Delivery in Rural Area to explore, test, and communicate the learnings from the experiments. The Agency will create a space for experimentation, and if experiments will reach intended outcomes, will take on the approach for the scale-up through the country

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

University students will be engaged as volunteers and interns at the Public Service Centers at pilot locations to increase the accessibility of services by vulnerable groups (elderly, people with disabilities). Volunteers and interns will undergo special training on skills development, including at a summer school, and work with local communities, especially with vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and people with disabilities, to raise awareness, provide basic training on using the online tools for accessing the public services and facilitate the process of request application for public services.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Our learning question is to identify the most effective design and approaches to improve the quality and accessibility of public service delivery in rural settings conducting the portfolio of experiments - engaging volunteers, utilizing mobile units, and gamification. 

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Explore
- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Co-creation will be used to identify the most demanded public services for the mobile units and how people would like these services to be delivered in remote communities. The learnings from the application of this method will inform the revision of existing models of providing public services. Gamification of public service will be used to increase citizen's awareness, usage of public service technologies, and enhance citizens’ engagement. We will be pioneering the usage of this approach in the area of public services.  Proof of concept for engaging volunteers and interns in the Public Service Centers will be a demonstration of viable ways of engaging youth in the public sector to improve the customer's experiences, decrease the digital divide and increase coverage of the services. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Time spent for obtaining service, level of satisfaction, availability and accessibility of most needed services; Demographic breakdown of customers, geographical distribution of users, potential demand analysis (based on location and demographic data), availability of social objects (schools, etc.).
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The Agency for Public Service will be closely engaged in this learning cycle and if proven successful, this approach will be replicated in other regions and nationwide. Ultimately, the beneficiary of this work will be citizens of rural communities.
