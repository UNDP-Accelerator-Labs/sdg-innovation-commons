> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

How can we design a "Community of Practices" that can bring women from different backgrounds to freely share their stories, voices, experiences, and to support each other?

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF the design thinking approach is deployed in designing the CoP, THEN more women are engaged, THEN the needs of women are better reflected at the platform, THEN the platform can become more resourceful.

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

I used the design thinking approach to map a MURAL board. There are 3 calls conducted with different STEM women. The result of the exercise has presented rich information about their needs and resources. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

#women

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

#women

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 month

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity has a low risk

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time and Partnership
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

Design thinking a powerful tool to engage diverse statekholders to act together, and to identify needs of people. 

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

This was a small experiment that I did not face any obstacles. The only challenge is to bring women from different countries to work on together across different time zones. 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

My experiment is helping the UNDP's regional platform STEM4ALL to build a Community of Practices with STEM women. My experiment helps STEM4ALL better identify challenges of STEM women, and to engage with them. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Women in the STEM fields across the world

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

There should be dedicated person to follow up with participants in building a Community of Practices. This requires constant community engagement activities. 

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Absolutely yes. 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

This is a design stage where we had lots of "sense" and "explore". I would continue working with Solutions Mapper to map resources of STEM women, and to explore good practices of STEM women with Explorer. 

> What surprised you?

Women were very much engaged in group activities using the board I designed. Despite the large group of people, people were able to listen to each other, and to generate ideas together.
