Executive summary

This document and its Annexes provide a Framework with
guidelines for conducting structured national consultations
on frontier technologies. The primary goal is to elevate
voices from people in places that are often overlooked in
global settings, by gathering perspectives from individuals
across countries on the perceived benefits and risks related
to the development and deployment of these technologies.

Frontier technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), are
projected to become some of the most transformative
technologies in human history. AI for example, promises
profound benefits to human development across a variety of
sectors from healthcare to agriculture to the arts. However, it
also bears known risks, like further discriminating against
underrepresented or disenfranchised communities; and both
the risks and benefits are often unevenly distributed.

This Framework builds on the understanding that there is an
untapped wealth of relevant knowledge and perspectives in the
Global South that should be considered in the development and
regulation of frontier technologies at the global level. It aims to
bridge a key tension: comparability of perspectives between
countries and specificity within. It proposes a logical sequence
of questions, based on localized technological examples, an
appropriate selection of modalities for discussion, and a series
of steps that need to be taken to engage representative
samples of stakeholders. Specific measures are also suggested
to ensure an inclusive approach that strikes a balance between
diversity and representativity of perspectives.

6

By following these guidelines, organizations that are interested
in conducting national consultations on frontier technologies
should be able to demonstrate global relevance to their
national counterparts, while ensuring a strong focus on local
specificities and their implications. The consultations should
typically help initiate dialogues between groups that may not
otherwise interact.

The Framework was developed by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) Accelerator Labs Network
and a graduate student team from Columbia University's School
of International and Public Affairs (SIPA). Research was
conducted in January and February 2024 by the SIPA team, and
a first prototype was piloted in March 2024 with UNDP
Accelerator Labs in Morocco and Paraguay. The pilots focused
on AI as a frontier technology. Extended rationales for the
methodology are presented in an associated report, “A
Framework for National Dialogues.”

Introduction: how to use
this Framework

The purpose of this Framework is to facilitate the organization
of national consultations on frontier technologies to both foster
dialogues in new places and with different stakeholders, and to
diversify inputs to global conversations on these technologies.
The Framework builds on the understanding that there is an
untapped wealth of knowledge and perspectives in places that
are often overlooked in global settings, and the desire to gather
a wider range of opinions, hopes, and fears from people around
the world to ensure that benefits are not monopolized by a
concentrated few, while risks and harms are absorbed by
others.

Frontier technologies are driving advancements across digital,
physical, and biological domains. However, there is global
inequity in the design and implementation of these
technologies (Work Intellectual Property Organization 2022).
Simply put, the Global North is more productive than the Global
South in technology infrastructure, development, and ethical
guidelines. The Global South typically lacks sovereignty in
producing, using, and developing frontier technologies.
Currently, countries in the Global South encounter hurdles such
as lower incomes, high poverty rates, and limited educational
opportunities, which pose challenges to integrating frontier
technologies (De Asis 2023). These obstacles include knowledge
gaps, resource constraints, language barriers, infrastructural
limitations, and legal and political challenges. AI adoption for
example, is less advanced in the Global South than in the Global
North, where these technologies are more readily integrated
into various sectors. Moreover, the Global South's participation
in global AI governance dialogues is often limited (AI Advisory
Body Interim Report 2023). Technology in the Global South, in
many ways, is operating under the paradigm of the Global
North.

Project
At a glanceThe United Nations (UN) is actively working to address these

developments. The organization has the unique power to
convene diverse stakeholders to discuss topics like the
governance and ethics of frontier technologies, and their
alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For
example, the UN’s Global Digital Compact has the objective to
establish a common agenda to close the global digital divide and
ensure that the benefits are accessible to all (UN Tech Envoy
2024). In addition, the UN has recently released a policy brief for
its Quintet of Change vision for a UN 2.0 (Policy Brief 11: Un 2.0
2023); the UN Activities on AI Report showcases nearly 300 UN-
led projects across all SDGs (UN Activities on AI Report 2022); a
High-Level Advisory Body on AI advises the UN Secretary-General
(AI Advisory Body 2024); the High-Level Committee on
Management (HLCM) has adopted a set of Personal Data
Protection and Privacy Principles for the organization (UN CEB
2018); and UNESCO leads global discussions on AI Ethics, setting
a standard that is adopted by all 193 Member States (UNESCO
2023).

This Framework aims to assist, streamline, and maximize the
impact of consultations at the country level. It also aims to help
structure the outputs so that they can be compared across
countries, which can then be fed into more global conversations.
The Framework generally draws inspiration from the “Post-2015
Development Agenda: Guidelines for Country Dialogues,” which
aimed to gather inputs for a shared global vision of a desirable
future from a broad base of civil societies, marginalized groups,
and others previously left out of conversations on development
priorities (UNDG. 2012).

This Framework was piloted together with the UNDP Accelerator
Labs in Morocco and Paraguay in March of 2024. The aim was to
test the logic of its line of questions, as well as different
consultation formats suitable for civil society and experts.

Framework Overview

Guidelines and recommendations are provided for a three-stage
process:

1.
2.
3.

Preparing a consultation
Conducting a consultation
Processing the insights from the consultation

These are addressed to consultation facilitators and should be
considered with respect to local specificities. Given the growing
presence of frontier technologies in various aspects of life and
the rapid pace at which they evolve, it is important to think of this
Framework as a flexible foundation[1] for structuring
consultations, rather than a prescriptive checklist of action items.
The guidelines and recommendations should be adapted for
specific frontier technologies (like AI or bioengineering), national
contexts, or technological maturity, to ensure situated, inclusive,
and insightful conversations.

The Annexes of this document contain more detailed information and
guidance derived from pilot consultations that were conducted in
Morocco and Paraguay. These materials can be used as needed.

[1] Throughout the Framework and its Annexes, [frontier technology] is written in
brackets to suggest it should be replaced by the specific technology of interest (for
example AI or bioengineering).

10

Stage 1: Preparing a Consultation—Measures
to Ensure a Successful Consultation

To prepare a national consultation on frontier technologies, it is
recommended to:

1. Specify the [frontier technology], or technologies, that the
consultation will focus on.

2. Localize the [frontier technology] by conducting thorough
background research, using both primary and secondary sources (for
example expert interviews and desk reviews), to understand the
following:

a.The local [frontier technology] landscape and its current
developments, as well as locally used systems, apps, or tools
in which the [frontier technology] is embedded.
b.The stakeholders and sectors that most influence and
connect to the [frontier technology]—whether they contribute
to the development, deployment, or regulation of the
technology, or whether they are impacted by its use.

3. Select one or several appropriate modalities for engaging in
meaningful conversations with stakeholders.

4.Determine relevant outreach strategies.

Discussions on frontier technologies can tend to be abstract. For
example, questions like “how can AI be deployed in an ethical
manner?” or “how is AI going to change the nature of work?” typically
beg specification of what is meant by AI and who it is likely to impact.
To make things more complicated, technology can sometimes go
unseen. It can be embedded in complex systems, and its implications

11

and importance can go unrecognized. The infrastructure it requires
and the means through which it is deployed can also vary across
locations and sectors.[2]

Facilitators should be prepared to localize technological examples for
participants to engage meaningfully in the consultation process,
meaning they should identify and be ready to discuss situated
instances or applications of the technology. For example, AI may be
localized in a consultation with students by focusing on text
generation applications that might support them in their exams.
Whether or not they use such applications, this should help them
reflect more meaningfully on the benefits and risks of the
technology.

Facilitators should also select appropriate modalities for the
discussion, and consider what actions need to be taken to engage
and empower a plurality of stakeholders. For example, it is important
to level people’s awareness of the profound influence technology has
on various aspects of life to facilitate active participation from diverse
stakeholders.

Finally, facilitators should determine relevant outreach strategies,
based on the stakeholder groups they want to engage with, and the
modalities they plan to use.

[2] Our pilot consultations in Paraguay revealed that participants’ prior knowledge
significantly shaped the direction of the conversation and influenced the kind of
questions one could ask. It is recommended that facilitators come prepared with ways
of framing the technology to level the conversation.

12

Aligning consultations with ongoing initiatives

Where and when possible, national consultations on frontier
technologies should be aligned with other existing initiatives.[3] The
goal is to involve as wide a diversity of stakeholders as possible, to
ensure a representative and inclusive process. Leveraging
established networks and relationships can not only save time and
resources; it can also enhance the reach and visibility of the
consultation. Aligning the consultation with other existing initiatives
can also raise awareness and interest in the [frontier technology]
landscape among local partners who may not have had much prior
exposure to it.

Facilitators should first clearly articulate the importance and goals of
the consultation to local partners. A strategic approach can be to
align the consultations with their existing initiatives and priorities.
This means identifying areas where the goals of the consultations
can overlap[4]. Stage 2 of this Framework leaves room for
stakeholder-specific questions, which can be used to ask questions
on topics that are aligned with their ongoing projects.

Further, whenever local partners are involved in the consultation
process, they should be invited to co-create the outreach strategy.
This should allow for alignment on what information is shared with
participants to avoid creating pre- and potentially mis-conceptions
about the [frontier technology]. The collaborative approach should
not only facilitate gathering diverse perspectives from a variety of
stakeholders; it should also help strengthen local partnerships.

[3] Our pilot consultations in Berkane, Morocco, were seamlessly integrated into an
existing collaboration between UNDP and the city to establish a digital twin city.

[4] Our pilot consultations in Arroyos, Paraguay, were held with staff of a local sugar
plantation with which UNDP had an ongoing collaboration for projects around
sustainable development.

13

Localizing consultations

This Framework builds on the idea that all voices should be equal
when it comes to shaping our collective technological future.
Including people with little to no prior understanding of the concept
of [frontier technology] is just as important as including
internationally renowned experts. Laypersons may be exposed to the
[frontier technology] in some shape or form without realizing it, and
even if they are not, the [frontier technology] may have direct
applications (and implications) in their everyday activities, which they
likely have views on. Identifying these applications is key to preparing
a meaningful conversation. Indeed, failing to localize technological
examples can lead to stalled conversations, because of uncertainties
about what the [frontier technology] entails. Participants may only
respond with short answers if they are unsure of the conversation
topic. This makes it difficult to capture meaningful perceptions.

Facilitators should:

Map common instances or applications of the [frontier
technology] that are relevant in the context of interest prior to
the consultation. These can later be used as proxy examples to
help situate the conversations and ensure that the often-abstract
notion of [frontier technology] is more relatable to participants—
especially in cases where participants are not aware of any
specific instances or applications of the [frontier technology]. An
example of a proxy for AI (and its description) could be: “Chatbots,
especially those that you can interact with on WhatsApp or other
websites are one example. When you send a text message to an
organization asking a question, it usually is not a person on the other
side, but a computer. That is AI.”

Carefully consider linguistic variations that exist within and
between countries, particularly in how they relate to the [frontier
technology] and people’s interactions with it. For example, while
the official language in a Latin American country might be

14

Spanish, street surveys or consultations may be conducted in areas
where other languages are predominantly spoken. To ensure an
inclusive and accessible process, facilitators should be aware of the
local vernacular used to describe the [frontier technology] and be
prepared to use it.

It is recommended that facilitators identify at least three to five
localized examples prior to a consultation, keeping in mind that
certain proxies can introduce biases into the consultation. For
example, using drone surveillance as a proxy for AI can negatively
influence perceptions. Examples should be diverse and balanced.
Further, it is encouraged to work with co-facilitators who are fluent in
the relevant local languages, as this tends to improve the quality of
the data collected, since linguistic nuances are more accurately
captured.

More proxy examples for AI can be found in Annex 5: Menu of Questions
and Definitions. This list should provide an idea of how frontier
technologies can be defined in simple terms and use the examples that
are relevant in that country’s context.

Identifying stakeholders

Capturing nuanced perspectives on frontier technologies while
drawing a balance between representativity and diversity requires a
methodical approach. Global conversations are generally enriched by
the diversity of inputs, while national or sub-national conversations
likely require that the perspectives captured are representative of the
country’s population. Facilitators should:

Understand current changes related to the [frontier
technology], by studying ongoing socio-economic developments
related to the deployment of [frontier technology] in the country.
This can provide a foundation for identifying stakeholders who are
directly involved in or impacted by the [frontier-technology].

15

Pay attention to sector-specific applications of the [frontier
technology], by investigating the sectors, industries, and areas
where the [frontier technology] penetrates most—and where
policy and regulatory interventions are most advanced. This can
be done by scanning news sources, or through interactions with
relevant local partners.

Identified stakeholders can then be separated into the following
non-mutually exclusive groups:

Stakeholders involved in the development of the [frontier
technology]. This includes key actors responsible for
developing, implementing, and regulating the [frontier
technology] and its derived applications. This might include
government bodies driving policy agendas, international private
sector companies developing the [frontier technology], and
other relevant entities shaping the [frontier technology].

Stakeholders focused on understanding the deployment of
[frontier technology]. This includes stakeholders with a deep
understanding of the connections between [frontier
technology] and its societal implications. This might include
media outlets disseminating information, activists advocating
for ethical [frontier technology] practices, social scientists
studying [frontier technology]’s socioeconomic effects, and local
NGOs offering community insights. The impact of [frontier
technology] on these stakeholders may be direct or indirect.

Stakeholders impacted by the [frontier technology]. This
includes stakeholders whose interests or livelihoods are directly
impacted by the deployment of the [frontier technology]. This
encompasses diverse groups, from labor unions representing
workers impacted by automation to farmers pushed towards
precision agriculture practices to any other communities or

16

individuals that experience the tangible effects of [frontier
technology] deployment. It is important to acknowledge that
these stakeholders might not have direct access to, or
interaction with the [frontier technology]. They may also have
more limited knowledge about its implications, while still being
subject to its impacts. Typical examples include refugees,
women’s organizations, and micro, small, and medium
enterprises (MSMEs). Engaging with these groups is important
to ensure truly inclusive dialogues on [frontier technology] and
policy outcomes.

In addition to these points, it is important that facilitators be
considerate of potential elite biases, and to respect social, cultural,
and personal sensitivities and priorities. Creating an inclusive
environment for participants can require, for example, providing
daycare options for mothers to be able to participate in
consultations. Recognizing knowledge gaps and levelling
participants’ understanding of the [frontier technology],
acknowledging the influence of unexpected stakeholders, and
understanding power dynamics are also important factors to
ensure the effective engagement of a plurality of voices.

More detailed examples are provided in Annex 6: Strategies to Account
for Culture Contexts and Diversity

Choosing the right modalities

A mixed-methods approach is generally recommended. The exact
modality should depend on the participants’ expected level of
understanding of the [frontier technology]. In general, facilitators
should be prepared to hold spontaneous conversations with
individuals that have different levels of technological literacy. Below
is a non-exhaustive list of consultation modalities and suggestions
about when to use them (Table 1).

Facilitators should further ensure that different age and gender groups
are adequately represented, whatever the chosen modality. Inclusivity is
crucial to gaining diverse insights. When setting a time and location for
any given consultation modality, facilitators should account for potential
barriers that certain participants might face—whether physical, social, or
psychological—for example, women caretakers who might have to bring
their children to the consultation, people with disabilities who might
require specific access to the location of the consultation, or simply
people’s availability at the time of the consultation.

A step-by-step guide to holding a focus group is provided in Annex 3.
A step-by-step guide to conducting a survey is provided in Annex 4.

19

Determining the Outreach Strategies

Two important steps in designing an appropriate outreach strategy are:

Stakeholder mapping: It is important to first identify the type of
stakeholders that will be contacted to participate in the consultations.
The stakeholders can be mapped along two dimensions, which define
the extent to which they require means to be contacted, and the
degree to which they require resources to participate (see Step 1 in
Annex 2)

Figure 1 - Indicative stakeholders mapped on a matrix of difficulty in participating
and being contacted for consultation

Linking stakeholder types to modalities: Drawing from the modalities
and stakeholder approaches outlined above, an outreach strategy
should be aligned in coordination with local partners. It should be
noted that the list shown in Figure 1 is not exhaustive and local teams
may be familiar with different approaches that can ensure an
inclusive and effective engagement strategy.

20

Step 2 in Annex 2 outlines suggested outreach strategies, modalities, and
types of participants that can be reached, in accordance with the stakeholder
mapping as suggested in Step 1.

Figure 2 - Matching modalities to participants' ease of participating and being contacted

Stage 2: Conducting a Consultation—Three Step
Sequence

To conduct a consultation that ensures comparability of perspectives
between countries while maintaining specificity within, it is
recommended to follow a three-step sequence:

1.
2.
3.

Level knowledge and concretize the conversation;
Gather general perceptions; and
Gather stakeholder-specific perspectives.

21

Figure 3 - Three-step sequence for a consultation

Every perspective is important, and all voices should be equal when it
comes to shaping our collective technological future, no matter the level
of technical proficiency or personal identity. However, prior knowledge
can greatly influence the flow of a consultation, as well as its outcomes,
so it is important to build on common ground.

Facilitators should level knowledge and concretize the conversation to
bring it to the level of understanding participants have of the [frontier
technology]. Depending on their familiarity, it may be necessary to
integrate the localized technological examples identified in Stage 1 and
agree on one or several proxies for the [frontier technology]. These
proxies will help concretize the conversations throughout the rest of the
consultation.

22

Facilitators should then gather general perceptions on the benefits
and risks of the [frontier technologies], using the coalesced
concretized examples. The idea is to collect general sentiment data
that is comparable across stakeholder groups and contexts.

Finally, facilitators should gather stakeholder-specific perspectives to
capture more nuanced information on the local [frontier technology]
landscape and how challenges and opportunities are perceived by
members of specific sectors, such as the public sector, private sector,
or academia.

If considered carefully, these steps should ensure that perspectives
collected are both specific to the context in which they are collected,
and comparable across contexts.

Annexes 3 and 4 offer step-by-step guide for conducting a consultation for
focus groups and surveys/street consultations.

Leveling knowledge and concretizing the
conversation

Two types of questions can be asked to level the conversation. These
may differ according to the localized examples of the [frontier
technology], the consultation modality, and other contextual factors.
However, the general structure is as follows:[5]

Questions on identifying the technology. For example:

Have you heard about the term [frontier technology]?
If the participant has not heard of the [frontier technology]:

[5]AI is used as a frontier technology to illustrate the questions in this section. For AI proxies,
refer to Annex 5 which holds examples that can be substituted as in the case below.

23

Have you heard of the term [localized or proxy example]? (for
example, “robots” in the case of AI)
After specifying an example, the facilitator notes to the
interviewee that [localized or proxy example] can also be
described as the [frontier technology].

Questions to concretize with a recent example. For example:

What does this [frontier technology] do?
In the past few weeks, can you think of a situation in which you
interacted with this [frontier technology] (or [localized or proxy
example])?

Biometric identification: If your phone unlocks when it sees
your face (facial recognition) or scans your fingerprint, instead
of typing in a password, it's in the computer or your phone has
learned the shape of your face and/or your fingerprints. That's
a form of AI.

Alternative methods of prompting and assessing participants'
knowledge of the [frontier technology] include:

In a prepared consultation such as a focus group, facilitators can
ask participants to bring photos of what they believe best
represents the [frontier technology]. Such printed materials can
prove helpful to get participants to agree on best proxies to use
throughout the rest of the consultation.

Depending on the type of [frontier technology], it may also be
possible to conduct a short activity wherein participants interact
with the [frontier technology]. This can greatly facilitate the
concretization step.

24

Facilitators should get participants to agree on one to three concrete
examples of the [frontier technology]. This will help foster meaningful
discussions between participants and ensure more substantive and
structured responses to the ensuing general perceptions and
stakeholder-specific perspectives questions. If participants cannot
come up with or agree on specific examples, facilitators should
introduce the localized or proxy examples identified prior to the
consultation (for example robots or chatbots in the case of AI).

Indeed, if participants express having little or no knowledge of the
[frontier technology], facilitators should quickly guide the conversation
towards the localized or proxy examples. It may happen that
participants have heard of common [frontier technology] applications
used in their line of work or in their country. They may have even
interacted with them. However, they may not be aware that these
applications leverage the [frontier technology].

If participants are more familiar with the [frontier technology], the
applications they mention can be used as concrete examples. Further,
when the consultation modality includes multiple participants (like in a
focus group), it can be interesting to confront different concrete
examples to check for general familiarity.

If participants are experts on the [frontier technology], the concrete
examples they mention might be highly specific, for example to their
line of work. These could turn out to be difficult to connect to broader
conversations on the social and societal implications of the [frontier
technology]. Facilitator should make sure expert participants keep this
in mind throughout the consultation.

25

Gathering general perceptions

This step focuses on collecting comparable data across stakeholder
groups on the perceived benefits and risks related to the development
and deployment of the [frontier technology]. The goal is to understand
overall sentiments towards the [frontier technology]. Facilitators
should prepare a series of high-level, open-ended questions that can
be asked to all stakeholder groups, whatever their prior knowledge of
the [frontier technology]. These questions should aim to capture a wide
variety of qualitative insights and should provide a chance for
participants to comment on identities and groups that they believe
could be disproportionately affected by the [frontier technology].
Typical questions include:

Who in your view stands to benefit the most from the development
and deployment of the [frontier technology]?

Who in your view is the most at risk of undesirable or rebound
effects of the development and deployment of the [frontier
technology]?

How might (or does) the [frontier technology] benefit you?

What kind of undesirable or rebound effects do you think you
might personally suffer from the development and deployment of
the [frontier technology]?

Whose responsibility do you think it is to protect people from these
risks or to make sure that the benefits are shared equitably?

While the exact number of questions asked is left to the discretion of
the facilitator, it is recommended to strike a balance between positively
(benefits) and negatively (risks) oriented questions to not bias
participants’ sentiments.

Annex 5 holds more questions for the “perception” section.

26

Gathering stakeholder-specific perspectives

This last step focuses on collecting more nuanced data on specificities
in the local [frontier technology] landscape. The goal is to capture
situated knowledge and perspectives on the [frontier technology].
Facilitators should prepare more targeted questions, tailored to
specific stakeholder groups or to locally relevant topics. These
questions should not only focus on how the [frontier technology]
impacts, for example, a specific sector, but also on how these specific
impacts might affect broader segments of the country’s population.
The 5Ps of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a
useful framework for prompting these wider considerations. The 5Ps
are:

People: participation in daily life, social inclusion, data privacy,
health outcomes
Prosperity: economic opportunities and labor markets, poverty,
education
Planet: environmental protection, sustainability, resource, and
clean water access
Partnership: national and international cooperation; global
connectedness
Peace: safety, security, privacy, governance, and institutions

Before each consultation, it is recommended to consider how to
prompt each of these dimensions in each stakeholder group, rather
than focusing on a single, different dimension with each group—even
though some groups may of course offer richer insights on certain
dimensions than others. This should facilitate comparisons across
groups and geographic locations (countries), providing a structured
way to assess how different people handle similar effects of the
[frontier technology]. It is also recommended to ask questions on who
is responsible for mitigating these effects. This should help derive
meaningful insights that can support targeted interventions and policy
recommendations.

Finally, it can also be relevant to focus questions on topics related to
other local initiatives. For example, if the organizers of the
consultation have ongoing projects related to the [frontier
technology], questions in this section could be targeted to gain more
specific insights. This flexible approach ensures that the information
gathered throughout the consultation is aligned with the unique
local [frontier technology] challenges and opportunities.

For additional questions, refer to the Stakeholder-Specific section in
Annex 5.

Stage 3: After the Consultation—Processing
Insights

To process the perspectives of participants on the perceived benefits
and risks related to the development and deployment of the
[frontier technology], and to ensure that their voices are properly
elevated, it is recommended to properly:

1.

2.
3.

Collect and compile the information shared during the
consultation;
Structure the analysis; and
Disseminate the data and results.

By following the three steps in Stage 2, and by appropriately
structuring the analyses of data the collected, it should be possible
compare perspectives between countries, while maintaining the
specificities within. This dual focus not only enhances the relevance
and utility of the findings; it also ensures that the specific conditions
and needs of individual countries can be addressed in global
conversations on frontier technologies.

Collecting and compiling the data

Facilitators should capture as much detail as possible on the
perspectives shared by participants. The greater and more precise the
information collected in situ is, the richer the analysis and insights that
can be channeled to global forums will be. This information should
then be digitized to facilitate future analyses and dissemination of the
raw data.

It is recommended that facilitators record the following elements:

What was expressed: Any views expressed vocally. An exact
transcript of the answer, to as far an extent as possible, is ideal.
Moreover, adding notes on when local terms were used to refer to
specific topics is important to highlight when these carry a
sentimental dimension (e.g., a positive or negative association).
Future viewers of the transcript may only review a translated
version, which can obfuscate these nuances.

Who expressed it: Note down the name or ID of the participant
next to the views they shared. This information will be helpful for
intersecting trends across professions and demographic identifiers
(see Stage 3). Personally identifiable information should be
removed before any data is shared outside of the consultation
team, as per the UN’s principle on Privacy and Data Protection.

How they expressed it: This includes the location of participants in
the room; whether they shared their perspectives during an open
discussion or whether they were directly called on; and whether
there were any interruptions during the discussion.

Which step in the consultation this was expressed: There may be
instances where participants return to earlier questions to provide
more details. In this case, facilitators should note down how the
discussion on that topic re-emerged as this may be a valuable
insight.

29

Facilitators should also keep track of the concrete examples of the
[frontier technology] agreed upon by participants. Overall, no
condensation of views should take place at the consultation stage. It
is recommended to record and transcribe conversations, provided
the data will be handled with the highest standards of data
protection.

Finally, it is imperative to follow national data protection and privacy
laws (when these exist), and it is also strongly recommended to
adhere to the UN Principles on Personal Data Protection and Privacy.
This generally implies that, at a bare minimum, informed consent is
collected from participants to use the perspectives they share as
data; that the data collected be anonymized by stripping all unique
identifiers (for example, names, addresses, etc.); and that
participants be informed of the purpose of data collection and
possible dissemination of the information.

This is largely covered through the step-by-step guides in Annexes 3
and 4.

Structuring the analysis

Separate analyses can be conducted for each of the three steps of
the consultation:

Step 1: it can be interesting to provide a summary of how the
levelling and concretizing unfolded. For example, did concrete
examples emerge from conversations with, or between
participants? Or were pre-identified localized or proxy examples
used? Were these concrete examples disputed by participants?
Did some resonate more than others, etc.

30

Step 2: the bulk of the analysis should focus on deriving sentiment
from participants’ responses. For example, are participants
generally more positive or negative about the [frontier
technology]? Other elements can be coded, depending on interest
and richness of participants’ responses to the high-level questions.
It can also be interesting to intersect the sentiment analysis with
participants’ demographic attributes.

Step 3: qualitative coding should be privileged. A grounded theory
approach is recommended to stay as true as possible to
stakeholders’ perceptions, but the 5Ps of the SDGs can provide a
helpful framework for structuring the insights. Further, it can be
interesting to compare insights across stakeholder groups. For
example, how do different groups perceive the economic
opportunities (Prosperity) offered by the [frontier technology]?

If the collected and compiled dataset is very large, resulting for
example from an online survey, then machine learning models like
Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for sentiment analysis,
entity extraction, and topic modeling—provided they are available in
the language of the consultation. In any other case, the gold standard
remains manual qualitative coding (or ethnographic coding). This
generally provides analysts a much deeper understanding of their
data, particularly when local knowledge and expressions are recorded.
Ideally, multiple raters should code the data and a high inter-rater
agreement score should be ensured.

31

Below is an example of sentiment coding for responses to the
question: “Imagine your life without the [concrete example of AI].
What would it be like?”

WHO: PERSON ID

Positive

Participant #4

Gender: male

Negative

Disseminating the data and results

When and where possible, an open data approach is highly
recommended. This implies not only publishing the results of the
analyses, but also the raw data collected during the consultations
—along with clear documentation on how it was collected. At a
minimum, facilitators should ensure that the gathered insights
are shared back with participants, so they can benefit from the
learnings of the consultation. This can be done for example, by
directly sending them a summary report (or any similar format).
In addition, as mentioned

32

above, participants should receive clear information prior to the
consultation on what is intended to happen with the information they
provide. This includes knowing which institutions will or will not be
informed by the results of the consultation, so as not to develop any
false expectations. Facilitators should clearly announce on whose
behalf the consultations are being held and that information may be
shared with various entities to inform wider conversations on the
[frontier technology].

It is equally recommended that results be shared with the wider civil
society. This can contribute to increasing awareness of the [frontier
technology] in the given country. Facilitators should also consider
different modalities for disseminating the results, based on their local
networks and experiences. These can include a blog post series, the
use of the local media landscape, including local and national
newspapers, radio stations and TV outlets. A collective effort is
recommended to ensure the streamlined and collaborative sharing of
consultation insights. For example, third parties particularly interested
in the topic, including innovation labs within governments or the local
[frontier technology] landscape, can be involved in the process of
dissemination. These efforts may also contribute to wider community
building around the [frontier technology].

Through the consultations, different and important voices are made
visible, which may normally not interact with each other. The potential
here is to unite a variety of stakeholders, leveraging the insights
gleaned from consultations to enrich a broader national dialogue
around frontier technologies.

Annexes

ANNEX 1: Country and Stakeholder Mapping

Categorizing Countries in the Global South
As we examine the global distribution and impacts of frontier technologies, the term
“Global South,” while useful for highlighting shared developmental challenges, can be
overly broad and obscures the distinct cultural, economic, and technological
landscapes of a wide variety of countries (Arun 2020). A more refined grouping could
enhance the specificity and efficacy of policy frameworks and development strategies
to analyze the perspectives gathered and later compare them with other countries:
·Development Status: Countries should represent a cross-section of lower-, middle-,
and higher-income countries (UNDG 2012).

Regional Representation: Countries should represent all regions of the world,
approximately proportional to regional size (UNDG 2012).
Technological Infrastructure: Classifying countries in the Global South based on
their digital and technological infrastructure and their readiness to adopt new
frontier technologies and aligning this with their existing capabilities. This could
range from foundational to advanced technological innovation needs. A good
reference for this classification could be the UNDP AI Readiness Assessment (UNDP
2023).
Sector-specific Commonalities: Aligning countries that face similar challenges in
sectors such as healthcare, education, or agriculture could foster resource and
knowledge sharing. This approach would facilitate regional collaboration focused
on common problems, leveraging frontier technologies like AI in contextually
relevant ways.

Once the country has been situated across key factors such as those listed above,
stakeholders within the country can then be categorized. Several categorization
methods are highlighted below, and these should all be considered alongside the
country-level factors.

model. Photo Credit: Sciences Po Media Lab.

The AI Loop, developed by Gourlet et al (Big Data and Society 2024), is a methodology for
situating society along the AI production and implementation lifecycle (loop). This
approach conceptualizes AI as being built on data which is generated from the world at
large. This is then fed into models which are applied in the real world - creating more data
and looping back. Within this loop, there are distinct roles that members of society play in
understanding what AI means, establishing AI models, and then building systems that
integrate these models. Around this loop is the regulatory world that bounds the AI loop
through government legislation. This model offers an interesting sociological perspective
that was used to conduct a consultation process in France, using a limited scope of
stakeholders, to gather concerns and perspectives on AI. These concerns and perspectives
were then categorized into key archetypes that were situated within the AI loop. Similar
approaches were taken with a survey conducted in the UK by the Ada Lovelace and Alan
Turing Institutes (June 2023), wherein major application types of AI were put to
interviewees to derive cases with the highest perceived benefits and risks.

38

Policy Stakeholders Within the AI Ecosystem
In the AI ecosystem, a diverse array of policy stakeholders plays essential roles in shaping
how these technologies are developed, implemented, and governed. Here are some
possible mappings:

Governance Institutions: These bodies have regulatory authority, policy-making power,
and access to financial resources.

International Organizations: These bodies like the UN navigate global technology
standards, and facilitate international collaboration, and provide a platform for sharing
best practices.

Technology Companies: These include both startups and established tech firms both
domestic and international that drive technology development and influence policy
through innovation and industry standards.

Academic and Research Institutions: These institutions conduct essential research and
contribute to policy discussions on ethical implications and technological impacts.

Advocacy and Civil Society: These social and human rights organizations wield significant
moral and advocacy power, often mobilizing public opinion and influencing policy
decisions.

Media: These outlets have the power to shape public opinion, influence political
discourse, and hold institutions accountable.

Technology Literacy Levels of the Population
To ensure that the consultations are effective and inclusive, it's essential to group
participants based on their technological and digital literacy levels. This nuanced approach
helps tailor discussions and consultations, ensuring that all voices are meaningfully
engaged.

Negligible: This group includes individuals with minimal or no exposure to digital
technologies. They may not know how to use devices like smartphones or computers,
nor are they familiar with the internet.

Basic: This group includes individuals with basic digital skills, such as using basic phones,
minimal internet browsing, and simple app interactions.

39

Intermediate: This group includes individuals with a more robust understanding and
usage of digital tools. They might be proficient in using their smartphones more for
complex tasks, engaging in social media, or utilizing digital platforms for business or
education.

Advanced: This group comprises individuals with advanced knowledge and skills in
digital technologies, including developers, technology professionals, or policymakers
who are familiar with AI and other frontier technologies.

ANNEX 2: Outreach Strategy

Step 1: Mapping Stakeholders

Figure 5 - Indicative stakeholders mapped on a matrix of difficulty in participating and being contacted for consultation

To design an adequate outreach strategy, it is important to first identify the type of
stakeholders that will be contacted and are supposed to participate in the consultations.
Stakeholders can be mapped along two dimensions, which define the extent to which
they require means to be contacted, and the degree to which they require resources to
participate.

41

Dimension 1: Contacting
The first dimension is characterized by the extent to which the identified stakeholders can be
contacted, and how accessible information is to them. The information should be publicly
available in local languages, and the communication channels should be suitable to the needs of
the stakeholders. For instance, access to safe and user-friendly online and digital platforms
enables stakeholders to receive invitations to consultations more readily, as they can utilize
social media, email communication, and newsletters.

It is important to highlight that online communication is the most straightforward and least
costly channel to reach potential consultation participants. Nonetheless, those who are most at
risk of being left behind tend to have fewer resources to access online channels of
communication and rely more heavily on in-person interactions to be both informed and
consulted. For example, rural communities are often less connected than urban communities. It
is important to consider hosting community events, workshops, or one-on-one interviews to
meet people where they are.

These channels of contact thus inherently reflect the potential at which stakeholders are at risk
of being left behind. An inclusive outreach strategy therefore should take the personal needs of
the stakeholders into account and apply a range of online communication channels,
complemented by more spontaneous in-person communication.

Dimension 2: Participation
The second dimension is defined by the extent to which stakeholders are able to participate, as a
barrier to inclusion may hinder them from meaningfully engaging in consultations. To ensure
channels for safe, non-discriminatory, inclusive, and meaningful participation, it is thus essential
to consider that certain stakeholder groups are more vulnerable, and thus face higher barriers
and risks to engage in consultations. The degree to which stakeholders can participate thus
depends on the creation of an enabling environment which aims to meet their needs to
overcome these barriers.

For instance, domestic work and direct care of persons often make it difficult for women to
participate in in-person consultation processes (UN Women 2017). It is important to consider
remunerating participants for their time and, when possible, to accommodate childcare to
enable more women to take part in in consultations.

42

Step 2: Linking Stakeholders to Appropriate Outreach Strategies

Figure 6 - Modalities matched to stakeholders for outreach strategy

Once the stakeholders are mapped along the two dimensions, four broad groups can be
defined, based on the extent to which stakeholders have access to online communication
channels and the means to participate in consultations. Appropriate outreach strategies and
consultation modalities can then be identified accordingly, and these can be mapped along a
scale of more or less inclusivity (see figure above).

If a particular stakeholder group is characterized by a higher access to online communication
channels and the resources to participate in-person, it is likely appropriate to reach out to
them via email, social media platforms, and newsletters, and to organize an in-person focus
group (most closely represented by Group 1). However, if the stakeholder group faces higher
barriers to participation due to e.g., childcare responsibilities in the case of women, yet are
likely well connected (UN Women 2017), an appropriate consultation modality could be an
online focus group (more closely aligned with Group 2). Further, with decreasing resources to
participate in a consultation, an online survey may provide the flexibility needed to collect
their perspectives (as categorized in Group 3). Finally, if the stakeholder group has little to no
access to online communication channels, more spontaneous face-to-face dialogues e.g., on
the street could be an appropriate consultation modality (Group 4).

43

Generally, it is key to consider and accommodate the individual needs of participants. Lower
access to online communication channels and higher barriers to participation should
translate to more in-person interactions with stakeholders for both the outreach strategy and
consultation modality. This should help create an enabling and inclusive environment for the
consultation.

Overall, it's important to note that the suggested outreach strategies and modalities aim to
provide recommendations for potential outreach approaches, as categorized by the four
groups in Figures 5 and 6. However, this list is not exhaustive and open to further channels of
communication and engagement. For instance, more creative approaches to participation,
such as social media discussions and radio conversations could offer meaningful ways to
engage stakeholders. These modalities should therefore address the challenges for
stakeholders that face higher barriers to both communication and participation, and account
for local needs.

Pre-consultation form and instructions

This methodological guide is part of a Framework for conducting national consultations on
frontier technologies developed by the UNDP Accelerator Lab Network and Columbia
University's SIPA.

Purpose of Focus Groups
The purpose of the focus group modality detailed here is to understand invited individuals’
perceptions of [frontier technology] within a pre-determined setting.

Notes for facilitators

Facilitators should fill in the sections below for [frontier technology] reflecting the specific
technology you are enquiring about, and additional details in “expectation setting.”
Facilitators should familiarize themselves with popular local frontier technology applications
which can be used for context setting (refer to Stage 1 and Annex 5 for more information on
AI-proxies specifically).

5 P’s for invited stakeholders
For conversations on technology, we can think of these five dimensions as the risks and
potentials of technology as they relate to:

People: participation in daily life, social inclusion, data privacy, health impacts.
Prosperity: economic opportunities and labor markets, poverty, education.
Planet: environmental protection, sustainability, access to resources and clean water.
Partnerships: national and international cooperation; global connectivity.
Peace: security, privacy, governance, and institutions.

Which of the 5 P’s is this focus group associated with?

Dimension 5P

Notes on sub-aspects of each dimension

Example: Partnerships
(private sector)

Economic opportunities and labor markets, poverty, and other sub-aspects such as
investment in local digital infrastructure

After an introduction and the establishment of expectations, focus groups should be organized around
three thematic blocks:

leveling,
perceptions, and
stakeholder-specific questions.

Importance of Concretizing and Expectation Setting
Concrete examples are very important and provide an opportunity to ask experts and non-experts how a
particular technology may affect them and their society in a way that generates comparable perspectives.
The facilitator should be familiar with the most common [frontier technology] applications and proxies
presented in the local environment prior to the consultation. This will facilitate choosing concrete examples
around which the questions of Block 2 will be centered.

Suggestions for successfully facilitating a focus group

Integrate interactive activities: Utilizing sticky notes can enhance participant
engagement and streamline responses. For instance, when exploring the concept of
“What is AI?” a participatory exercise can be implemented where respondents use
sticky notes to visually represent the similarity of their perspectives. Participants are
invited to place their sticky note adjacent to the one that best resonates with their
viewpoint, fostering a dynamic and collaborative exchange of ideas.

Switch up the speaking order: To foster equitable participation and accommodate
diverse personality dynamics within a group, it can be beneficial to alternate the
sequence in which participants are invited to share their thoughts. This approach
ensures that each individual has an opportunity to contribute meaningfully and helps
balance the conversation dynamics by preventing any one participant from
consistently dominating the discussion.

Digital tools for online focus groups: Digital whiteboards (such as Miro and Mural) help
facilitate an online dialogue centered around specific questions and mimic the sticky
notes approach outlined above. In coordination with Zoom, this allows for porting the
focus group Framework directly to a remote setting in which each question is a

48

separate, dedicated section of the whiteboard in which participants spend time on. When
conducting surveys, whether in the street or online, tools such as KoboToolBox and
SurveyCTO enable data recording for analysis later. Installing software such as these onto
tablets and phones ready for offline data collection also enables operating in more remote
locations where internet access is not available.

During the consultation - form

Introduce the conversation:

Say

Thank you very much for your time and interest in participating in our focus group on
frontier technologies.

Today we will discuss the topic of [frontier technology]. Technologies such as these are
increasingly influencing how our societies function. We can often be surrounded by these
technology systems without even realizing it. Due to the growing importance of [frontier
technology], policy makers and international organizations are beginning to debate what role
[frontier technology] should play in our future lives and how it should be regulated.

As facilitators, we take a neutral view on technology: we believe there are arguments for and
against. We are interested in hearing about your general perspectives on [frontier technology].

During the following focus group, we want to understand your current level of knowledge about
[frontier technology] and, most importantly, your feelings of where technological developments
should be heading in the future. The first two question blocks consist of more general questions
which you may answer both from your personal and professional perspective. In the last section
of this consultation, we will direct the conversation more towards questions especially related to
the role of frontier technology in your specific sector.

Set expectations:

This consultation was developed on behalf of the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP). The organization running today’s consultation is [insert
facilitating and sponsoring organizations here]. Any information shared
will be treated with the usual ethical safeguards that are the standard for
protecting your personal data. Your responses will be anonymized and shared
without any personally identifiable information.

Say

The results of today's consultation will be made available to you if you are
interested. In addition, the information gathered in this consultation may be
shared with [insert specific entities that are likely to see the results] who
would use this information to [insert the likely objectives of these organizations].

Present focus group participants

Ask

All participants state their name, background and briefly explain their expectations for
participating in this focus group.

Question Block 1: Leveling

The objective of the first block of questions is to find out what participants currently know or
understand about frontier technologies.

Exercise 1: What is [frontier technology]?

Ask

Ask participants to come up with an example of a [frontier technology] they have heard of or
interacted with. Ask them to write their response on a sticky note. For other approaches for
leveling in this stage, see Stage 2 of the Framework.

Discuss and compare participants’ responses and their similarities. Do people know the examples provided by
other participants?

Guiding questions could be:

What does
this [frontier technology] do?

Where did
you hear about this [frontier technology]?

Have you
interacted with the [frontier technology]?

What was
the [frontier technology] used for?

The specific process / activity that will be covered in the remainder of this consultation is:
[insert specific frontier technology application here]

50

Important: At the end of this section, participants should choose at least one, and possibly
two to three concrete examples of [frontier technology] through which they will answer the
following questions, to facilitate discussion among participants. If participants do not actively
propose examples, or if their examples are not suitable for discussion, the facilitator can
suggest some of the examples presented in the previous section, which are relevant to the
local context.

If the focus group members are experts, they may focus too much on their niche knowledge.
Therefore, it is very important to remind them of the expectations of the focus group: to
discuss the impact of [frontier technology] on civil society in their country. Advise them to
generalize their opinions on the potential impact of [frontier technology] to the concrete
examples chosen earlier to establish a discussion among the participants focused on
common themes.

Some examples can be found in Annex 5: Menu of questions and definitions.

Question Block 2: Perceptions

Using the concretized examples of [frontier technology] that have been agreed in Question
Block 1, this section sets out to gather general perceptions by focusing the discussion on that
technology interaction which is familiar to participants.

The specific process / activity that will be covered in this section is:
[insert specific frontier technology application here]

Ask

In what ways are you aware of the use of [frontier
technology] in [X area*]? What specific
process/activity is the [frontier technology]
attempting to perform?

Write down responses

Question 1

In your opinion, what are (or would be) the effects
of mass deployment/adoption of [concrete frontier
technology example] in your country? Please
provide examples if possible.

51

Question 2

Follow up

How do you think that [frontier technology] might
impact the average citizen of your country? (If covered
already in the previous question, move to the more
precise follow-up questions below).

Who is impacted by the effects?

Do you think those who will be impacted are aware of it?

Question 3

Whose responsibility do you think it is to protect people
from these risks or to make sure that the benefits are
shared equitably?

Question Block 3: Stakeholder-specific

Relate these questions to the person's profession. Following the consultation, the profession’s
answers derived will relate to one of the 5Ps of the SDGs: People; Prosperity; Planet; Partnership;
and Peace.

These questions should focus on the topic and not as strongly on sentiments, which have already
been covered above. This section therefore offers facilitators a space to address specific topics
around [frontier technology] that are relevant to the local development landscape, ongoing
projects and partnerships of the team organizing the national consultations, or specific
experiences of focus group participants and their particular sectors.

You can find some example questions for specific stakeholder groups in Annex 5.

Pre-consultation form and instructions

This methodology guide is part of a Framework for conducting national consultations on frontier
technologies developed by the UNDP Global Accelerator Lab Network and Columbia University's
School of International and Public Affairs.

The purpose of surveys and street consultations
Surveys are meant to capture the perspectives of the wider civil society and are especially useful
when trying to incorporate the voices of more marginalized groups whose voices are usually not
represented in discussions on frontier technologies. Random sampling is important during the
consultation process. Surveyors and interviewers should try to reach out to diverse respondents
and ensure that different parts of society are equally represented (e.g., try to include an equal
number of male and female respondents, try to capture different age groups, try to conduct
physical surveys in both rural and urban settings, etc.).

For respondents whose level of knowledge is identified to be low at the beginning of the
consultation process, it is particularly important to introduce examples of proxy technologies at
the beginning of the conversation. This creates a foundation for respondents to express their
opinions on the following questions, as described in Stage 2 with examples of AI proxies in Annex
5. Surveyors and interviewers should remain flexible and agnostic to the [frontier technology].
They should avoid biasing participants’ attitudes through their prompts and questions.

In general, it is recommended to limit the survey to five to seven questions and a consultation
time of 10 minutes. The following questions can also be applied in online surveys.

Prior to conducting the Survey:

Surveyors and interviewers should familiarize themselves with popular local frontier
technology applications which can be used for context setting (refer to Stage 2 and Annex 5
for more information on AI-proxies specifically).
Fill in the sections below for [frontier technology] reflecting the specific technology you
are enquiring about, and additional details in “expectation setting.”
Set up the consultation device for recording answers of participants: recommended tools are
KoboToolbox or in-person survey tools.

Consider proxies for socio-economic status:

If conducting a street consultation, consider that geographic locations could act as proxies for
socio-economic status. Having locations which span the range of these dimensions, e.g., more
affluent, and less affluent areas, can aid in having a more representative cross-section of
society interviewed as part of the national consultation.

55

If conducting an online survey using the questions below, consider how the outreach
strategy might be reaching certain socio-economic groups or other demographics. For
example, dedicated group chats or newsletters for professionals are often aligned to
identities and interest areas which can then be used for later analysis.

Welcome the participant

Thank you very much for your time and interest in participating in our survey on frontier
technologies.

Say

Today we will discuss the topic of [frontier technology]. Technologies such as these are
increasingly influencing how our societies function. We can often be surrounded by these
technology systems without even realizing it. Due to the growing importance of [frontier
technology], policy makers and international organizations are beginning to debate what role
artificial intelligence should play in our future lives and how it should be regulated.

We take a neutral view on technology, as we believe there are arguments for and against.
Therefore, we are not looking for specific answers and are more interested in hearing your
general perspectives on [frontier technology].

Set expectations

Say

This consultation was developed on behalf of the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP). The organization running today’s consultation is [insert facilitating and sponsoring
organizations here]. Any information shared will be treated with the usual ethical safeguards
that are the standard for protecting your personal data. Your responses will be anonymized and
shared without any personally identifiable information.

The results of today's consultation will be made available to you if you are interested. In addition,
the information gathered in this consultation may be shared with [insert specific entities that
are likely to see the results] who would use this information to [insert the likely objectives of
these organizations].

If participants have no further questions, surveyors or interviewers may begin the official
consultation using the questions below.

Survey Questions

Have you heard about [frontier technology]? If
yes, what did you hear about it and where?

If familiarity is low, set the context by providing some
technology examples/proxies and ask if the
participant is familiar with it. Center the following
questions around the examples for which familiarity
exists. Make sure to note whether the examples
discussed in the following questions were named by
the participants themselves or if you provided the
proxies.

Have you used [frontier technology] in your daily
life or work environment? How do you use this
application?

(Be sure to concretize on the specific task/activity that
uses [frontier technology], rather than the broader
concept of the [frontier technology]).

Write down responses

The specific process / activity that will be covered in this section is:
[insert specific frontier technology application here]

Imagine your life without [specific application of
the frontier technology], what would it be like?

(If the consultations process would like to derive
more specific sentiments, ask: “Do you think life
without this [specific application] would be better,
worse, mixed, or are you uncertain how it would
be?”).

Thinking broadly about [frontier technology]
now, imagine a future where more activities will
be based on these technologies. How do you think
this will affect you?

(If the consultations process would like to derive
more specific sentiments, ask: “Will such a future be
beneficial or harmful to you and to your work? If so,
in what way?”)

ANNEX 5: Menu of Questions and Definitions

This Annex offers a set of questions on AI, which were used during the pilot phase in Morocco and
Paraguay. However, these questions may also be utilized for other frontier technologies by substituting
AI for the technology of interest.

Perception Questions

Perception questions work best when they are concretized on a specific application of AI and should
address multiple dimensions. The following questions provide some examples of the types of questions
that can be asked when capturing sentiments.

Trust in AI

What tasks do you trust and not trust [concretized AI example] to perform?
Can [concretized AI example] complete tasks as effectively as people?
What does it look like when [concretized AI example] makes a mistake?

It is typically useful to concretize with participants what is meant by “task” or “mistake”
during the consultation.

Understanding of Risk (probability and severity)

How often do you think [concretized AI example] makes mistakes?
How easy is it to correct when [concretized AI example] makes mistakes?
Who is likely to be affected when [concretized AI example] makes a mistake?
Do you think users (other than yourself) well enough aware of this risk?
Do you think users can avoid this risk?
Do you think technology makers are aware of the risk?

Equitability

Who do you think receives the most benefit from AI? Who do you think is the most at
risk of undesirable effects?
How do you anticipate AI will impact social inclusion?
Where do you think using AI will make the biggest impact? Is it a positive, neutral, or
negative impact in your opinion?

Responsibility

Do you think AI is always used responsibly?
What do you think might happen if AI is not used responsibly?
Who do you think is responsible for preventing [concretized AI example] from being used
irresponsibly?
Who do you think is responsible for protecting users of [concretized AI example] from harm?
What do you think individual users can do to protect themselves?

60

Stakeholder-Specific Questions

These stakeholders are indicative of traditional sector categories, with further information on such groups
present in Annex 6. Professional groupings such as this should not be the only cluster utilized in national
consultations and alternatives such as relative positioning within the AI Loop can be considered from Annex 1.

Public Sector

What do you think is the role of the government in helping citizens better harness the
potential or mitigate the risks of [concretized AI example]?
How do you think AI will impact private businesses and startups? What do you think the
government’s role should be in supporting them?
Is cybersecurity a major threat to your country? What do you think is the role of the
government in helping mitigate this risk for citizens?

Private Sector

Do you think the private sector in your country is investing enough resources in the local
development of AI? If not, why do you think this is?
What do you think are the benefits or risks of AI for the private sector in your country?
What challenges do you think companies in your country face in competing for skilled
workers with foreign companies that can hire remotely?

Academia

How is AI currently used in academia in your country? How do you think academia
will contribute to future developments in AI in your country?
Do you think there is a lack of digital talent (required to properly harness AI) in your
country? If so, do you think it is due to a lack of academic opportunities, with too few
students in these fields? Or do you think it is because foreign companies are
recruiting local talent (a brain drain)?

Activists

What are the potentials or challenges of AI for digital rights in your country, e.g., data privacy?

Useful AI Proxies and Definitions

It is important to reflect on the most relevant AI applications in the local context prior to the
consultation. However, some widespread examples and definitions of AI may be applicable in many
countries.

61

AI Definitions

UNDP, 2018: “theory and development of computer systems that can perform tasks normally
requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making,
and translation and interpretation.”
OECD, 2023: “An AI system is a machine-based system that, for explicit or implicit objectives,
infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content,
recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments. Different
AI systems vary in their levels of autonomy and adaptiveness after deployment.”

Chatbots, especially those that can interact with WhatsApp or other websites. When you send a
text message to an organization, especially to ask questions, it is normal that there is not a person
on the other side, but a computer. That's AI.

Search results and recommendation algorithms from Google and social networks. When you
search for something on your phone and then your news and ads match in a pattern, that's a
computer that has recognized your interests and suggests things to you. That's AI.

Biometric identification: If your phone unlocks when it sees your face (facial recognition) or scans
your fingerprint, instead of typing in a password, it's because the computer or your phone has
learned the shape of your face and/or your fingerprints. That's AI.

Alexa, Siri, Google Home or other virtual assistants. Some devices in your home or on your phone
respond to your voice and give you help because a computer learns to recognize your voice and
then figures out the best way to help you. That's AI.

ANNEX 6: Strategies to Account for Cultural Contexts and Diversity

Accounting for Challenges to Diverse Stakeholder Selection

Throughout the process of identifying and selecting stakeholders, efforts should be made to
mitigate elite bias, be culturally sensitive, and include diverse representation with awareness of
different dynamics (Bryson et al, 2012). Below are recommended practices for addressing each:

Elite Bias Mitigation

Ensure representation from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds to mitigate elite bias in
stakeholder engagement.
Actively seek input from marginalized or underrepresented groups to capture a broader
spectrum of perspectives.

Cultural Sensitivity

Respect cultural nuances and sensitivities when engaging with stakeholders.
Tailor communication approaches and engagement strategies to align with local
customs and values, fostering inclusivity and trust.

Diverse Representation

Prioritize diverse representation across stakeholder categories to reflect the
multifaceted nature of societal interests.
Take active steps to include vulnerable and marginalized populations that may be more
impacted by frontier technologies, ensuring that all voices are heard and considered.
For example, incorporating a daycare option for mothers to take part in a consultation
will improve accessibility.

Awareness of Different Dynamics

Recognize that no one's understanding, or appreciation of frontier technologies is
complete or correct (and vice-versa). Even “experts” have their own views and opinions,
and it is not because someone is not involved in the development or deployment of
technology that they are not impacted by it. Value diversity of views as much as
representativity.
Recognize that individuals or groups previously thought to have little influence may
actually hold significant power, or vice versa.
Consider dynamics between stakeholders invited to the same consultation to ensure a
fruitful discussion.

Post-2015 Development Agenda: Stakeholder Guidelines

The inclusive and culturally sensitive engagement of stakeholders is pivotal for a consultation
that is respectful of the local context. Leveraging the approach outlined in previous sections on
identifying stakeholders and using different modalities, strategies to keep in mind while
engaging specific stakeholders are available in Annex 2.1 from the “Post-2015 Development
Agenda: Guidelines for National Consultations: What future do you want?” (UNDP 2012). We
encourage the reader to consult that document for further information.
