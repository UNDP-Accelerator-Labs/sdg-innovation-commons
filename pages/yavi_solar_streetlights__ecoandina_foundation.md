> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Most of the towns located in the puna are not connected to the national or provincial power grid. In general, they must be autonomous and generate energy with diesel fuel with high costs and the consequent emission of greenhouse gases. Others have generation through photovoltaic microgrids, and the energy is not always enough to cover public lighting in the towns’ access or in their social areas. In general, in the towns, the electrical service is rationalized and limited.   Solving the lighting problem in unlit areas of Pueblo Casti and spreading the use of solar technology for clean and efficient lighting are the premises of this project. Photovoltaic equipment will be purchased with the use of LED lights and batteries that enable system autonomy for several days even in the absence of sun.
