> Title of the innovation

LVSCC Agrovet Marketing Youth Network

> Brief description of the innovation

LVSCC Agrovet Marketing Youth Network (AMYN) would like to promote and develop a youth market for farm produce, agrovet inputs, livestock and livestock products and, agrovet inputs among 47 Smallholder Livestock Farmers (SLF) participating in LVSCC Herd Health Programme. The SLF own cattle, goats and chicken as a main source of income. They also grow a good hectarage and produce higher volumes of maize and other grains because of use of cattle draught power. 
However, a recent study by LVSCC and Value for Women-UK has highlighted a number of challenges. Challenges include SLF being price-takers, high costs to get to better markets, limited market access, lack of skill and high costs of running the farming business, lack of support services and inputs mainly veterinary needs. 
A number of respondents raised ideas to support or encourage women and youth in households farm entrepreneurship and engagements just for them. SLF expressed desire for more training and access to markets as well as other service providers.
LVSCC-AMYN would like to identify, create awareness, mobilise, organise and build market capacity of the SLF youths. AMYN will establish youth managed grain market storage facilities and livestock market centres to use or rent out.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

LVSCC has been receiving a number of interns from Universities, Colleges, and Institutes. Some students fail to get attached because of a lack of operational funds to sustain their exposure to required activities. The challenge prize is required for start-up resources. AMYN would like to establish an internship fund to assist needy students who also serve as additional labor. AMYN in partnerships with SLF youth groups will set up grain market storage facilities and livestock market centers.

Revenue will accrue from rentals or commission for storage of grain or livestock kept. Storage facilities (SF) will house outlets for LVSCC agro-vet inputs and other requisites. SLF youth groups will manage the SF and use them to buy, sell and store grain/livestock. The SLFGs at livestock services centers will provide oversight. SLFG will have an opportunity to trade here as opposed to now when long distances at high costs to markets in town are covered. The facilities will be open to other service providers and inputs suppliers as venues for meetings, to promote and sell their products. 

AMYN will promote the setting up of incinerators and disposal storage for plastics, used chemicals/drugs containers, and expired chemicals/drugs from communities to prevent environmental contamination and pollution.

> Technical Feasibility

Since 2008, LVSCC’s core activity has been the provision of Livestock Herd Health followed by the provision of capacity building of smallholder livestock farmers (SLF), mainly at livestock service centers as a prototype of this proposal. LVSCC would like to set up an Agrovet Market Youth Network Unit to house a facilitator. Youth will be identified, sensitized, mobilized, and organized into viable Smallholder Livestock Farmer Group (SLFG) subgroups. The facilitator will act as liaison and overseer for SLFG youths’ subgroups at LSC and provide mentorship in entrepreneurship to youth among SLFG. 

The facilitator with receive applications, schedule the internships, and allocate resources. In addition, the facilitator will be responsible for a database for grain and livestock marketing and provide the necessary linkages between grain/livestock buyers and sellers, manage and distribute required based agro-vet requisites.  

Training provides knowledge and skills in; livestock disease control and prevention, good group governance, entrepreneurship skills, and, environment protection practices. Implementation of the herd health program requires a 2-3 years plan per SLFG. Thereafter, the activities become self-sustaining. However, startup resources for capacity building need the support of the government or indeed its partners to alleviate operational resources limitations.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Employment for youth in SLFGs will be created. Funds for internships will be made available so as to fully expose students to their needs especially in the field. Direct benefits will include reduced costs/distances to grain and livestock markets in town. Service providers will have somewhere to hold meetings, promote and sale of their products. SLF will easily access markets at which to sell grain and livestock for money to meet household needs and also pay for herd health activities. Veterinary drugs and other requisites will be sold within the vicinity. 

The centers will serve as community information hubs to improve extension networks among the livestock communities and, serve as grain and livestock bulking centers. Reduced environment contamination, improved livestock community cohesion, enhanced grain and livestock market dynamics, and overall productivity among livestock-based communities are envisaged indirect benefits.
