## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Empower and inspire local governments and communities to increase their digital capabilities. 
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is to empower individuals, communities, and local governments focused on women to increase digital capabilities that they can leverage to provide basic services and needs in health, effective governance, and digital literacy. We want to explore how digital influence can support the transformation and adoption of tools for the development of vulnerable communities through the digital literacy of basic services and how, based on these tools, we achieve resilient and empowered behaviors that support their development.   Based on the Latin American and the Caribbean Economic System (SELA) "Internet use in most Latin American households is limited to communication tools and social networks" and that, therefore, "Internet penetration per se does not indicate a high degree of digital resilience of the Latin American household". The existing digital divide in the country prevents the effective use of ICTs and the overcoming advances to promote holistic processes in human development and this gap has been more noticeable after the pandemic of COVID 19. As Lab we also want to explore how to ensure the continuity of digital operations in areas such as telemedicine, tele-education, citizen participation for effective governance and the digitization of productive sectors functioning as a front battle to mitigate and address the effects of the pandemic for economic recovery at the basic levels in vulnerable communities. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The digital divide hinders the region from taking effective advantage of ICTs, avoiding the relay on them to drive a sustainable, integrated and development processes of the countries that shape the region. Today, amid the disruption of the pandemic, the digital gap let clarify and reveals a very significant vulnerability and inequalities that compromises the success of the measures that LAC governments have taken in response to COVID-19. The pandemic has highlighted the existing gap and the urgent need to reactivate sectors and streamline basic processes such as health and education through ICTs, in which societies of all classes have been affected; most of them, women, without the different digital tools it would have been impossible to carry out measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. This gap has brought a myriad of effects creating social impacts inequalities, less inclusion for different productivities sectors, civil societies and has decelerated the fulfillment of the SDG’s.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Acc Lab has identified an opportunity to act with different partners around the Digital Strategy, identifying and capturing initiatives to implement DLi (Digital Lighthouse Initiatives), short-term digital solutions that create impact; regarding to the understand of this pathway we can add value mapping solutions, creating alliances and partnering with key stakeholders to develop a more transcendental strategy that could achieve other sectors and could culminate in the co-creation of the national innovation ecosystem. Also, we want to implement the challenge thinking in a collective intelligence and human centered design focusing in 1) collectively map the issue, the community assets, the stakeholders; 2) collectively organize, design and prototype different digital solutions that are appropriate to the specific community and locals’ governments in the intervention. The value of the lab is the agile and participatory methodologies that help to achieve milestones in a short-term. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP’s accelerator lab is inspiring local governments and transforming lives in smalls communities, specifically women through digital capabilities in basics services that support more dignified health and effective co-created governance.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

Could the digital transformation decrease the early pregnancy and mitigate the risks of early marriage?   How can we empower people to acquire digital skills to change their manners and improve them to use their technological resources to achieve basic needs, getting started in the health sector?   How could we get data to support the digitization of basic services to increase the effectiveness of these services?   What are the inner drivers to adopt emergent technologies for early and older adopters due to obtain behavioral insights from them and create public policies and mechanisms accurate to them?

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Sense
- Explore
- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

All of these methods have been streamlined into one portfolio of sense, exploration and experimentation phase that we will carry out in one community as a prototype. We will apply the different learning activities outlined by each method, in a series of community meetings where most stakeholders will participate and will bring behavioral insights. The result is expected to generate insights, theory of change, strategies for achieve different nationals co-created solutions to scaled up into policies and data to use for making national strategies.    

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

This technological process will bring us new frontiers of information. Socioeconomic data in the DR is almost inexistent and the data is collected every 5 years or more. We need to use participatory and user journey data by observation to get real insights to act.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The beneficiaries will be the communities, specifically women that will see an improvement in their Primary Attention Unities, a health regulatory services and a more achievable digital capability probably reducing the effects of early pregnancy.  For this challenge, we are already prototyping with digital solutions in the health sector that are in conversation with the government to map data, increase and improve the health sector in terms of vaccination, digitalization, etc.
