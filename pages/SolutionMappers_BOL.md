# Solutions Mapping in Bolivia for Women's Empowerment and Financial Inclusion

[[0:00]] Hi, my name is Patricia Choke and I work at a club in Bolivia as the head of Solution Mapping\.

### [[0:08]] Hi Patricia, can you tell me about your heir and the journey?

[[principles:Inclusivity and diversity]]
[[principles:Diversity]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
[[principles:Collaboration]]
Yes, yes\. Some years ago, we were working on the financial inclusion for women and it was something we shared with the UN Women and we wanted to map the current solution for that, the digital ones and the other ones in order to understand how the ecosystem is working on this financial inclusion for women\. So we'll launch our challenge\. And yeah, we try to involve other stakeholders like investors from the beginning, investors like our donors, everything to, you know, be part of this challenge, actually to to socialize the challenge, everything at the end we chose like two start\-ups\. And because of the links we made with investors and other institutions, one of them, the most active entrepreneurs managed to, you know, diffuse its solutions to implement with other donors like the Inter American Development Bank\. They even got internationally side their solution\.

### [[1:35]] So maybe it was a successful death\.

[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Even when the Lab is not there things should continue]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
Yeah\. But the other winner it was no so dynamic\. So yeah, the star died, the star died\. So we learned a lot of things of that experience\. And I think one of the principles is that no one's solution can drive, can grow, which had a good environment without friends\. Yeah\. So in the first case, the solution has like a good environment, many people that knew about solution, about that solution and they helped, they have this all these organization have the startup to grow health etcetera to be known\. So it is a good principle I think to work with the main ecosystem institutions from the beginning\. And then based on this experience, we decided to begin other one\. It is not only for the empowerment economically important for women, but also the high like empowered in general\. And in this case we, you know, we had some more partners, not only you, you and women, but also the government and also other NGOs in the ecosystem\. And we began to gather this initiative\. And it was like we took some months in order to be prepared\. And maybe this is other principle and we need to build a common ground\. Yeah, because all these institutions have their own vision of development and innovation for them is may be different\. So we decided to co\-create the initiative and it took some time, but at the end of this time we were prepared\. We're prepared to launch it together\. So now we are mapping together solutions\. So every situation is like contributing with money, with their time, with their efforts\. So that means not only a common knowledge ground, but also like willingness, also like goal also like, you know, when you give your time and you give your money, when you have your energy, it's like this kind of common ground\. Yeah\. So in we map it to more than 400 solutions\. And it was, oh, there are more than 200 institutions working on in women empowerment\. And we, we didn't know all these institution well, you know, like 2025 institutions\. So there was a lot of like insights from that\. So we are like in the first stage of an initiative, an ecosystem initiative to identify missing solutions, because there are already a lot of solutions\. Yeah, but they are missing, they are missing solutions, they are gaps\. So it is important to identify this this missing solutions because impact is not only from 1 institution, it's not only a group of solution\. Impact means many institution, a critical mass working together for the same goal\. So maybe other in principle in this is we need to create a critical mass in order to, you know, build an adequate environment for the solutions, for the new thing, the new approaches, the new solution, the new thing\. So it needs a lot of skills, but not only my skills\. You know, one of I think a tactic it's to identify champions\. Yeah, you need a team, you need an internal team, an internal team\. You need a lot of friends for innovation\. So identify as a champion\. I think it's a skill to promote to, you know, support this champion in order to, to, to grow its other skill\. Yeah, because you need to, to form a group, A\-Team\. And this is, this is a skill\. Yeah\. So now because of we are together, we are many institutions working together, we socialize a lot the mapping solution, there are some specific institutions interested in the results of them of this mapping in order to like to identify gaps, to innovate, to identify solution that could be scaled\. So there is some expectations about that\. So we think it is important, this ecosystem approach because it will, you know, continue with or without, without us\. There are some champions, there are some institutions that are waiting for the solutions\. There are some plans and they will continue with or with us\. So this is a movement\. Yeah, I think it is all these phases for research\. It's so important because it will help all the institutions to have a shared vision of the ecosystem of ourselves\. Yeah, it's like a photography of ourselves in order if we can change any anything we can, we have to know what to change\. So it's like a photography of ourselves and it is so important to have this, you know, capacity reflection of ourselves in order to know how to where it's important to innovate in order to identify like strategic innovation\. Our final result will be like a portfolio of a strategic innovation for the ecosystem\. So all this, all this effort is still ongoing, but we think we have built like a strong foundations to be like a very important thing for the ecosystem\.

### [[8:34]] Thank you, Patricia\. I have 3, 3 asks for you answers\. The first one, what opportunity did you see and how did you come to see them with all these journey, the opportunity that you find, can you describe them?

[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[tools:Design]]
[[tactics:Gaining leverage and traction for solutions]]
[[principles:Recognize and promote agency]]
Yeah, an opportunity\. I think there are a lot of opportunities 1st for the organization in the ecosystem because all this organization want to make a impact\. They want to and they need new, new, new information\. They need new ways to make an impact\. So they are so engaged with because of that, they are the Champions\. Yeah, there are not any organization\. They are the Champions for that and they are, I think there are opportunities for startups, for innovator, but especially the opportunities for women because the new solutions are the, the, the, I don't know, but the solution will be, will be built based on the needs of women\. Yeah\. And so what are you doing? It's the photography\. What is it really needed to do? It's the other thing we will talk about because with all this information, we will develop dialogues like evidence based dialogues, like with visuals\. I think an important tool for that is to visualize\. Visualize easy things to visualize in order to identify the gaps, in order to identify the opportunities based on all this information with recovery\.

### [[10:17]] Thank you\. The 2nd that I have to for you is what was a critical moment in your journey and why a critical moment?

[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Trust]]
[[principles:Self-awareness]]
[[principles:Well being]]
Yeah, OK\. A critical moment was when maybe there were some people don't believe in this process because it was so new\. Yeah\. And they did OK\. They said OK, maybe why it is necessary\. We are doing the things we, we, we know what to do\. So what is necessary? Yeah\. It's like a, it was a critical moment, but it was so important because of the organization\. That's where we're working together, OK\. It's really important, although maybe it's something we missed\. And yeah, it's a, you know, strengthen us in order to like develop our value proposition for the ecosystem\. And yeah, it changes our way to communicate, our way to, you know, be linked with the needs of the ecosystem\. And yeah, but at the end, thanks to the to this critical moment, more institutions were involved in our journey\.

### [[11:35]] Thank you\. The last one, what would you do differently?

[[tactics:Systems thinking]]
[[principles:Recognize local expertise]]
[[principles:Curiosity]]
[[principles:Flexibility and adaptability]]
Different\. Yeah, I think it's necessary like common knowledge, common knowledge about innovation, about practicing of innovation\. Even in this level it's innovation because institutions are working on development and development problems and implementing solutions\. They have like an approach that it's not maybe the one we have\. Yeah\. So it's necessary like to be at the same level of knowledge of like expectation\. And we managed that, but it took a lot of time\. So maybe yeah, some protocols, some methods and chilling in order to have this same level\. No, not knowing such a long time\.

### [[12:40]] Tell me about more about you\. Did you anything happen during the journey that change changed your mind?

Everything changed my mind\. Yeah\. I think it's like it's really important to listen and the difference, the different things from the ecosystem, you know, even we, we think it is the same goal\. It's the same interests\. It's not real\. There are always different interests, so how to read them and how to balance them and how to\. Yeah, I learned a lot about that\.

### [[13:26]] Thank you\. I have a question about tools and methods\. Did you adapt or did you love yourselves some kind of tools and method that you want to share with us?

[[tools:Narrative analysis]]
[[tools:Visual thinking]]
[[tools:How might we]]
[[tools:Flourish data visualization tool]]
Yeah, I think one of the methods that I use the most was visualizing things, visualizing evidence, visualizing gaps\. It was like, you know, there are a lot of information, but it's another format, like it is a research, like it's and yeah, it's in the it's in the space, in the consistent\. But when you take this information and you put in other formats, visual, especially visual I love this visa\. It's like you can show invisible things because they are invisible, because they have a lot of weight to be visible\. Yeah, they are invisible for some people\. So tools for making visible invisible things and maybe a story and maybe graphic trolls, they are\. They are so important and maybe a mixed of them\. I think we can adapt all of these tools in order to show something that it's not elegant\.

### [[14:48]] Thank you, Patricia, thank you for sharing this amazing experience\.

Thank you\.
