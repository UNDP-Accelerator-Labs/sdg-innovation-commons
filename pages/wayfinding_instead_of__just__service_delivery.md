## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

- The number one pressing need is registration, and this should inform our digitization priorities  - We can notice that the ‘Civil Rights’ had more interest in the content as well as a higher chance of proceeding into an inside location page on the website - We can notice that the ‘North’ had more interest in the content as well as a higher chance of proceeding into an inside location page on the website. Followed by the South and then Baalbeck-Hermel. - We can notice that the ‘Men’ had more interest in the content as well as a higher chance of proceeding into an inside location page on the website. - The only exception is that in the South, women were almost equally interested in the ‘Marital Issues’ video in the second place along with ‘Labor Rights’. - However this equality was not noticed on proceeding to get more information as ‘Labor Rights’ still had more conversion by far. - We can notice that the ‘Men’ had more interest in the content as well as a higher chance of proceeding into an inside location page on the website. The different in interest is less (6%) than the difference between landing on an inside location page (25%). This shows that the interest level was the same for both genders but once on the landing page, women were more likely to seek additional information.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

To verify assumptions from team, donor goals, and the actual need. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

It is necessary to revisit the notion and modality of service delivery especially in such crisis context and this experiment proves that.
