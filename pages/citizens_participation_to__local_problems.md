> Title of the innovation

Citizens participation to  local problems

> Brief description of the innovation

Factors affecting the quality of education include high pupil teacher ratio especially in rural schools. Rural schools have fewer teachers compared to urban schools. Despite most schools in urban areas having no and or inadequate housing units for teachers, houses are accessible on rent by teachers while in rural areas there is nothing. Thus, shortage of skilled teachers is linked to lack of or inadequate houses.

The establishment of a model that would permit locally identified parcels of land near schools for residential plots will alleviate the challenge of accessibility to standard houses in rural areas.  Consultations will be held with traditional leaders of Choma district, school management committees and local people to seek for their opinions on the suggested model and other alternative solutions that need to be tested as a local solution to housing deficit in rural schools. This model will appeal for active participation of local people.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

To sustain the programme beyond, we shall build on our existing business model of out grower scheme of giving out Certified Sunflower seed to identified persons in rural areas to do the planting. Sunflower retain nutrients into the soil. After harvesting the beneficiaries pay back 105 kgs (recoveries) of sunflower produce. The produce is processed into cooking oil which we sell to customers for consumption and reselling. We also sell the by-product (sunflower cake).  Farmers sell the extra produce for cash or process into cooking oil for consumption and sell to increase earnings for the household.  Going forward we intend to be inclusive by targeting also persons with disabilities, youths, women and schools as beneficiaries. We shall build their capacities through trainings. Furthermore, we hope to procure machinery for value addition.

> Technical Feasibility

Plan and general approach to carrying out the Initiative
Theory of Change 

Problem								
•	Inadequate trained Teachers in rural schools
•	Inadequate educational materials in rural schools
•	Inadequate teacher  housing in rural schools
•	Limited source of funds	

Activities
•	Facilitate stakeholders consultative meetings on devised teacher housing model
•	Facilitate engagement platform between communities and DEBS on supply of educational materials and deployment of teachers
•	Run businesses

Output
•	The local people and teachers acquire land near school and build standard houses for rent
•	The Government through the DEBS deploys more trained teachers to rural schools
•	The Government through the DEBS supplies more educational materials to rural  schools
•	The business sustainably supporting school with educational materials

Outcome
•	Standard houses for rent available near the school
•	Increased number of trained teachers in rural schools
•	Increased number of educational materials in  rural schools
	
Goals/Impact
Improved learning outcomes among children in rural schools

Key Assumptions 

Willingness by stakeholders to support this model.		
Active participation of traditional leaders, citizens  and elective leaders in  engagement platforms		
•	Trained  teachers willing to be deployed in rural schools
•	Children willing to enroll, remain and progress in school		
Rural communities demand for improved education provision in schools

> Anticipated Social Impact

National surveys suggest education is a priority for Zambian citizens although levels of satisfaction have varied markedly (Final Report – Zambia Accountability Programme-ZAP April, 2016). Improved education and skills development are instrumental in creating societies that are better able to respond to social and economic development challenges they face.

Skilled workforce is necessary to support the transition of all economic sectors towards highly productive activities, raise labour productivity, attract investment into the country, reduce poverty and build resilience in the economy. Special attention needs to be directed to broadening access and participation to education by disenfranchised populations that are found in remote places.
