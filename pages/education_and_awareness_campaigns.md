> Type of the Solution

Behavioural

> Description of the solution

Both India and Pakistan have successful heat-health early warning systems and action plans already in place, including those specially tailored for urban areas. Multi-pronged heat actions are highly effective in reducing heat related mortality and morbidity especially among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with chronic conditions. Heat action plans must be cost-effective, easy to mantain, ideally should not rely on a mass effort of people and should be specifically structured to meet the local needs and resources of the community.
