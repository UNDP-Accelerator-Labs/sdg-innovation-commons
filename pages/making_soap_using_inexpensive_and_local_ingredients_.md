There were two types of soap made. The first type of soap that was made consisted of a 100% coconut oil bar with 15% superfat, scented with tea tree. The other soap that was made used coconut oil, sunflower oil, olive oil and different oil blends. This was called the fancy soap to sell to mission visitors and volunteers.
