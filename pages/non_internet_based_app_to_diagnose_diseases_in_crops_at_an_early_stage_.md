Non Internet Based APP to diagnose diseases in crops at an early stage. 

> Qualitative Results of the Innovation Solution 

1. Promotion of agribusiness: The Foundation supports the development of agribusinesses in rural communities. This has led to the creation of new jobs and income-generating opportunities for farmers. 
2. Improved market access: The foundation facilitates linkages between smallholder farmers and markets, helping farmers to access better prices for their produce. 
3. Adoption of technology: The Foundation introduced new technologies to smallholder farmers which help farmers to make informed decisions and improve crop yields.

> Quantitative Result of the Innovation

1.  Increased adoption of modern farming practices: Through its farmer education programs, the Okuafo Foundation has helped smallholder farmers adopt modern and sustainable farming practices. For example, the foundation's training on good agricultural practices has led to a 20% increase in crop yield among participating farmers.
2. Improved access to finance: The foundation has partnered with financial institutions to provide smallholder farmers with access to credit and other financial services. This has enabled farmers to invest in their farms and increase productivity. As a result, farmers who have accessed credit through the foundation have seen an average increase in their incomes of 25%.
3. Job creation: The foundation's partnership with a cassava processing company has created over 500 jobs for farmers and other community members.
4. Increase in income and adoption of new technologies: Through its partnerships with companies such as Coca-Cola, Nestle, and Unilever, the foundation has helped farmers to secure long-term contracts and access new markets. This has resulted in a 30% increase in farmers' incomes in some cases. The foundation's use of mobile-based extension services has led to a 50% increase in farmers' adoption of new technologies.
