Access to affordable housing remains a major challenge for many poor communities in Eswatini. The Mgidza informal settlement in Vuvulane with a total of over 27 households is one such community whose homes are constructed mostly of stick and mud and present a health and safety hazard for its residents, including children. This is one of five informal communities located in the Farming town of Vuvulane. The Informal settlements supply labour to the sugarcane farmers who either do not make enough from their revenues to provide their workers with proper housing or elect not to do so. The result is that informal workers and their families must resort to building make-shift, usually one or two-roomed houses using local materials like stick, mud and grass that are shared by whole families, as they also do not have land rights to allow them to build more permanent structures. This problem is widespread across the 5 farming communities in Vuvulane and is a common feature across the rural poor.&nbsp;This solution is shared by a locally based education center focused on promoting sustainable living called Gubha.&nbsp;&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Traditionally, Swati homes are made of natural building materials, mostly lutindzi grass, reeds, sticks, stones and mud. These home structures have excellent thermal properties, allowing for a pleasant stay throughout the seasons. The cutting of the grass and reeds is seasonal, to allow for nature to regenerate and provide consistently. Floors are rammed earth with a top coating of wood ash and cow dung. It is important to note that traditional African or Swati architecture has always been environmentally conscious, using what is available within the landscape. It is unfortunate that such indigenous knowledge, in architecture, was neglected for a long time, labelled as primitive and a symbol of poverty, thus giving way to ‘modern’ architectural methods &nbsp;that have mostly been working against nature (i.e. requiring artificial means of temperature control) &nbsp;and are generally more expensive.

The Low Cost High Quality Eco Housing solution, tries to utilise these traditional methods to construct modern, sustainable and affordable housing solutions. This sustainable housing solution aims to provide affordable housing solutions to the poor using locally available and affordable materials.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The house is made of compressed mud bricks (made by the community from red earth, dug on site, and a mixture of river sand, small amounts of cement) that provide good insulation, thus reducing the energy costs for running them. A wood sawdust bucket compost toilet has been featured, thus reducing the need for solid waste plumbing and unnecessary wasting of water. The construction of up-cycled pallet wooden framed windows with shutters and mosquito nets allows for cross ventilation day and night with no fear of mosquitos penetrating. The window opening has been deliberately made small in width so that burglars cannot enter through it when it is &nbsp;open. Natural airflow and natural light have been considered in the design as the area experiences very hot summers and cold winters.

On one of their solution mapping safaris, the AccLab found this solution to be shared by two locally based NGOs focused on sustainable living, one being the Vuvulane orphans and Vulnerable Children’s Outreach Foundation (VOVCOF) and the Gubha Permaculture Education Center &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
