Nhinte Mane has made pots her whole life, using knowledge she was passed on from her mother and grandmother. The pots are sold and used in the region of Bafata for water cooling. Additionally, different clay containers are made for the use of traditional ceremonies such as marriage, male circumcision and funerals. Nhinte sells the pots at an affordable price due to the competition in the region.
