> Brief description of the innovation

We are a group of 5 gentle men and 1 lady.2welders and 4 carpenters,as for now we only have very few tools for carpentry as for welding this is when we are believing God to help us to buy the machines and tools which means in welding people just hire us,if by any chance we manage to have a our own machine it'll be a great opportunity even to other youths in the land of Luanshya.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If we are helped with some funds,first thing we are going to insure that we have the machines and tools for easy work after that we are going to buy materials to for both welding and carpentry already the small place is there but if the business grow we are going to find a bigger place and believe me you we are going to ensure that we employ more people to work on small jobs which will generate more income to our coffer.

> Technical Feasibility

So after sitting down with my colleagues and see what things we must take first we came up with the amount of money $10000 if we are to tackle most of things.

> Anticipated Social Impact

By proper management and monitoring of the potential social impact, both positive and negative,will make the community benefit and not only the people of Luanshya will benefit but also from other cities.
We are looking forward to your response thank you.
