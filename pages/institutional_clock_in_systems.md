> Title of the innovation

Institutional clock in systems

> Brief description of the innovation

Clock in systems should be installed in government institutions so as to ensure people are working the required number of hours for their pay. It is unfair for service to be under delivered when people are paid full scale salaries for less than half the Job being done. This will help us attain efficiency, at the same time let’s focus on letting civil servants that service is important and should not be taken lightly. Kindness and politeness to the people they interact with should be of great importance.
