## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

It's essential to have an experienced technology partner capable of training craftsmen in the practical use of digital machines. The partner experience is the key. Ensure that you have the right partner and clarify your digital goals because some only care about digital marketing and not the use of digital equipment.

 Targeting craftsmen must ensure that they have a minimum of training and that they know how to read and write.


 Digitization has its preconditions. For example, artisans must first be trained in how to manage their business.


 Timing is everything: you have to choose the right process right from the start. 


it's crucial to ensure that the project is aligned with craftspeople's needs and the country's policies. In our case, working with the 3FPT and the Chambre des Metiers was an element that facilitated targeting. ensure from the outset that women are part of the cohort.
