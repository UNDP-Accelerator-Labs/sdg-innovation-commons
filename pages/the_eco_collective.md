## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



​Our challenge is that the community-based recycling cooperatives in Zanzibar lack adequate training, equipment, financial literacy, and business acumen, particularly in plastic recycling. This hinders their capacity to manage waste effectively and operate sustainable enterprises. Additionally, there is a general lack of knowledge and misconceptions surrounding cooperatives in Zanzibar, leading to inefficiencies and underperformance. Addressing these challenges is crucial for improving waste management practices and enhancing the livelihoods of cooperative members.​

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



​The community-based recycling cooperatives in Zanzibar have emerged in response to escalating waste management challenges, particularly due to rapid urbanization and a booming tourism industry. Historically, Zanzibar has grappled with inadequate formal waste management systems, especially in informal settlements, leading to environmental degradation and health hazards. In an effort to address these issues, grassroots initiatives have formed cooperatives to manage waste more effectively and create sustainable livelihoods.​academia.edu+1ijcrar.com+1

However, these cooperatives face significant obstacles that impede their effectiveness. A critical challenge is the lack of formal systems for solid waste management, which is more pronounced in informal settlements. Additionally, there is a scarcity of dedicated areas for recycling material drop-off, and the absence of a governmental garbage removal system exacerbates the situation. Furthermore, the cooperative movement in Zanzibar has experienced periods of decline, particularly after the Cooperative Union of Tanzania underwent reforms in 1991, leading to weakened organizational and support structures. ​ijcrar.com+1academia.edu+1zanzibarinsiderbuzz.wordpress.comsemanticscholar.org

The current situation is characterized by inefficient waste collection, improper disposal methods, and limited recycling activities. This inefficiency contributes to environmental pollution, posing health risks to the community and diminishing the aesthetic appeal of the islands, which can adversely affect tourism—a vital component of Zanzibar's economy. Moreover, the lack of financial literacy and business knowledge among cooperative members hinders the development of sustainable waste management enterprises, limiting income-generating opportunities and economic growth within these communities.​

Addressing these challenges necessitates a comprehensive approach that includes capacity-building initiatives, infrastructure development, and policy support to empower these cooperatives. Enhancing their operational efficiency and sustainability is crucial for improving waste management practices and fostering socio-economic development in Zanzibar.

​Zanzibar has implemented several initiatives to enhance solid waste management and promote sustainable development. In 2019, the Zanzibar Urban Municipal Council (ZUMC), in collaboration with the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), introduced the Urban Municipal Council Solid Waste Management Regulations. These regulations, the first of their kind in East Africa, are based on the 'Polluter Pays Principle' and aim to improve waste management practices across the island. Building on decentralized waste management pilot projects, such as the successful implementation in Shaurimoyo, these regulations emphasize waste segregation at the source and community involvement. Furthering its commitment to sustainable development, Zanzibar launched the Zanzibar Development Plan (ZADEP) 2021–2026, focusing on the Blue Economy for inclusive growth. This plan includes objectives to implement a National Waste Management Plan and establish dedicated waste disposal areas. These efforts align with Tanzania's broader strategies, as outlined in the Third National Development Plan 2021/22–2025/26, which emphasizes sustainable waste management and environmental conservation. Collectively, these initiatives reflect Zanzibar's proactive approach to addressing waste management challenges and promoting environmental sustainability.​

Recent developments in Zanzibar's waste management landscape underscore the urgency of addressing systemic inefficiencies. The island's ambition to become the world's first Zero Waste archipelago, marked by the launch of a Zero Waste implementation in Unguja on March 4th, 2024, highlights a critical need for sustainable waste management solutions. However, the absence of dedicated recycling drop-off points and a governmental garbage removal system has led to widespread littering across villages, beaches, and roadsides, posing serious health concerns. Grassroots initiatives, such as the crowdmapping of informal urban infrastructure, aim to improve waste management, reflecting a growing community recognition of the problem's severity.
