> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This is a red-hot innovation which we are seeing crossing boarders few months after it goes live in that it addresses the biggest problem in our day to day lives. The innovation has been targeted at the biggest players in mobile money service provision which include all banks and mobile telecommunication companies and we see ourselves getting more clients across Africa as this solution is an icebreaker.

> Technical Feasibility

In these times of constant attempts to hack, or even do social engineering on unsuspecting people, our innovation will protect the many users of mobile money services in that all persuasive messages which are usual the fraud launchers for mobile money fraud, will be flagged as spam and never reach the intended recipient. 
We intend to implement it before this year ends in a phased fashion with a few clients targeted as we perfect it as the clientele grows and the datafile becomes bigger.

> Anticipated Social Impact

From the time we implement the solution, we are anticipating a drastic drop in the number of digital financial fraud cases across the country. This will automatically improve the lives of the Mobile Money users in Zambia as it will bring to an end, any potential loss of money through digital means to fraudsters. 
The solution is relevant to the current market due to the fact that Ecommerce has taken center stage in the day to day lives of Zambian People regardless of status.
