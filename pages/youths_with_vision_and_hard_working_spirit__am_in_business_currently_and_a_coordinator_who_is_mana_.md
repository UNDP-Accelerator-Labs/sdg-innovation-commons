> Brief description of the innovation

Nalusanga area in Mumbwa is an area where is a big population among them youths and women with a heart of wanting to development and help others. Being an area near the Kafue national park game management area, my dream is that of helping youths in a way of engaging them in skills and businesses. One of the always thought as capital is that of strating a welding business and milk production which is believed to be profitable and later open up other ventures and opportunities for more youths like a skills center piggary business.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

If we'll supported welding and milk production shall be of it's kind in the area and shall generate income for both myself and all the other target groups including the community at large. The service in the are shall reduce on distance to welding centers and milk buying found in town. Other ventures to be started from profits like piggary business shall also reduce on illigal activities like poaching. Due to high demand of the mentioned products and services, i believe the business shall have market and less competition or non hence rapid growth.
With time and growth in production, the business will be able to produce condensed milk, and other foods made out of milk, also production and selling of animals for milk production.

This includes first identification of hard working youths as human resource including other partners.
Implementation shall be done in stages depending on level of production, welding business as a big start-up capital shall be done from a well established place at the central location atleast for all to access. This shall be a day to day profit making venture Which shall be producing most of the things like door frames, window frame, molders among others. The business shall require a capital of a big and reliable soler powered generator and all the required equipment and shall be fun in day out support the milk production venture by feeding of animals and buying other needs upto the time of production of milk.
