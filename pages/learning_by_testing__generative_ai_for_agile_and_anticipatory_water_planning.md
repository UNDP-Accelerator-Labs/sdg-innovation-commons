Learning by Testing: Generative AI for Agile and Anticipatory Water Planning
## Challenge statement
****

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is how public officials can leverage generative artificial intelligence tools to review and analyze applications for new connections to the water network, in order to improve the agility and accuracy of the feasibility process with anticipatory capacity*.

 

*Note: Agility and accuracy refer, for example, to improving the cross-referencing of information, analysis, and decision-making between silos (i.e., the internal areas of the State Water Commission responsible for conducting technical analyses to determine the feasibility of a new application). Anticipatory capacity can be applied, for instance, to planning hydraulic infrastructure or adjusting requirements for new developments.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



NOTE: This Action Plan continues AccLab Mexico’s research and development efforts in water management and generative artificial intelligence, as first outlined in our previous Action Plan: “Promoting water sustainability with generative AI: Transforming the feasibilities procedure into a planning tool for water resources management” (go to: https://sdg-innovation-commons.org/pads/action%20plan/2349). In this new Action Plan, we focus on a deeper understanding of the feasibility procedure and on piloting a concrete solution.  

The framing of our current challenge emerged from our previous efforts with the Water Commission to enhance the process for evaluating new water service connections in Querétaro. While the current feasibility analysis provides valuable information, several areas of opportunity for improving the analysis have been identified. Estimating water availability and future demand remains complex due to fragmented and outdated data, limited analytical tools, and coordination challenges across departments and institutions. Additionally, the ability to anticipate and respond to climate variability is constrained by the absence of integrated scenario planning tools. Internally, information silos and the lack of standardized mechanisms for data sharing can delay decision-making. These conditions contribute to a reactive planning environment, instead of a more strategic future-oriented one.

Water scarcity is a big issue in Mexico, including the state of Queretaro. Regarding the total territory in the state of Queretaro, the percentages of areas affected by a particular type of drought are distributed as follows, as shown in the image of the map of Mexico:

0.0% Unaffected

3.8% D0 Abnormally dry

17.6% D1 Moderate drought

15.3% D2 Severe drought

27.2% D3 Extreme drought

36.1% D4 Exceptional drought

This means that a bit more than 60% of the state suffer from the highest types of droughts as of June 2024. 

Furthermore, out of the 18 municipalities in Queretaro, one is experiencing moderate drought, two severe drought, four extreme drought, and eleven exceptional drought, which is the highest form of drought. These numbers show the vulnerability of the state with regards to access to water, illustrating the urgency of tackling this challenge. [1]

According to the Water Information System Monitoring of Mexico’s Major Dams, as of July 2024, Queretaro has 7 damns, 4 of them have reservoir levels of less than 10%, 2 damns have between 11 and 15% and only 1 has a reservoir level of 90%. [2]

Water scarcity in Queretaro has been exacerbated by population growth and an increase in housing. Queretaro stands out due to its economic and industrial development, ranking 5th place on a national level in terms of competitiveness [3]. Due to the competitive job market in the state, in the past years, many people have settled in Queretaro.

Comparing the Population and Housing Census of 2010 with that of 2020, the number of households increased by 63.45%, and the population by 47.9%. The number of households increased to a greater extent. One house was built for every 2.37 inhabitants, as shown in the image with the visualization of statistics. [4]

According to the 2022 National Survey of Household Income and Expenditures (ENIGH), 68.22% of the population in Queretaro has access to piped water and sanitation, and 68.46% have access to safely sourced drinking water and sanitation services.

In this context of water scarcity, population growth and urban development, it is important to address the issue of granting feasibilities for new connections to the hydraulic network in a more sustainable way and based on long-term planning.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.



<div class="group">


> 

We have identified signals in two high level domains: sustainable management of water resources and the use of generative AI in the public sector. We share the signals we identified below.

 

A)    SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

Dams are alarmingly empty:

Due to the water crisis, Queretaro has become the third state in the country with the most dams that do not exceed 30% of their capacity. Back in May 2024, it was reported that  El Centenario, La Llave, and La Venta dams were completely empty [1].

Two of the other four dams in the region barely exceeded this, as they were holding less than 5% of their total capacity.

This signal illustrates the urgency of contributing to the management of water resources in the state.

The privatization of water:

There are 23 concessions granted by the State Water Commission of Queretaro to private companies, including real estate firms for urban housing and commercial developments. Among the main concessionaires are Operadora Querétaro Moderno and Fraccionamientos Selectos I. This situation leads to discontent among the population, many of them complain about excessive prices in the water service [2] [3].

This highlights the dynamics of water in the state between private and public sectors, inviting us to think how the feasibilities process could contribute to a better planning of water resources in the future, and better decision making when it comes to deciding if the provision of water should be a private or public enterprise.

The impact of water scarcity in productive activities:

Small and medium-sized producers working in the primary sector, such as agriculture, livestock, or fishing, have seen their productivity decline due to the effects of the drought. Aquaculture producers blame low water levels for limiting fish farming. Aquaculturists in the region point out that several of their colleagues have migrated to the United States due to the income drop caused by these conditions.

Additionally, agricultural and livestock producers have also experienced reduced production due to low reservoir levels. Even if it rains, there is inadequate infrastructure for water capturing. [4] [5]

This situation showcases how various sectors are being affected by the water crisis and invites us to think how the feasibility procedure for new water connections for housing and commercial use could be managed in a more sustainable way in order to ensure access to water in the future not only for new constructions, but also for productive activities.

Another signal that illustrates this situation is related to the fact that Queretaro has become a hub for investment with the arrival of several data centers. However, it is anticipated that in the long term, energy demands may not be met. This is exacerbated by bureaucratic procedures, as companies often lack information about how the energy they use is generated. And in addition to energy, access to water to operate the data centers will also put great pressure on the water resources of the state.

 

Social response to government’s actions around water management:

Grassroots organizations and indigenous collectives in the region are actively involved in addressing various issues, which are highlighted below:

-Due to the "land use change voted by the council allowing 66,641 square meters settled in the area, 409 apartments will be built in four-story buildings, where a mall and services will be integrated" in the El Batán area, favoring real estate interests, environmental groups seek to designate several areas as protected zones [6].

-The Museo del Agua Bajo Tierra has published reports on the privatization of water in Querétaro and criticizes the "Ley Kuri," or concessions law, which regulates the provision of drinking water, sewage, and sanitation services, as well as unplanned real estate growth and overexploitation of water in urban areas.

  -In 2022, the Caravana por la Vida mobilized several of these groups to the Otomí region in Santiago Mexquititlan and took over a well as a form of protest against excessive charges and the criminalization of activists. The Indigenous Council of Santiago Mexquititlán "also commemorated their own struggle, which began on March 31, 2021, against what they described as an attempt to dispossess their community of their well with water pipes owned by a private companies protected by state police," expressing concerns about the management of a well by the State’s Water Commission, which they affirm was built by their ancestors [7].

The examples presented above show some of the dynamics and challenges that surround the management of water resources and its linkage with land use. This highlights the involvement of various sectors in the issue, which invites us to think about possible links with their involvement in the creation of a feasibilities procedure focused on planning.

B)    USE OF GENERATIVE AI IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR

 Since the surge of generative AI, its adoption in the public sector has generated examples of how this technology can improve the way governments operate. And while the examples are relatively new and scarce, this technology has the potential to enhance —and even transform— the way governments operate. As shown in the image, some of the trends of using generative AI include improve speed and efficiency of public services and engagement, optimize employee time by reducing manual processes, draw insights to empower decision-makers, etc. [8].

On the other hand, the huge impact that AI systems can have in various domains of our lives call for a critical, thoughtful, imaginative and cautious approach to designing AI strategies.

As Vaugh Tan frames it: “To have good AI strategy, we need to make reasoned decisions about:

1.     What humans can do which AI systems cannot — these are tasks which should be done by humans.

2.     What AI systems can do much better than humans — these are tasks which AI systems should be built to do.” [9]

This becomes particularly urgent in the context of public services because these systems need to ensure human-rights, inclusion, ethics, transparency. Thus, it becomes imperative that we define pathways to design good AI strategies for deploying these systems in the public sector.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The Accelerator Lab adds unique value by operating in a practice-oriented, experimental mode—designing and testing proof-of-concept solutions in real-world conditions. Building on prior systemic analysis, the Lab will apply agile methodologies to prototype a AI tool and generate rapid learnings to inform future iterations. This approach enables low-risk exploration of innovative pathways and supports public institutions in making more informed, data-driven decisions.

 At the same time, the Lab’s convening power and participatory methods foster collaboration across institutional and sectoral boundaries. In a context where UNDP Mexico is still building its profile in AI and digitalization, this work positions the Country Office as a credible partner for inclusive and sustainable tech adoption. The Lab’s connection to a global learning network further amplifies its impact, allowing it to share insights and draw from international experiences.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?



AccLab Mexico is exploring how generative AI can help public officials review water connection requests more efficiently—boosting accuracy, breaking silos, and enabling anticipatory planning for sustainable water infrastructure.

## Closing
****

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?



Governments currently implementing or interested in applying AI to public service delivery—especially agencies responsible for water resource management—stand to benefit from this work. Additionally, regulatory bodies overseeing AI and those involved in establishing regulatory sandboxes may find value in these insights. NGOs and academic institutions dedicated to advancing inclusive AI technologies for public sector innovation, as well as private sector organizations focused on AI applications in government, are also key stakeholders to engage early in the growth phase.
