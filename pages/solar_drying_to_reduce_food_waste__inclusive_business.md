## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Name of the experimental activity

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

> On date (Day/Month/Year)

> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- 

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- 

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:
## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

20-40% food grown in India spoils before reaching consumers. Small shelf life is one of the reasons. Can we have in situ technologies to increase shelf life of food without loss of nutrients? 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If shelf-life of agriculture commodities are increased, food waste can be reduced and local economy improves with additional resource 

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Startup-led design & business model which includes solar drying,  decentralized processing of commodities, addressing food wastage and perishability issues, ensuring product quality and buy back guarantee. Women micro-entrepreneurs are earning an additional income through this model.

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Parameters measured: Quantity of food loss reduced, No.of women entrepreneurs, Additional income to women entrepreneurs 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Quantitative data collected by S4S

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

2 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 2-9

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling

> Please upload any supporting images or visuals for this experiment.

## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

Results:

36,000 tons/year food loss reduced. Over 6,000 women micro-entrepreneurs are being supported through this model. Women entrepreneurs are earning Rs 35,000- Rs 100,000 per annum.
## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

 

With AccLab collaboration S4S produced tomato powder for the first time and the experiment was successful. Food loss of 16% tomatoes from tomatoes each year can be prevented.

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

S4S model is scaling fast with worldbank funded projects in multiple states. With Accelerator Lab facilitation UNDP is adopting solar drying model in multiple proposals led by Inclusive Growth portfolio for large scale implementation. Accelerator Lab is facilitating this Scale-Out
