## 

"An innovative new app for Real-time Amazon Fire Monitoring (see&nbsp;MAAP #118&nbsp;for details).


In a&nbsp;novel approach, the app combines data from the  atmosphere (aerosol emissions in smoke) and the ground (heat anomaly  alerts) to effectively detect and visualize major Amazon fires.




The app specializes in filtering out thousands of  the heat-based fire alerts to prioritize only those burning large 
amounts of biomass and thus emitting elevated levels of aerosol (defined here as a major fire)."
