UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab - Energy Factsheet
MAY 12, 2022
The UNDP Uganda Accelerator Lab has undertaken a portfolio of experiments on the challenge of deforestation, born from several explorative methodologies used to identify key priorities for intervention. This portfolio includes an energy audit of large institutions, innovative financing to stimulate supply and demand of renewable cooking technologies, exploring behavioral change to adopt renewable cooking technologies, and design of the Uganda Natural Resource Information System (NARIS) to monitor and map forest cover. The Accelerator Lab has formed an active and collaborative effort involving Government, private sector, academic institutions, development partners and civil society actors – including traditional institutions and local communities – to identify transformative energy solutions.
