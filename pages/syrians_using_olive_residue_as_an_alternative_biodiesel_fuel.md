> What is the name of the solution holder? (main contact person, if multiple)

it is now a common solution adopted in many places, we could not track down the person or community that started it 

> What is the purpose of the solution? (brief problem & solution description)

Challenge: Scarcity of fuel, electricity  Solutions: Syrian communities are now using olive waste to make fuel to heat homes during the winter, to cook, and use in commercial activities.  The fuel is basically made from the olive residue called " birin" which is the leftover of the oil-making process. leftovers come mainly from the pulps(seeds) that are not used. This pulpy residue is pressed into the shape of cylinders dried in the sun and then
