## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

Challenge

In Coordinating with the Programs Department: We learned that one of our biggest challenges was coordinating with the programs department, especially when integrating new partnerships that were seen as unconventional or disruptive to ongoing projects. To address this, we recommend fostering a culture of open innovation and systems thinking within the department. This involves organizing joint workshops and communication forums to align different departments with the innovative potential of these new partnerships.

Financial

Process Inflexibility: We faced a critical issue when a partner was ready to contribute $300,000 USD, but we were unable to provide the necessary charter of accounts to receive the funds. This was due to the funds not aligning with ongoing projects, and our country office management's perspective on project implementation. To overcome such challenges, we propose the development of more agile financial processes that can accommodate a wider range of funding sources and project types, thereby enhancing our capacity to engage with diverse financial opportunities.

Difficulties in Drafting New Types of Agreements: Our experience highlighted the lack of existing templates or frameworks for drafting agreements that encompass UNDP, government entities, and the private sector. Recognizing this gap, we see an opportunity to develop new, flexible templates for multi-sector collaboration. This initiative would not only solve our immediate problem but also position us as a leader in facilitating innovative partnerships.

Administrative and Legal Hurdles: The challenge in drafting new types of MOUs points to a broader issue in administrative and legal preparedness for innovative partnerships. We recommend establishing a task force dedicated to creating adaptable legal frameworks for such collaborations, thus ensuring that we are equipped to handle similar challenges in the future.

Organizational

Alignment with Field Innovations: Finally, we encountered a misalignment between our field-level initiatives and the broader organizational strategy, particularly in terms of project support and implementation. To address this, we suggest initiating strategic dialogues with higher management to realign our field innovations with the organizational goals, ensuring that these initiatives are not only recognized but also fully supported and integrated into our overarching strategy.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Comprehensive

Environmental Insight: Traditional data sources often lack the

granularity needed for detailed environmental analysis. Climate data fills

this gap by providing specific, localized information crucial for

sustainable city planning.

High-Resolution

Spatial Analysis: Existing urban data might not be sufficient for

detailed spatial analysis. Drone and satellite data offer high-resolution,

up-to-date imagery that is essential for accurate planning and monitoring.

Dynamic

Urban Mapping: Traditional mapping techniques may not capture the

rapidly changing landscapes of modern cities. Geospatial data provides

dynamic mapping capabilities, allowing for more effective urban

development and land use planning.

Real-Time

Urban Monitoring: Traditional urban management systems often operate

on outdated or static data. Sensor networks provide real-time data,

allowing for immediate responses to urban challenges and facilitating the

development of a truly 'smart' city infrastructure.
