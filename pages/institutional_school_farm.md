## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

Can we increase accessibility and affordability of locally grown food in times of disaster / COVID-19

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF we improve food availability in outer islands, then we can improve food security in sensitive times like disaster

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

Enlist partners to co-design the pilot and survey

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Increase in food availability and employment of youth

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

surveys

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

6 months

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

30% of solution mappers and experimenters time.
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven.

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

A clear design and planning and clearly articulated roles of everyone involved.

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

Almost an year.

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

Approximately 15K

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No.

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, the learnings from the experiments were incorporated into similar projects supported by the Canadian High Commission, the funding was provided by the Commission to Blue Lagoon Initiative.

> Please include any supporting images that could be used to showcase this activity

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Lack of communication; experiment was implemented on a maritime island zone; poor planning; UNDP Procurement process; 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

Resilience and Sustainable Development Team

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Ministry of Education- the learnings could be incorporated into the students curriculum, the students and teachers of Beq-Yanuca Secondary School- they learn of new methodologies and innovation in agriculture; the local community has expanded knowledge of environmentally sustainable practices; other donor or funding bodies who would be willing to scale the experiment.

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We changed the logistical affairs, and how the approach to involving village elders in order to dilute the gate-keeping governance structures.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Involve all stake holders who would be affected by the experiment from the initial stages.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

SDG 3- Good Health and Wellbeing. There is a nutritional component in the experiment which could add to SDG 3.

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

We identified food security as an entry point for the AccLab from Climate Security for low-lying atolls/coastal zone, but we did not carry enough exploration of the food security space to inform the experiment.
