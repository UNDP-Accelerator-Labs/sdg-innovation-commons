## Title

Digital Transformation in the Thai Government
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the Thai government wants to implement digital transformation to improve the effectiveness of their public services delivery but the Government does not know where to start and have unclear priorities. Systems are also disconnected and the digital transformation journey has been hampered by a lack of coordination and not taking a whole of government and whole of society approach to digital investments

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The challenge aligns with the Thai government's Thailand 4.0 policy which aims to ensure that the Thai economy continues modernising, building on previous economic development models which emphasise agriculture (Thailand 1.0), light industry (Thailand 2.0), and advanced industry (Thailand 3.0).  Thailand 4.0 has four objectives: 1. Economic Prosperity: to create a value-based economy that is driven by innovation, technology, and creativity.  2. Social Wellbeing: to create a progressive society that realises the full potential of all members of society.  3. Raising Human Values: to raise Thailand’s HDI from 0.722 to 0.8 within 10 years, and for at least five Thai universities to rank amongst the World’s top 100.  4. Environmental Protection: to develop an economic system capable of adjusting to climate change and a low carbon society.  Government reform is critical for Thailand 4.0. Office of the Public Sector Development Commission (OPDC) leads the Government 4.0 initiative, of which digital transformation is particularly important. It is understood that the implementation of any comprehensive digitalization may require changes in the Rules of Business/Procedure of the government or even legal amendment. The process will require detailed discussions among relevant stakeholders and could be time consuming, however, without digital transformation it is hardly possible to face our current and future challenges and thrive in the 21st century.  Given that digital transformation can be a complex undertaking that requires a strategic approach - including identifying current gaps and opportunities, against a broader understanding of intended objectives, OPDC asked for UNDP to support in identifying needs and challenges as well as providing recommendations for the successful implementation of digital transformation roadmap for Thailand. With UNDP’s mandate as an integrator of sustainable development, and recognising that the future of development is digital, UNDP promotes inclusive, human rights-based approaches to digital transformation. Hence, this discovery work with OPDC and GDSI will help UNDP identify the priorities and entry points through which it can support the Thai Government in promoting accessibility and inclusion in digital transformation

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Given the lab's expertise and past experience on digital technologies and innovations, the Lab is well placed to address this challenge on behalf of UNDP Thailand Country Office. This is worth investing as the learning insights are intended to serve as an “entry point” for increased engagement between governments, COs, and a broad range of UNDP experts as digital transformation is relevant and touching upon almost all government agencies and government processes/ services.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

UNDP Accelerator Lab is supporting the Thai Government in its digital government transformation journey by conducting a digital needs assessment. Data sharing, digital skills and digital governance have been identified as key priorities that need to be urgently addressed.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The obvious partner that will benefit from this work is the Office of Public Sector Development Commission as it is within their mandate to drive the Government 4.0 and digital government transformation journey. However, other relevant government agencies that have mandates relevant to digital aspects from driving digital economy to promoting open data would also benefit from this work. For example, Digital Government Development Agency, Electronic Transaction Development Agency,  Office of the National Digital Economy and Society Commission, etc. For the next phase, the Accelerator Lab will be working closely with relevant partners in rolling out some of the suggested recommendations.
