At present, worldwide cement consumption is approximately 4.5 billion tonnes per year. The primary ingredients in the cement require heating up to 1450 °C, accounting for 40–50% of CO2 emissions globally.
One of the main goals of this research is to achieve sustainable construction materials to reduce the overuse of virgin materials used to produce cement and coarse and fine aggregates. The utilization of industrial by-products such as palm oil clinker (POC), palm oil fuel ash (POFA), and fly ash (FA), steel slag, manufactured sand as cement and aggregate replacement, or as additional cementation materials have had a constructive effect in minimizing greenhouse gas emissions.
The suitability of using more sustainable materials for concrete production and other applications was investigated. The approach taken was to make material substitutions so that the environmental, energy, and CO2 impact of concrete could be reduced. This was accomplished by using the local industrial waste materials in our various research, such as the construction of low-cost houses, the development of blast-resistant slabs using oil palm shells, the construction of the first cement-free geopolymer house in Universiti Malaya campus, and recycled plastic aggregate pavements, and the development of self-healing bricks using microalgae.
