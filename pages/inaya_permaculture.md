Inaya Permaculture was founded in 2017 as an outcome of a thorough and lengthy study of our planet’s current ecological state and needs. Our postmodern, consumerist and industrial lifestyle threatens the very survival of Man as a specie. We need to act now to ensure the well-being of future generations.

We tackle these issues through Permaculture training and project design and implementation.

By doing so, we hope to improve the conditions of the soils, plants, animals, water, energy systems and us the people, the true inheritors of the lands.
