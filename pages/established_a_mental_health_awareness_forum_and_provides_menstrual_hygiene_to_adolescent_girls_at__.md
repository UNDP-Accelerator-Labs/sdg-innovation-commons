> Title of the innovation

Established a mental health awareness forum and provides menstrual hygiene to adolescent girls at secondary schools in rural areas

> Brief description of the innovation

The Mental Awareness Forum was designed to help families and individuals identify threats to their psychological wellbeing and learn where they could receive professional help from.. During the CORONA virus pandemic, the forum utilises virtual conferences to raise such awareness.. Through PTAs and head teachers, the forum has designed a program  to help vulnerable young girls attain menstrual hygiene education and support.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Mental health problems are among the most expensive health issues and Zambia has a low number of physicians in this field.. This program will prompt the academic market to train more professionals.. In order to reach out to more adolescent girls in rurals secondary schools, the forum requires funding for logistics and allowances but most importantly, for donating more sanitary towels as awareness is being raised.

> Technical Feasibility

After identifying an existing mental health concern, a target group is defined and then a mental health expert within or outside the forum is identified to share knowledge on that matter virtually or otherwise. Menstrual hygiene is done virtually to address a larger scope but donations are made in person

> Anticipated Social Impact

If young and old people can acknowledge the impact of alcoholism and substance abuse on productivity and social life then seek professional help ad recommended, society would have a more informed and productive workforce. Menstrual hygiene and donations will help reduce the number of vulnerable adolescent girls that miss school due to a lack of sanitary towels.
