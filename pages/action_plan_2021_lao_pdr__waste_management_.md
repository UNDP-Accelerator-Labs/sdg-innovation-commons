## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Action Plan 2021-Lao PDR (Waste Management)
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that insufficient waste management in Vientiane still lingers which requires systemic change with multiple partnerships, novel data and collective solutions. 

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

Vientiane, home to more than 900,000 people, produces more than 700-800 tons of waste daily.  Trash is collected by the municipality only if you have a contract, and it comes at a price. Businesses and homes without contracts – that account for about 70 percent of the population in Vientiane – throw their trash anywhere and everywhere: in heaps by the roadside, in open spaces and fields, and sometimes straight into the Mekong River.   According to the Vientiane City Office for Management and Services (VCOMS), only 27 percent of the city’s population had contracts for waste collection in 2018. This presents a major challenge, as pollution from garbage affects the air, soil and water, which in turn affects public health.  

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

Our unique value in solving this challenge has been the ability to convene stakeholder dialogue and partnership. Apart from that, we have identified and mapped local solutions and innovation which can be experimented and scaled. Besides, novel data and methodologies have been appreciated by the UNDP country office and relevant partners. Poor waste management and open burning has been alarming issue and will continue to grow exponentially in the future due Covid19 (medical waste, returned migrants, economic downturn etc.) and urbanization. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

Vientiane Capital is not as clean as it's supposed to be. Poor waste management poses sight & smell pollution and open burning is a concern to public health. UNDP A-Lab has worked with various types of partners to address this issue by applying system & data driven approach.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?



> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test
- Grow

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We use tools of behavioural insights to understand stakeholder behaviour and attitude towards waste management and their needs/choices. Citizen science and collective intelligence are applied to understand the issue by involving many people especially those who affected by the problem to collect data and discuss the problem & its impact. These also link to solution mapping which various solutions from different dimensions are explored and assessed. System thinking is used to map level of solutions, stakeholders and impact and how things are interconnected, where the entry point will be, and who the champions are. 

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

We could identify hotspot locations and frequency. However, we need data to measure the volume of each type of waste. AQI data can be used to compliment and help with the deeper analysis.
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

This challenge leads to the transboundary air pollution and large environmental issues. The SDGi Integrated Policy Modeling and Systems-based Engagement for Transboundary Air Pollution Mitigation is regional project aiming to develop integrated policy model in Thailand and Lao PDR. Now we are conducting a deep listening process to map the system. The champions are Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment-multi departments.
