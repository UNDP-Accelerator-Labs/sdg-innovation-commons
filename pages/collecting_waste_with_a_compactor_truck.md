## Overview
**This section is to explain the basics of the activity**

> Prepared by (Name of the experimenter)

Javier Brolo and Juan Pablo Rustrián 



> On date (Day/Month/Year)

April 19th, 2022



> Current status of experimental activity

> What portfolio does this activity correspond to? If any

Co-creation of waste management solutions



> What is the frontier challenge does this activity responds to?

How to improve the collaboration between society and public institutions to increase resilience to climate change



> What is the learning question(from your action learning plan) is this activity related to?

How to improve waste management



> Please categorize the type that best identifies this experimental activity:

- Quasi Experimental (Analytical, observations, etc)

> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- United Nations agency
- Public Sector

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Municipalities, Waste collectors, The ministry of

environment and Natural Resources, Communications area at UNDP 


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to know if the use of a compactor truck will reduce waste collection costs. This is an important experiment to run because it's not clear that investing in a compactor truck will yield results. Often, there are incentives to propose solutions that involve acquiring expensive equipment; however, there may not be effective or necessary. 



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If a compactor truck is used for waste collection; then the costs of moving the waste will be reduced



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The compactor truck will be acquired on a temporary basis (ideally rented). The routes and collection days will be defined. For each trip, it will be recorded if the compactor truck is used or not, the mileage at departure and at the end, the time of departure and arrival, the initial and final weight. The route must start with a full tank and the volume of fuel will be recorded to fill it up again at the end of the route. With the information collected, a statistical test will be carried out to assess whether there is a significant difference in transportation costs and, if so, to know the difference (how much is it?).



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Each journey traveled per day (routes).



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

We´d collect data from direct observations and GPS to track the distance for each route, a sensor will be used to measure the weight.



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

1 Month



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Skills to measure and analyze the weight of collected waste.
