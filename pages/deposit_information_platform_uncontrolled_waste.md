In the Faladiè SEMA-Bamako district of Faladiè, the Lab team discovered a small company called "MAP Action" which has developed an application that provides timely information on uncontrolled waste disposal sites. Also, this application allows the mapping of dumps and facilitates decision making regarding their management. It plans to mobilise statistical data in this sector using this application, which uses satellite and UAV images. This will make up for the lack of statistics on waste production in the city of Bamako.
