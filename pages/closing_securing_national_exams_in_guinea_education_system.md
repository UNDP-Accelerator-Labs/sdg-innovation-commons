## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1- The level of perception of teachers involved in the process of securing exams. 

2- The behavior of the candidates faced with all this arsenal of security. 

3- The quality of the equipment deployed and its impact on the conduct of the exams. 

4- The challenge of the existence of social networks in the face of a system resulting from an orientation of 1997. 

5- The whole system put in place to guarantee zero leakage and less fraud.

> Did you experience any barriers or bottlenecks when impacting the system, working on your frontier challenge respectively?

The examination circuit is composed of the following levels: the production of subjects whose challenges still remain the lack of computer equipment and also the related capacity building. Their transport to and from examination sites: the vulnerability of which is reflected in the fact of physically conveying the subjects in buildings with police protection. During the exams, the invasion of the centers by foreign people because of the unfenced places, the misuse of social networks to interfere with the exam which remains and remains one of the major challenges to the smooth running of these exams And the correction : whose challenge remains the level of professionalism of the agents hired for this purpose

it was for me a kind of structured way to work and exchange with stakeholders so that things went softly and quickly.
