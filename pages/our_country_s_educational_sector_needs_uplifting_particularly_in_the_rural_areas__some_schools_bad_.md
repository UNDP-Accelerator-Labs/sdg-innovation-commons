> Title of the innovation

Our country's educational sector needs uplifting particularly in the rural areas. Some schools badly have furniture. This sector really needs furniture. My innovation is to set up manufacturing plant in the rural areas to specifically with the force to manufacture furniture for rural schools. These manufacturing plant should also be centres to in part skills to the youth in the rural communities.

> Brief description of the innovation

These manufacturing plants with draw man power from the locals in their respective areas thereby in powering the local communities as well as in parting skills in the youths. Skills in carpentry, welding as well as building. The rural communities have very little opportunities hence this innovation that will give these rural communities an opportunity of a life time.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Being manufacturing plants income will be generated through the sale of the furniture that will be manufactured in these manufacturing plants. Since most of the materials will be sourced locally the products will be sold at affordable price so that the rural child can use the furniture as get educated.
These manufacturing plants will improve operations of existing businesses in that the plants will depend on existing businesses for materials needed in the manufacturing of the furniture.
Target markets will include both the government and the private sector
The challenge prize will help grow the business in that the manufacturing plants will acquire machinery which will help in producing quality products
Value addition of this innovation on the environment is that since these manufacturing plants target to employ the rural communities, yes in powering these communities who currently depend on charcoal burning for their living. Meaning therefore that charcoal burning will be gone and the environment will heal as these manufacturing plants will also embark on tree planting.

> Technical Feasibility

This innovation is designed to not only equip rural schools with furniture but give give local communities employment as well as skills to the rural youths.
The proposed implementation plan for this innovation will include seeking technical help from the government and institutions like universities as well as international organisations like USAID and the like.

> Anticipated Social Impact

Like already explained this innovation will definitely improve the lives of others since local communities will have work,youth will be equipped with skills.
The proposed innovation will be relevant to the current market since most of the school furniture comes from outside the country and expensive. That is the reason why most rural schools have no furniture.
The manufacturing plant intends to provide school furniture that will be affordable for the rural market
