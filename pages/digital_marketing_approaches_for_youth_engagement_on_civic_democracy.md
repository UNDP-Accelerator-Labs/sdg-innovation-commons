## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Digital marketing approaches for youth engagement on civic democracy
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that interventions targeting information pollution (online misinformation and disinformation) receive significantly less engagement than the harmful content which spreads faster than ever in an increasingly interconnected world. Therefore it is important now more than ever to explore innovative approaches of amplifying the right content to the target audiences in order to maximise impact of digital interventions.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The development of information and communications technology has significantly changed how we interact with and perceive the world around us. These technologies have been vital for economic and social development, the dissemination of and access to information, and offer an opportunity for greater participation in political processes and public debate. Unfortunately, the negative impacts of these developments have been amplified as well. Hate speech and other forms of information pollution have been exacerbated by online business models and social media algorithms, leading to increased intolerance, discrimination, division, and violence. Additionally, the overabundance of information pollution has the potential to undermine social cohesion and decrease trust in public institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the magnitude of these issues and the danger they pose for the Sustainable Development Goals.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Accelerator Lab was able to support the CO in mobilising in-kind resources through the Chief Digital Office from Google through their Search Ad Grants. Search campaigns allow non-profits like UNDP to place ads across Google's vast network of search results and reach audiences with highly targeted advertising to increase engagement. The Lab provided leadership in the design of the project concept, and the technical skills in the project implementation and reporting phases, working closely with the Governance portfolio colleagues. This was particularly crucial since Kenya was undergoing a General Elections in August 2022 and this initiative helped to enrich the existing portfolio of interventions related to elections support.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.

To help drive global recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, Google committed $20 million in free advertising for 2021 to select UN agencies through their Ad Grants Crisis Relief Fund, with UNDP establishing a spending goal of $1.5 million. The “Fighting Hate and False Narratives” initiative was jointly created by UNDP Crisis Bureau and Oslo Governance Centre to amplify the work of UNDP Country Offices through Google Ads. Essentially, COs created Google Search ads that directed users to a landing page of their choice. Of the eleven COs selected to participate in this campaign, three had to withdraw due to difficulties including obtaining government authorization for the creation of sites, the postponement of content creation, and delays on approval of created content from external stakeholders. The initiative was launched in the summer of 2021 with the first campaigns being launched in August of the same year and was extended till December 2022.

## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

The initiative highlights the potential reach that targeted online campaigns may have, despite the
limitations and challenges of not only reaching the right audience but also promoting
behavioural change through the campaigns and measuring this change. Additionally, this provides evidence of successful partnership models between UNDP and Big Tech partners which can be scaled at a corporate level.


Advertising tools such
as Google Ads offer the potential for extensive promotion of projects conducted by UNDP
and other UN entities and the possibility of expanding the reach of the produced content.
