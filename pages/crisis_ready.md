## Learnings on your challenge
****

> What are the top key insights you generated about your learning challenge during this Action Learning Plan? (Please list a maximum of 5 key insights) 

The importance of doing background research for evidence-based decision-making. The partner we initially started with did not do enough research for the co-designing workshop, which affected the workshop results. 

A backup plan for projects led by CO team members is necessary because it could take longer, and the lab would have little autonomy over the project activities. 

Disaster education is under developed in Jordan, especially that people do not see it as a priority because of generally safe environment in Jordan and fear of official institutions of addressing such topics as not to spread fear among people.

> Considering the outcomes of this learning challenge, which of the following best describe the handover process? (Please select all that apply)

- Other

> Can you provide more detail on your handover process?

The project is still pending partners' feedback and moving forward. 
## Data and Methods
****

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

Jordan does not have recent experiences with large-scale natural disasters. Looking at other people's experiences and working with the Civil Defence in workshops based on their missions abroad was helpful and provided a solid basis for discussions and design. 

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Prototyping in the workshop with designers helped determine that we were not initially addressing the right problem. While we invested more money than the usual in that workshop, that prototyping showed us that it was not a feasible idea (making rescue tools for the general public) and that directed us to use other data sources and methods and shifted our approach to the project.

## End
****

> Bonus question: How did the interplay of innovation methods, new forms of data and unusual partners enable you to learn &amp; generate insights, that otherwise you would have not been able to achieve?

We believe we helped the project team manager tap into an evidence-based intervention, using examples from the earthquake in Syria and Japan's long history of working in disaster education. 

> Please upload any further supporting evidence / documents / data you have produced on your frontier challenge that showcase your learnings.
