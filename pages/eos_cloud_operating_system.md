> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

The web applications on offer are our unique offering. Any operating system is as good as its applications. We have very good applications that generate income independently with different models. On offer is also the ability to earn money from your newsfeed. This feature allows you to earn advertiser money from likes, comments and watching ads and redirected visits. We will earn from withdrawals of this money from our platform by charging a withdrawal fee.

> Technical Feasibility

website and mobile applications will be created. Web hosting and dropbox yearly fees will be paid and most of the money channeled into advertising and promotions. After 6 months of this, our models are self sustaining meaning they will be able to make money with more investment.

> Anticipated Social Impact

People will make money from our platform which will improve living standards and reduce poverty levels. The number of people using our cloud OS in the launch month of august was 914 sign ups in one month! We expect it to have economic impact as it is open to the world and will generate more foreign currency coming in as internationals try to add money and make it from our platform.
