## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

With this work we experimented hand washing devices and behavior on hand washing practice. During our field observation, there are basically three types of hand washing devices. A bucket or water tank with faucet and pedal operated hand washing devices. We have also observed some hand washing devices connected a tap water and there are also some basic hand washing devices like a jerrican with small hole and nail used as a faucet. We didn’t notice much message on hand hygiene on the devices except some stickers about the sponsors. With this experiment we will see how people respond to different types technologies, messages and pictures about hand washing. Specific learning goals were to see if nicely designed products improve user experience, learn if messages on hand washing device improve hand washing practice and learn the impact of different types of messages will have on hand washing experience. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

-  If we promote a well-designed and user-centred hand washing stations, then people are more likely to wash their hands.  -  If we post a message about handwashing on handwashing stations, then people are more likely to wash their hands. -  If we post messaging that elicit an emotional response, then people are more likely to wash their hands

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, the same group but before the intervention

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- Random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

The team tested two different types of handwashing stations and three messages with each device. We used the same traditional coffee shop from our observation to experiment, in consultation with the owners. We placed the handwashing facility at the entrance of the coffee shop where it was visible and accessible to clientele. The experiment was based on observation at peak hours of the coffee shop from 10 am –1:30 pm for ten days to capture the experience of hand washing. 

> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

Number of people washed their hands in comparison with different types of hand washing solutions and messages. 

> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Head counting number of people and observe their actions 

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

10 days 

> What is the estimated sample size?

- More than 1,000

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

80 hours of Acc Lab team
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

· In general, there was a low level of handwashing practice regardless of the type of handwashing stations and messages used, with only 83 of the total 2,003 customers observed washing their hands. · Text-only messages got the greatest number of handwashing compared to those with only pictorial messages. · People responded better to the commanding message than the emotional or informational messages. · The number of customers who washed their hands increased with the new pedal-operated handwashing station. · We didn’t see a consistent pattern on the effects of our messages between the two devices. While messages used on the regular hand washing station increased the number of hand washes, the pedal-operated handwashing stations didn’t show as much improvement. (see numbers below) · People follow and wash their hands when they see other customers washing their hands. · 74% of the customers who washed their hands followed the WHO recommendations of washing hands

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

No significant change on methodology 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

A month

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

About 800 USD to purchase different types of hand washing solutions and printing

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

No 

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

Yes, the lab leveraged the partnership between UNDP and Dalberg Catalyst on the Safe Hands Ethiopia coalition on COVID-19 to scale up the learnings from our experiment. The coalition bought together the private sector, government and civil society to provide information for vulnerable communities and provide sanitary materials by aligning the private sector’s production of sanitary products with the distribution capacity of the government.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> 

Specific learning goals were to see if nicely designed products improve user experience, learn if messages on hand washing device improve hand washing practice and learn the impact of different types of messages will have on hand washing experience. 

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

· In general, there was a low level of handwashing practice regardless of the type of handwashing stations and messages used, with only 83 of the total 2,003 customers observed washing their hands. · Text-only messages got the greatest number of handwashing compared to those with only pictorial messages. · People responded better to the commanding message than the emotional or informational messages. · The number of customers who washed their hands increased with the new pedal-operated handwashing station. · We didn’t see a consistent pattern on the effects of our messages between the two devices.

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Some issues related to quality of hand washing solutions 

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

UNDP and Dalberg Catalyst on the Safe Hands Ethiopia coalition on COVID-19 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

Businesses selling different types of hand washing solutions, NGOs, government 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

No

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

See our blog on this.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Perhaps, on something related behavioral change communication 

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Actually, it's our sensing and exploration exercise that set the basis for this simple experiment. 

> What surprised you?

In general, there was a low level of handwashing practice regardless of the type of handwashing stations and messages used, with only 83 of the total 2,003 customers observed washing their hands even during pick Covid transmission . We didn't expect this.
