Food Waste Interventions
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

The challenge is that Food Waste is assumed to be one of the highest waste categories, given to multiple causations, such as cultural roots, missing recycling facilities, regulations, and many others.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

The history of excessive consumption of food goes back to the historic Arabian hospitalities, where generosity and magnanimity are signs of wealth and prosperity. For causations, the Arabian peninsula lived in extreme poverty, thirst, and hunger before oil discovery. Hence food was a sign of wealth and prosperity. With oil discovery, sudden and rapid wealth and abundant supply of everything made food remain a sign of wealth and prosperity in formal and informal accusations. Moreover, Saudis share a rare phenomenon with other societies in the region, where individuals insist on paying the bills rather than others. This also shows that cultural hospitality is a driver of food waste. Moreover, regulations, recycling cycle gaps, information, and awareness are missing pieces that add to this complexity. The current situation is that the leadership wants to reduce food waste by 50% in vision 2030. Hence, many organization entities are working to achieve this, like SIRC, SAGO, and SFDA.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

According to SAGO’s report (Saudi Grains Organization) 2,325 million tons of foods are wasted in Saudi Arabia, this number is estimated from 38k samples from different food supply chain sites such as; domestic residents, HoReCa & retail stores. Accordingly, and to UNEP; Saudi Arabia’s information around food waste is considered high confidence due to its diverse sampling sites from the supply chain. However, according to Dr. Abdulrahman Al-Khorayef, SAGO’s Head of Scientific Study Team “Such assessments are reliant on limited datasets collected across the food supply chain”. Moreover, SAGO’s samples do successfully show “what” food categories are wasted such as rice, meat, or bread, but it does not show spatiotemporal elements; where down to street or neighborhood levels and when down to weeks or days levels of foods are being wasted.

> Qualitative evidence: What weak signals have you recently spotted that characterizes its urgency? Please provide qualitative information that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge. You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Etaam (Saudi Food Bank) stated that they receive calls to collect excessive foods most from weddings and social events, also Ramadan month is recognized nationwide as the greatest month to waste foods due to excessive grocery shopping amongst residents before and during the month. Where diets and everyday meals change for many families, this leads households to buy new items for recipes that they weren't to cook unless it's Ramadan. Furthermore, the awareness campaigns during Ramadan and around weddings and banquet halls do not serve their purpose and their effects are not seen by many stakeholders. Moreover, a positive weak signal that may multiply to other regions in KSA is that the Governor of Asir (Asir is a region in Saudi Arabia) banned large banquets in the principality's social events. This act may echo to Asir's society and other regions to follow this lead, especially since the people of Asir regions (and KSA's south region) are known for their food generosity.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

The Saudi AccLab is well-positioned in an unbiased position to form a bird view on the current situation and understand the challenges, hence designing leveraged interventions. The Saudi AccLab connects national challenges with the global best practices, where tools and methodologies meet to make the change. The AccLab have the flexibility to make experiment and mistakes that UNDP usually does not have, where the lab's network support and best practices offer advantages to other stakeholders in the country. Nevertheless, reducing Food Waste is a goal set by the government in Saudi Vision 2030. This is aligned with our counterpart and tackles a main issue in the country.

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

In Saudi Arabia, there have been 2,325 million tons of food wasted, where rice ranked on top. This waste is equivalent to more than two large cargo ships or six Boeing 747 Jets. Therefore, the Saudi Accelerator Lab is working to enhance the system of food waste.

One of Riyadh Municipality's mandates is to collect waste, hence it supervise thousands of waste-collectors, who we are planning to tap into their collective intelligence to cover for the identified spatiotemporal informational gaps. This coverage of the informational gap is assumed to help sustainability practitioners tackle food waste in targeted interventions.

## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can we gain the ownerships of interventions pathways we identified to enhance the food system in Saudi Arabia, where the AccLabs has identified multiple challenges and is planning to generate discussions and debates around possible interventions points with multi-stakeholders to gain their ownerships.

> To what stage(s) in the learning cycle does your learning question relate?

- Test

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioral Insights: use marketers' craft (methodologies) to speak to people about their interests, beliefs, or values when correcting their behavior toward food. Collective Intelligence: exploit unusual communities like (waste collectors) for their collective intelligence about food waste (test approach in single neighborhood). Prototyping: gain empirical evidence about what shape of intervention work best. Solution Mapping: Identifies and connects to grassroots innovations that tackle food waste in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

The data around food waste in Saudi Arabia is based on SAGO's baseline, which follows global best practices in sampling, where it reached 38k samples from different food supply chain sites such as; domestic residents, HoReCa & retail stores. Accordingly, and to UNEP, Saudi Arabia’s information around food waste is considered high confidence due to its diverse supply chain sites. However, according to Dr. Abdulrahman Al-Khorayef, SAGO’s Head of Scientific Study Team “Such assessments are reliant on limited datasets collected across the food supply chain”. Therefore, SAGO’s samples do successfully estimate “what” food categories are wasted such as rice, meat, or bread, but it does not identify spatiotemporal elements; "where" down to street or neighborhood level and "when" down to days or weeks level of foods are being wasted. This in terms, doe not serve targeted interventions, rather generic ones. 
## Closing

> Early leads to grow: Think about the possible grow phase for this challenge - who might benefit from your work on this challenge or who might be the champions in your country that you should inform or collaborate with early on to help you grow this challenge?

SAGO established the National Programme to Reduce Food Loss and Waste, its goals entail raising awareness about the importance of food diversifications, responsible consumption of natural resources, and many others, they are viewed as strong potential partners as well. Nevertheless, Riyadh Municipality will add the collective intelligence of waste-collectors, which is assumed to help sustainability practitioners to identify spatiotemporal information for targeted interventions.
