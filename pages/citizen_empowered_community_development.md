## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Citizen-empowered community development
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

There is a growing relevance gap between the community development agenda of Local Self Governments (LSGs) and the “agenda” (needs) of local citizens. LSGs struggle with ineffective local governance and declining public trust. Citizens are mostly perceived as the recipients of development works, that constrain their meaningful participation to the society.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

It is always challenging to translate policies into implementation, especially at the level of Local Self Governments (LSGs). We recognized that there is neither financial capital, nor human capital for LSGs to exercise the so-called “development agenda” (see evidence below).

In response, civil society and international organizations step in to intervene mainly with their grant-based development programs. While recognizing these efforts, our field observation also reveals that the local people have become dependent on grants. Local people most often are treated as beneficiaries, rather than solution providers. Regretfully, the existent conventional development models do not provide the necessary social environment and means to secure sustainable development of local communities.

Along with the above-mentioned background, local communities are especially vulnerable to respond and recover from crises situations, a recent sound example is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

If the citizens were not empowered to own and exercise their agencies, the development works in local communities would be neither inclusive, nor sustainable. If we don’t explore accessible means to engage citizens (including ones inside and outside Kyrgyzstan) in community development, the social cohesion and equality would be jeopardized.

There are 453 “ayil-okmotu” (Local Self Governments) and 31 cities in Kyrgyzstan. 2/3 national population are based in rural areas.

Recognizing the increasing gap between the urban and rural areas, Sooronbai Jeenbekov, the ex-president of Kyrgyzstan, declared the “Year of Regional Development and Digitalization” of the country in 2019. Regardless of the highest-level of political will, 372 (82%) LSGs remain heavily dependent on the central government’s subsidies. Reports have noted, that subsidized rural LSGs barely sustain their basic needs.

In addition to that, as over a million citizens as migrants working overseas, LSGs lack of human talents to create and implement development works.

In the first learning cycle, through our activities of Sense-making (130 participants) & Hackathon (over 200 participants with 80 applications), we have captured following weak signals embedding the importance and urgency of our frontier challenge:

There are significant grassroots innovators over the country who are interested and/or already support their local communities through diverse tools. After introducing the model of AccLab, all of them expressed their interest in applying new methods, such as collective intelligence, horizon scanning, sensemaking, etc.

Community development in Kyrgyzstan can be featured with very vibrant civic engagement. The SeM workshop showcased “known knowns” in the civic activism, youth and women mobilization, diaspora supporting their communities, IT community engaged into local development.

We have identified the existing solutions through SeM. And there is a room for integrated solutions: 1) grassroot solutions (e.g. DEM-Platform), 2) solutions developed by development agencies (e.g. Portal of Good Practice on Local Governance myktyaimak.gov.kg; “Meerimduu Tyiyn” (transl. The Coin of Mercy) charity project by “Elim Barsyngby?” Foundation was indicated by the South-South Cooperation as unique solution), 3) community-based solutions (e.g. ICT training for rural youth in Myrza-Ake village).

One of the most pro-active stakeholders who participated both in SeM and Hack were our diaspora’s members – individuals and associations. They shared their experience working with community including tools for resource mobilization.  Another active group is youth – who have innovative ideas and digital skills which can be used to unite people. Thus, we see an opportunity to accelerate community development through the systematization of their efforts through crowdsourcing and crowdfunding campaigns.

The pandemic intensified participation of civic activists in community life.

Citizens began to self-organize and hold discussions on local development issues, as in the Karakol case: from a social library to active participation in strategic planning of development.

Platforms for co-planning to address the needs of cities and villages bring sustainability to the interaction between the municipality, civil society and the community. For example, brining community members together for co-planning of public space through the "Minecraft" game as well as the creation of dialogue platforms at Bishkek Mayor's Office to discuss problems and generate new ideas and solutions.

 

All the above identified weak signals of changes show importance and demand to test and explore more on how these signals can be used for better community development.

Result of Group work at the Sense-making workshop (Day 1). By using AccLab’s bootcamp Exploring Futures template, we tested approach with sense-making workshop participants and collected weak signals of changes in the area related to FC. https://app.mural.co/t/undpacceleratorlabsws23178/m/undpacceleratorlabsws23178/1614828862701/038bd0ccb600e25f8b9a0dadf656d560ed9c1f5b

Result of Group work at the Sense-making workshop (Day 2). By using Creative Matrix template, we collected potential solutions/ideas by origin (capacity building, digital solutions, legal, institutional) which can be serve target audience of FC (youth, women, diaspora, civic organizations).

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?

AccLab would like to design an inclusive development model by providing citizens an equal access to collective intelligence and empowering citizens in co-creating community development portfolio (CDP). The following innovative approaches are value-added by AccLab at UNDP KG:

1.      Understanding citizens' needs on empowerment and their perception on "local development" through AccLab’s ethnographic research;

2.      Applying a Positive Deviant approach: Identifying pro-active groups in pilot communities, and to see how a new development model can harness their potential in the best way possible;

3.      Inclusiveness: Reach out the most marginalized and self-disenfranchised groups, who do not usually participate in community development dialogues;

4.      Exploring weak signals and behavioral incentives, in order to identify emerging trends and possible entry points for citizens’ empowerment & inclusion;

5.      Mapping community assets and partnerships of pilot communities;

6.       Capacity Building: Workshop on "Citizen-Empowered Community Development Model" is co-designed with CO expert teams and conducted for the LSGs & Citizens in pilot communities;

7.       Agility of the AccLab’s working model allows us to learn, act and reflect on each intervention with the grassroot communities and revise our working plan, subsequently. This is one of the key comparative advantages of the AccLab compared to other UNDP teams.

8.       The use of collective intelligence as the core methodology for making sense/exploring  communities’ unmet needs is relatively new for the UNDP.

9.      Exploring existing mechanisms of crowdsourcing and crowdfunding

10.   Designed and tested crowdsourcing and crowdfunding mechanisms may become new tools for the CO to be implemented in the grassroots communities for better resource mobilization and more inclusive citizen engagement into sustainable community development. 

> Short “tweet” summary: We would like to tweet what you are working on, can you summarize your challenge in a maximum of 280 characters?

There is a growing relevance gap between the community development agenda of local governments and the needs of citizens. The current development model along with ineffective governance decreases public trust, and it constrains citizens' meaningful participation to the community.

Asset Mapping and Stakeholders Mapping enable us to understand the resource and power networks in a local community. We will learn how to engage key stakeholders to mobilize resources in community development.

System Thinking is to explore how the systemic community development is conducted.

Proof of Concept is to assess willingness of different stakeholders to be engaged in participatory design of community development.

Ethnography research is the key activity we will conduct during the second learning cycle with the purpose to learning socio-economic-cultural environment of a local community.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

User journeys document user experience in testing our MVP of crowdsourcing & crowdfunding platform.

Ethnographic data are collected in our ethnographic research. We try to quantify our research into data measurement.

Socioeconomic data are key components of our asset mapping.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

How can grassroots solutions be identified and integrated into a local development agenda?

During the 2nd Learning Cycle, we will start filed work in pilot community. One of key deliverables of this cycle is to explore and design the crowdsourcing platform. Crowdsourcing platform should have database for solutions. In order to conduct solutions mapping our team will conduct Asset Mapping for understanding existing Community Profile structure, power dynamics and existing innovators. Training on how conduct solutions mapping will be delivered to local civic activists and youth volunteers, so they can test use of the approach. When solutions will be identified it is necessary to understand their taxonomy and origin, and for this purpose ethnography of positive deviants will bring better understanding.

As possible tool to be used we suggest participatory design, when citizens can learn from solutions mapping and provide their ideas (co-create) how to transfer or how to utilize these solutions for their unmet needs.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Ethnographic and Socioeconomic data will provide knowledge on taxonomy of existing solutions at the grassroot level and answers for learning question “How can grassroots solutions be identified and integrated into a local development agenda?”.
## Learning questions

> Learning question: What is your learning question for this challenge? What do you need to know or understand to work on your challenge statement?

What existing practices of the crowdsourcing are used by the pilot community and which can be accelerated through digital solutions?

> Usage of methods: Relating to your choice above, how will you use your methods & tools for this learning question? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Behavioral insights. We would like to design our future interventions including the crowdsourcing platform based on the existing grassroots practices of crowdsourcing and crowdfunding where technology will accelerate and improve current mechanisms. For this purpose, it is important to know how people think, behave and make decisions under different conditions.

Crowdsourcing is a great way for us to engage citizen into community development to understand their unmet needs and priorities to be reflected in the portfolio of local development

Proof of concept will help us to test our hypotheses related to the crowdsourcing in the pilot community. Thus, we will verify our hypotheses and concepts if they have the potential for real-world application. One of the hypotheses to test is whether diaspora members are  interested in co-creating and co-implementing development agenda.

Collective Intelligence. As a result of the field work we need to accomplish the consensus on the crowdsourcing campaign to be launched for the community. This is where collective intelligence will stimulate public knowledge and help us reflect diversity of opinions and visions on the community development.

Co-creation. We expect citizens to share their ideas and improve them together rather than keep to oneself.  Co-creation should help us improve us future design of the crowdsourcing platform.

> Existing data gaps: Relating to your choice above, what existing gaps in data or information do these new sources of data addressing? What value do these add in answering your learning question?

Ethnographic data will help us designing crowdsourcing platform reflecting the unmet grassroots needs, incorporate perceptions of citizens on local development, and design crowdsourcing mechanism which could be potentially used by the citizens in the future.
