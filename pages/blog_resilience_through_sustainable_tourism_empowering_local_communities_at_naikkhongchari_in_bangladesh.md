This journey transforms challenges into opportunities for sustainable growth and unity.
Community-Based Tourism (CBT)(link is external) is a relatively new but rapidly growing concept in Bangladesh, driven by the country's abundant natural beauty and cultural diversity. CBT plays a vital role in alleviating poverty, generating employment, fostering entrepreneurship, and conserving natural resources, forests, and wildlife. Bangladesh's vibrant cultural heritage and exceptional biodiversity make it ideal for sustainable development through CBT initiatives.Kagajikhola village, Baishari union (union is the smallest administrative unit of the Government in Bangladesh) of Naikkhonchari, situated in the hill tracts of Bandarban, emerges as a popular destination for local and international tourists promoting sustainable tourism. With its lush green hills, crystal-clear streams like- Niladri Lake, and predominant rubber gardens, Baishari offers unparalleled natural beauty and biodiversity. The area is also home to tribal communities like the Chakma, Marma, and Tripura, whose unique culture, cuisine, and handicrafts offer exceptional experience to the visitors. These attractions, combined with eco-tourism opportunities, make Baishari a heaven for nature and adventure enthusiasts.

Located around 44 km from Cox’s Bazar, Baishari provides a cost-effective alternative for beach lovers seeking the charm of Bandarban without the long travel. Despite its immense potential as a tourism hub, the local economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture, leaving the community highly vulnerable to economic uncertainties. Limited employment opportunities (except agriculture) highlight the urgent need to diversify livelihoods through sustainable tourism.By engaging the local community, particularly marginal groups; CBT can transform Baishari into a hub for sustainable tourism. This approach not only enhances livelihoods but also ensures the preservation of natural and cultural heritage while supporting Bangladesh's broader economic goals.The region holds immense potential for sustainable livelihoods through eco-tourism, which offers greater benefits compared to traditional activities like agriculture, small-scale trading, or Jhum cultivation. When managed responsibly, eco-tourism maximizes natural resources without environmental degradation, unlike logging or unsustainable farming practices. It also boosts revenue across multiple sectors such as lodging, food, transportation, and local crafts, fostering broader economic growth.

To promote sustainable employment through green tourism, the UNDP Bangladesh Accelerator Lab has focused on empowering the local community, particularly women and informal male workers. By conducting capacity-building training sessions on skills, hospitality, and service management, the lab has helped improve service quality, attracting and satisfying more tourists. This approach not only enhances livelihoods but also supports the region’s transition to community-based tourism. Empowering Communities Through Tourism: Baishari Embarks on a New JourneyIn September 2024, a 15-day training program targeted 90 locals to enhance their skills in hospitality and tourism services, aiming to attract more visitors and increase income. Although this initiative culminated in recent workshops, it built upon efforts initiated three years ago. Feedback surveys revealed significant and progressive outcomes: women are now actively producing and selling handicrafts in local markets, informal workers such as- bikers and drivers have improved their hospitality, and youth are effectively promoting attractions through social media. Tourists report higher satisfaction, female tourists feeling particularly welcomed by local women, showcasing the community's ongoing transformation, and growing economic potential.

In Baishari, the story began on 12 December 2021, when Bangladesh Tourism Board (BTB) and Tour Operator Owners Association of Cox’s Bazar (TOAC), in partnership with UNDP, identified Kagajikhola village, full of possibilities, for tourism development. After a need assessment in 2022 and collaboration with local authorities, the first sensemaking workshop introduced residents to community-based tourism. Follow-up training sessions in November 2022 focused on equipping locals with foundational skills to serve tourists, marking the village's initial steps toward becoming a sustainable tour destination.In 2022, training began with male informal workers as tour guides and basic service providers, fostering guest acceptance in the community. Over time, Kagajikhola gained recognition as a tourist destination, drawing more visitors. In between 2023-2024, the Accelerator Lab, along with TOAC and BTB, monitored developments, respective enhanced infrastructure, and promoted sustainable tourism knowledge. Key tourist attractions such as- Niladri Lake and vast rubber garden, historic temple, night camping, homestay, local traditional foods became the most visited spots. The focus remained on establishing community-based tourism (CBT) to improve livelihoods and promote sustainability.

In September 2024, the Accelerator Lab conducted a 2nd phase of training, involving 90 participants in a 15-day workshop on hospitality, behaviour insights, and tourism services. Around 30 Women received training in handicrafts, livestock management, and raw material marketing, while 30 men (informal workers) and 30 youth (male and female) were equipped to enhance all kind of tourist services and promote the region on social media. Local Tourist Police at Baishari provided incredible support ensuring security of the workshops as well as safety of the tourists. Efforts also included capacitating female eco-tour guides to better cater to female tourists, ensuring inclusive participation in CBT initiatives. Last year, over 30 million domestics tourists and 655,000 foreign tourists vacationed in Bangladesh. Abu Tahir Muhammad Jaber, CEO, Bangladesh Tourism Board noted, “We have developed a master plan for tourism in Bangladesh, set to be fully implemented by 2040. This initiative aims to generate $5 billion in revenue by 2040(link is external), emphasizing CBT as a core strategy while contributing to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).”

Successful CBT Practices around the worldUNDP Bangladesh consistently demonstrates a strong commitment to advancing the concept of CBT by offering innovative and impactful support. Successful CBT models, such as those in Kamalganj (Moulvibazar(link is external)) Sreemangal, Thanchi, and Bilaichari (Bandarban), Sundarbans showcase the potential of this approach. Drawing inspiration from Thailand's successful practices, Bangladesh can also adapt these insights to empower local communities, enhancing their capabilities and ensuring the sustained success of CBT.Consequently, the Accelerator Lab, along with TOAC, BTB, continues to provide technical support to enhance the tourism sector, promote sustainability, and improve livelihoods. The significance of CBT is underscored by the MoU between BRAC and the Bangladesh Tourism Board (BTB), which aligns with BTB's Tourism Master Plan. Despite its potential, CBT in Baishari faces limitations hindering its growth. Connecting with infrastructure service providers and offering community incentives could significantly enhance development. With over 100 households, many can be upgraded for homestay services, encouraging tourists to stay longer and utilize community offerings. To ensure employment sustainability as well as eco-tourism, a long-term plan is essential, including more training workshops, logistical, and technical support. Capacity development initiatives can be gradually expanded throughout the entire community. Proper monitoring and strategic planning can develop both the marginal locality and the tourism sector in a sustainable manner.
