## Learnings on your challenge

> What are the top 5 key insights you generated about your frontier challenge during this Action Learning Plan?

1) Employing digital marketing approaches is a useful tool for non-profits to enhance engagement on digital content. Through the use of Google Ads, UNDP was successful in increasing the online audience and overall engagement through targeted online campaigns. 2) This kind of initiative has the potential to complement online behaviour change interventions at scale through sustained nudges and prompts with the target audience. 3) This experiment provides evidence of successful partnership models between UNDP and Big Tech partners which can be scaled at a corporate level. 4) There is need for further experimentation on better ways of gauging the real-world impact of online campaigns and how they contribute to long-term behaviour change along with other offline interventions. 5) Investing in dynamic content by UNDP, eg through the use of gamification, is key to attract new audiences, being cognizant of shifting trends on how internet users consume online content.

## Data and Methods

> Relating to your types of data, why did you chose these? What gaps in available data were these addressing?

n/a

> Why was it necessary to apply the above innovation method on your frontier challenge? How did these help you to unpack the system?

Harnessing gamification provided a useful approach to target youth audiences in an interactive manner on civic democracy issues within the sea of elections-related content. Google Ads' intuitive AI/ML algorithms generated insights on the campaigns which were used to continually iterate the campaigns to ensure the engagement metrics with the target audience were high. Behavioural insights was important to gauge the performance of the campaigns and what kind of social change resulted through this intervention.
