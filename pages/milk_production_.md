> Title of the innovation

Milk production.

> Brief description of the innovation

Am based in chisamba where am doing my dairy farming program. I need an impowerment to improve on my project. I have two crossbreed animals which I feel if I can have pure breeding I can do better.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- no

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Thank you. It is a very good and sustainaning business. Animals are milked everyday from the time they give birth upto the time they want to have another calf, two months prior to delivery date you dry it. The target market is zambeef and palate we want to be supplying according to our dream atleast 2000 litres of milk per _day. If I can have 50 animals if each is giving me 5+ litres per milking.

> Technical Feasibility

The proposed Implementation plans we have started buying crossbreed animals to start our project move. So far two animals are milked but we have managed to buy more. So our cry is for the pure daily animals if we can be impowered for they are very expensive.

> Anticipated Social Impact

When we are officially at the level we want to be will offer not less than 20 people different types of jobs just on the farm. We need to have feeders. Milk men, tenders, transporters etc.
