> Title of the innovation

SUPPORTING INNOVATIVE, CRITICAL THINKING THROUGH TALENTS AND GIFTS IDENTIFICATION AND IMPROVEMENT THAT LEADS TO DEVELOPMENTALPROJECTS- OBJECTIVE 3 O F MHRM

> Brief description of the innovation

My innovation is more to do about thinking. When we know and understand the how, when, where, and what of thinking we will just flow in health in all facet of like. we, as leaders need to motivate our people starting from raising of children to real preparation of our children for life and not life for our children. There is a very great difference!!! We should encourage people to think for themselves and be independent. The there will synergize well with others. Dependent individual can not add much value to community development. I am More into mental or mind wellbeing and development and almost everything you touch, see, smell, feel and hear is more.
I am sorry I saw this invitation just late today and being a busy person I have an able to write much, surface to say that I have i have done business research on Water and Sanitation in Zambia, Waste Management and recycling of almost all solid wastes, Production of solar energy, Making incubators, how to improve on the film industry in Zambia, irrigation of crops in order to increase productivity in agriculture, revenue collection- changing the mindset of our citizen to maintain a culture of integrity, hard-work, love, etc.  I am willing to be called upon for interview should need arise.
I  am very convinced that every person as a DNA of leadership. See attachment bellow.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

I have mention many research on many businesses but because of time let me sway that all projects are very viable because am an entrepreneur who is train to think critically in any of the endeavor I do. I like choosing my owner strategies to all my business. I have contributed much to not only the mental health services in Zambia but also global. I believe that our core cultural values forms the bases of our behaviors. So good mental health translates in positive progress, person and community wellbeing and development.

> Technical Feasibility

I have only set all things in place but as entrepreneur i should be give more freedom to think on how to sell my businesses and let my technicians do their work and managers also. I have done much technical work in market but i want so show my fellow citizens to beginning the way we think and these other things will for in it. I am willing to disclose what i have discovered in my initial studies in these areas of development.

> Anticipated Social Impact

all sectors will be affect, therefore all areas of innovation should be enhanced. the marginalized will be a priority. We can discuss.
