The Bangladesh Accelerator Lab organized a Women’s Digital Innovation hackathon to promote ICT skills and innovation practices to female students and professionals and find new digital solutions to a wide range of SDG challenges of the country. The second prize winning team of the hackathon designed a real-time River Water Quality Monitoring System to constantly monitor water quality parameters to alert the authority to take urgent steps. This solution is particularly important as water contamination is a big challenge for the country.   The picture shows the members of the team that designed this solution.
