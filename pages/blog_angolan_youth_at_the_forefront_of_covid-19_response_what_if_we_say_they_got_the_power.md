ANGOLAN YOUTH AT THE FOREFRONT OF COVID-19 RESPONSE: WHAT IF WE SAY THEY GOT THE POWER?
Angolan youth at the forefront of COVID-19 response: what if we say they got the power?

There is no need to call a specialist to find out what´s the most searched topic on the internet these days: corona virus. Since its outbreak last December 2019, at the central city of Wuhan in China, the virus has spread all over the world, becoming a pandemic as stated by the World Health Organization (WHO) last month.
What have we been doing since then? Regardless of who you are, type of job you have or lifestyle you carry, COVID-19 disease has shaken us, at least a great bit, forcing countries’ governments to rapidly come up with a strategy that can assertively prepare (where it was possible) or move straight to the response stage, which is followed by the recovery phase.
As the number of affected countries grows, over 180 so far, UNDP countries requests to help them prepare for, respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic- the so called Three by Three UNDP´s response, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable, follows the same pattern.
This ongoing work, in hand with WHO at the core of the UN family, is part of the integrated approach, which is interlocked around the three objectives above- prepare, respond, recover - is being built to support countries preparing for and protecting their people from the devastating pandemic and its impact, outlined not only on health, but also humanitarian and development basis ones, also being able to provide response during its outbreak and be resilient to recover from the economic and social impact. This matrix is highly important as they are directly proportional, interlinked (i.e. weak preparedness and response, it´s highlighted on the recovery scenario).
Angola, which is part of the few countries in Africa with a small number of cases, and so far all imported, has been deploying its response mechanisms as the novel happens, alike other countries around the world, finding effective ways to convince people to stay at home, for those that can, complying with the quarantine and the official state of emergency in place.-By the way, please, do promote social distance as much as possible.
Unfortunately, COVID-19 joins the group of many obstacles to be faced in the country not forgetting the emergence of other deadly diseases from the past such as marburg, ebola, or malaria, which still represents a very serious public health issue and with an impact that sometimes passes unnoticed by the media. The response to this pandemic has, in many cases, been compared to a war that must be won, thus requiring the mobilization of all. Elders are part of the at-risk group to this disease. However, it is important to emphasize that it does NOT transform young people immune to the disease. Sadly, it is possible to see some young people with "I am invincible or autoimmune to disease" behavior, becoming a great vector for contamination. So, we really would like to ask for a more sensible behavior since our parents or our elders in general, people with other chronic or respiratory diseases are at higher risk and needs our protection- young people can play a positive important role during this global crisis.
The Accelerator Lab Angola, which is part of the next generation network of innovation and digital solutions, reached out to youth groups and innovators and has been sensing on-the-ground changes and tracing local solutions collectively with these individuals for the pandemic response here in Angola, deconstructing the issue and generating knowledge, actions, ideas, or projects that can be scaled up.

For our joy, major youth movements are being registered on digital platforms, such as social media. For instance, a group of volunteering young people building mobile washbasins so people can wash their hands on the streets, a preventive action that is considered the most important to reduce the spread of this virus as stated by specialists, others developed a Facebook chatbot for disease information, or apps to help track symptoms.
Currently, these innovators have shifted their focus to be also on the frontline to fight the pandemic, helping the country responding to the social economic impact of this crisis through grassroots digital innovative solutions. As an example, AppySaúde is a digital health platform that offers users the opportunity to access the profiles of health establishments online, search and reserve medicines, among other services. For the COVID-19 response they have been working on delivering supplies and also the implementation of online medical appointments, thus reducing the number of people needing medical assistance for “controllable” situations. On the other hand, 72,6 %
of the population is said to be relying on the informal market for daily income, becoming one of the most vulnerable groups within this pandemic in socio-economic terms. Focus also on this group, we have been witnessing existing e-commerce, such as Sócia or Roque Online or digital apps for services delivery like Tupuca, helping to cope with the current situation. Many other digital platforms with focus on the informal sector with great potential are also being brought to light, thankfully. These platforms have been adding value to the innovation ecosystem in the country that is growing as internet access also expands.

It is quite important to highlight that innovation does not need to be technological or digital, many simple ideas and actions can make a difference, especially in a country where the majority of the population does not have internet access - only round 20% of the population - and radio and television are still the main channels for communication and to reach all the corners of this significantly big country. Even issues like access to water and electricity are still a big challenge, so there are many forefronts for youth to channel their energy. Recycled fuel tank washbasins, handmade masks or even painted circles on the floor in the market lines or at the bank are good examples of non-technological actions that can make a difference.
It is widely known, and accepted by some, that youths are agents of change, influential individuals fueling powerful movements through activism. Regardless of the era, their passion for the cause is noticeable and the mind-blowing catalyst that is eventually born out of it to create change. Highlighting the month that Angola celebrates its youth day, 14 of April, as we carry on the conversation with them, we see those youth as instrumental to build on our capacity and together respond to a crisis that sees no color, no gender, no race. A crisis that can only be stopped if we are fully aligned and in this together. Together as one!
