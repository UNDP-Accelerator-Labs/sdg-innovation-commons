## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

To understand how and if "Mobile Justice" has the ability to bring justice closer to the citizens. 

> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

IF justice services (Civil Registry and the Center for Access to Justice) are available in isolated communities... THEN a higher number of people will use the services

> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- Yes, a different group entirely

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

8 days

> What is the estimated sample size?

- 100-999

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

- This activity is relevant to a CPD outcome
- The hypothesis is clearly stated
- This activity offers strong collaboration oportunities
- This activity offers a high potential for scaling
- This activity has a low risk

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

15 days time allocation from the team
## Results
**Only complete this section when presenting results**

> Was the original hypothesis (If.. then) proven or disproven?

Proven

> Do you have observations about the methodology chosen for the experiment? What would you change?

It would have been interesting to incorporate the introduction of "digitalization" in the current manual registration processes. 

> From design to results, how long did this activity take? (Time in months)

20 days

> What were the actual monetary resources invested in this activity? (Amount in USD)

14.186 USD

> Does this activity have a follow up or a next stage? Please explain

Yes, the Governance Cluster has got EU funding for implementation of the "Mobile Justice" Project. The follow up stage will be to design a test incorporating the aspect of digitalization and also look into how mobile justice can be brought to the Bijagós Archipelago, where some of the islands are extremely isolated.  

> Is this experiment planned to scale? How? With whom?

The Governance Cluster is planning to scale it together with the Ministry of Justice. The test only covered 2 regions, the scaling of the experiment is planed to cover all regions of the country. Additionally more services are planned to be incorporated and made accessible through the vehicle, one idea is for example to train staff in multiple justice services instead of bringing staff who only handle one justice service.

## Learning
**This section is aimed at presenting the learning outcomes from this activity. **

> What do you know now about the action plan learning question that you did not know before? What were your main learnings during this experiment?

In the context of Guinea Bissau, a mobile unit can help in bringing public services closer to the population

> What were the main obstacles and challenges you encountered during this activity?

Infrastructure is very bad in the country, making the experiment difficult and time consuming, cultural barriers (women at some points needed their man to be present or they were busy with domestic work), and financial barriers (because of domestic work or day to day work in the village, people choose not to take time to seek justice services).

> Who at UNDP might benefit from the results of this experimental activity? Why?

The Governance Cluster who could use the results to prove that their planned activity was worth investing in. 

> Who outside UNDP might benefit from the results of this experiment? and why?

The Ministry of Justice as it provides one solution (Mobile Justice) which can support in bringing justice services closer to to population. 

> Did this experiment require iterations? If so, how many and what did you change/adjust along the way? and why?

We took notes for how to improve the experiment for next time, ex the factor of bringing in digitalization in the process and how to optimize the use of the vehicle, something we will hopefully test in the next phase.

> What advice would you give someone wanting to replicate this experimental activity?

Take more time to plan and prepare: Structured communication (ex. through radio) to the population ahead of the visit of the vehicle. Communication with partners/ team, in our case communication with the Governance Cluster. Also it is important to involve the local authorities before the visit.

> Can this experiment be replicated in another thematic area or other SDGs? If yes, what would need to be considered, if no, why not?

Health sector: ex. provicing vaccines to isolated areas (SDG 3)

> How much the "sense" and "explore" phases of the learning cycle influenced/shaped this experiment? In hindsight, what would you have done differently with your fellow Solution Mapper and Explorer?

Exploration was crucial in shaping the event in order to access and understand which comparative data to use. Looking back,  I believe the three of us did not spend enough time together,
