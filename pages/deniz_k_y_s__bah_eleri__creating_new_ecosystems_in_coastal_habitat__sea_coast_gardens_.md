The primary goal is to create a natural area that will be composed of seaweed species that directly absorb pollutants in the sea, various marine plants that take in carbon dioxide and give off oxygen, and artificial reefs. It is thought that biodiversity will naturally increase, as restoring coastal habitats, restoring ecosystem services, will create conditions for the seas to manage themselves and cope with pollution.
