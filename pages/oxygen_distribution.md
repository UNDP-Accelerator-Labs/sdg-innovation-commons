## OxígenoCDMX

Oxígeno CDMX is a project to share updated information every day to buy, rent or recharge oxygen tanks in Mexico City and Toluca. The site shares information on oxygen distribution companies that may be filtered by location, price, availability, payment information, The initiative was born from the need to provide the population with updated information on the sales and rental network of oxygen cylinders, since the saturation of hospitals in Mexico City has forced thousands of people infected by the virus to treat the condition from home and access to oxygen was becoming complicated. It was started by students of the National Politechnic Institute and has since been supported by the  Digital Agency for Public Innovation (ADIP) of the Mexico City Government, which now is looking into conneting it to other public services and information related to COVID attention.
