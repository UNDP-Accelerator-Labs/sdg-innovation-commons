CONSUMABLE GOODS DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM

> Brief description of the innovation

Inflation caused by the PF Govt sent the prices of local foods soaring. My goal as a small scale entrepreneur is to provide the members of my neighborhood community with affordable foods. Operations are underway as the tomatoes and onions are grown in my backward. I do however have to buy a sack of rice, package it and resale because I can not afford to grow it by myself. Customers call me to place their orders and I deliver to their doorstep as soon as I can. With your help and resources, I could expand my network and be able to reach a large customer base. I wish to some day own cattle  just like his excellency MR HICHILEMA. chickens and pigs aswell.  My plan is to produce at the lowest possible cost so the goods can be resold at the lowest possible price making my products affordable even to the poor.

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

Income will be generated through the sales of our products. Income for others will be generated through job creation as employees shall be required when we expand . My target market shall be home owners in my area and retailer's. The challenge prize might just be the financing required to expand my innovation and do it on a large scale. The innovation will put the earth to use by  cultivating it
and providing the produce to the less fortunate

> Technical Feasibility

The implementation plan is to register my own company and start selling the goods under my own brand name. which will distinguish my product form others
