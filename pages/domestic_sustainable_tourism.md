## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.

Domestic Sustainable Tourism
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)

Our challenge is that the topic of "Sustainable Tourism" is too big and is extremely difficult for stakeholders to digest into actionable pieces. We want break down the topic with Sensemaking and Pain Points research and start experimenting with some of the sub-topics, such as the Safety of Public Roads (one of the identified top pain points)

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?

When the COVID pandemic started we made a rapid impact assessment and interviewed over 40 local businesses in Ukraine. The impact was severe and domestic tourism was repeatedly arising as the solution that would save the local economy. Then we joined the working group led by The State Agency for Tourism Development and conducted research of the top 20 pain points of the domestic tourists for them. Few of the top points were in the domain of the Ministry of Infrastructure so we reached out to them and made a design sprint for the service measurement tool in long-distance busses.  Next, we received a request from the Ministry on data visualization of road safety that would allow more targeted and efficient local interventions into the road infrastructure and make travel safer (Pain points #9 and #10) Thereby, sectoral Sensemaking, interventions in Road Safety, and Service Quality on long-distance busses are the entry points into this challenge that will allow us to understand if it is possible to approach the big topic of Sustainable Tourism from digestible smaller bits.

Sustaining the momentum of increased interest and demand to local recreation and tourism in Ukraine is of strategic importance, as mentioned above “for every 30 new tourists traveling to a destination, it is estimated that one new job is created”. Development of local tourism has the potential to foster post-pandemic economic recovery and also facilitate for better social cohesion.  There are many barriers that hinder the development in this strategic direction, hence coordinated development efforts are required to foster enabling its development: socio-economic factors, quality of service, availability and access to information, environmental conditions etc. But the issue of travel and tourist safety is probably the most cross cutting to other development areas, in particular in Ukraine.   Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), like Ukraine, are facing a major challenge in road safety. Each year, 1.35 million people are killed on the worlds’ roads, and a further 50 million are injured, with the vast majority of these (over 90 percent) occurring in LMICs. There is an upward trend in road crash fatalities and injuries, causing human suffering, grief, and loss, and retarding the economic growth of LMICs. According to World Bank’s estimations (page 333), cost of road crash fatalities and injuries in Ukraine amounts to 4.7% GDP in 2016. As can be seen from the graph below, between 2013 and 2016 Ukraine had the worst trend in fatality of road traffic accidents.  The official data confirms the urgency and scale of the problem. According to Patrol Police data:   30,000 people injured in traffic accidents annually in Ukraine  3200 die annually in Ukraine due to traffic accidents  1100 of them die on state roads (and 5500 get injured)  Traffic accident on the state road is twice more deadly    Number of people died in traffic accidents in 2016 in some EU countries (originally published on epravda.com.ua)    Population, mln of people  Number of people dies  Deaths per million of population  Number of cars per /1000 population  Number of cars, mln  Number of people died per 1 million of cars  Ukraine  42  3 410  81,2  202  6,9  494,2  Germany  83  3 206  38,8  555  45,8  70,0  Great Britain  66  1 792  27,1  469  30,8  108,6  France  67  3 477  52,0  479  32,0  80,8  Italy  61  3 283  54,2  625  37,8  86,8  Spain  47  1 810  39,0  492  22,8  79,0  Poland  38  3 026  79,7  571  21,6  140,0
