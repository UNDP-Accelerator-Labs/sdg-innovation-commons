District Hai Chau has built an app to engage citizens in urban management issues, including but not exclusive to waste issues. For example, if there is wrong throwing of trash (ex: big pile of construction trash in wrong positions, sometimes in front of residential houses), citizens can spot it, take picture and post it up on the app to demand prompt solutions from the district and ward management.

All problems have maximum 4 hours (automatically set by the app) to solve. This put a lot of pressure on ward and district management. Besides this app, there is also a Zalo group for ward and district management level to communicate and delegate task to solve citizens’ pointed problems.
