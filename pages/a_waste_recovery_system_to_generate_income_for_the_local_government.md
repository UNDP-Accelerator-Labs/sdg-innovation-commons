> Which sector are you partnering with for this activity? Please select all that apply

- Public Sector
- Private Sector
- Civil Society/ NGOs

> Please list the names of partners mentioned in the previous question:

Waste collectors, waste generators, selling companies and buyers


## Design
**Explain the design of the experimental activity. In general, experimental activities consist on trying to learn how results are connected to a stimuli.**

> What is the specific learning intent of the activity?

We want to learn if implementing a system to commercialize recoverable waste system will generate an income and will reduce the environmental impact. We need to understand what the components are required to commercialize waste, from the collection to the storage, processing, sale, and administration. We need to know who needs to be involved, what actions they need to implement, how should be organized. It's important to learn how to implement this system at small scale before scaling up, to facilitate adaptation and reduce risks associated with failure.



> What is your hypothesis? IF... THEN....

If a system is implemented to commercialize recoverable waste, then income will be generated, and the environmental impact will be reduced.



> Does the activity use a control group for comparison?

- No, it does not use a control group

> How is the intervention assigned to different groups in your experiment?

- non-random assignment

> Describe which actions will you take to test your hypothesis:

To implement the recoverable waste system the actors involved in its implementation must be identified (recoverable waste generators, collectors, processors, sellers, and buyers). Then an initial logistics must be defined, including the procedures that each actor involved must follow. The system is put into operation during the determined period, collecting information on the volume and weight of waste collected by type, income generated, and feedback from each actor involved on what has gone well and what can be improved. The recommendations made are assessed and the cycle is repeated.



> What is the unit of analysis of this experimental activity?

The unit of analysis is each time the system is launched to market recoverable waste



> Please describe the data collection technique proposed

Direct observations, focus groups to know the things that worked and those that did not from everyone involved in the process.



> What is the timeline of the experimental activity? (Months/Days)

10 weeks 



> What is the estimated sample size?

- 10-49

> What is the total estimated monetary resources needed for this experiment?

> Quality Check

> What are the estimated non- monetary resources required for this experiment? (time allocation from team, external resources, etc) If any.

Time to conduct the focus groups and skills to analyze the data from the system to market recoverable waste.
