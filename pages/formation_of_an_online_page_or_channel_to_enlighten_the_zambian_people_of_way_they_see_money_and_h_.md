> Brief description of the innovation

A channel on Facebook called l3tsgomotivation to teach the Zambian people how to have a productive life, not only been the consumer but the producer of our own future...

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This channel will produce income for me by monitising to Google admod and will benefit the viewers by giving valuable information about making good daily choices that will benefit the Zambian people &amp; they will win prices through our giveaways

> Technical Feasibility

The primary use is through Facebook and YouTube because it's most available by the average Zambian citizen and is widely available making it very efficient in distributing information

> Anticipated Social Impact

The current Zambian Facebook or YouTube channel offer laughter, dating, or showing off their life's which is good but it gives little value to their future and what am willing to offer is a change of the way they see their future to not only work hard but to also work smart, I think that is very valuable considering that Zambia now has a new leader so we expect alot from our new leader which is great, but we have to expect mostly alot from ourselves, and that will definitely make a better Zambia.
