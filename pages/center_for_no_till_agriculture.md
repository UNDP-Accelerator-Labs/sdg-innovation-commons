> Description of the solution

The Center for No-till Farming (CTNF) provides farmers with access to community, knowledge and technical advice on no-till farmning and conservation agriculture. Activities include field-level demonstrations, community-based training events and peer-to-peer communication to share experiences and provide resources. No-till farming is planting crops on farmland year after year without tilling the soil. In conservation agriculture, not burning residues means that after harvest, farmers leave all the residues on the field to decompose and serve as nutrients for the soil.
