## Title

> Please provide a name for your action learning plan.



Mobility for All
## Challenge statement

> Challenge type: If you are working on multiple challenges, please indicate if this is your "big bet" or "exploratory" challenge. 

Please note: we ask you to only submit a maximum of 3 challenges - 1x Big Bet, 2x Exploratory. Each challenge must be submitted individually.


> Challenge statement: What is your challenge? (Please answer in specific terms: "Our challenge is that...”.)



Our challenge is that people with disabilities in Thailand, especially wheelchair users, face significant barriers in mobility due to the lack of accessible transportation options and infrastructure, hindering their ability to commute, work, and engage in recreational and cultural activities, thereby limiting their inclusivity and equal participation in society.

> Background: What is the history of your challenge? What is causing or driving it? Who is involved? How does the current situation look like? What undesired effects does it produce?



People with disabilities in Thailand have historically faced numerous challenges in their daily lives. The lack of accessible facilities, such as inadequate ramps and restrooms, has made it difficult for them to navigate independently. This is exacerbated by gaps in accessibility for tourist activities and attractions, limiting their recreational and cultural experiences. The daily commute is another significant hurdle, given that public transport often doesn't cater to their needs. This affects their ability to work and travel freely. Additionally, tourism transportation issues hinder country-wide exploration. Addressing these challenges is imperative to ensure inclusivity and equal opportunities for all in Thailand.

> Quantitative evidence: What (official) data sources do you have on this challenge that better exemplifies the importance and urgency of this frontier challenge? You can add text, a link, or a picture.

Testimonials and personal experiences, like those of Namchok Petsaen, a United Nations Volunteer, highlight the daily challenges faced. The video "Bangkok Accessibility Journey" illustrates the difficulties of navigating Bangkok streets and using public transport for people with disabilities. Feedback from wheelchair users regarding their experiences with tourist attractions and daily commuting paints a vivid picture of the challenges.

> Value proposition: What added value or unique value proposition is your Accelerator Lab bringing to solving this challenge? Why is it your Lab that needs to work on this challenge and not other actors within UNDP, other stakeholders in the country respectively? Why is it worth investing resources to this challenge?



The UNDP Accelerator Lab in Thailand offers a unique combination of local insights, a commitment to sustainable development, and a network of partners ready to drive change. While other actors within UNDP or stakeholders might address similar challenges, our Lab's deep understanding of local culture, innovation, and the specific needs of people with disabilities in Thailand positions us uniquely. Investing resources in this challenge will not only improve the lives of people with disabilities but will also promote overall inclusivity and sustainable development in the country.

> Please provide a brief description of the collaboration.



Royal Enfield is a motorcycle company that has been producing bikes since 1901. It is known for its classic, retro, and adventure models.



Proposed Collaboration Areas:  
Custom Motorcycle Development: Together, we can design and prototype custom motorcycles tailored for wheelchair users. Given the mention of the "Harevenger", a motorcycle built as an extension of The Rabbit, Royal Enfield can provide the base model while we integrate accessibility features.

Awareness Campaigns: We can co-host events, rides, and campaigns to raise awareness about the mobility challenges faced by people with disabilities. Using Royal Enfield's broad customer base and brand reputation, these campaigns can achieve wide-reaching impact.

Training & Workshops: Organize training sessions where Royal Enfield engineers and our team brainstorm and share knowledge. This will foster innovation and lead to the development of more user-friendly designs.

Pilot Programs: Before a full-scale launch, we can initiate pilot programs where selected individuals test the custom motorcycles. Feedback from these pilots can help refine the designs further.

Documentary & Storytelling: Building on the "Riding Beyond Limits" theme, we can co-produce documentaries or short films capturing the transformative journey of individuals as they experience newfound mobility with Royal Enfield's custom bikes.
