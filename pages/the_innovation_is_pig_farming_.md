> Brief description of the innovation

The innovation is Pig farming, which is the raising and breeding of domestic pigs as livestock, and is a branch of animal husbandry. Pigs are farmed principally for food (e.g. pork, bacon, gammon) and skins. Pigs are amenable to many different styles of farming: intensive commercial units, commercial free range enterprises, or extensive farming.

> Do you have a prototype for your innovation?

- yes

> Commercial Viability of the Innovation

This innovation will help generate income for the myself, the community and country at large, because it will help in the recycle of most materials, which they eat and convert to meat, pigs help farmers to largely reduce feeding costs and waste, it also helps feed accounts for about three-fourths of the cost to raise pigs, careful control of feed costs is necessary to make a profit. Small-farm pig producers seek to increase profits by selling to niche or specialty markets .Pigs also have a high resistance to diseases they hardly get sick and adapt easily to most environments, whether hot or cold. Pig farming, will help assist in improving operations of existing businesses, by helping in growing this particular type of farming, in order to help create employment, as well as product meat products for the local market as well as export outside the country. The challenge prize will help the business grow, because the demand for pork products is high. 
While negative impacts are serious, and can include pollution and degradation of soil, water, and air, agriculture can also positively impact the environment, for instance by trapping greenhouse gases within crops and soils, or mitigating flood risks through the adoption of certain farming practices.

> Technical Feasibility

Feasibility study on piggery farming, using land of about 4 acres in Kasisi in Chongwe District. Farming business is a lucrative business and an important sector of the economy that can provide significant, economic and social impact which will affect the general public positively, both in food provision, skill acquisition, employment opportunities and many more.    
Pigs  can  be  raised  in  controlled  or  free  environment,  as  a  small-  or  large-scale  business.  But  in whatever  size,  a  prospective  farmer  would  need  inputs  as  to  how  to  raise  pigs  efficiently  and  in  a more productive manner.

Pigs  may  be  raised  in  highly  controlled  environments  (hog  lots)  indoor,  in  open  spaces  or  barns  as breeding sows or grown and sold for slaughter to butcher shops. Here are the aspects of pig rising that a grower must carefully consider:

Choosing Piglets to Raise

Pig feeders can be obtained from stock breeders, and producers, in auctions and classified ads. Pigs are of  different  breeds  some  of  them  are  well  suited  for  specific  environments,  indoor  or  outdoor.

Crossbred  pigs  tend  to  grow  faster,  consume  feed  more  efficiently  and  are  vigorous.  When  buying  a feeder, choose the large and healthy looking ones, at least 25 lbs. If you are choosing a male, which is observed to grow slightly faster than females, get one that is already castrated. Male or female, they are preferably immunized. Ask the breeder for health information and stock of the breeder.

Proper Nutrition for Pigs

Pigs feed on both grains and meat. They can also be fed with cooked table scraps and vegetables. Corn is  their most common food, but they could benefit from having a diet with protein from soybeans or cooked  meat.  Further,  they  grow  faster  with  vitamins  and  other  supplements.  Piglets  have  higher protein requirements than mature ones. Feeds can be bought packaged and in bulk. Pigs must also have adequate supply of drinking water daily, about two to four gallons. Provide water either through a tub or automatic nipple waterer.

> Anticipated Social Impact

For the piggery farming business, there are large market networks there are large market networks in some parts of Zambia with many dispatch outlets like hotels, spotlights, bars, bakeries, event planners, families all around.
