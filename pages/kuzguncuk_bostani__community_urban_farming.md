Urban garden site in Istanbul. It is divided into 115 parcels and 50 of them are
reserved for neighborhood residents. Those who will have the chance to use the
reserved parcels are determined by casting lots each year. The rest of the
parcels is given to schools and community centres of municipalities. Planting
activities are held in the area and a harvest festival is organized each
autumn.
